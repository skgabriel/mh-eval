Thank you for all of your advice and kind words"	"First and foremost, I commend you for reaching out for help. This is an important step and shows your strength. It's important to understand that your struggle with depression is real and acknowledging it openly as you have is critical. You are not alone in this.

The first thing to tackle is the rat infestation. This is a health risk not only to you, but also to your family. Without frightening you further, it may be worth it to consult a professional exterminator. In terms of telling your parents, you could try opening a conversation by honestly and earnestly expressing your feelings and the state of your mental health.

In terms of cleaning, try splitting it up into manageable tasks, rather than looking at it as one huge task. Small victories can serve as motivation builders. You could start by focusing on one section of your room at a time, and gradually move on to another section when you're comfortable.

Lastly, and most importantly, consider seeking professional help for your depression, if you haven't already. There are many online resources that can assist you in finding help. Don't hesitate to join support groups with people who can relate to your experience. Together, we are stronger.

First off, I want to commend you for your courage in sharing this. Being open about your struggles is the first and most crucial step towards seeking help.

What you're going through is common among those dealing with depression. Remember, you aren't alone and there are ways around dealing with this. The initial reaction may be to solve everything all at once but that can easily become overwhelming. So, let's break it down into manageable tasks.

The primary concern seems to be the rat infestation. This is a problem that may require professional intervention. Calling in pest control could be a solution. You may feel apprehensive about letting your parents know but remember, this is a health concern that needs immediate attention. Once you are safe from the infestation, we can then move on to the cleaning.

When it comes to cleaning, once again, taking small steps and breaking the tasks into manageable chunks helps. Perhaps you can start by setting a 15-minute timer each day and tackle one corner of the room during that time. As you gradually make progress, the tasks might not seem as daunting.

While dealing with depression, it's essential to seek professional help. This might seem challenging, especially given your living conditions, but there are resources available to get the conversation started. Therapists and counselors can provide techniques and strategies to navigate through this tough period. Consider giving teletherapy a try. It's an excellent tool for receiving mental health support from the comfort of your own home.

Remember, reaching out to friends, family or a grounded community such as this can help boost your morale. You have taken a brave step by seeking help, and I'm certain you are capable of stepping into the challenge of managing your living situation.

Good luck and let us know about your progress."

Firstly, I just want to take a moment to remind you that you are doing an amazing job simply by acknowledging your state and looking for ways to overcome it. Depression can make even the smallest tasks seem mountainous, but it's a brave start to shine some light on what you're going through. One foot in front of the other, we'll get there together.

If it's too overwhelming to tackle the entire mess all at once, try breaking it down into smaller, more manageable tasks. Maybe on the first day, you can try getting the rat situation under control by calling an extermination service. You won't have to handle the creatures directly, they will make sure to handle it professionally and discretely.

After you've taken that first step, it might be less daunting to start with one section of your room. You could begin with your bed, desk, or any area that’s manageable for you. Then move onto the next section when you feel able.

If it's within your means and you're comfortable with it, you might want to consider hiring a professional cleaner. They deal with messes both big and small on a daily basis and can approach the task without judgement.

Connecting with a mental health professional, if you haven’t done so already, can also provide you with the support and resources to manage your depression. They can help you develop coping strategies, which might include ways to deal with tasks that feel overwhelming.  

But of utmost importance, don't be hard on yourself. Progress is progress, no matter how slow or small it may seem. 

Sending lots of strength your way! You got this!"

Thank you for reaching out. It seems like you're feeling under pressure at the moment but I'm really proud of you for seeking advice and help. 

Firstly, dealing with depression can indeed make daily chores feel insurmountable, but remember that it's okay to seek help and reach out to others. Asking a friend or neighbor, or hiring a professional cleaning service for a one-time deep-clean could be an option worth considering. This could take a lot of stress off your shoulders. 

Talking to a mental health specialist could also be a great starting point to address the feelings of anxiety and depression you are experiencing. Some professionals even offer telehealth services if you are not comfortable going in-person. Expressing your feelings and speaking to someone confidentially about your situation can make a world of a difference.

Regarding the rat infestation issue, it's crucial to address it promptly. Get in touch with pest control services, most offer discrete and effective solutions.

Also, have you considered speaking to your parents about your struggles? It can be scary but seeking their understanding may be beneficial - after all they are your family, and they most likely want the best for you. In case you decide to share your feelings with them, let them know how you truly feel and let them know how they could potentially help you ease your struggles. 

You are definitely not alone in your struggles. There are resources available, and people who genuinely care about you and your well-being. Sometimes, it's the smallest steps in the right direction that can make the biggest difference in our lives. 

Update: I'm glad to hear that you’ve made progress with your room and are feeling a bit better - that’s a great accomplishment! You’ve shown great courage in tackling a tough situation and reaching out for advice. Keep going, take things at your own pace and remember that it's okay to ask for help when you need it. Proud of you!

Dealing with depression isn't easy, and I can understand your feeling of overwhelming when it comes to tasks like cleaning up your room, especially since you have a deadline looming over you. It can be really tough when family members don't see or understand what you're going through, too. 

First, consider seeking professional help if you haven't already. A therapist or counselor who specializes in dealing with depression could provide invaluable support and coping strategies.  

Second, don't hesitate to communicate your feelings to your parents. Without knowing what you are experiencing, it can be difficult for them to respond accurately to your needs. You don't need to go into deep details, but simply conveying how you're feeling and why certain tasks have become hard for you might help them understand better. 

As for the hands-on cleaning, start by focusing on small tasks. Maybe start with the bin, empty it out, clean it, get a bin liner if you have one. This one small task could give you a boost and a sense of accomplishment. Then gradually tackle other parts of your room bit by bit.

Concerning the rat infestation - it's important to address this. There are pest control professionals who could tackle this problem for you; it could take a load off your mind and free up space to focus on other tasks, like your general cleaning.

Lastly, remember that there's no shame in asking for help. Whether it's a friend, a family member, or even a professional cleaning service, getting assistance can make a world of difference.

Firstly, I want you to know that you're not alone and there are people here who genuinely want to help. It sounds like you're going through an overwhelming time right now, but remember, it's ok to ask for help and there's no shame in doing so.

Try breaking the task down into smaller, manageable tasks. Start with just removing the garbage into a bag and get that away from the room. You can tackle the rest step by step, there's no need to overwhelm yourself with cleaning it all at once.

Pest control sounds necessary in your case. Don't be afraid to reach out to a professional as they are trained to handle these infestations. 

Open up to your parents if you think it could help. Parents may not always understand, but they often want what's best for their child. 

Continuing to stay silent about your depression with your parents isn't helpful for you in the long-term, it might be a good idea to discuss with them how you're feeling if you feel it's safe to do so. Maybe you could even get professional medical help or a therapist, they may be able to help make your struggle a bit easier to bear.

I also recommend you to join a support group for people dealing with depression. Knowing that there are others that are going through similar struggles can be very comforting. 

And don't forget that it's ok to have bad days. Progress isn't always linear. You're doing what you can and that's enough. 

I'm really proud of the fact that you're reaching out and seeking advice, it's a really big step towards improvement. It's okay to ask for help and it's okay to struggle. Just take it one step at a time. All the best."

First of all, no need to toss any judgement on yourself for needing help. Everyone has those days, weeks, or even months, and it's totally okay to ask for assistance. 

Here's my advice: Break things down. Tidy one corner today, one the next. Take small, manageable steps. Remember that some progress, no matter how small, is still a step forward. 

Also, consider reaching out to a professional to handle the rat issue. Dealing with an infestation can be quite overwhelming to handle on your own, especially if you're already dealing with a lot mentally. 

It may help as well to let your parents know what you're going through. They may not fully grasp your feelings of depression, but opening up to them and asking for their support may make things a bit easier on you. Alternatively, reaching out to friends, other family members, or even just a counselor/therapist could be beneficial. You don’t have to handle this alone.

I hope this helps and I’m rooting for your progress!

Firstly, thank you for sharing your story with us; it sounds like you're having a tough time, but hopefully we can provide some support. Let's break down the situation a little: 

Managing depression can often feel overwhelming at the best of times, without the added stress of managing sensory issues and a physical task such as cleaning. Remember, it's okay to ask for help with this from your parents; they may be more understanding than you think.

Try to approach cleaning your room in small steps because cleaning a mess can seem a lot easier when you don't have to do it all at once. Start with a small corner, a shelf, or even just the rubbish bin. Use protective gloves if touching certain materials makes you uncomfortable due to your sensory issues. 

Regarding your rat infestation, it's vital to seek professional help. There are pest removal services that come in discreet vans, so your parents may not necessarily have to know. They can handle the infestation with minimal inconvenience to you and will do the job effectively.

Finally, remember to look after your mental health. Reach out to a professional counselor or therapist who can provide resources and techniques to help manage your depression. Support is out there, never hesitate to ask for it.

Remember, each small step forward is progress, no matter how tiny it might seem. You can do this."

I'm so sorry to hear about what you're going through. It's understandable that you feel overwhelmed and fearful about revealing your struggles to your parents. What you're going through isn't a sign of laziness, and it sounds like you're really having a tough time.

Firstly, I'd recommend you reach out to a mental health professional if you haven't already. They can provide you with the necessary tools and resources to manage your depression, and they might be able to help you communicate these issues with your parents.

Secondly, tackling cleaning your room can be a herculean task when you're not feeling well, and it sounds like the sensory issues are an added challenge. Try breaking down the task into smaller, manageable steps. You don't have to accomplish everything at once.

Specifically with the rat infestation, getting a professional exterminator who can safely and humanely remove them from your room might be a good idea. It could seem daunting, but it's important to take care of that issue - for both your safety and peace of mind. 

Communicate with your folks about the problems you're facing, even if it feels difficult. If you're worried about their reaction, consider bringing up the topic in a calm and controlled way, perhaps even when a third party or trusted adult is present.

You're not alone, and things can get better. Do reach out for help when you feel ready. I hope some of this advice is helpful, and I'm rooting for you!

Amateur advice from a stranger on the internet can only go so far, but from the description you provided, it sounds like there is a need for clear communication. 

Perhaps you could express your feelings to your mother in an open but gentle way. Let her know that you understand her need for companionship during this difficult time, but also explain your need for some independence and space to grieve. Making sure to let her know that this doesn't mean you don't care about her or her feelings, but that you need to find your balance and cope with your emotion in your way.

In regards to finding a therapist, it can be hard, especially considering everyone's needs vary. But please, don't give up. Continually seeking until you find a person who can understand and help you navigate your feelings. Online counseling might be a good option as well as you can schedule your sessions at your convenience.

Remember, during grieving periods it may be hard to see properly, but it's important to take care of yourself too. Sending you lots of strength and positivity."

"Hi, I'm really sorry to hear about what you're going through. It sounds like a tough situation with a lot of difficult emotions involved. Your feelings of wanting independence are understandable and you shouldn’t feel guilty about this. It's crucial to acknowledge that you have your own grief to manage as well.

Since you mentioned that you've struggled to find a therapist, there are online resources such as BetterHelp and TalkSpace that may be more accessible. An experienced professional could help guide you through this especially challenging period. Have you tried bereavement support groups? They could provide a safe space for you to express your feelings.

Setting boundaries with your mom could be beneficial. Prioritize open communication while being respectful of both her feelings and your own. It might be something like, ""I love you mom, but I need some personal space to grieve and process my emotions. We can set specific times to check in and spend time together.""

Remember, it's okay to take care of yourself first. You're not alone in this. Be kind, gentle and patient with yourself during this time."

"I'm really sorry to hear about your struggle. It must be incredibly challenging to juggle your own grief and strive for independence while managing your mom's expectations, too. The most essential thing to remember is that it's okay to set boundaries even with our most loved ones. Here's a suggested approach that could help:

1. Honest Communication: If you haven't already done so, you might want to sit down with your mother and explain your feelings and needs. Do it politely but assertively. It’s important she understands your grieving process and emotional needs are different from hers.

2. Establish Boundaries: Define personal time and space. Schedule define visit times, even if it's a phone call or meal. Protect your time and privacy but don’t disappear completely. This could help her understand you’re there for her but on your own terms. 

3. Suggest Alternatives: She’s seeking company hence she’s seem to be clinging onto you. But she needs to fill her own life too. Maybe she could join a club, or social group. She may find other channels to express her feelings. 

4. Seek External Help: If things don't improve, consider seeking a family therapist for guidance. A mutual third-party perspective can help immensely, and help you both navigate this difficult time. 

Remember, it's crucial to take care of your own mental health first. If you're not okay, it's tougher to help others. Take your time and stay strong. You're not alone in this."

Does your mom have any friends or other family members that can provide her with some company? Maybe guiding her towards groups or activities where she can meet people in a similar situation could help alleviate her loneliness, and in turn, allow you some peace.

Also, you might want to consider sitting down with your mom and having a heart-to-heart conversation. Express your needs for independence and some alone time, and reassure her it's not about not wanting to be with her, but more about how you cope with your feelings.

As for finding a right therapist, there's no rush. Just keep researching, don't hesitate asking for recommendations either- there's bound to be someone out there who could guide and support you through this challenging time. I hope this advice helps, and remember to take care of yourself too."

"Hi there, I'm really sorry to hear about your current situation. This indeed sounds very overwhelming. It's essential to address what's best for both your mental health and your mom's. While it's wonderful that you have such a caring, albeit persistent mother, it's essential to set boundaries. 

It's clear you're a strong independent person who values their space, and there's nothing wrong with that. Perhaps, you can communicate this to your mother gradually. Start by letting her know that you love her and your bond matters a lot to you, but you need a little space to manage your personal life and grief. 

Alternatively, you could set aside designated times to spend together. This gives you both a balance of quality time spent together and your much-needed personal space. As for social events, you could discuss event schedules with her. That doesn't mean you would leave her out completely, but you can certainly pace it out so that your paths overlap less. 

When it comes to therapy, don't lose hope. Availability and affordability can often be hurdles in finding the right help. There are lots of resources and hotlines available, and reaching out to local mental health services as well as online platforms can provide some avenues.

Finally, remember grief is a shared experience, and it's okay to have different coping mechanisms. It's just important to remember to be patient and kind (including towards yourself!) during this difficult time. It's a process. Let me know if there's anything else that can help. Stay strong."

I'm really sorry to hear about your situation. Losing someone is never easy, so I want to firstly send you my deepest sympathies for your loss. 

I understand your worries about your mother and your need for space and independence. It's important to remember that maintaining your personal boundaries isn't being selfish or unkind. It makes healthy relationships possible. 

If you're uncomfortable having a direct conversation with your mom about needing space, maybe consider writing her a letter that she can read and reflect on in her own time. It can be an effective way to express how you're feeling, your needs, and why you are establishing boundaries. 

She may not like it initially, but just know it's for the better in the long haul. Remember, it's your right to decline invites or tell her when she's encroaching on your privacy. 

Hang in there, it's healthy to address these feelings and emotions as you are doing now. Maybe consider reaching out to local community resources and support groups dealing with loss could be really beneficial.

Above all, remember you have a right to nurture and protect your mental and emotional health. Take care and be gentle with yourself."

"I'm really sorry to hear what you're going through, it sounds like a challenging situation. It's important to remember that it's okay to have needs and boundaries, even in difficult situations like these. Both you and your mother are grieving a major loss, and everyone copes in different ways - some individuals want to cling closer while others need space. It's completely valid to fit in the latter category.

It might be helpful to have a candid conversation with your mom about how you're feeling. You could start by acknowledging her grief and reassuring her that you are there to support her in this difficult time, but stress that you also need time and space to heal. Assure her that needing space is not a rejection of her but rather a part of your grieving process. Make clear to her your need for established boundaries for communication and visits. 

Try suggesting alternate sources of support for her, like grief counseling or joining a support group. These resources not only provide a social outlet, but also provide an understanding community for your mother to share her feelings and experiences.

I advise you to keep reaching out to therapists for your own wellbeing. It can sometimes be a process to find the right one, but finding good help can be very beneficial. It's important not only to take care of your relationship with your mother, but also to prioritize taking care of yourself.

Remember, it's okay to protect your mental health and you don't have to feel guilty for wanting to maintain your independence. You matter too.

I can understand that feeling of being overwhelmed and craving for personal space, especially in such a trying time. You're dealing with the loss of your father as well, and your feelings are valid too, regardless of how different they may be from your mother's process of grieving. 

I wonder if you've tried having an open, honest conversation with your mom about this. She might not be completely aware of how strongly you feel about this. It would be helpful to express your feelings to her, emphasising that while you understand she's alone and in pain, you need time and space to grieve and live as well. 

This doesn't mean that you will ignore her pain completely, but that you're requesting for a more balanced relationship where both of your needs are taken into account. Let her know that you're here for her, but also need space to be the independent person you are. Maybe suggest alternatives like hobby groups or therapy, which could help her deal with her loneliness and grief more effectively.

Don't be too harsh on yourself, the situation is emotionally charged and you're doing your best to navigate it. Pursue therapy for yourself as well, it will provide additional tools and insights to deal with such situations. 

In the meantime, please make sure to engage in self-care to deal with your grief, take some time for yourself and engage in activities that help you relax and heal.

Best wishes."

Does any one have any tips?"	Hi there, it sounds like you're really struggling with intense feelings of separation anxiety. Remember it's completely okay to have these strong emotions, but learning to manage them can be incredibly beneficial. A few things you might want to consider are mindfulness techniques, listening to calming music, writing in a journal, or practicing deep breathing exercises. You could also seek professional help from a therapist who can guide you with the right techniques. Creating a self-soothe box with things that make you happy might help as well during those intense moments. Remember you're not alone in this, many of us struggle with similar feelings.

Does any one have any tips?"	"Hi there,

Firstly, I want to acknowledge how brave you're being by reaching out and sharing your experience. Separation anxiety can be incredibly tough to deal with and I'm really sorry you're experiencing this. The intense emotions you're describing may point to the deep love you feel for your partner, but it's essential to learn to manage those feelings because being independent is equally important.

Start with small acts of self-care when your partner isn't around. Find something that you love doing independently, like a hobby or a book, and try to spend some time on that. This might help to distract you and also make you feel better about spending time alone. 

Breathing exercises and other grounding techniques can be beneficial when your anxiety starts to peak. These techniques can make you feel more connected to your surroundings and help you deal with the overwhelming emotions you're experiencing.

Therapy could be a crucial step to understanding and managing your feelings. Meeting with a psychologist or therapist can provide you a safe space to explore your emotions and create coping strategies that suit your situation. 

Lastly, you're not alone in this. Many people experience the same feelings and it's okay to reach out for help. Remember, it's your strength, not weakness, that is on display when you reach out.

Take care."

You might also consider working through your feelings with a therapist. Mental health professionals are equipped with tools and strategies to help us understand our emotions better.

Sorry to hear about what you're going through. Separation anxiety can indeed be tough. It sounds like your emotional connections are particularly strong, which isn't a bad thing, but it seems to be causing you distress right now. Here are a few suggestions that may help you cope:

1) Mindful breathing can be a powerful tool. Try to focus on your breath, the sensation of the air going in and out of your lungs, to help anchor you in the present moment and create a bit of distance from your anxiety.

2) Therapy can be extremely helpful for dealing with separation anxiety as it provides a safe space to explore and challenge your thoughts and feelings with a professional counselor.

3) Engage in activities that you enjoy and resonate with - hobbies, sports, arts, whatever it is that you feel connected with. This can be a powerful distraction and a positive reinforcement of your own identity outside of your relationship.

Remember, it's okay to seek help when the going gets tough. There's no shame in admitting that you're struggling. And remember, everybody has their own pace for growth and change. So, take your time while acknowledging your feelings - this too shall pass.

Hope this insight helps. Reach out if you ever need more support."

Does any one have any tips?"	"Dear [@user],

I'm really sorry to hear about the anxiety you're experiencing, it sounds incredibly tough. Separation anxiety is not uncommon, it can manifest due to underlying feelings of insecurity, fear, past trauma etc. But remember, this doesn't define you and your strong emotions make you a genuine and empathetic person.

The first step is to acknowledge these feelings which you're evidently doing, and I'm proud of you. 

One method you could try is mindfulness exercises or meditation. It helps you stay in the moment and regulate your emotions better. It might be useful to try and identify any patterns or triggers for your emotions to better understand where they're coming from.

Speaking to a professional therapist, psychologist or counselor can be invaluable. They can provide strategies to manage and cope with your anxiety, these could include Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) techniques. 

Lastly, opening up to your partner about your struggle with this might lead to solutions that would help both of you. Remember though, while healthy partnerships generate comfort, relying too much on one person for emotional stability can be draining for them and unhealthy for the relationship's dynamic.

Remember, it's okay to seek help and work at your own pace. You're not alone. We're here to support you.

[32y/o, black female] -- i’ve been struggling with replying to people on social media, especially people i don’t usually talk to. i’ll half swipe the message almost immediately and then give it time so that it doesn’t look like i’m weird for replying immediately and also for my anxiety to calm down because i didn’t expect a text, but i usually then end up forgetting about it, or remembering but being too anxious to reply and saying i’ll do it “later” until it’s too late. i don’t have this problem when i’m texting people who i talk to daily or i’m close with, just like acquaintances and stuff. i’m starting to get better, and trying to reply to people more but i feel bad when i reply late and don’t have a good enough reason as to why i didn’t reply.	"Hi there,

I can really relate to what you're saying and know how difficult it can be to manage these feelings of anxiety around social exchanges on platforms like social media. It's completely okay to take your time in responding to people to ensure you're looking after your mental health. 

One technique that might help you is setting specific times for social media interaction rather than having it spread intermittently throughout the day. Allowing yourself a set amount of time to respond to messages can take a lot of pressure off and give you the space you need to respond confidently. 

Another approach could be jotting down some common responses or phrases that you feel comfortable using when replying to people you don't often communicate with. This might help in reducing the anxiety associated with crafting a reply on the spot.   

Remember, it's okay to put your mental health first. Explain to your contacts that you are working on practicing self-care and sometimes that means responses may be delayed. Most people will likely understand and respect your approach.

Stay strong, you're doing great!"
[32y/o, black female] -- i’ve been struggling with replying to people on social media, especially people i don’t usually talk to. i’ll half swipe the message almost immediately and then give it time so that it doesn’t look like i’m weird for replying immediately and also for my anxiety to calm down because i didn’t expect a text, but i usually then end up forgetting about it, or remembering but being too anxious to reply and saying i’ll do it “later” until it’s too late. i don’t have this problem when i’m texting people who i talk to daily or i’m close with, just like acquaintances and stuff. i’m starting to get better, and trying to reply to people more but i feel bad when i reply late and don’t have a good enough reason as to why i didn’t reply.	"Hello there,

First off, know that you're not alone in this. It seems that you might be experiencing social anxiety, which is pretty common. Take heart in the fact that you're already taking steps to improve. 

One strategy that works is drafting a reading schedule. Assign a particular time of the day just to read and respond to your social media messages, this way you're not caught off guard and you've already mentally prepared yourself for any unexpected chats. 

Moreover, it's essential to remember, everyone operates at their own pace. If anyone gets upset with you for not responding immediately, that's a reflection on their patience, not your communication skills. It's beneficial to convey this to them diplomatically, to create understanding.

Do seek professional advice if this issue persists or worsens, therapists and counselors are trained to provide valuable aid with such situations. Remember, self-care and mental health are of prime importance.

Best wishes on your journey to confident communication."

"Hey there, sounds like you are going through a tough time dealing with social media interactions and anxiety. Firstly, it's okay to reply late. Remember, we all have our own schedules and commitments and it's okay to put your well-being first.

Secondly, try to not put too much pressure on yourself, you are allowed to take your time to respond. You might want to consider setting aside a specific time each day for interacting on social media, so it doesn't become an overwhelming task. 

Also, practicing mindfulness techniques or relaxing activities may help you manage this anxiety. And remember, it's okay to seek professional help if you feel your anxiety is impacting your everyday life. You don't have to go through this alone!"

"Hi there! It sounds like social media triggers your anxiety, specifically when it comes to messaging people outside of your inner circle. It's perfectly okay and understandable to feel that way. Remember, everyone has their own pace and style of communication. There's no rule that says you must respond immediately or within a particular time frame. 

As a first step, consider setting boundaries for your social media use. Let yourself take breaks and don't hesitate to mute notifications or even uninstall the apps temporarily if it's becoming too stressful.

Coping mechanisms like relaxation exercises and mindfulness activities could help with the anxiety. Journaling about these experiences might also offer insight into specific triggers and patterns.

Finally, it's very important to remember that the path to overcoming these challenges isn't one of perfection, but of progress. Celebrate your small victories and be gentle with yourself. You don't need to justify your communication style or habits to anyone. You're doing great, keep up the good work!"

"Hi there! First off, kudos for being brave enough to express your feelings. It sounds like you're dealing with social anxiety, which a lot of us struggle with. Here's an interesting fact: the people you're messaging probably don't pay that much attention to how long it took you to reply nor do they judge you for it. Our brains can sometimes convince us stories that are far from the truth.

But, why don't you try setting up dedicated times each day for social media interactions? During those times, focus on replying to the messages that make you anxious. This way, you're not always on the hook and it's okay to reply immediately since you're already dedicating that time for this purpose.

Also, don't beat yourself up if you don't reply immediately or even within a day or two. Remember, it's your time and energy, use it wisely. Finally, consider seeking help from a mental health professional. They can provide you with strategies for managing your anxiety. Hope this helps and remember to be kind to yourself."

"Hi there, thank you for sharing your struggle with us. You're certainly not alone - many people experience social anxiety, especially through digital means such as social media where we're constantly exposed.

It's a great first step that you've recognised your struggle. Understanding and acknowledging that you experience social anxiety when replying to certain people is the first move towards overcoming it.

To deal with your anxiety, you could set dedicated times during your day when you’ll reply to messages. This way, it becomes a part of your routine and it won’t entail the pressure of being an unexpected event. You may also want to set a reminder so that you don’t forget to reply. Remember, if you're late in replying, you don't owe anyone an explanation. Everyone has their own pace and it's okay to take the needed time.

Apart from that, you might find it useful to seek professional assistance if you feel that anxiety is severely impacting your day-to-day life. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or other therapeutic modalities can be of great help in managing social anxiety.

Keep in mind, progress may be slow, but every step forward counts. You're doing great!"

"Hey there, thank you for reaching out with your concern. It seems like you're dealing with some social anxiety that gets specifically triggered when interacting with people who aren't in your immediate comfortable circle. 

Social media can sometimes add an extra layer to our anxieties due to its ""instant"" nature. It's perfectly normal to take some time to respond, especially when the message takes you by surprise and causes anxiety. You get to control the pace of your interactions. People understand, and if they don't, it's a reflection on them, not you.

Also, do try to remind yourself that no one is obligated to respond immediately, so you don't need to feel guilty about it. Would it help to set a reminder for yourself to reply at a certain time? Or perhaps figuring out a few standard responses that would work in most situations?

To deal with the anxiety, have you considered talking to a licensed therapist or counselor about this? They could provide you with some coping strategies and exercises to help better manage your anxieties. 

But remember, there's no one-size-fits-all solution, so finding what specifically works for you is absolutely crucial. All the best, and know that we're here for you whenever you want to talk."

Hey there, it sounds like you're dealing with social anxiety specifically when it involves communication with acquaintances or people you're not too familiar with. Firstly, there's absolutely no shame in this - it's more common than you might think. From what you've stated, it's really positive to hear that you're making steps towards addressing it. But remember, the speed of your progress is for you to determine. Start small maybe; reply to one message you would normally avoid daily and gradually increase it. Remember, it's okay to take time to reply - not everyone expects an immediate response. Also, consider sharing your feelings with people around you, opening up can often bring relief. Keep focusing on your progress, you're doing great.

It sounds like you're dealing with some social anxiety, which is very common, particularly when communicating with people you don't know well. One strategy that might help is scheduling dedicated periods of time each day to do this, so you lessen the risk of forgetting or avoiding the task. Additionally, keep in mind that everyone is different in how they engage on social media, and there are no set rules for how quickly you have to respond. People understand that we all have busy lives and can't always reply immediately, even if we see the message when it first comes in. If you're finding this issue is really impacting your ability to engage or is causing added stress, talking to a mental health professional could be beneficial. They can provide more individualized coping strategies and guidance.

"Hi, it seems like you're going through a tough time with social media anxiety - it's more common than you might think, so you're definitely not alone. Positive step, acknowledging it and seeking to change the habit shows great self-awareness. 

Maybe one way to deal with it is to set specific times when you check your messages, like in the morning and evening. This way, even if you reply late, you can tell them that you only check your messages at certain times. Also, it might be helpful if you remind yourself that there's no rule that says you must reply immediately. It's okay to take your time.

You could also practice some mindfulness exercises to relieve feelings of anxiety. And remember, it's okay to ask help from a professional. They can provide you strategies to deal with the feeling.

Kudos to you for working on this and trying to reply more often. Each step is a victory, no matter how small. Keep going!"
[32y/o, black female] -- I don't know when exactly it started. Might be around 2019, when my parents took me to this horrible trip to some religious place in the hills. Before this we used to do great trips, London, USA etc which I enjoyed. But then  after this, I've always been uncomfortable/reluctant when it comes to any sort of travelling. Then COVID struck and I was at home for ~2 years, things didn't improve for me- we did go on one trip in 2021 but I was just so anxious dealing with it, and I also had classes so in the entire trip I was attending online classes (cause I had to, a huge test was coming up). My problem is that I'm anxious before the trip happens and during it I'm completely fine. It's gotten better now tho, but not completely cured. Going alone or with friends seems like a mammoth task. Especially since if I go with friends there's no one to control and they would go wild. I know I need to get over this for the future. Any tips?	"Hey there,

I'm really sorry to hear that you're struggling with travel anxiety. It's commendable and a huge first step that you've recognized the issue and want to get help. Anxiety manifesting itself before a trip is common, even though you feel fine during the trip. It's often fueled by the unknown and anticipation of what might happen.

One suggestion could be to plan your trips meticulously. Break down your journey into smaller tasks that you can manage and plan things like your mode of transport, where you'll be staying and the routes you'll be taking in advance. You could also have contingency plans in place, be it for the journey, or other aspects of the trip, which might help ease your anxiety.

When it comes to social situations, it might be worth discussing your anxiety with your friends. You may be surprised by how supportive they could be if they understand the situation you are in. It could help in calming you down during the trip and ensuring things don't go too wild.

Exercise and meditation can also be great stress-busters. Regular physical activity can help you manage your anxiety in general, while mindfulness techniques can help manage your anxiety virtually anywhere, including on trips.

Finally, remember it's perfectly okay to seek professional help. If your anxiety is severe and impacting your day-to-day life, speaking to a therapist or counselor might be beneficial. They would be able to provide you with strategies tailored specifically for you.

Hang in there, you've got this!"

It's okay to feel anxious, since travel can often push us outside our comfort zones. However, it shouldn't cause you significant stress or discomfort. Here are some suggestions for handling your situation:

1. **Take Control Of Your Itinerary** - Whenever you can, have a say in where you're going, what you'll be doing, and who you'll be with. This can reduce some of your anxiety and give you a level of control that can be comforting.

2. **Preparation Is Key** - Being well-prepared can ease travel anxiety. The more you know about where you're going, what your accommodations will look like, what activities you'll participate in, the more comfortable you might feel.

3. **Practice Self-Care** - While traveling, remember to prioritize your physical and mental health. Don't feel obliged to overbook your schedule. If you need a day to relax and take care of yourself, do it.

4. **Pace Yourself** - Start with short trips, maybe a weekend away with friends. Gradually extend the duration as your comfort level grows.

5. **Therapy and/or Counseling** - If you find that your travel anxiety continues to persist, it might be helpful to consider working with a counselor or therapist. They can provide you with strategies to manage anxiety and help you understand its underlying causes.

Remember, overcoming anxiety is a journey in itself, it might take time and that's okay. Just take small steps and gradually proceed. Most importantly, be patient and kind to yourself."

It sounds like you're dealing with quite a bit of anxiety around travel, and I'm so sorry to hear you're going through this. It's really common for these kinds of fears to develop after a bad experience, and it's great that you're seeking help.

Try to understand your anxiety, what exactly are you afraid of? Are you worried about possible unforeseen circumstances? Or feeling out of control when you're away from familiar surroundings? Identify the specific cause for your anxiety and slowly try to confront or understand this fear. 

Visualization might help too. Sit somewhere quiet and imagine being on a trip, from packing your bag to reaching the destination, visualize everything in detail. Practice this ""imaginary trip"" habitually and gradually, you might feel less anxious about the actual trip. 

If safe, try taking small trips close to your home alone or with people you trust. These can be short day trips to places that are familiar to you, to begin with, and once you're comfortable with that, you can gradually increase the duration or distance.

Limiting caffeine intake might also help as caffeine could cause or increase feelings of anxiety. Exercise or meditate regularly as both these things can help reduce stress and anxiety.

If these feelings persist or are severely affecting your life, consider talking to a professional. Cognitive-behavioral therapy can help change negative thought patterns that lead to anxiety, for example.

Remember, take it slow, be gentle with yourself and don't push too hard. It's okay to have fears and worries, confronting them and seeking help is a big step forward. Wishing you all the best."

I'm really sorry to hear about the difficulties you're experiencing with travel anxiety. It's not an easy thing to deal with, especially when it interferes with your life the way you've described. Let me first say that you've taken a significant step forwards by recognizing the issue and asking for help.

It's great to hear that things have been getting a little bit easier for you, even if they're not completely better. Gradual improvement is key and it's a good sign that you're noticing a positive change. Here are a few tips that might help you further: 

1. Identify your specific fears: Are you worried about being out of control? Or maybe it's the unknown that happens on a trip? If you can pinpoint what exactly makes you anxious, you can address these fears more directly. 

2. Prepare as much as possible: If the unknown is a source of anxiety for you, planning ahead can lessen that fear. Have a loose schedule in place, but also remind yourself that it's okay if you deviate from it. 

3. Try to visualize a successful trip: This is a therapeutic technique where you imagine every detail of your trip going smoothly, from start to finish. It can help you to be more positive about your journey. 

4. Practice self-care: Eating balanced meals, getting enough sleep, and exercising can all help manage stress levels and make you feel more in control. 

5. Consider seeking professional help: If your anxiety continues to interfere with your life, you may find it beneficial to speak with a mental health professional. 

Remember, everyone has different coping mechanisms. Try out different strategies and see what works best for you. Lastly, be kind to yourself and celebrate every small victory on the road to conquering your travel anxiety. You're stronger than you think. 

Stay strong, and remember that it's okay to ask for help. We're here for you."

Thank you for reaching out and I hear you. It sounds like you're dealing with what might be anticipation anxiety, which is a common type of anxiety experienced before certain events or situations. It's completely okay and normal to feel this way. 

One thing that might help is to identify what exactly about the trips makes you anxious. Is it the fear of the unknown, being away from the comfort of your home, or the unpredictability of your friends? Once, you've identified this, you can try to address each concern individually.

Breathing exercises, meditation, or mindfulness techniques can also be useful tools to help calm your mind when you start feeling anxious. 

As for traveling with friends, setting boundaries could be beneficial. Let them know about your anxiety and discuss how they can support you during the trips. If they understand and respect your feelings, it might make the trips much easier.

Facing your fears may sound daunting, but you've already shown immense bravery by reaching out here and expressing your feelings. Remember, it's perfectly okay to take small steps. Maybe start with short trips close to home and gradually increase the distance. 

Also, it could be helpful to seek professional guidance. Psychologists and therapists are trained in handling such situations and could offer some more personalised advice and coping mechanisms.

Keep going, one step at a time - you've got this!"

Hey there, it sounds like you're dealing with anticipatory anxiety related to travel, and it's completely valid. The good news is, many people are going through similar experiences and have found ways to cope successfully and so can you. Start small, maybe just a short trip to a nearby place that you feel comfortable going to either alone or in a controlled group setting. Familiarity might reduce some of your concerns. Breathing exercises and visualization might also be useful tools. Imagine the trip in vivid detail in a positive light from beginning to end. This might help to simulate the trip and reduce your anxiety beforehand. It's essential to take your time and not rush the process. Gradually expose yourself to longer and less predictable trips over time. Don't worry about trying to get over it quickly, this is a process and it's okay if progress feels slow. Stay patient with yourself.

It sounds like you've been dealing with quite a bit of anxiety around travel, and I'm sorry you're feeling this way. It's actually quite common to feel anxious before a trip, a phenomenon sometimes referred to as anticipatory anxiety. It seems like your anxiety got triggered after a negative experience during a particular trip, and since then, it has built up around the idea of travel.

One thing you can do is try to make the experience as comfortable and familiar as possible. If you can, travel with someone you trust and who understands your anxiety. Start by taking small trips, maybe day trips to local attractions before gradually progressing to overnight stays or longer vacations. 

In regards to going with friends and feeling out of control, try having an open and honest discussion with them about your feelings. Friends, who truly care for your wellbeing, would most likely respect your boundaries. 

Also, have you ever considered seeking professional help such as a therapist or a counselor? They can provide expertise on coping mechanisms, exercises, and perhaps exposure therapy that might assist you. 

Remember, it’s okay to take small steps at your own pace. Being kind and patient with oneself is also a part of the healing process too."

It's great that you've realized the pattern of your travel anxiety and are seeking ways to handle it. Acknowledging the issue is the first step towards dealing with it. It's understandable that tension mounts before trips- this happens to many of us. Here are few things that might help:

1. Plan ahead: Have everything sorted out well in advance. Try to have a well-structured itinerary that includes not just the places you'll visit but also time reserved for rest and self-care. 

2. Understand your triggers: Is it the uncertainty? Is it the fear of losing control? Once you can identify your specific triggers, then you can begin to effectively address them.

3. Practice mindfulness: This doesn't necessarily mean meditating for hours. Simple, daily practices can help, like taking deep breathes, progressive muscle relaxation, or even a few minutes of quiet and calm before starting your day.

4. Have a support system: Share your anxieties with your friends. They might not fully understand, but their support can be a valuable source of comfort. Let them know what might trigger you and work out ways of handling those moments during the trip.

5. Seek professional help: If the anxiety continues to hinder your daily life, it might be helpful to consult a mental health professional. They can provide you with tools and coping mechanisms to better manage your symptoms.

Remember that changes take time and there's no instant solution. Celebrate small victories and remember that even the smallest progress is still progress. You've got this!"
[32y/o, black female] -- I don't know when exactly it started. Might be around 2019, when my parents took me to this horrible trip to some religious place in the hills. Before this we used to do great trips, London, USA etc which I enjoyed. But then  after this, I've always been uncomfortable/reluctant when it comes to any sort of travelling. Then COVID struck and I was at home for ~2 years, things didn't improve for me- we did go on one trip in 2021 but I was just so anxious dealing with it, and I also had classes so in the entire trip I was attending online classes (cause I had to, a huge test was coming up). My problem is that I'm anxious before the trip happens and during it I'm completely fine. It's gotten better now tho, but not completely cured. Going alone or with friends seems like a mammoth task. Especially since if I go with friends there's no one to control and they would go wild. I know I need to get over this for the future. Any tips?	"I'm so sorry to hear about what you're going through, it must be really tough. Sometimes, a negative experience can imprint a fear or anxiety response, maybe that trip to the religious place in the hills affected you more than you realize. You aren't alone in this. 

There's no rush in ""curing"" this feeling, it's ok to take things at your own pace. You might find it helpful to take small steps, like going on short trips around your vicinity and gradually increasing the distance and duration as your comfort increases. Try to create new, positive experiences with travel to replace the older, negative ones. 

Remember that it is perfectly okay to communicate your feelings to your friends ahead of trips together, so they can be supportive and understanding. You may also want to consider talking about this with a psychologist or a counselor, they could provide you with some coping strategies or therapies that might help you deal better with your anxiety. 

Remember: it is perfectly fine to take things slow, to ask for help and to take care of your mental health. There's no such thing as a problem being too small if it's causing you distress. Stay strong!"

Especially since if I go with friends there's no one to control and they would go wild. I know I need to get over this for the future. Any tips?	"Hi there, 

Firstly, thank you for reaching out and being so open with your struggle. Anxiety related to travel can often be a response to stressful events associated with tripping like the one you described. It's totally okay to feel what you're feeling and it's great that things have gotten somewhat better for you. 

A couple of potential strategies you might want to consider. First, relaxation techniques such as deep breathing, visualisation, and progressive muscle relaxing can all help to reduce feelings of anxiety. Regular practice can make them more effective. They are easily available online.

Just like you said, you are fine during the trip. This indicates that your fear might be anticipated or linked to the unknown rather than the act of traveling itself. Journaling through your thoughts and experiences might help you to identify any patterns or triggers, and allow you to work through them in a safe environment.

If you haven't already, you might also consider seeking professional help. Psychologists and therapists are equipped to provide strategies and techniques to help manage anxiety.

Finally, remember the importance of baby steps. Maybe start by going on short local trips with a trusted friend or two, gradually expanding into longer distances or larger friend groups. Remember to celebrate each small victory.

Remember to be kind to yourself along the way, healing is a journey not a destination.

"[32y/o, black female] -- Im sorry for this little rant here but i dont know what else to do… I have been clinically depressed since i was 14 and although i am sure i have had happy moments or times when everything didnt feel so dark i keep coming back to the same place emotionally. 
I wanted to try journaling or smth like that but i felt so dumb so i came to this community to just type my thoughts. When i was younger no matter how hard things were academically, sociallly or emotionally my mom was there but she has been diagnosed with dementia for 2 years now and i lost the one person that i could talk to freely. 
I have seen been kind of parenting my dad and while im away in uni he is all alone so im scared for him all the time because he doesnt take care of himself and he has a serious heart condition. 
Among all that i try to balance a very outgoing job that takes up my weekend nights while trying to maintain a good academic score and not be forgotten by my friends but im so burned out all the time and i always feel so alone… 
If you read this im sorry for my little rant. I hope it gets better for all of us."	"First off, you don't have to apologize. It's natural and healthy to express your feelings, so thank you for reaching out and being so open about what you're going through. It really sounds like you're carrying a lot on your shoulders. Dealing with your own depression while worrying about evolving family dynamics and balancing work with academic commitments is not easy and can feel incredibly overwhelming. 

You mentioned being interested in journaling - in fact, it's a great way to process feelings and reduce stress. Remember, there’s no right or wrong way to journal - it's your personal space to offload feelings and thoughts. You certainly aren't dumb for considering to try it.

Are you currently seeking any professional help for your depression? There are various avenues you could explore such as counselling or therapy, which could assist in managing everything you're dealing with. These professionals can help you find effective coping strategies tailored to your needs. 

It's also great you retain hope during these difficult moments. Your feelings and struggles are valid, and nobody is as alone as they feel. Reach out to your friends when you're able - even a short text or call can remind you that there are people who care about you. Keep pushing through, and remember, self-care isn't selfish. Please do what you can to take care of yourself even as you care for others.

Stay strong, your resilience is admirable. Remember there's a supportive community here and we'll do whatever we can to help. Sending virtual hugs your way."

It's okay, you have every right to feel overwhelmed and it's brave of you to open up and share your feelings here. Recognizing that you're feeling burnt out and emotionally drained is a step towards finding a way to address it.

Depression can make you feel like you're alone, and that can be really tough. However, remember that you are never alone and it's always okay to ask for support. You're going through some pretty big life changes and taking on a level of responsibility with your dad that's challenging for anyone, let alone someone dealing with their own mental health issues.

Might you consider seeking support from university counseling services? They're there to help students both academically and personally and they may be able to provide you with resources. 

Also, please don't isolate yourself from your friends. Reach out to them, let them know how you're feeling. They may not understand everything you're going through, but they can provide moral support. Besides, human connection, empathy, and understanding can sometimes be incredibly healing.

And remember, it's okay to focus on self-care and take breaks when burnout starts to set in. It's not a sign of weakness, but a testament to understanding your own limits.

Just know that feelings won't be forever and things can get better. Hold on to the hope. It's okay to struggle and to ask for help."

Please remember that it's never silly to express your feelings, and it doesn't make you weak. Your struggles are valid, and it takes immense strength to open up about them.

I can only imagine how tough it is facing the condition of your mom and worrying about your dad while also managing your job and academics. Please know it's okay to feel overwhelmed and burned out with all this on your plate. You're human.

Your school may have resources available, such as counseling or support groups, don't be afraid to ask. There are also free hotlines and online services where you can talk to mental health professionals anonymously, which can be a good place to start, especially considering your worries about your family's health.

Also, try to find small moments of self-care during your day. This could be as simple as enjoying a cup of tea, listening to your favorite music, or taking a short walk. It can really help manage stress levels.

Lastly, consider reaching out to your friends. You might be surprised how understanding people can be, and perhaps they're feeling similarly at times.

Remember, it's okay to ask for help - we all need it at points in our life. I sincerely hope things start to get better for you soon, and please remember, this community is here for you. Be gentle on yourself, you're shouldering a lot. Sending you all the positive vibes."

Dealing with depression is never easy and it becomes notably harder when juggling multiple responsibilities and loss. Remember, it's okay to be vulnerable, it has nothing to do with being weak. In fact, it requires a profound type of strength to face one's fears and pain head-on. 

Have you considered reaching out to a mental health professional to discuss these feelings? Also, universities often provide counseling services, these resources could be of great help. You wouldn't be alone in this.

As for your dad, it may be worth looking into community resources that could help provide care for him, giving you peace of mind while you're away. 

Don't forget self-care, it's okay to take a little pause from everything. Go for a walk, meditate, take a warm bath — do simple things that calm your mind. You deserve happiness and wellbeing just as much as anyone else.

Lastly, try to be patient with yourself. When dealing with emotional pain, the healing process can be slow, but it's crucial to give yourself time. 

Remember, there are people here, in this community who care. You're never truly alone. Stay strong, it does get better. Sending warm thoughts your way."

What you’re going through sounds incredibly tough and it's perfectly understandable that you’d feel overwhelmed and alone.  Depression is a serious condition, and it's so important to continue to reach out and talk about it just like you're doing now. Journaling can indeed be a source of relief for some people, but it's not for everyone - don't feel embarrassed or ""dumb"" if it doesn't work for you.

Taking care of your parents in top of everything else you're dealing with sounds very challenging. Remember that you're allowed to take time for yourself and to take care of your own needs. 

Your fear for your dad is totally justified, and it underlines what a considerate and caring person you are. However, you can only do so much. It may be worth talking to him about getting a home aide or health care professional to visit him when you aren’t available.

As for balancing work, school, friends, and self-care - that's a lot for anyone to juggle. It's okay to ask for extensions, to say no, to delegate and to seek help when you need it.

Your feelings are valid, you are heard and your strength is commendable. It's okay to lean on others as you navigate this challenging time - we’re here for you. Remember to not forget about self-care amidst all of this. It’s crucial for you to look after your own mental health."

First off, I want you to know it's truly okay to post your emotions here. Communities like these exist to provide support, and you're not alone. Dealing with depression for such a long time must have been challenging, and it's truly brave of you to share this with us.

Have you considered seeking therapy or support from mental health professionals to assist you in managing these feelings? They might be able to provide you with some techniques to cope with feelings of loneliness and burnout. Also, please don't feel dumb about journaling. Some people really benefit from it as a form of catharsis. You could try writing just for yourself, you don't have to share unless you want to.

It also sounds like you're dealing with a lot on your plate right now. Taking care of a parent, balancing work and studies, and trying to maintain a social life is a lot for anyone to handle. It's important to remember that it's okay to ask for help. There might be organizations in your area that could assist with your mother's care or others you could reach out to about your father's wellbeing.

Lastly, I encourage you to also take time for self-care. Even small moments can have a big impact. Taking a brief walk outside, reading a book you enjoy, or treating yourself to something you like can help boost your mood.

You're doing great, even when it doesn't feel like it, these circumstances are not easy and yet here you are, pushing on. Remember, reaching out is a step towards healing and things can and will get better. You're not alone, and we're here for you."

First off, I want to say it's completely okay to rant. Sometimes typing it all out can really help with processing the emotion. You're dealing with a lot right now, juggling so many responsibilities. It's natural to feel overwhelmed and alone. 

I can see that you're trying to take care of everyone around you while also battling your own demons. Your strength is admirable, but please remember to take care of yourself too. You deserve care and affection just like everyone else, and I hope you can find some ways to take care of yourself while managing your life.

I encourage you to align yourself with some professional help too, it's important to accept when something is out of our hands and seek a person that's qualified to guide us. It doesn't devalue our efforts, only strengthens our resolve. Reach out to a counselor or mental health professional at your university if possible. It can be a source of a great support.

Journaling can be a great tool too, it can feel silly at first, but it could help organize those inundating thoughts. And remember, you don't have to carry this all by yourself. Your friends can be a great network of support; don't hesitate to let them know you're having a tough time.

Take care and remember, it might take time, but things will get better. Okay?"

Thank you for sharing your feelings with us here. Please remember that you're not alone. Even when it feels like it, this community is here for you. Anyone can feel overwhelmed when they're dealing with so much. It's okay to have these feelings, and it's really important to make sure you're taking care of yourself, even in small ways.

Have you considered reaching out to a professional counselor or therapist, if you're not already doing so? They can provide you with strategies and tools that can help manage your emotions during difficult moments and overall make this journey a little easier for you. 

Universities often have mental health resources and services available to students. Consider checking those out, as talking to someone objective might help with your feelings of loneliness. They might also have resources that could assist your father.

As for your issue with maintaining your academic performance and a highly active job, I wonder if you're pushing yourself too hard. While it's great to strive for success, it's important to remember not to stretch yourself too thin. 

Look into ways that you can practice self-care. This doesn't have to be anything grand. Even simple things, like taking a few minutes each day to breathe and reflect, can make a big difference.

Remember, there is no timeline for progress and it's okay to have set-backs and off days. Clear message here is: take care of you. You're doing well, even if some days it doesn't feel like it. Keep going."
"[32y/o, black female] -- So I have decided to well distance myself from most of my friends. The reason why is even though i seem to be getting better.

Now that I have show more emotion I tend to lose control over my emotions and when I do I try to control it but it just makes me angry.

First and foremost, it sounds like you're really going through a tough time, but you are not alone. Many people have experienced periods where their emotions can be overwhelming and difficult to control. It's really commendable that you're taking steps to protect the people you care about.

It's important to know that I'm not a professional, but there are potentially a couple of things you can do. First, finding a therapist or counselor can be incredibly helpful. They can provide you with techniques to help manage your emotions on a day-to-day basis. 

Second, deep breathing and similar coping strategies can sometimes help diffuse an intense emotion in the moment. Journaling about your experiences may also help, and it’s a good way to document your progress and recognize patterns.

Lastly, consider reaching out to the people you've distanced yourself from, if you feel comfortable. They probably care a lot about you and may be wondering how they can support you during this time.

No matter how dark it gets, remember there's always help available, you don't have to face this alone. Reach out to a professional mental health service and keep the conversation going. Your well-being is important.

Take care of yourself!"

I'm really sorry to hear you're going through this, processing and managing our emotions can be extremely difficult. Let me applaud you for recognizing the issue and wanting to do something about it. Kudos to you for this show of strength.

There's a complex tangle of emotions you're dealing with and it's never easy to navigate these storms alone. Try to express your feelings to your friends, they could provide you with much needed support. As for your emotional bursts, could I recommend trying to find coping mechanisms (breathing exercises, meditation, yoga, etc) to help manage it? 

Reaching out to a mental health professional would be immensely beneficial. They have tools and resources that can help you understand your emotions and improve your mental health condition. 

Remember, it's okay to ask for help and seek support. Everyone needs a little help sometimes and there's absolutely nothing wrong with reaching out. Best of luck and take care."

It's really admirable that you're acknowledging this and seeking advice, not everyone has the strength and courage to do that. With regard to your emotions, it sounds like you may have some bottled up feelings that you're struggling to manage in a way that doesn't harm others. Consider Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) to help you gain better control of your emotions. This therapy helps you understand your thought patterns, so you can handle challenging situations better and respond appropriately to emotional triggers.

Seeing a professional therapist could be beneficial here. They can provide tools and techniques for controlling and expressing your emotions more healthily. Anger management courses might also be useful. Please, don't be too hard on yourself, everyone struggles from time to time, you're not alone.

As for your friends and loved ones, have you talked to them about what you're experiencing? They might be more understanding than you think. And while it's commendable that you want to protect them, self-isolation is rarely a good long-term solution.

Firstly, recognition of the issue is the first step towards progress, so good on you for acknowledging and taking that bold step to isolate yourself in order not to hurt others. 

However, it's distressing to hear that you're struggling with your emotions and it's resulting in you hurting your loved ones. Emotions can be overwhelming at times and difficult to manage, but it's important to understand what is prompting these outbursts. Facing raw emotions isn't easy and it shows courage for you to ask for help. 

There are few things you can consider, such as mindfulness techniques or learning coping skills such as deep breathing, taking walks, or journaling your feelings to better understand them. Some people find art and music therapeutic as well. 

But above all, professional help could be beneficial. A therapist or counselor can provide you with strategies to regain control of your emotions, help in understanding your triggers, and give you better tools for communicating effectively without hurting those around you. You should really consider seeking their guidance as they have studying and treating behaviors like this for a long time and can help you navigate through it. 

Remember, everyone makes mistakes, but the trick is to learn from them. Please stay brave on this journey for better mental health and wellbeing. We're all in this together.

Thank you for reaching out and expressing your feelings and struggles here. You're certainly not alone in this - many people grapple with similar issues. Addiction can take many forms, and it's a strength that you're able to recognize and acknowledge your patterns.

One of the first steps to managing an addictive personality is understanding the root causes, which you've done brilliantly by connecting it to your early life experiences. Yet, there are some practical strategies you can consider to help manage your urges. This could include finding healthy alternatives to replace your addictive tendencies, such as exercise or channelling your energy into a hobby you're passionate about. 

Moreover, reaching out to mental health professions who specialize in addiction counselling and cognitive-behavioral therapy can provide you with coping mechanisms tailored to your situation. This doesn't mean you're weak or incapable, far from it. It merely suggests that we all need a helping hand from time to time.

Remember, this is your journey and you're doing your best. That's what matters the most.

Stay strong, we're here for you.

P.S. It's always recommended to seek professional advice for the best guidance in such cases."

Firstly, thanks for sharing your story with such authenticity. It takes courage to do so. Know that you're most definitely not alone in this struggle with habitual addiction. You'd be surprised how common it is.

It seems like this tendency to find addictive outlets comes from a long pattern that started in childhood. As you mentioned, it doesn't only pertain to traditionally harmful substances but also behaviors and food. It's important to understand that these habits are not a reflection of you, but rather, they're coping mechanisms developed over years due to life circumstances.

There are various ways to approach this issue, but one suggestion could be to check in with a mental health professional. They can provide practical cognitive-behavioral strategies to help break the cycle of addiction. A professional would also be able to guide you through unearthing and addressing the root cause of these habits.

Another thing that can help is joining a support group for addiction. It might help to hear others' experiences and coping strategies as well. Even here, you will find many people who have found ways to manage addictive tendencies in their lives.

Remember, it's not a failure if you find the addiction changing shape or form. You're working through deeply ingrained patterns, and sometimes they're pretty stubborn. Every step you take towards getting to understand yourself better is progress, even if it doesn't seem like it.

Sending strength and positivity your way!"

"Hey there, thank you so much for sharing your story. It must have taken courage to be this straightforward about your struggles, so props to you!

First off, you're definitely not the only person dealing with this. Many of us have been there, trying to fill voids with different forms of addictions, trying to grasp onto something that feels good for the moment while struggling with past or present problems.

You've taken a significant step in acknowledging your addictive personality and that's half the battle won. Breaking the cycle of addiction can be really tough but it's possible, done consistently and gradually.

Education can also be a great tool, understanding why you get addicted, and what these addictions do to your body and mind can be a huge eye opener.

Exploring therapeutic avenues such as cognitive behavioural therapy or getting involved in a support group can be a starting point. Getting professional help to learn coping mechanisms can be beneficial too. 

Take it one day at a time, and remember it's okay to ask for help, and it's even more than okay to not be perfect while working on yourself. Hope you find what you're looking for. You're stronger than you think.

You're certainly not alone in what you're experiencing and it's brave of you to reach out. Many people struggle with various types of addictions and overcoming them can be tough - it's more than okay to ask for help. It seems like you're already aware of the cycle, which in itself is a powerful step towards change. Identifying and acknowledging the issue is really important.

If you haven't sought professional help yet, strongly consider finding a therapist or a counselor who specializes in addiction. They're trained to guide you through these hardships and can provide you with tools and strategies to manage your addictive tendencies. If professional help feels like too big a step for now, there are also numerous support groups, both online and offline, where you can connect with people who are battling similar issues.

Start by focusing on the roots of your addictive behavior and find healthier ways to cope with whatever it is you're dealing with. It could be stress, loneliness, lack of confidence, etc. Find hobbies or activities that can fill your time more productively. Regular exercise, meditation, creative pursuits like painting or writing, for example, can all be really helpful.

Remember, you're battling with quite a complex aspect of human nature. So be gentle with yourself, celebrate even small victories, and don't beat yourself up if you stumble. Healing is not linear. Stay positive, focus on progress not perfection, and reach out to others when you need to."

I'm really sorry to hear you're struggling, and I'm glad to see you reaching out for support. I can empathize with what you're going through, and you're definitely not alone in this. From what you've shared, it seems that you've been managing different dependencies throughout your life. It's great that you're acknowledging the issue, that's the first step understand and work through it.

While it's very common for people to develop habits or certain dependencies, when carried to excess, these need to be addressed. Therapy might be a good route for you to consider if you have not tried it already. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) especially focuses on understanding the root cause and breaking unhealthy patterns. If that feels like too much at once, opening up to trusted friends or starting with some self-help books focused on addiction might be gentle stepping stones too.

In addition, practicing mindfulness and maintaining balanced diet and regular physical activity can be beneficial in managing and overcoming different forms of addictions. These complement any professional interventions.

Remember, the journey to self-improvement is a gradual process, and it's okay to have setbacks. What's important is to never stop trying. Be kind and patient with yourself.

Take care."

Firstly, I want to commend you on your courage for sharing your story here. You're not alone in facing such struggles. Many people experience addictive patterns - it's a human trait, not a personal failing.

A few things you may want to consider: 

1. Therapy can really help, as it's always good to understand the source of your behavior. There are therapists who specialize in addiction and they may help you uncover the root cause and give you necessary tools to tackle it.
   
2. Mindfulness and meditation can help you recognize when you're starting to get into addictive patterns. It's not easy and it doesn't happen overnight, but in the long run it can lead to better understanding and control over your actions.
   
3. Taking care of your physical health: Regular exercise, maintaining a balanced diet, getting enough sleep etc. can all provide a healthier outlet for your energy.
 
Remember, it's okay to not be okay sometimes. You're not expected to be perfect, no one is. Making progress, however slow it might be, is what truly matters. Reach out to professionals who can guide you through this journey; they can offer far better help than we can here. Stay strong, we're rooting for you."

Therapists and psychologists are equipped to help you understand and navigate these issues. You could also look into local support groups for individuals struggling with similar issues. You're strong for seeking out help and please remember it's perfectly fine to ask for it. You've got this!
"[32y/o, black female] --      So ima just keep this short, but most of my life I’ve never gotten attention from my parents. That’s do to the fact my mom had many jobs and was still in college while my father was an addict. I think this is where it came from I’m pretty sure. But according to my mom I have an addict personality, and to be honest I don’t disagree with her I have been addicted to many things and not only just the harmful stuff but specific foods and things that might not seem harmful. But they can most definitely be in large quantities. 
     The reason why she said this is because she has plenty of evidence to support it. I have always been addicted to something ever since I was a kid I had an addiction wether if it was bad or good I had always had one. Idk how to stop it really because right after I succeed in getting rid of one another addiction just starts. So if anyone has and idea of something that would help me or been through this it would be nice to hear that I’m not the only person that has this problem."	"Hey there, thank you for reaching out and sharing your experience. It sounds like you're dealing with a very tough issue. I wanted to let you know that you're certainly NOT alone in facing this—there are many out there who've struggled with similar patterns of addiction, and there is help available.

Seeing a professional therapist or psychologist could be a great step forward. They could provide you strategies to deal with the cycle you described and they might help you understand the root cause of these addictive behaviors. 

You might also find it helpful to get involved in supportive communities, both online and offline. There are plenty of forums and groups where you could find mutual understanding and companionship. 

Remember, it's important to take small, consistent steps towards breaking these patterns. Don't be hard on yourself if progress seems slow. You're already showing great courage by acknowledging this issue and reaching out. That’s already a great start! Take care of yourself and keep going!"
"[32y/o, black female] -- I know... it affects me. I had my sleep on schedule before but the recent events didn't allow me to have a good sleep. But it's fine. I can change it slowly. Had a little dark thoughts at night but it didn't last long. Some self hatred and other usual stuff but it wasn't that bad. I mean can I get better in one night? Of course not. Still felt lonely (or alone... I don't know my English sucks:() but that's fine too. Pain is part of my journey. I'm not feeling strong yet but it doesn't hurt like last week. 

Also I had a small good conversation with someone which made me happy that moment.

I was supposed to go to see my psychiatrist but I didn't go because I was scared. It's really hard to go there. But it's ok at least I tried to think about going there. I need to change my medicines. 

Overall I'm sad but not too much. Like 4/10. That's good. I mean it was 9/10 last week so I'm still satisfied ."	"Hey there, first let me say that it's okay to be scared and even unsure about things. Don't beat yourself up over missed opportunities or changes in your routine - progress doesn't happen overnight and it's okay to take your time. Acknowledge your victories, no matter how small they may seem! 

It's entirely fine that you felt scared to see your psychiatrist. Perhaps next time, you could try reaching out to a trusted friend or family member, or even a mental health advocate to accompany you? It can often make the process less daunting. And remember, it's okay to express your worries to your doctor — they are there to help you, and understanding your fears is part of that process.

It's important to uphold a self-care routine especially when you're feeling down. It can help you manage your thoughts and emotions. I understand that sleeping well has recently been a challenge for you, but don't be too hard on yourself. Consider some ways to help with your sleep schedule, like wind down activities before bed, and avoid excessive caffeine.

Always remind yourself that pain is indeed a part of the journey, but so is the pleasure and happiness, like that brief yet impactful conversation you had with someone. 

Remember, your feelings are valid and it's okay to feel sad. Keep striving for better days and accept the small improvements. We're in this together - remember you're never alone. We're here for you, always."

"Hey there, I'm really proud of you for recognizing your feelings and being open about them. Remember, change doesn't happen overnight, it's perfectly okay to take small steps towards improvement. Recognize small victories - like feeling a bit better than last week, having a good conversation with someone, and being able to assess your sadness. These are big wins! 

Your sleep will get better with time, just give yourself a bit of patience. Dark thoughts can be very scary sometimes, it's totally normal to feel shaken by them. However, it's important to remember that they are temporary. 

Regarding your psychiatrist, it's completely understandable to feel scared about it - but it's a step that's really good for your mental health. Maybe try reaching out through a phone or online consultation first? It might feel less intimidating than a physical visit. And it's great that you are considering changing your medicines, discussing it with your psychiatrist could give a more appropriate prescription for your current feelings. 

We all have periods of feeling sad and alone, and it's good that you're not feeling too much pressure. And don't worry about your English, you're doing amazing. Stay strong, keep fighting, and keep recognizing your little victories. Best wishes to you."

Your post really touched me, and first off, I want to say how proud I am of you. You're absolutely right in saying that pain is part of the journey, it truly is. You recognizing the fluctuations in your emotional state shows a lot of self-awareness. A 4/10 this week when it was a 9/10 last week definitely sounds like an improvement, and it's important to acknowledge both small and huge victories on our personal paths to mental wellbeing. 

Don't beat yourself up for not going to your psychiatrist. It can indeed be overwhelming and even scary, but remember, it is a step that you might eventually need to make in order to get better. It's completely okay to take it one day at a time.

The fact that you had a good conversation with someone and it made you happy is wonderful. Keep seeking out interactions which can lift up your spirit. Continue connecting, even if it's just small talk. 

Please, don't hesitate to reach out here if you're feeling down or if you just want to talk. This community is here for you. Keep nurturing the small victories, and remember that progress isn't linear. Even on tough days, you're still moving forward."

First thing, I want to commend you for being brave and reaching out. That in it of itself is a major and commendable step. I'm glad to see you're reflecting on your feelings and finding positivity—even if it's small—within your struggles.

I think it's great that you understand that changing your sleep schedule—and your overall mental state, for that matter—won't be an overnight process. It's an ongoing journey towards healing that takes time.

Remember that feeling alone, or loneliness for that matter, can be incredibly isolating. Try to continue reaching out to people, even if it's briefly. That small conversation you had that made you happy, try to have more of them. Connect with others. You'll be surprised how much strength you draw from those small exchanges.

Keeping up with your medication is incredibly important and I understand visiting a psychiatrist may cause anxiety. You were brave enough to remember to do so, that's a great step. Maybe consider taking a supportive friend along next time? It could prove to be comforting.

You're showing incredible resilience by recognising progress in your sadness scale. This is such a powerful tool and I encourage you to keep using this measure.

Remember, it's okay to not feel okay. It's okay to be scared. Just remember that you're not alone and that there are people who care about you and your wellbeing. It's hard but acknowledge how far you've already come. Keep going, taking one step at a time.

It's okay to not have everything magically get better in just one night. Recovering and changing, especially in regards to mental health is a slow process, and the fact that you can acknowledge the journey and take it step by step shows a lot of strength within you. 

The loneliness, the lower moments, they come and go and it's okay to not be okay. It's a part of the journey as you mentioned. Remember, language is no barrier. Your feelings are valid and you're doing a great job to communicate them here. 

It's great that small conversations are bringing you happiness. Focus on those moments, those bright spots, and carry them forward with you. 

It can indeed be intimidating to see a psychiatrist, but trying to think about scheduling an appointment or preparing yourself mentally to see one is a start. Switching medications is a serious decision and it's important to consult with a professional about it. Whenever you're ready, just let the fear sit aside and try to remind yourself of the help you may receive post visit. 

Most importantly, recognize the progress you have made. Your sadness score has decreased from last week, that's a win! Celebrate these small victories. Lastly, remember it's okay to sit with the sadness, as long as you remember to not let it consume you.

Stay strong and keep moving forward at your own pace. You're doing great!"

Encouraging to see your resilience through this difficult time. Remember, healing is not an overnight process, but instead is a journey. It's great to see you clarifying your feelings and acknowledging the pain. It's also heartening to see that your sadness scale has decreased from last week. 

Engaging in good conversations is truly beneficial. Continue to have those if possible, and don't be hard on yourself for feeling alone, your language skills are actually very good!

It's okay to be scared to see your psychiatrist, but remember, they are there to help. If you feel you need to change your medication, that could be a significant step towards feeling better. Take it one step at a time, write down what you'd want to communicate during the session. It will help you articulate your feelings better.

Lastly, don't forget to practice self-care. Warm baths, a good book, or even a simple walk can do wonders. And please, reach out when you're in distress – there are people ready to help. You're stronger than you know."

First and foremost, congratulations on the progress you've made! Going from a 9/10 to a 4/10 in terms of sadness is not a small achievement. Your journey may not be easy, but every little victory counts — like having a good conversation that brought you joy. 

It's okay to take baby steps. Change doesn't happen overnight. Be gentle on yourself and celebrate each small step you take. 

I understand your fear about seeing the psychiatrist – it can be really daunting. But remember, getting professional help is an act of courage and self-care. You have already made progress by acknowledging that you need to change your medications. Maybe the next step is scheduling the appointment. You don't have to go right away – just setting the date can be progress. 

Your English doesn't suck. You're doing a great job expressing yourself. You're not alone in how you're feeling. We're all humans, facing the world the best way we can. Be patient with yourself. Keep reaching out. You're stronger than you think.

Always here to lend an ear. Feel free to reach out anytime!"

Firstly, thank you for sharing your experience. It's great to see you taking one step at a time and also recognizing small victories. It's okay to have days like these and cut yourself some slack. Sleep patterns tend to disrupt during stressful times, you can try some relaxation techniques before bed, such as deep breathing exercises or positive visualization.

The glimmers of positivity in your post show a lot of resilience. You are clearly making an effort to adjust your perspective, and that's a very important part of the process. Please remember that healing and getting better is not linear.

Isolation can make these feelings worse sometimes, try reaching out to a friend or a loved one - it's so important to have a support system in these times. 

Dealing with a mental health professional can indeed be scary. But remember, they are there to help and assist you. You deciding to think about taking this step is a big accomplishment in itself. 

Please continue rating your sadness — you're making progress. A 4/10 is a step forward from 9/10. Take one day at a time and remember it's okay to be where you are. 

Bear in mind, this too shall pass. We're here for you on this journey. Keep going.

"[32y/o, black female] -- I have no friends aside from one from primary school who I infrequently catch up with. I really just find most people not to be worth talking to, as I find it hard to connect with many people due to my lack of shared interests and my social anxiety.

However, I often feel lonely and kinda sad especially when I see people who are having a good time with their friends.

I did actually have a weird experience making a friend just recently though, but he's way older than me so it's a bit weird to hang out in person. I noticed he had an interest in something I really liked, and we had this great chat for about 10 minutes. It flowed so smoothly, and it was super passionate. We still message each other every couple of days.

Can anyone else relate to this?"	"Absolutely, it's completely normal to feel this way and you're definitely not alone. It can be difficult to navigate social situations when we feel out of step with the people around us. Anxiety can certainly exacerbate that feeling of isolation, making it more challenging to connect with others. I'd like to offer a few thoughts that might be helpful for you. 

First, it's great that you're reaching out and sharing your feelings - that's a big step towards understanding what you're going through. Don't be too hard on yourself if you're not instantly clicking with everyone you meet - genuine connections take time to build. 

Remember, it's the quality of friendships, not the quantity that truly matter. You seem to have established a good connection with your new friend, and it's perfectly okay if he is older. Age doesn't determine the strength or validity of a friendship. 

Lastly, it could be beneficial to consider seeking assistance from a mental health professional to help manage your feelings of anxiety and loneliness. They can provide strategies and coping mechanisms to handle these feelings. There are also online communities and support groups available where you can connect with people who feel the same way or have gone through a similar situation.

Feel free to reach out anytime you need someone to talk to. This is a supportive community and we are here for you."

"Hey there, it sounds like you're in a bit of a tough spot-- dealing with loneliness is hard, especially when it's harder for you to connect with others due to differences in interests and social anxiety. Remember, it's perfectly okay not to have a large group of friends. Quality is far more important than quantity in friendships.

You mentioned making a new friend recently, which is wonderful! Although he's much older, if you share common interests and enjoy your interactions, age shouldn't be a barrier. Friendship transcends age after all, and it's great to have a diverse range of friends. 

Have you tried looking into communities or meetups tailored to your interests? It's possible you could find more people there who you share common ground with. Additionally, if you feel comfortable, you might want to consider seeing a therapist to help manage your social anxiety. There are also online communities that offer support for various mental health challenges.

Remember, there's no singular roadmap to making friends, and each person's journey is unique. You're not alone in your struggles. Stay strong and be open to new possibilities!"

Building strong, meaningful friendships takes time and not every interaction necessarily has to turn into a lifelong connection. 

Your relationship with your older friend sounds lovely. Sometimes, shared interests create deep bonds that exceed differences in age. There’s no set guideline for who you should or shouldn't be friends with. All that really matters is you both enjoy and respect each other’s company.

The loneliness you're feeling is completely natural. Social media often paints a picture that everyone is constantly surrounded by friends, which can intensify feelings of loneliness. But remember, it's just a highlight reel. Everyone feels lonely sometimes, and it's okay to feel this way. 

Connecting with people via shared interests could be a good starting point. Maybe you could look for local groups or online communities related to things that you enjoy? This could increase your chance of meeting like-minded people. Joining a course, club, or group related to your hobbies could also help.

Remember, it’s perfectly okay to take small steps. Dealing with social anxiety is not easy, but every interaction can gradually build your confidence. Reach out to your older friend or even your primary school friend when you're up for a chat. It's okay to lean on the friends you have while you navigate this journey.

Take care, and reach out any time you need support. We're here for you."

Meeting new friends sometimes does involve stepping outside of our comfort zones. It might sound challenging, but you've already taken a big step by connecting with someone older. Through him, you may be introduced to more people sharing the same interests as you do. 

To tackle social anxiety, professional help can really be beneficial, like cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), if you haven't tried it already. Cognitive-behavioral therapists specialize in helping us to revise these negative patterns that we've built up over time.

And lastly, keep seeking connections online, even if it's just to chat about shared interests. You never know where these relationships might lead!---- best of luck. You've got this!"

Social anxiety can often create a barrier to forming connections with new people but as you experienced with the person who shares your interest, that barrier can be bypassed with common grounds. 

That friend is a stepping stone, it's easier to make new friends after you already have one, even if they're significantly older than you. So don't worry about the age difference, friendships can form regardless of it.

Also, don't worry about not having many friends. Quality will always be better than quantity. It's okay to be selective about who you want for company, everyone's social needs are different. It's also completely acceptable to enjoy being alone.

If you feel lonely and sad though, consider joining offline or online groups that share your interests. This may provide a good environment for you to exchange thoughts and experiences leisurely. Keep taking steps, however tiny, to gradually overcome your loneliness and address your social anxiety.

Remember, it's okay to seek help when you need it. Talk about your feelings with a professional if you think it will help. We're all here cheering you on!"

I can definitely relate to you as I've also struggled with social anxiety in the past, and also had difficulties finding people with shared interests. It can be a lonely path, but remember that you are never alone.

Let's talk about your latest friend—a shared interest is a wonderful way to connect. I think there's no harm in having friends of different age groups as long as you both respect each other and feel comfortable. You need not hang out in person if it doesn't feel right, but continuing to communicate online or through messages can be quite beneficial.

Now, about expanding your circle: it might be worthwhile to explore more online forums, groups, etc. revolving around your interests. Be it an online book club, photography forum, fitness group, or even a course on a subject you love, it could open doors to meet like-minded individuals. You could also try volunteering in your community where you're bound to meet various people, and it's often easier to connect when you're doing something meaningful together. You're doing great, just take it a step at a time."

Firstly, I want to acknowledge your feelings of loneliness and occasional sadness - they're perfectly valid. Many of us can relate to what you're going through, so you're certainly not alone in this. 

Having social anxiety can indeed make things difficult when forming new connections or maintaining existing ones. There's no shame in taking baby steps to challenge this anxiety. Being open about your feelings, like you've just done here, is already a great first step. 

I'd like to focus on what you mentioned about your recent friendly interaction. It sounds like a really fantastic experience! Shared passions can form strong, lasting bonds. And if both of you are comfortable with the age gap, then it doesn't have to be a barrier to a great friendship. 

I would encourage you to put yourself out there more and try to find groups, both online and offline, that share your interests. That's a great way to connect with people authentically. Along with this, consider seeking out mental health professionals who can provide strategies to help manage your social anxiety. Take care!"

Can anyone else relate to this?"	"Hi there,

First off, thank you for sharing your feelings with such honesty and clarity - that’s the first step towards finding solutions and it's not an easy one. I believe many can relate to what you're experiencing right now.

Isolation can sometimes stem from feeling too different than the rest, or from having unique interests. However, these 'differences' are what make us special and can actually help us to forge meaningful connections if we allow ourselves to embrace them.  It's okay to find it hard to connect with most people - not everyone in our lives is meant to be a close friend. It's more about quality rather than quantity in friendships.

Reaching out on this forum already shows you're making amazing strides to conquer your social anxiety. As for the older new friend, age doesn't define the depth of a friendship. If you feel comfortable messaging each other and share common interests, then that's a good connection. You could try having more such conversations with people of varied age groups, backgrounds etc. on online forums, as it would offer a sense of anonymity while helping you build your confidence in social interactions. 

Remember, it's okay to take small steps and not rush the process. It's better to form a strong bond with a few people over time rather than forcing a connection.

More power to you!"

It's not uncommon at all to find it hard to make friends due to differences in interests and social anxieties. But remember, everyone has their own pace. It's great to hear about your experience of making a new friend, regardless of the age difference. Connecting with people based on shared interests is a great start!

If you're finding it tricky to meet new people, perhaps you could seek out events or groups that align with your interests. For example, if you're into books, joining a book club might be a good idea. It will give you a platform to interact with people who share your hobby and it can potentially lead to friendships.

Even online communities could be a good start. A lot of people find solace in online friendships, plus it's great for overcoming social anxiety as you can speak your mind without worry. 

For dealing with the feelings of loneliness, it may help to engage in activities which lift your mood and explore some self-care routines. Also, please remember, it's always okay to seek professional advice if feelings of sadness and loneliness continue to persist. Be gentle with yourself and take care."

First, I want you to know how honestly brave it is to talk about your feelings so openly. It's okay to feel lonely and to have a challenging time building relationships. It’s a common struggle that many people face-- and your feelings are completely valid.

Could it be possible that many people might share your interests but you just haven't found each other yet? It can often take just one common interest to spark a connection, much like you described with the older friend you've made recently. Even if it feels a bit weird because of the age difference, that connection is still pretty valuable.

Try not to worry too much about not having a lot of friends. It's not about quantity, but the quality of the relationships that you have. Trust me, having a single understanding friend can sometimes be much better than having a lot of superficial companions.

Consider finding communities both online and offline that indulge in your interests. You may be able to develop more meaningful connections there. 

Lastly, know that social anxiety is something that you can work on; there are coping mechanisms and resources to help. You aren't alone in this. It's always okay to seek professional help if you feel your situation isn't improving. 

Remember, it’s absolutely okay to be yourself. Continue to cultivate your unique interests, and before you know it, you might find folks who relate to your experiences and share those interests! Keep faith in yourself.
