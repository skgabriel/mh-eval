I live with my parents, who have no idea how bad my depression is. They think my room is messy because I'm lazy, but in reality, I just don't have the strength to clean it, especially as a 32yo wearing my natural hair, which somehow makes me feel even more disconnected from the world around me. I also suffer with sensory issues which makes cleaning harder. My room isn't even messy anymore; it's filthy. I mostly struggle with managing my bin, which has resulted in a rat infestation in my room. My parents don't know, and I'm scared to tell them in case they get mad. But I don't know how to fix it on my own, especially since I don't do well with things like that. Unfortunately, I need to get my room clean in a week and I just don't know what to do. I've always struggled with cleaning but my depression has made everything so much harder, so I'm very worried that it won't get done in time. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.	"Hello Friend,

I understand how overwhelming this can be and I really appreciate how brave you are for seeking help. It seems like you're dealing with a lot right now. Firstly, you might like to consider opening up about your mental health to your parents or someone you trust, provided you feel safe and comfortable in doing so. Sometimes sharing your burden can make it a tad bit lighter.

Regarding your room, you might consider breaking down the tasks into smaller, manageable bits. For example, you could first focus on getting rid of the rubbish, one bag at a time. It may not seem like much, but trust me, every small step counts.

Also, getting rid of the rats is important and necessary. There are a number of methods for doing so or you can potentially ask someone else to do it for you - whether that's a friend or a professional pest control service. Please remember that your health and wellbeing are priorities.

Lastly, perhaps using motivational techniques might be helpful. Like rewarding yourself after every bit of progress you've made. For example, taking a break to do something you enjoy after clearing out a part of your room.

Also, please remember to reach out to a mental health professional if you aren't already. You don't have to go through this alone.

You're stronger than you realize and I believe in you. You've taken the first step by admitting that there's a problem. And that's huge. You're not alone. Please keep us updated on your progress, however small it may be."

In terms of practical advice for your current situation, here's a simple step by step suggestion: 

1. Acknowledge that this is a hard task for you and that’s ok. Don’t beat yourself up over it. 

2. Remember, you're not alone. Seek out help from friends or family to assist with cleaning efforts.

3. You could consider hiring pest control to deal with the rat infestation. There might be local services that can help, even on a low budget. 

4. Cleaning can be overwhelming when you look at it as one giant task. Try breaking it down into smaller, manageable tasks. Start with one corner of your room, one drawer, or even just the bed. 

5. Do some minor tasks. Even just taking out the rubbish or washing a cup can make you feel like you've accomplished something. 

6. Consider using earplugs or listening to calming music to help with your sensory issues while cleaning. 

Most importantly, please reach out to a mental health professional about your depression. It’s a big step to even acknowledge it, and it might be scary, but it’s the path to start feeling better."

"Hi there,

First, I just want to say it's brave of you to openly discuss your mental health struggle and seek help. You aren't alone, and it's okay to have bad days or weeks, or months. 

In terms of cleaning your room within a week, here are few manageable steps you could take:

1. **Do it bits by bits**: Cleaning all at once can be spiraling, but doing a little every day could make a big difference by the end of a week. 

2. **Take it Zone by Zone**: Divide your room into zones and clean each zone on a different day. It might help to take it one task at a time like - clothes first, then bed sheets, then your desk, etc.

3. **Involve someone you trust**: Can you ask a close friend for help? They might not only assist with the cleaning but also provide emotional support during this time. 

4. **Professional Cleaning**: This might be a good time to consider hiring some professional cleaning/ pest control services. To prepare for that, you could just pack everything you want to keep in boxes and let the professionals handle the rest. 

5. **Professional Help**: Finally and most importantly, please consider seeking professional help for your mental health. Maybe look for local resources, adressed to provide mental health support and therapy. 

Remember, it’s okay to have these feelings and it's okay to ask for help. There are many people out there, professionals and friends alike, who care about you and want to help you feel better. You're not alone in this. 

Take care."

"I'm really sorry to hear about the difficult situation you're going through. Dealing with depression is hard enough without added challenges like a messy room and a rat infestation. However, remember, it's okay to ask for help, and there are solutions to your problems.

Firstly, I strongly suggest confiding in your parents about your struggles if you feel comfortable to do so. Understanding your situation might facilitate their cooperation and support. If you can't broach the subject in person, consider writing a letter expressing your situation.

As a temporary solution for the rat problem, you might hire a pest control service. If the costs are prohibitive, you could DIY with humane rat traps. Wearing gloves and a mask when dealing with waste might minimize your sensory reactions.

To tackle your room littler by littler, try dividing the space into small manageable areas and plan on cleaning one patch a day, a small step at a time. It can be as simple as picking up three things off the floor. Remember, you don't have to do everything at once!

Importantly, seek professional help for your depression if you haven't yet. Certain therapists specialize in chronic disorganization and compulsive hoarding. Also, consider joining support groups online as these communities can be surprisingly motivating and helpful.

You're not alone, and you don't have to face these challenges by yourself! Tomorrow is a new day, with new possibilities."

"Hi there,

First, let me commend you for reaching out and sharing your struggle. It requires a lot of courage. It sounds like you're dealing with a lot right now. 

Let's try break this down into achievable steps. Firstly, dealing with the rats is a health hazard and needs primary focus. You might not feel comfortable doing it yourself and that's okay. There are professionals who are trained to handle these situations. Look for professional pest control services in your area - many offer discrete services so it wouldn't necessarily draw attention.

Secondly, no matter how tough it is, confiding in someone you trust can be really beneficial. Your parents might be more understanding than you're anticipating if they know the full situation. It's okay if you don't want to share every detail of your struggle with them, but letting them know you're having a tougher time than usual could open up an avenue for you to receive some help.

Regarding cleaning, one technique might be to try and clean a little bit at a time. Start with five or ten minute sessions if you need to and gradually increase over time. Another option is to look into professional cleaning services, which could get the job done efficiently and relieve a bit of your stress. 

While this advice tackles immediate concerns, it's also really important to look after your mental health in the long term. Reach out to a healthcare professional who can guide you towards the right path. Many offer tele-consultation these days, so you can do it from your room if you're more comfortable that way.

Hang in there. It's okay to ask for help, and it's okay to need it. You're valued and there are people who want to support you. Everyone has their struggles and it's okay to not be okay. Let us know how it's going and how we can continue to support you."

"Hello,

Firstly, let me applaud your courage in reaching out and expressing your feelings so eloquently on such a public platform. It takes a brave individual to do that. Secondly, I want to remind you that you're not alone in your battle with depression or the struggles you're experiencing; there are many people who are on a similar journey and we're in this together. Now, let's tackle the issue at hand.

What you're describing sounds like an overwhelming task, but with small steps, you can surely overcome it. Let's start by breaking it down. If it's possible, reach out to a pest control company to take care of the rat problem. They are professionals in dealing with such situations discreetly and would ensure your health and safety.

Next, take on the cleaning in stages. You don't have to do it all at once but break it into manageable tasks. For instance, you could start with one corner of the room or one category of items - perhaps clothes or books. Remember, it's okay to take breaks in between to rest and recharge. 

Regarding your parents, while I understand how you're afraid of their reaction, remember they are your family, and they might be more understanding if they know about your struggles. If you find it hard to tell them in person, perhaps you could write them a letter, explaining everything and how you're feeling. 

Have you considered reaching out to a therapist or counselor about your experience with depression? There are many mental health services available, including tele-health consultations if you're worried about leaving your house.

Most importantly, please take care of yourself. Try to do small things that reassure you or bring you comfort whenever you can. Remember, reaching out for help is the first step, and you've already done that successfully. You're stronger than you realize!

Take good care,
(Your Name)"

"Hey there, I'm really sorry to hear you're feeling so overwhelmed, it can indeed be extremely difficult to manage cleanliness when you're dealing with depression. Firstly, know that it's really brave of you to ask for help and I would like to encourage you to share your feelings with your parents - they might be more understanding than you expect.

As for cleaning your room, maybe you can break it down into smaller tasks and tackle one area at a time. You might start with picking up the trash and putting it outside, then washing bedding, and so on.

When it comes to the rats, professionals would be the best route, but if that's not an option, you could buy traps from your local store - wearing gloves could help with your sensory issues and the cleanliness factor. You could set the traps, then leave the room for a bit. But do not forget to deal with the pests, for health reasons primarily.

For the broader issue of your mental health, please consider seeking professional help if possible. Therapy can be very beneficial for managing depression. There are also numerous online resources available that can help you understand and manage your feelings. It's really important to remember that you're not alone, and there are people and organizations out there who want to support you.

Try to take things one step at a time and celebrate small victories when you can. You can do this. I'm sending you best wishes for your journey ahead."

Firstly, I just want to say how brave you are for recognizing what you're going through and seeking help for it. It's not easy to deal with depression, sensory issues, and trying to handle a situation like this on your own. Remember, it's okay to ask for help.

Step one could be reaching out to pest control services. This will not only help get rid of the rats but could also give a fresh start to the cleaning process. As a rule, when there's much to do, break it down into small tasks. You don't have to clean your entire room in one day. Maybe spend some minutes on it each day, or divide the room into sections and tackle one section per day.

Reach out to some close friends. Let them know what you are going through. They might be more understanding and supportive than you think. Maybe they can help you clean, or keep you company while you do it, making the task more bearable.

Also, consider seeking professional help for your depression. Therapists and counselors are trained to help you manage it. If you are not in a position to access professional help, here on the internet there are resources and people who can share their experiences and ideas with you.

Above all, try to remember: it's okay to feel the way you do, but don't have to face it all alone. There are people ready to help when you reach out.

Keep going, and take care!"
My dad just died and my mom wants me to hang out with her all the time. I've never liked doing casual things with her, and I'm very independent. As a 32yo wearing my natural hair, I value my individuality and space even more. I don't know how to tell her to leave me alone. The best relationship we ever had was when I lived in another state. I moved back because of my dad, but now he's gone. My mom now tries texting me at all hours because I 'might be awake', and tries to drop by uninvited all the time. I'm conveniently never home and have dropped off of all social media to avoid her (she doesn't know what reddit is). Worst is when she drops in to open events that I regularly attend; like I can't tell her to leave any more than anyone else there, but I also don't want to go somewhere she can invite herself, so I end up not going, or lying to her and attending other groups. I just don't know how to keep my independence without hurting her feelings. I get that she's lonely, but I don't want to be her go-to person. Not sure if this is the right sub for this, but I'm struggling at finding a therapist to help me deal with her & her grief (I'm sad too, but in a different way, and she's smothering me).	"First and foremost, I am sorry for your loss. It sounds like you're trying to navigate your own grief while also managing your mother's, and that's a heavy burden. Grief is unique to everyone and the fact that you're feeling differently from your mom doesn't take away your right to process this loss in your own way.

Regarding your mother, it's clear that she's coping with her grief in her own way, which may not be in alignment with your needs and that can be tough. She probably sees you as her closest source of support. Perhaps it would help to have an open conversation with her about your feelings. Make sure to reassure her that you do care and understand she's lonely, but that you need some space to work through your own grief. Framing it in a way where it's not about your relationship with her per se, but more about your own healing journey, might help.

You also mentioned about not finding a therapist, please don't give up. There are many resources available online that can connect you with suitable professionals. It's important during a time like this to have someone neutral to talk to about your feelings.

Lastly, is there anyone else in the family or close to your mom who could provide some of this emotional support to her? Sharing this load might give you the space you need, while ensuring she still has someone to lean on.

Take care of yourself and remember, it's okay to put your mental health first."

"I'm really sorry to hear about the tough situation you're experiencing right now. It's certainly a challenge dealing with the loss of a close family member, and in this instance, the added complexity of your relationship with your mom makes it even harder. 

Setting boundaries is essential, especially for your mental health and wellbeing. Your feelings are valid, and there is nothing wrong in wanting to have your independent life. 

Here's something I suggest you might try. Could you sit down with your mom at a time when both of you are calm and collected, and have an open conversation about your feelings? It's not about telling her to go away, but about communicating the need for personal space and boundaries. You might say, ""Mom, I love and care for you, and I understand you are going through a tough time, but I also need my space to deal with things on my own and to maintain my sense of self. It would really help me if we could maybe schedule our interactions, like having a designated dinner or call once or twice a week"". 

It's also crucial to develop a support system for her outside of you. Encouraging her to engage in her personal interests, joining clubs, or even seeing a counselor could help reduce her dependency on you.

Lastly, don't give up on finding the right therapist. It takes time to find a match that really aligns with what you need, but when you find one, it can make a big difference. You could also consider joining a support group for people facing similar issues. They might offer some strategies or new perspectives that could be helpful.

Remember, it’s okay not to have all the answers and to feel overwhelmed. It's a tough situation, but you're not alone. Take care of yourself alongside caring for your mom."

It sounds like you're dealing with a lot right now, and I'm so sorry to hear about your loss. It's important to remember that everyone manages their grief differently and unfortunately, it can cause friction in relationships. It's clear that you care about your mother's feelings, despite feeling overwhelmed by her need for company.

One thing to consider is setting respectful but firm boundaries with her. For example, if you don't want her to text anytime, you could clearly communicate specific hours during which she can contact you. Emphasize that you need to maintain your personal space to process your loss and deal with other aspects of your life. 

If she feels hurt, remind her that it's not about not wanting her around, but about you needing to deal with your grief and manage your life in the way that works best for you. Perhaps suggest other forms of support for her such as joining a support group for people who have lost their partners. 

Another thing that could be helpful is giving her tasks or roles that she can do independently but feel connected to you. This can be anything from simply maintaining her garden, engaging in a hobby she likes or volunteering. It might give her something to keep busy with, thus reducing her loneliness and the intensity of her grief. 

Finding a therapist can be indeed be hard, but it's so worthwhile when you do. You could try a local mental health hotline or website that has resources for finding one in your area. It will be highly beneficial for you to work through your feelings. 

Remember, this is a journey, and there will be good days and bad. It’s okay to assert your boundaries and care for yourself amidst this difficult time. Hope things get better for you soon.

Take care."

"I'm really sorry to hear what you're going through. It sounds like you're dealing with some tough emotions and difficult family dynamics. Based on what you've explained, it seems your mother is also going through a challenging time, trying to cope with her own grief and loss. It's difficult when the manner someone seeks support impacts us negatively, but remember, it's okay to establish boundaries. 

You might find it beneficial to have an open and honest conversation with your mom about what you're feeling. You can express to her that you're there for her, but having time alone is also important for your own mental health. It could also be beneficial for your mother to have an outlet or engage in activities with other people outside of her relationship with you, such as joining a support group or spending time with friends. 

As for your personal healing, do remember that seeking professional help can be invaluable, and it's ok to take some time finding a therapist that matches your needs. You're not alone. It's understandable that your mom's way to coping makes you feel overwhelmed. Just remember, it's okay to prioritize your own mental health too. It’s not a sign of selfishness or insensitivity, but an act of self-care."

Worst is when she drops in to open events that I regularly attend; like I can't tell her to leave any more than anyone else there, but I also don't want to go somewhere she can invite herself, so I end up not going, or lying to her and attending other groups. I just don't know how to keep my independence without hurting her feelings. I get that she's lonely, but I don't want to be her go-to person. Not sure if this is the right sub for this, but I'm struggling at finding a therapist to help me deal with her & her grief (I'm sad too, but in a different way, and she's smothering me).	"I'm really sorry to hear about everything you're going through right now. The passing of a loved one always brings profound sadness and many changes. It is essential that you allow yourself ample time and space to process your own grief. As for your relationship with your mother, it seems like a delicate situation to navigate but remember, your feelings matter too. 

One suggestion for addressing this issue could be to have an open, honest discussion with your mom about your feelings and needs during this challenging time. Be sure to use non-accusatory language such as ""I feel..."" instead of ""You make me feel..."", this will help to avoid making her defensive and more open to what you have to say. 

You might say something like, ""Mom, I love that we have each other, especially at a time like this, but I also need my own space to grieve and process dad's death. So I'm requesting that we reach a compromise on how often and when we should interact."" 

She might not fully understand, connected, or even respond positively at first, but give her time to adjust. Remember, everyone processes grief differently and she might be leaning on you more largely due to her own grieving process.

Again, it's very important that you find a professional therapist to talk to. While it might be a struggle to find one at the moment, don't give up. Having someone neutral to talk to can make a world of difference. Be gentle with yourself during this difficult time and remember, it's okay to ask for the space you need."
My dad just died and my mom wants me to hang out with her all the time. I've never liked doing casual things with her, and I'm very independent. As a 32yo wearing my natural hair, I value my individuality and space even more. I don't know how to tell her to leave me alone. The best relationship we ever had was when I lived in another state. I moved back because of my dad, but now he's gone. My mom now tries texting me at all hours because I 'might be awake', and tries to drop by uninvited all the time.

"I'm sorry to hear about your father, and the difficult position you're in with your mother. This is a tough situation and it's completely understandable that you're feeling overwhelmed. Losing a loved one is a surreal and challenging process for anyone.

Individuality and personal space are essential aspects of life and should be respected by your family, including your mom. However, it's crucial to approach this communication with empathy, considering that she too is dealing with grief and possibly even the fear of losing her connection with you.

Could you gently express how you're feeling to your mom? It's possible that she's unaware of how her actions are affecting you. Clear communication is essential here. Let her know how much you appreciate her love and concern, but also need your space as part of your grieving process. Suggest some other ways she could seek out companionship, like volunteering, clubs or support groups.

Also, continue the search for your own therapist. They can provide tools to help you cope with your grief, as well as strategies for setting boundaries in a compassionate and caring manner. Remember, it's okay to prioritize your mental health. You getting the support you need is just as important as her receiving hers. 

Wishing you strength and clarity in this difficult time."

"Sorry to hear about your situation. It's essential to establish boundaries with your mom, especially as you value your independence. Grief can make us act in ways we don't usually behave, and it seems like your mom is trying to cope by leaning heavily on you for emotional support. It's okay to sympathize with her sadness, but you're not obligated to sacrifice your wellbeing.

First, have an open conversation with her. Explain your need for space and emphasize that it isn't about pushing her away but about maintaining your own emotional health. Try using ""I statements"" to communicate how you feel. For instance, ""I understand you want to be close, but I need some time alone to process everything.""

Next, possibly suggest something like a standing weekly dinner that you both can prepare for so it’s not so spontaneous and your mom still gets some dedicated time with you.

You might also want to help her expand her social circle. Are there bereavement groups or hobbies she could get involved in? Having other people to share her feelings with might give her the emotional support she needs and help her understand that she doesn't only have to lean on you.

And lastly, seeking professional help will be beneficial to both of you. Perhaps you could encourage her to see a therapist too, if she hasn't already. This way you both can have a neutral party to share your feelings with."

"First of all, your feelings of wanting to maintain your independence while dealing with the loss of your father are completely valid. Grief is a unique and personal process, varying from person to person. Let me assure you that there is no right or wrong way to grieve.

Your mother’s increased need for your company can be a part of her way of coping with the loss. Understanding this is key to dealing with her actions. However, it is also key to understand that you are not solely responsible for managing her grief. While it’s important to show understanding and patience during this delicate time, it’s also crucial that you express your need for space.

Consider reaching out to your mother to say you that love her, but you also need time to process your grief in your own way. You can do so in a loving but assertive manner. It is also acceptable to suggest that she lean on others for support as well. If there are friends or other family members who could provide her company, perhaps you could encourage her to engage with them.

Being consistently honest about your unavailability can help set boundaries. Try establishing set times to communicate or meet, so that she doesn’t feel neglected, but you retain your necessary space and freedom.

Take some time and seek therapy for yourself. Many therapists offer virtual sessions, which might make the process of finding someone easier. You can explore forums and support groups too for help and guidance. And remember, it is okay to prioritize your mental health above others when it comes to preventing burnout and cultivating healthy relationships."

"Hey there, 

I'm truly sorry to hear about the situation you're in - losing a parent is one of the toughest things to go through and it's made even harder by these additional challenges you're facing with your mom. First off, you are not alone in this. Your feelings are valid and you're allowed to need space. 

Having boundaries is incredibly important, and it's not wrong to value your independence. This time is tough for both you and your mom, but it's paradoxically the best time to have a conversation about this. Start by asserting that you have been grieving as well, and your way of healing and processing is through solitude. Clearly express your need for space and independence. 

Maybe recommend her to join some community groups or engage in activities she enjoys, that could also help lessen the constant attention on you. A healthy relationship needs balance; you can be there for her without having to sacrifice your own peace of mind.

In regards to a therapist, I suggest you broaden your search, or perhaps use online therapy platforms during this time, as it can be a beneficial way to find the support you need.

Remember to take care of yourself. It's okay to prioritize your mental health and wellbeing. Good luck, and here's to brighter days.

Peace,

"Hey there, I'm really sorry to hear about the loss of your dad and the difficult circumstances that have followed. It definitely sounds like your mom is leaning on you for emotional support, but it's crucial to remember that you should prioritize self-care too. 

Your feelings are valid as everyone has their own boundaries, and it’s important for those to be respected. It's complicated when emotions and grief are involved but having boundaries doesn’t make you a bad person or any less sympathetic to your mom's grief. 

Consider having a direct conversation where you express how you feel and suggest alternative ways she can seek support. There are therapy groups, online forums, and hotlines available for people coping with loss. Encourage her to reach out to her friends and other family members as well. 

It might benefit you as well to seek professional help. Even if you feel you're dealing with your loss in a different way, counseling can be hugely beneficial in times of grief. Make sure you’re taking time for yourself to process your own emotions, even while you’re trying to help your mom. Hang in there, you're doing the best you can."
I have intense separation anxiety when I’m away from my partner. And every time I leave them I begin to cry a lot. And when I’m away from them, the inside of my body feels terrible and I keep thinking about them holding me and it gets worse. Being a 32yo wearing my natural hair, I feel this deepened sense of vulnerability. I have very strong emotions and I don’t really know how to process/handle them. Does any one have any tips?	"First off, thank you for your courage in opening up about what you're experiencing. Separation anxiety can be very debilitating, but remember, it's okay to seek help and share what you're feeling. You're not alone in this and it's completely normal to feel the way you do.

If possible, try to find a professional therapist who specializes in anxiety issues. They can guide you with effective strategies to handle your feelings. In the meantime, focus on practicing self-love and self-care. It could be helpful to set a regular routine where you have time for yourself: reading, exercising or even just walking. 

Engaging in activities you love and enjoy may also help, and keep your mind from focusing solely on thoughts of being away from your partner. Meditation and deep-breathing exercises may assist in calming your mind and reducing your anxiety. 

Consider talking to your partner about your feelings, if you haven't already. Open communication can do wonders and provide an opportunity for understanding and support. 

Please remember, it's okay to ask for help, and it's admirable that you've taken the first step. Hold on, be patient with yourself, and take one day at a time. You're already headed in the right direction, just by reaching out."

"Hello there.

I'm so sorry to hear that you're experiencing such a severe level of separation anxiety. It must be incredibly challenging to feel this way, and I want you to know that it's okay to feel these things and to seek support.

Firstly, please consider reaching out to a mental health professional if you haven't already. There's no substitute for the dedicated support they can provide and they can help develop coping strategies catered to your specific situation.

In the meantime, here are a few tips from my personal experience that might be helpful. Note that everyone is different and what works for one person might not work for another.

Practice self-soothing techniques such as deep breathing, mindfulness, and meditation. These can help to ground you in moments of intense anxiety.

Prepare for periods of separation in advance with activities you enjoy. Reading a favorite book, picking up a new hobby, or relaxing with a movie can distract from the sense of missing your partner.

As per your hair, embracing your natural hair can be a journey of self-discovery and empowerment. It does come with its unique struggles but remember you're not alone. Connect with communities that share hair care tips, encouragement, and solidarity.

Expressing your emotions is also key, no matter how intense they may be. Writing in a journal, talking to a friend or family member, or even speaking to a professional counselor will provide you an outlet.

Remember it's okay to seek help and you should not have to face this alone – everyone needs a helping hand at times. Keep reminding yourself of your strengths and the progress you make, no matter how small it may seem.

Take care, sending you warmth and positive vibes. Stay strong!"

"Hey there, thank you for sharing what you're going through. It's brave to reach out and seek help when you're feeling this way. It sounds like you're experiencing a great deal of emotional intensity that's difficult to handle alone. 

One way to help manage these feelings is by practising mindfulness techniques. This involves grounding yourself in the present moment, which can help distract from recurring thoughts about your partner. This could be anything from noticing the sensation of your breath, to observing the objects around you in detail.

Another option is to start journaling your feelings. Writing can be a potent form of self-therapy, as it can work as an outlet to express these intense emotions. Moreover, it can aid in self-reflection and understanding the root cause of these feelings.

Don't hesitate to seek professional assistance if the situation doesn't seem to improve, or get more difficult to manage. Those professionals are trained to handle these situations and can give you advice tailored to your condition.

Most importantly, remember, you're not alone. There are people who care for you and want to help. It's okay to reach out to them as well."

"Hi there, I'm really sorry to hear that you're experiencing such severe separation anxiety. It's important to remember that it's perfectly okay to have strong feelings and it's clear that you care deeply for your partner, which speaks so much to your capacity to love and empathize. 

One suggestion might be to carry around a token or small item that reminds you of your partner. This could be a photo or an item of theirs. The comfort this can bring can be comparable to them holding you. 

Another approach can be mindfulness and meditation. Try to focus on your breathing, and remind yourself that you're in control of your own emotions. It may not be easy, but with practice, you can hone this skill. 

There are also support groups where individuals dealing with similar feelings can share their experiences and coping mechanisms. 

Professional help from a therapist or counselor can also be extremely beneficial. They can provide strategies and relaxation technique to help manage your separation anxiety. Remember, you don't have to handle this all on your own."

"Hey there, it sounds like you're going through a pretty tough time, and that must be really hard for you. You're so brave for sharing your struggle, and I commend you for reaching out. Separation anxiety can definitely be challenging and overwhelming.

One technique that can be beneficial is grounding, which can help you stay connected to the present and not get too caught up in your thoughts or anxiety. You can try this by focusing on something physical - like the feeling of your feet on the ground, or the texture of something in your hands. 

Exercise also can help in producing calming hormones and keeps your mind active, thus reducing the frailty caused by emotional disturbance. 

You mentioned that you don't know how to handle your strong emotions. One approach can be trying mindfulness meditation, which teaches you how to be present in the moment and can reduce anxiety and help you manage strong emotions.

Obviously, everyone is different, so what works for one person might not work for another, but there's no harm in trying, right? Additionally, look into professional help like therapy. A therapist can provide you with effective coping mechanisms specifically for your situation. 

Remember, you are not alone in this. Stay strong and positive. Stay connected with friends and family, they can provide a meaningful distraction and emotional support. Wishing you all the best."

In the meantime, it can be beneficial to try and develop personal coping mechanisms. This could involve finding an activity to keep you busy when you're apart from your partner, like reading, working out or pursuing a hobby. This not only distracts your mind, but it also builds your own sense of self outside of your relationship. 

Writing about your feelings in a journal when you're feeling anxious might alleviate some of the emotional weight. It's also important to remember to take care of yourself physically through eating well, getting enough sleep, and exercising regularly. 

Try to keep a regular communication schedule with your partner, but also take steps towards independence. Feel free to share the steps you're taking for your mental health with them, as well. It's not easy, but remember, every little progress is still progress.

I hope you find this helpful and wish you the best on your journey."

Hello there, I'm sorry to hear that you're dealing with such intense emotions tied to being apart from your partner. Please remember, it's okay to feel deeply and it's completely normal to feel vulnerable - this means you care. Try to find activities that keep you self-engaged and distracted from these feelings when you are away from your partner.

Your feelings are valid, and acknowledging them is the first step towards better understanding them.
I’ve been struggling with replying to people on social media, especially people I don’t usually talk to. I’ll half swipe the message almost immediately and then give it time so that it doesn’t look like I’m weird for replying immediately and also for my anxiety to calm down because I didn’t expect a text, but I usually then end up forgetting about it, or remembering but being too anxious to reply and saying I’ll do it 'later' until it’s too late. As a 32yo wearing my natural hair, I wonder if my self-image plays into this anxiety. I don’t have this problem when I’m texting people who I talk to daily or I’m close with, just like acquaintances and stuff. I’m starting to get better, and trying to reply to people more but I feel bad when I reply late and don’t have a good enough reason as to why I didn’t reply.	"Hi friend,

First off, give yourself some credit. Recognizing that this is an issue and trying to change your behavior is a huge step in itself. Here are a few suggestions:

You could try to set aside specific times to reply to messages. This way you might lessen the anxiety associated with unexpected texts, as you know generally when you’ll be responding to them. 

As for the self-image issue, you might find it helpful to confront any insecurities you have head-on, either by yourself or with a counselor. Self-perception plays a huge role in anxiety, especially social anxiety, so addressing that could be quite beneficial.

And remember that each person’s communication style is different, so don’t feel as though you have to conform to a ‘standard’. You're trying to get better and that's what really matters.

Keep pushing through. Everyone is a work in progress, present company included. We all face challenges and have areas where we can grow. Take it one day at a time, one text at a time.

Your experiences are completely valid, and you're certainly not alone in your struggles with replying to people on social media. It sounds like it's more than simply forgetting to reply; your anxiety plays a significant part, too. Acknowledging that is an important first step towards understanding your feelings and how they affect your habits.

First, know that there's no right or wrong speed to reply to messages. If you do reply instantly, it doesn't make you weird. And if you don't reply quickly, it doesn't make you a bad person. What you're comfortable with is most important here.

As for your self-image concern, it's common to tie our perceived attractiveness or acceptability to our confidence levels, especially in social situations. It's okay to wear your natural hair, and it's beautiful in its own right. Your self-worth isn't tied to your appearance, and people who truly care for and respect you will understand that.

Here are a few steps you can consider: First, try explicit self-care actions that boost your self-esteem, such as self-affirmations, regular exercise, or meditation. Second, consider speaking to a therapist or counselor about your social anxiety, they can provide resources and tactics to help manage your stress and potentially overcome your problem with replying promptly. 

Remember, you're on a journey, and progress is slow but sure. Take small steps, and celebrate your wins. You're doing great by at least trying to reply more to people. Keep striving, and be kind to yourself. You got this!"
I’ve been struggling with replying to people on social media, especially people I don’t usually talk to. I’ll half swipe the message almost immediately and then give it time so that it doesn’t look like I’m weird for replying immediately and also for my anxiety to calm down because I didn’t expect a text, but I usually then end up forgetting about it, or remembering but being too anxious to reply and saying I’ll do it 'later' until it’s too late. As a 32yo wearing my natural hair, I wonder if my self-image plays into this anxiety. I don’t have this problem when I’m texting people who I talk to daily or I’m close with, just like acquaintances and stuff. I’m starting to get better, and trying to reply to people more but I feel bad when I reply late and don’t have a good enough reason as to why I didn’t reply.	"Hey there,

It's great to hear that you're taking steps to understand and manage your social media anxiety. Your feelings are very common and quite understandable. Social media can sometimes feel like a high-pressure environment where every move is scrutinized. In regard to your natural hair, it could be that you're unsure of how people perceive you, but remember that you should embrace all parts of your identity and express yourself how you feel most comfortable. 

Remember, how quickly or late you reply to someone doesn't define your worth or value in a conversation. Lots of us aren't glued to our devices, and it's okay to take time to answer messages. Begin by acknowledging your anxiety and try not to judge yourself too harshly for it. This could be an opportunity to practice mindfulness — notice your feelings, let them be, and try not to let them dictate your actions. 

You could also think of setting boundaries. Maybe designate specific times for social media, and stick to them. That way, you might feel less pressure to respond immediately, but won't entirely forget about it either.

Take things at your own pace. It's a journey, not a destination. And finally, always remember it's absolutely okay to take care of yourself and prioritize your own mental wellbeing. We don't owe immediate responses to anyone, especially if it causes undue stress. And if you believe this issue is affecting your quality of life, it might be helpful to speak with a professional therapist. 

Wishing you the best on your journey!"

It's perfectly okay to admit that you have anxiety and relatability issues when it comes to replying to acquaintances on social media, and there's nothing wrong in sharing these feelings. Not everyone is adept at dealing with social situations the same way, and that's what makes us all unique individuals. 

Regarding your prompt replies and anxiety related to that, it might help to remind yourself that there are no strict rules about reply timing. It's all about setting your boundaries and comfort levels. Remember, it's okay to take your time to form a reply, you don't owe anyone an immediate response.

About your self-image, our external image can sometimes play a part in amplifying our insecurities. Yet, just as we are all unique in our approaches to social situations, we are also just as unique in our appearances. Embracing yourself, natural hair and all, is a step towards self-acceptance and assurance. 

Consider seeking professional help on this matter if this persists and interferes with your daily life function. There are many therapists who specialize in social anxiety and self-esteem issues, and they can provide you valuable tools and strategies to approach this concern head-on.

Remember, you're not alone, and reaching out like you are now is indeed a brave step towards getting better!"

Firstly, you're not weird! Anxious feelings about replying to people, particularly those we don't know well, can be common. It's awesome that you have identified this and are actively taking steps to improve. I see self-awareness and proactivity, which are strengths.

Self-image does play a major role in how we interact with others, and it's great that you're embracing your natural self. Embrace yourself, imperfections and all. You could possibly be projecting your own insecurities onto these communications, and that's okay. We all do it sometimes.

Remember, everyone stumbles socially at times, and that doesn't make them think less of the person. The fact that you respond, no matter how late, shows your willingness and effort to stay connected. Perhaps a frank and brief disclaimer about your tendency to delay replies due to anxiety could provide context to the person you're responding to without going into unnecessary detail about it.

It may also be helpful to set aside specific times for dealing with messages. Scheduled response times might ease some of the anxiety and create a sense of control over this aspect of your life.

Remember, change doesn't happen overnight. Celebrate the small victories along the way.

Sending love and support to you. You’ve got this!"

"It sounds like you're dealing with social anxiety, and I'm really proud of you for opening up about it - it's a big step towards improvement. It's perfectly okay to take some time to respond to messages if that's what helps your anxiety. Remember, you don't owe anyone a speedy reply, even in our fast-paced digital world. Your comfort and mental health are paramount.

It seems that your social anxiety is linked to unfamiliarity rather than your self-image, though it's understandable that you might question if they're connected. Try to remember that we all have things about ourselves that we worry will negatively affect how others view us. Yet, you'll find that most people are so caught up in their own anxieties, they barely notice the things we're self-conscious about. 

It's great that you're trying to improve. Remember to be gentle with yourself along the way. You're not required to provide a 'good enough' reason for replying late. It really is enough to say that you needed some time. You're doing your best in navigating this, and that's enough. It's perfectly okay to have anxious moments. When they come, be sure to show yourself the same understanding and kindness you'd show to a friend going through the same thing."

Firstly, I want you to know that your feelings are valid. It's perfectly okay to feel anxious and even a little scared when interacting with people, especially those whom you are not very familiar with. It's something a lot of us can relate to.

The great thing though, is that you've recognized this issue and you're eager to work on it. That’s the first step to getting better. It's also important to not feel too guilty about replying late. We all have our moments where replying to messages immediately is challenging. 

Concerning your self-image, it could indeed play a part. Self-image hugely affects how we act and communicate with others. If you feel positive and confident about yourself, you're more likely to feel comfortable interacting with others. So, accepting and loving yourself as you are – including your natural hair – can help. Perhaps you might want to seek help from a professional who can help you navigate through these feelings of self-consciousness and anxiety. 

One small tip before I go: when a message pops up, and you feel that rush of anxiety, take a moment to breathe slow and steady breaths. Remind yourself that it's okay to take some time to reply. It might be a small thing, but over time this could help calm your feelings of anxiety. 

Remember, we're all working on ourselves, so take your time and be kind to yourself. Keep going, you're doing better than you think!"

"I hear you, this very real struggle with text anxiety can sometimes feel isolating. Remember, it's okay not to respond immediately. Your value isn’t determined by how quickly you reply to a text. Your self-image can indeed affect your anxiety level, so, recognizing that you're already moving towards improvement is a major step! 

Consider setting aside a specific time of day dedicated to replying to these 'difficult' messages. That way, you're mentally prepared, reducing the chance of anxiety creeping up. If you're truly feeling anxious about a conversation, it may be good to let the person know that it is overwhelming you and you need some time to respond - people are more understanding than we give them credit for! 

Continue working on your self-image as well. Embrace your natural hair and every bit of who you are. We all interact differently with different people and that's okay. Everyone takes their own time to open up or feel comfortable, don’t be too hard on yourself. And remember, it's okay to seek professional help if you feel like your anxiety is too much for you to handle. You're making progress, and that's what really matters!"

It's clear that you're feeling anxious about replying to acquaintances on social media and it seems like you're putting a lot of unnecessary pressure on yourself. Firstly, don't beat yourself up - anxiety is something many of us struggle with, especially when it comes to social interactions, both online and offline. And in your case, I believe it may have a lot to do with your self-image, as you mentioned about your natural hair. 

Remember, it's okay to take your time in replying to messages and it's perfectly normal not to have 'instant' replies. That doesn't make you weird; it makes you human. What matters is that you communicate - late, early, it doesn't matter. On the other hand, putting off replying due to anxiety may reinforce your fears rather than diminish them. If you can, try to reply right when you see the message but take the pressure off yourself by remembering: there's no 'perfect' response, there's just your response. It's okay to be you, and it's more than okay to speak in your own voice and at your own pace.

Practicing self-compassion is also important. Try looking at yourself from a distance: would you blame your friend for responding late? Probably not. You might then ask, why blame yourself? Lastly, please consider speaking with a mental health professional about these matters if you haven't already. You're not alone and there are many tools and strategies designed to help manage social anxiety. You're on the right path by acknowledging and starting to work on your feelings. Remember, go at your own pace and be patient with yourself."

Firstly, you're not alone in feeling this way. Many people struggle with social anxiety, especially when interacting with others online. Each person's battle with this issue is unique, and it seems yours is primarily tied to your self-perception and perception of others' perception of you. It's a cycle where your anxiety feeds into itself, but it's possible to break it.

Anxiety can take hold because we're worried about how others perceive us. Your concern seems to be not wanting to appear overly keen or forgetful. This is completely understandable, but keep in mind that everyone works on their own schedule and has different expectations. It's okay to respond when you feel comfortable doing so.

Your self-image also plays a significant role in this. It's hard to project confidence to the outside world when we're not feeling it internally. As someone who wears her natural hair beautifully and boldly at 32, try to carry this same spirit forward in your social interactions - each reply you send is your unique voice speaking, and that's something to be proud of.

Take baby steps. Start by responding to one or two messages a day at your own pace. Then, as you grow more comfortable, gradually increase this amount. It's also perfectly okay to explain that you responded late due to your busy schedule. After all, we each have our own lives and responsibilities outside of the digital realm.

Lastly, consider seeking guidance from a mental health professional. They can provide you with tools and resources to help manage your anxiety more efficiently. Keep trying, and remember you are not alone. We're all perfectly imperfect in our own ways."
I don't know when exactly it started. Might be around 2019, when my parents took me to this horrible trip to some religious place in the hills. Before this we used to do great trips, London, USA etc which I enjoyed. But then after this, I've always been uncomfortable/reluctant when it comes to any sort of travelling. Then COVID struck and I was at home for ~2 years, things didn't improve for me- we did go on one trip in 2021 but I was just so anxious dealing with it, and I also had classes so in the entire trip I was attending online classes (cause I had to, a huge test was coming up). As a 32yo wearing my natural hair, dealing with this anxiety feels even more isolating. My problem is that I'm anxious before the trip happens and during it I'm completely fine. It's gotten better now tho, but not completely cured. Going alone or with friends seems like a mammoth task. Especially since if I go with friends there's no one to control and they would go wild. I know I need to get over this for the future. Any tips?	"Hey there,

I can sense the discomfort and anxiety from your words, and I want you to know, it's completely okay to feel this way. This is a very real experience, and you're not alone, many people go through this. 

First of all, please note that while it's good to want to overcome this anxiety, be kind to yourself in this process. Change doesn't happen right away, and it's okay to take small steps.

So here we go:

1. Maybe start with short day trips, close to your home, that do not involve a lot of planning, or a significant change in your routine or environment. This could help you get comfortable with the idea of travelling again.
   
2. Try to pinpoint your worries about the trip. Is it the change of environment? The planning and preparation? The fear of something unexpected happening while you're away? The more specific you can get, the easier it will be to tackle the issue.

3. Try some visualization techniques. Sit in a quiet, comfortable place, and imagine yourself going on a trip. Visualize everything from packing your bags, to getting on the transport, to reaching your destination. Seeing yourself handle each step of the process can ease some of your fears.

4. Consider seeking professional help. Therapists or counsellors can offer techniques and strategies catered specific to you and your experiences. 

5. Lastly, Reach out to the people you trust and express your anxious thoughts. Sometimes, speaking out loud about your fears can help reduce their intensity. 

Please remember, there's no instant solution, but each small step is a victory. Keep going, keep trying, and remember, it's okay to ask for help if you need it. 

Take care!"

"Hey there, it sounds like you're experiencing a lot of anxiety surrounding travel, and it sounds like this is really affecting your quality of life. It's great that you're reaching out for support though. One thing you could try would be to break down the travel into smaller achievable tasks. This might help to make it seem less overwhelming, and help you to feel more in control of the situation. If possible, you could also look into seeing a therapist who can help you to navigate your anxiety in a way that suits you.

Also, it's important to remember that it's okay to communicate your fears and anxieties with your friends. If they're really your friends, they'll listen and try to accommodate you. You're not alone in this, and I believe that you can conquer this step-by-step. Remember, everyone moves at their own pace in life, so don't rush. You'll get there!"

It sounds like a certain trip in the past has unsettled you and subsequently affected your view towards travelling. It's okay to have unfavorable experiences, but identifying this as a key contributor to your travel anxiety is a giant step towards managing it, so kudos!

To manage before-trip anxiety, having a clear plan might help. Know your itinerary inside out, and prepare as much as possible beforehand. This could reduce the uncertainty and the stress associated with it.

Regarding travelling alone or with friends, you might want to start small. Try a short trip nearby with people you trust—a 'safe' environment so to speak. As for friends going wild, it is okay to voice your concerns and set boundaries.

I'd also recommend seeking therapeutic assistance. A professional might help equip you with specific techniques to manage your anxiety better. This is only advice from a fellow Redditor, but seeking professional help could really make a difference.

Lastly, remember to be kind to yourself. Anxiety is not something you learn to manage overnight. It's a journey, and you're doing great by actively seeking solutions. Take care."

Firstly, please know that this is more common that you might think, and you're not alone in this. Here are a few tips to manage your anxieties:

1. **Cognitively Reframing Your Thoughts:** You're doing great in managing your anxiety during the actual trips. That indicates that you have the ability to control it. Addressing the anticipatory anxiety might require reframing your thoughts about the trip. Try visualizing fun or relaxing aspects of the journey and destination.

2. **Mindful Breathing & Relaxation Techniques:** Practice deep breathing exercises, progressive muscle relaxation, or guided imagery techniques at times when you're feeling anxious about a possibly upcoming trip. 

3. **Setting Boundaries while Traveling:** You mentioned concerns with friends going wild. It's important to have open conversations about your comfort zones and anxiety to help them understand your limitations. 

4. **Seeking Professional Help:** If the anxiety is very distressing and disrupting your daily function or obligations, don't hesitate to seek professional help. A therapist or counselor specializing in cognitive behavioral therapy can provide structured strategies to tackle such issues.

Remember, you're not alone, and it's commendable that you're reaching out and seeking strategies to manage your anxiety. Good luck.

This is quite common and absolutely something you can work through over time, so don't feel alone in this. You've already made the first step in acknowledging the issue and seeking help. 

There are different ways to tackle this. Firstly, make sure that you prepare for your trips as much as possible. This could be things like researching the destination, booking accommodation in advance, packing well ahead of time, and even considering the worst-case scenarios to help ease your mind. 

Secondly, it might help to try to identify what exactly is triggering your anxiety. Is it the change of routine? Being in unfamiliar surroundings? Meeting new people? Once you have an idea of what's causing the discomfort, you can then take steps to address these issues. 

I highly suggest bringing along something familiar from home that you love. A comfort object can make a huge difference when dealing with anxiety and can make unfamiliar surroundings feel more safe and comfortable.

Finally, if you haven't already, consider reaching out to a mental health professional. They can provide some insight into why you might be experiencing this anxiety and help you develop coping mechanisms to deal with it. 

Don't put too much pressure on yourself, everyone moves at their own pace. Gradually pushing your comfort zone can lead to big changes over time. Good luck, mate!"

"It's understandable you're feeling this way, traveling can certainly provoke anxiety, especially after a negative experience or a long time of staying at home due to COVID. Remember, it's okay to have fears, and it's perfectly normal to feel anxious about things that are out of our usual routine. 

What might help is starting with baby steps. Begin with small outings close to home, and gradually increase the distance or time spent away from home. This could slowly desensitize you to the fear associated with traveling.

Try to understand the root of your anxiety. Is it the uncertainty of what might happen during the trip? Is it the worry about routines or responsibilities at home? Understanding what triggers your fear could be a helpful way to address it.

Consider engaging in mindfulness activities such as meditating or deep breathing exercises. They can help to reduce anxiety by keeping you grounded and focused on the present.

Lastly, it can be helpful to discuss these feelings with trusted friends or family. They may offer perspectives that you hadn't considered or give you the support you need during this time. 

Remember, you're not alone in this. Everyone has their own fears and anxieties. Try not to be too hard on yourself, Rome wasn't built in a day. It's crucial to take small steps at your own pace. And If the anxiety continues to be severe, consulting a mental health professional could be extremely beneficial."

What you're experiencing might be anticipation anxiety, where you feel the anxiety prior to the event more than during the event itself. You're already making progress with the fact it's getting better, even if it's not completely cured yet.

This actually might be a combination of 1) the previous bad experience you had and 2) the impact of COVID which has forced us all to change the way we approach traveling. Try to make each future trip as comfortable as possible, and with time, hopefully your past experiences won’t impact your present as much. It's okay to take your time to adjust.

If going with friends feels overwhelming, perhaps consider some solo trips if possible. Start small, like day trips in a known city or surroundings, and as you get more comfortable, try and stretch those boundaries.

Consider seeking professional guidance, such as a therapist, who can provide techniques and coping mechanisms specifically catered to your needs. Eating well, getting enough rest, and practicing mindfulness exercises (like breathing exercises or meditation) may also help. Remember, it's okay to take everything at your own pace. Healing takes time."
I don't know when exactly it started. Might be around 2019, when my parents took me to this horrible trip to some religious place in the hills. Before this we used to do great trips, London, USA etc which I enjoyed. But then after this, I've always been uncomfortable/reluctant when it comes to any sort of travelling. Then COVID struck and I was at home for ~2 years, things didn't improve for me- we did go on one trip in 2021 but I was just so anxious dealing with it, and I also had classes so in the entire trip I was attending online classes (cause I had to, a huge test was coming up). As a 32yo wearing my natural hair, dealing with this anxiety feels even more isolating. My problem is that I'm anxious before the trip happens and during it I'm completely fine. It's gotten better now tho, but not completely cured. Going alone or with friends seems like a mammoth task. Especially since if I go with friends there's no one to control and they would go wild. I know I need to get over this for the future. Any tips?	Hey there, it sounds like you're going through quite a stressful time. The fact that you're acknowledging these issues and reaching out for help is already a massive step. Perhaps you might find it helpful to break down your trip into smaller parts and tackle each one individually. Like arranging the trip, packing etc. Then visualize each step and perform little victories to celebrate your progress. Mindset is key here and try thinking about the good times to outweigh your fear. It's okay to start small too; maybe you can visit a local place first and gradually increase the distance as your comfort grows. Regarding travelling with friends, perhaps you can discuss your anxiety with them and ask for understanding and cooperation. Your friends might surprise you with their support. Therapy can also be a great resource in managing these anxieties. An online therapist experienced in travel anxieties could provide insights too. You're stronger than your anxiety, and with time and small steps, I believe you can overcome this.

A significant lifestyle change like the onset of a phobia can be challenging to navigate, but you're showing real courage in seeking advice. Firstly, it's essential to remember that it's okay to feel how you're feeling. Everyone experiences anxious feelings before events to some extent, but when it becomes difficult to shake, it's understandable how this might cause distress. 

Remember, gradual exposure to what you fear, in this case, traveling, can be incredibly beneficial. Start small, take small trips nearby and gradually increase the distance as you become more comfortable. Try to go on trips to places that you know first, this might help calm your anxiety. You could take someone along, preferably someone who understands your struggle.

Also, consider engaging in activities that help manage anxiety like deep breathing, meditation, and regular physical exercise. Mindfulness exercises may also help in remaining present in the moment and not getting lost in anticipatory fears. 

Lastly, but most importantly, don't hesitate to seek professional help. Therapy could provide you with tailored strategies to cope. You're definitely not alone in your struggle and remember, there's always help around."

I know I need to get over this for the future. Any tips?	"Hello there, it sounds like you're going through a tough time and I'm really sorry to hear that you're feeling this way. It's clear that these experiences have had a significant impact on your anxiety around travelling. It's okay to feel this way, it's a normal human response to discomforting situations.

So, a few things that might help. First, recognizing that anxiety often revolves around the anticipation of something negative happening, rather than the situation itself. This might explain why you're anxious before the trip, but generally okay during. Try to remind yourself that your anxiety is not a reflection of reality, but rather it's your mind racing ahead and imagining scenarios that may not happen.

Second, take small steps. Maybe start with small trips close home with family or a close friend. Or sometimes doing a virtual tour before the actual trip can help minimize the out-of-control feeling. Give yourself permission to take breaks if needed. 

Third, when it comes to travelling with friends, it's okay to voice your concerns and set boundaries. You don't need to completely control, but sharing how you feel and setting some limits would help lessen your anxieties.

Lastly, consider professional support. Therapists or counselors are trained to guide people through such matters and can provide you with strategies and coping mechanisms. There's absolutely no harm in seeking help. In all these, take your time and go at your own pace. Overcoming anxieties is not a race, it's a journey of self-discovery and building resilience. Sending positivity and strength your way."
I'm sorry for this little rant here but I don't know what else to do… I have been clinically depressed since I was 14 and although I am sure I have had happy moments or times when everything didn't feel so dark I keep coming back to the same place emotionally. When I was younger no matter how hard things were academically, socially or emotionally my mom was there but she has been diagnosed with dementia for 2 years now and I lost the one person that I could talk to freely. As a 32yo wearing my natural hair, I've become more reflective on these aspects of my life. I have seen been kind of parenting my dad and while I'm away in uni he is all alone so I'm scared for him all the time because he doesn't take care of himself and he has a serious heart condition. Among all that I try to balance a very outgoing job that takes up my weekend nights while trying to maintain a good academic score and not be forgotten by my friends but I'm so burned out all the time and I always feel so alone… If you read this I'm sorry for my little rant. I hope it gets better for all of us.	"Hey there, 

I truly admire your strength for sharing your feelings. It isn't easy juggling so many responsibilities, especially when battling your own inner demons. Depression is a heavy burden, and it sounds like it's made even harder for you with the challenges you face with your mother and worrying for your father. 

Perhaps reaching out to support groups or mental health professionals could offer you some solace. Since you mentioned being in uni, they often have counseling services that are included in your tuition. Maybe your university could offer some resources to help your father as well.

Your job and academics are important, but so is your well-being. It's okay to take breaks when you need them. It might help to try to set aside some time for yourself, even if it's just for a few moments each day. 

And remember, it's okay to lean on your friends for support. You don't have to bear everything on your own. Most importantly, your feelings are valid and it's okay to be overwhelmed.

Stay strong, and remember you're not alone. I'm sure others here on this forum are willing to provide support as well. Take care."

Firstly, I want to say it's really great that you've come here to express your feelings because it's always important to let it out. Trust me, there's no need to apologize for sharing your life with us. Life can feel incredibly difficult when dealing with depression and other aspects of our lives seem to just pile on top of it. You're not alone and I promise you are stronger than you know.

Having a loved one with dementia is tough, sitting with that fear for their well-being can be emotionally draining. Is there any home care or resource centers in the area that can assist your mother? Local community centers, for example, may offer day services.

Also, care for your father's health while balancing your work and university commitments must be quite challenging, too. It's highly commendable yet you also need to take out time for self-care. It might help to discuss this with your professors at university or consider counseling services that many universities offer. They provide academic support and mental health guidance that may prove useful.

Remember it's perfectly okay to ask your friends for help too, sometimes we forget that they're there for us and might be more than willing to offer support. As for the burnout, please consider setting boundaries to protect your personal time, it's very important for your mental health.

Just remember, you're doing the best you can given the circumstances, don't be too hard on yourself. You're stronger than you know and it's okay to ask for help. There are also many support groups, both online and offline, that can provide further assistance.

Lastly, be kind to yourself, you're doing a lot and you deserve to give yourself some credit. Please remember to take care of yourself. You're vital, and things will get better. Always keep going."

This is a safe space for everyone to share their feelings and thoughts, and we're here to offer support to each other. 

It sounds like you're dealing with a lot right now. Depression, your mother's dementia, looking after your father, balancing school and work, and maintaining social connections all at the same time are tremendous pressures to carry, and it's understandable that you're feeling overwhelmed and alone. It's okay to feel this way. What you're going through is tough. 

Every little step you take, however small, counts in your journey with depression. Celebrate your progresses, however minor, and don't forget that it is okay to have bad days, good days, and in-between days. It's part of the human experience. 

As for your dad, have you considered discussing support services that might be available for him, like Meals on Wheels or a home health aid? Sometimes, professional help in such cases can alleviate a lot of stress. 

In regards to your academics and job, would it be possible to speak with a counselor in your university about possibly managing your schedules or workload better? They might also have resources that could help you manage stress and burnout more effectively. 

In terms of your friends, real friendships can withstand the stressful times. Maybe you can explain to them what you're going through. Let them know that you're not going anywhere, but that you might not be able to be as available as you used to be.

Remember, even when you feel alone, there's always someone out there ready to listen to you. Keep reaching out, don't be afraid to speak honestly about what you're feeling, and if possible, get help from professionals. They can provide tools and strategies that can make a big difference. 

You are strong, and you can get through this. It takes courage to seek out help and support, which you've already done by posting here. Be gentle with yourself. Better days are yet to come. Hang in there."

I wouldn't undervalue the strength it takes to share what you're going through, it's brave and it reflects resilience in you. I'd recommend considering seeking professional help if you haven't already; they can work closely with you and help you navigate through these tough times.

Remember, it's okay to feel overwhelmed, you're human and no one is tough all the time. Take one step at a time, it's okay to slow down a bit, eliminate the non-essentials and focus more on self-care. Reading some books or listening to podcasts about mental health might also be helpful; remember knowledge is power. 

This community is here for you, remember you're not alone, and please reach out anytime. It's okay not to be okay, and asking for help is a sign of strength. Professionals with the right training and friends/family who truly care about you will be there to help. Please take care of yourself. You're important and your feelings are valid. Things might seem dark now, but remember after every night, sun surely rises. Keep going. You're stronger than you think, and you've got this. If you ever need someone to listen, I'm here for you.

I read your post and want you to know that your feelings are valid, and it's absolutely okay to feel overwhelmed. Remember, it's okay to not be okay all the time. 

There are plenty of resources available online, like counseling or therapist services, or crisis hotlines, that can offer immediate and professional help. You might also consider reaching out to a trusted mentor or someone from university; many schools have free student counseling services. 

However, know that you're more resilient than you might think. You've faced hard times before and you've always overcome. It's okay to take time for yourself, and it's okay to set boundaries. Maybe stepping back from comprehensive caregiving for your father or asking your job for fewer weekend hours could help while you focus on your emotional health and schoolwork. 

Remember to communicate with your friends as well. They may not know exactly what you're going through, but sharing your feelings can help lessen the burden. 

Take care of yourself, prioritize your mental health, and remember it's okay to ask for help. Sending good vibes your way. Stay strong."

Depression is serious, and dealing with all that you're facing must be extremely hard. I want to acknowledge you and your strength - being there for both your parents, balancing work, studies, and a social life. It's a testament to your resilience. 

I know it probably doesn't make you feel less alone, but please know that you're not the only one feeling this way. Many people go through the same experiences and feelings. You're doing an incredible job, even if you don't always feel like it. 

Have you considered seeking professional help to navigate through these difficult emotions you're experiencing? A therapist, counselor or psychologist could provide coping strategies and potential treatment options. It's important to take care of your mental health just like you would your physical health. 

Also, remember to take some time out for you. Do something you find soothing or enjoyable, even if it's just for a few minutes each day – it could be reading a book, taking a walk, meditating, pampering yourself, or listening to music. That's not being selfish or taking time away from others. It's important for your own mental health. You can't pour from an empty cup, remember to refill yours. 

Things may seem bleak now, but I urge you to reach out to someone you trust and confide in them about what you're going through. You're not alone. Remember, it's okay to ask for help. It does get better, sometimes it just takes time. You're stronger than you think. Keep reaching out!

First of all, I want you to know it's okay to express your feelings, and it's not a rant. It's sharing your reality, and by doing so you are taking a brave step. You're going through a lot, and it takes courage to ask for help. 

Remember, it's essential to make sure you have emotional support during these times. Reach out to friends or consider joining a support group for people with families that have similar health conditions. Encourage your dad to do the same, possibly explore home care options for him if feasible.

And about your feeling of being burnt out, it's essential to remember to look after yourself. With so much to balance, it's understandable you're feeling this way. You are important, your health is important. It's not selfish to dedicate some time for yourself for relaxation, hobbies, or whatever it is that makes you feel good.

Also, reach out to a mental health professional about your feelings if this isn't something you're already doing. Sometimes, talking with someone trained to understand can make a big difference. Just like you would go to a doctor for a physical injury, reaching out to a professional for emotional struggles is just as important. 

Lastly, remember you're not alone. Many people are struggling with their situation, but it's easy for people to hide what they're truly going through. Reach out to others, ask for help, join communities. Things get better, and you will pull through.

Sending big hugs your way. 💛"

It's clear that you're dealing with multiple sources of stress and it's really important that you let out these feelings somewhere. It sounds like you're juggling so much with your mom's illness, looking after your dad, university, work and your social life - and dealing with depression on top of all that is immensely tough.

Try to not beat yourself up about feeling this way because your feelings are completely valid under these circumstances. Caring for family members with serious health issues is incredibly demanding and emotionally draining, so your exhaustion makes total sense. Remember that it's okay to not be okay all the time.

Balance is important, even though it seems nearly impossible right now. If there are any areas where you could lessen your load, even if it's minor, please consider it. Remember, self-care is not selfish. It's a necessity. Perhaps, consulting a professional counselor or therapist could be beneficial to navigate through this tough time by providing coping strategies and an understanding ear. Keep reaching out - there are people that care and want to help. You're not alone, even if it often feels like you are.

Feel free to vent anytime here and remember to take care of yourself first. Stay strong, you have already shown incredible resilience and bravery just by reaching out here. Things can and will get better."
So I have decided to well distance myself from most of my friends. The reason why is even though I seem to be getting better. The people around me keep getting hurt because of me. But there’s no reason for me to get rid of my friends that I don’t see in person anymore so there’s no reason to worry about them because they did seem to get hurt. The reason why the people around me are getting hurt is because of me. Now that I have shown more emotion I tend to lose control over my emotions and when I do I try to control it but it just makes me angry. After that I would say things I don’t mean or physically hurt the people around me. As a 32yo wearing my natural hair, I feel this adds another layer to my struggle with self-control and expression. I don’t mind the looks I get but I don’t want to hurt the people I care about I just want to protect them but if I can’t even stop myself from hurting then how am I supposed to stop others. I really am just looking for some advice or if anyone really knows what is going on I haven’t been in the right mindset for a while now and I don’t think this will help me in any way.

"Hey, it sounds like you're going through a rough patch, and first and foremost, I want you to know that it's okay to share these feelings. You're taking a big step by acknowledging the problem and seeking assistance. You're not alone, there are people out there who want to help.

It seems like you're dealing with intense emotions, and that can be challenging. But remember, everyone has moments when emotions seem out of control. This doesn't mean it's not workable or fixable. 

A technique that might be helpful for you is mindfulness practice. Mindfulness is all about observing your emotions without reacting to them. When you notice yourself becoming angry, try to pause and identify your feelings. It may take some practice, but over time, it could allow you to respond to your emotions more positively rather than reactively.

It might also be beneficial to consider talking to a mental health professional about what you're experiencing. They could give advice and techniques to handle your emotions effectively. Please remember, never hesitate to reach out to professionals when you're feeling overwhelmed. They are there to assist.

Just remember that self-care is essential, too. Making sure to take care of your physical health can really benefit your mental health. Eating well, getting enough sleep, and exercising can all contribute positively. 

Remember, you're so brave for reaching out, and you're not alone. It's okay not to have all the answers right now. Asking for help and advice is a huge step towards learning and healing."
So I have decided to well distance myself from most of my friends. The reason why is even though I seem to be getting better. The people around me keep getting hurt because of me. But there’s no reason for me to get rid of my friends that I don’t see in person anymore so there’s no reason to worry about them because they did seem to get hurt. The reason why the people around me are getting hurt is because of me. Now that I have shown more emotion I tend to lose control over my emotions and when I do I try to control it but it just makes me angry. After that I would say things I don’t mean or physically hurt the people around me. As a 32yo wearing my natural hair, I feel this adds another layer to my struggle with self-control and expression. I don’t mind the looks I get but I don’t want to hurt the people I care about I just want to protect them but if I can’t even stop myself from hurting then how am I supposed to stop others. I really am just looking for some advice or if anyone really knows what is going on I haven’t been in the right mindset for a while now and I don’t think this will help me in any way.	"Hi there,

It's really brave and commendable of you to open up about such an emotionally challenging topic. Not many are able to do that, and it's a big first step towards seeking help. 

The fact that you recognize your issues and how they affect others is an important start. It's understandable to feel the way you do, especially when those closest to you are the ones who are getting hurt. I would encourage you to possibly take up seeking some professional input. Speaking to a mental health expert, like a psychologist or a psychiatrist, could provide a way to navigate these feelings of anger and loss of control. 

As for distancing yourself from others, it's okay to take some time alone to recuperate and figure things out. However, isolating yourself completely might make the situation more difficult. Reach out and let your loved ones know what you're going through - they might be more understanding than you think.

This is your journey, your growth period. Remember it's okay to ask for help, this doesn't make you weak. It takes strength to recognize that you need others. You're not alone in this. Sending you strength and positive vibes for the journey ahead."

"I'm sorry to hear you're feeling this way, but glad that you're looking for help. It's clear that you care about the people around you and don't want to cause them any harm. It's also good to hear that you've been getting better, but emotions can be difficult to control—just know that there is help and resources available. Cognitive behavioral therapies can be effective for understanding and managing emotions. You might try seeking a therapist who specializes in these techniques. Keeping a journal might also be helpful, being able to visualize what you're feelings might make it easier to understand them. 

In regard to your friends, communication can be key. Let them know that you're in a tough place and are trying to get better. They most likely care about you a great deal and would understand. Additionally, involving them could provide you with some much needed support. 

This is a tough journey to go on alone, so consider reaching out to trusted people in your life. Remember, there's no shame in seeking help. It's a brave step to take. Take care."

First off, it's courageous to recognize and understand that your actions may be affecting others negatively. That's a vital first step down a path of self-improvement.

Changing behaviors and learning to manage strong, overwhelming emotions is a challenge, but it's one that many people deal with daily and it's, most importantly, achievable. You're not alone in this. You're approaching this situation from a place of self-awareness and a desire to change, which is a good start.

However, it might be beneficial to seek professional assistance for this kind of in-depth emotional management. A mental health professional can provide strategies and techniques for managing your reactions to situations that lead you to feel out of control.

Emotions can be a tough tide to navigate and managing them by yourself isn't always the best way to improve. Remember, reaching out is not a sign of weakness, it's a sign of strength. 

You must ensure that you're communicating clearly with your friends about how you're feeling as well - if they care about you, they'll stand by you through this journey.

It's admirable that you want to protect and not hurt those around you, but you also have to take care of yourself. Remember, you can't pour from an empty cup.

I'm cheering for you, please take care."

First of all, I want you to know that it's brave of you to reach out and ask for help. It takes a lot of self-awareness to recognize the patterns you've mentioned, which is actually a significant first step towards change and healing. 

If you haven't done it yet, seeking professional help might be a good idea. They have the capability to provide strategies to help you manage your emotions in a healthier way.

Remember, change doesn't happen overnight. It sounds like you are on a journey of self-discovery and growth. Sometimes on this journey, we stumble and regress, but that doesn't mean progress isn't being made. It's part of the process, and it's okay. Self-forgiveness is just as important as striving for change.

You mentioned wanting to protect your friends. People who care about you surely want to see you flourishing, not hurting. It may be strategic to connect with them in a way that is healthy for you both, perhaps writing letters or using video chat. You can let them know in a calm manner about what you're going through. They may not fully understand, but opening a dialogue can help both of you navigate your friendship in a healthier way.

Lastly, just because you're struggling with self-control doesn't mean you're a lost cause or that there's something wrong with you. Everyone has their battles. It's clear you have a kind heart and a strong desire to get better. You aren't alone in this. Keep reaching out, keep trying. You're important and you matter. 

Take care."

Hey there, firstly, it can be sensitive to share these feelings but it's brave of you to acknowledge what you're going through. I want you to know that these feelings of guilt and wanting to protect those around you are incredibly human and commendable. But remember, your friends wouldn't be your friends if they didn't care about you, and they're likely willing to be there for you as you navigate through this. You're dealing with intense emotions, so it can be helpful to take a step back and work on self-awareness. Being aware of your triggers, your emotional responses, and how you can manage them could really help you. Practice deep breathing exercises, and consider techniques like mindfulness and meditation. Exercise can also be a useful outlet for increasing your control over your emotion. You might also want to reach out to a mental health professional, who can provide you with tools and strategies to manage your emotions. Professional help can be invaluable. Stay strong!

First off, kudos to you for your self-awareness and taking responsibility for your actions. It shows strength to acknowledge that you might be hurting others, and even more to actively look for ways to change it. Feeling out of control with your emotions can be really hard to handle; it's like walking a tightrope without a safety net underneath. 

But remember, you’re not alone. Many have had similar experiences and have come out the other side stronger and more in control. Consider reaching out to a therapist or counselor who can provide you with tools and strategies to help manage your emotions better. They can also help you explore why this is happening. 

Connecting with those close to you about your struggles can also help, even if it's hard. They may need some reassurance that you're working on improving things; it might make the situation less scary for them, knowing that you're making an effort. 

Don’t forget to practice self-care too and remember to be kind to yourself. You’re a work in progress, like everyone else. Respect your journey and your pace.

Take care!"

It seems like you're going through a difficult time and it's really brave of you to reach out for help. Your feelings of guilt and your desire to protect your friends indicate how much you value them. Sometimes, we don't realize that we are dealing with a lot more than what meets the eye, emotionally and physically. It's important during these times to be kind and patient with ourselves. 

Have you thought about consulting with a mental health professional? They can provide tools and strategies to help you manage your emotions and reactions in a healthier way. It's also important to communicate with your friends about what you're going through. They may understand and support you more than you realize.

If you find it difficult to express your feelings verbally, try writing them down. This can help you process your emotions and make them less overwhelming.

These are just a few suggestions but remember, you don't have to face this journey alone. Seeking professional help can go a long way in helping you understand and manage your feelings better. It might seem difficult right now, but things can get better with time and effort. Keep your head up and continue reaching out to supportive communities and people."
So ima just keep this short, but most of my life I’ve never gotten attention from my parents. That’s due to the fact my mom had many jobs and was still in college while my father was an addict. I think this is where it came from I’m pretty sure. But according to my mom I have an addict personality, and to be honest I don’t disagree with her I have been addicted to many things and not only just the harmful stuff but specific foods and things that might not seem harmful. But they can most definitely be in large quantities. As a 32yo wearing my natural hair, I ponder whether this aspect of my identity influences my addictive tendencies. The reason why she said this is because she has plenty of evidence to support it. I have always been addicted to something ever since I was a kid I had an addiction whether if it was bad or good I had always had one. Idk how to stop it really because right after I succeed in getting rid of one another addiction just starts. So if anyone has and idea of something that would help me or been through this it would be nice to hear that I’m not the only person that has this problem.	"Hello,

It's definitely tough when it feels like you're jumping from one addition to another, regardless of whether or not they are harmful aspects. First off, it's great that you're recognizing the pattern and seeking help. That's often the first, most significant step. Now this isn't professional advice, but based on experiences and knowledge, here are some thoughts:

1. Find new hobbies or activities: Distractive work is useful when trying to manage addiction. Explore new interests, hobbies, or activities that can take the empty space of your addictions.

2. Try therapy: Therapists are trained professionals who help navigate through rough patches, and addiction is one of those patches they're well-equipped to handle. They'd be able to give you personalized advice and coping strategies.

3. Establish a support system: It's harder to go through this alone. Find friends or family who can support you, people who can understand your situation and be there for you when things are tough.

4. Test out techniques: Everyone manages addictions differently. Try out different techniques such as meditation, reading, journal-keeping or even physical activities like running, and see if they help.

Remember, it's okay to stumble, everyone does. The important thing is that you keep trying. It won't be easy, but recovery is definitely something you can achieve. Be patient, take it one day at a time, and most importantly, be kind to yourself."

I appreciate the courage it takes to open up about your situation. Plagued by addictions can indeed be so tough, especially when you feel alone in your struggle.

Acknowledge that it's not your fault. You were placed in strained circumstances as a child, and it's admirable that you're aware of these issues and are seeking help for them.

One strategy could be developing a mindful approach. When the urge to indulge in an addictive habit pops up, pause and evaluate your feelings. Another way would be focusing on moderation, rather than absolute avoidance. Find healthier alternatives where you can keep control and gradually reduce your dependence on such habits.

Seeing a licensed professional is the most effective way if these addictions interfere with your daily life. The insights from a therapist, psychiatrist, or counselor can lead to lifestyle changes that will mitigate the hold that these addictions have on you.

Connecting with others who struggle with similar issues can also be beneficial. Participating in support groups, either in-person or online, can provide the reassurance that you're not alone, and can provide strategies that have worked for others.

It is possible to fight your addictive tendencies and seek the change that you so earnestly desire. Always remember, even small steps towards change count. All the best."

Firstly, I'm sending you warm wishes and want you to know your experiences are valid. Many people face similar struggles with addictive personality traits, so please know you're not alone in this. 

The root of addictive behavior can stem from a lot of places, including childhood experiences. It's understandable, considering your personal circumstances, you might have developed these traits.

Have you considered reaching out to a mental health professional? They could help you dig deeper into understanding your tendencies, possibly work on some coping strategies and behavioral change methods customized for you.  

Additionally, you could try to channel your addictive tendency towards positive and healthy habits. This may include things like exercise, developing a hobby, learning a new skill or even meditation. 

Remember that this is not an easy journey, and relapses might occur, but try not to get disheartened by setbacks. Healing takes time, and you should remember to be patient with yourself. Reach out to your friends, family, or supportive online communities for emotional support whenever you feel overwhelmed.

User communities like this are here to offer empathy, shared experiences, and a sense of camaraderie, but seeking professional help is advised for long term personal growth and improvements. You're not the only one with this struggle. Don't lose hope, you're stronger than you believe!"

Firstly, I want to commend your bravery in reaching out and being open about your struggles. The first step towards any sort of change or improvement lies in acknowledging the issue, which you have already done. 

Based on what you've shared, it seems like you're caught in a cycle of trading one addiction for another. This could indicate that there are underlying issues that might need professional intervention. While it's completey understandable that these issues arise from your past experiences, they shouldn't define or limit your future. 

You may benefit from cognitive behavioral therapy, which focuses on challenging and changing unhelpful thinking and behavior patterns. Many people who battle addictions have found this approach helpful, as it encourages managing problems by changing the way we think and behave.

Also consider joining mutual support groups that focus on addiction recovery. Many people find camaraderie and strength in sharing experiences and support with others who are going through similar things.

An important aspect is to maintain an overall healthy lifestyle, which includes a balanced diet, regular exercise, adequate rest, and engaging in positive activities.

Remember, you're not alone in your struggle and there's always help available. I strongly advocate for seeking professional help, as they can provide techniques tailored to your specific situation. 

Keep reaching out, keep asking questions, keep trying. Your road to recovery may be tough, but it's not impossible. Stay strong!

You're definitely not alone, and I'm really sorry to hear about what you're going through. Unfortunately, many people struggle with addictive tendencies and it can manifest in many forms, not just substances. It sounds like you're dealing with a lot right now, from issues surrounding your upbringing to your self-identity. 

You might want to consider seeking out a mental health professional who specializes in addictive behaviours. They can provide strategies, resources, and therapies that could help you manage these tendencies better. You can typically find these professionals through health clinics, hospitals, or private practice. 

Also, joining a support group could help. There are many online and physical groups for people who are going through similar issues. In these spaces, you can share your experiences, feelings, and strategies for coping, which might be beneficial to you. 

Finally, adopting a holistic approach to your health could be beneficial as well - being mindful of your physical health, exercising regularly, eating balanced meals, getting sufficient sleep, and practicing mindfulness can all play a role in boosting your overall mental wellbeing.

Remember, recovery isn't a sprint, but a marathon. It's okay to have setbacks and stumble along the way. The most important thing is that you are taking steps towards a better future. Wishing you the best of luck on your journey."

First off, thanks for opening up about your struggles - that alone is a big step. Secondly, I want you to know you're definitely not alone in your struggles with addiction tendencies. Many of us wrestle with various forms of addiction, and at times it feels like an endless cycle of replacing one addiction with another.

From what you've shared, it seems like you've already made considerable strides towards acknowledging this pattern in your life. That's a big deal! Identifying the problem is a major part of solving it.

About your natural hair and identity, it's always hard to say how these elements influence our behaviors. There might be some correlation, but it's often more complex than a direct causation. 

It seems like you could benefit greatly from professional assistance, like therapy or counseling, to better understand your addictive personality. They may help provide insightful techniques on how to break these cycles, potentially revealing root causes in a protective environment.

Families with addiction histories often unwittingly pass down certain behaviors or establish environments that make future generations more susceptible to forming their own addictions. It may help to reach out to support groups focused on familial connections in addiction, as they could provide you comfort and understanding in shared experiences as well as beneficial direction.

Remember, change is a progress, not a destination. The fact that you are actively attempting to change your addictive behaviors is a huge deal. Every step, no matter how small, is a victory.

Please remember to be gentle with yourself in times of struggle. You are actively working against ingrained habits, and that's never an easy task. 

So hang in there, friend. Keep moving forward, and know there's a whole community here willing to support you during your journey towards healing and balance."

"Hey there, thanks for reaching out and for your honesty. Desire for unmet attention can definitely manifest in various ways and it sounds like you're really grappling with some tough stuff right now. First off, know you're not alone in this, and that many people deal with issues of addiction. It's a normal part of life to have intense interests or develop habits, but when these become detrimental, that's when it can be a problem. 

One possible way to handle this might be identifying triggers that lead to addictive behaviors. This could involve noting what you're feeling, thinking, or undergoing whenever an addictive tendency arises. By doing so, you might start to recognize patterns and work on healthier ways to respond to these triggers.

Additionally, finding positive hobbies or outlets might help occupying your mind and time constructively, essentially replacing the destructive habits with more beneficial ones. It could be physically oriented like sports, art, cooking, reading, etc. 

Seeking professional help like a counselor or therapist could be invaluable. They can provide you with tools, strategies, and support guided by their understanding and experience in the field of mental health. Many are now offering online services due to the pandemic if visiting in-person is a concern. 

It's great that you're taking the first step towards change by acknowledging this as a problem, and you've exhibited a lot of self-awareness in your post. That's a considerable part of the battle. Remember that progress isn't linear, there will always be ups and downs, but never stop believing in your capacity to overcome and grow. Wishing all the best for you."
So ima just keep this short, but most of my life I’ve never gotten attention from my parents. That’s due to the fact my mom had many jobs and was still in college while my father was an addict. I think this is where it came from I’m pretty sure. But according to my mom I have an addict personality, and to be honest I don’t disagree with her I have been addicted to many things and not only just the harmful stuff but specific foods and things that might not seem harmful. But they can most definitely be in large quantities. As a 32yo wearing my natural hair, I ponder whether this aspect of my identity influences my addictive tendencies. The reason why she said this is because she has plenty of evidence to support it. I have always been addicted to something ever since I was a kid I had an addiction whether if it was bad or good I had always had one. Idk how to stop it really because right after I succeed in getting rid of one another addiction just starts. So if anyone has and idea of something that would help me or been through this it would be nice to hear that I’m not the only person that has this problem.	"Firstly, kudos to you for opening up about such a personal struggle. It's not easy to confront your realities with yourself, let alone sharing them with others. From what you’ve described, it seems like you have a highly addictive personality. This is, in fact, a recognized condition and quite common. It means you're more prone to addictions of all kinds: substances, behaviors, and even relationships.

Simply recognizing and admitting that you have this problem is an enormous step toward overcoming it. Please know, you're not alone. Many of us struggle with different kinds of addictions and you won't be judged here.

What you need now is some professional assistance, such as psychological counseling which may help to explore and address the root cause of your addictive personality. Certain therapeutic approaches like Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Rational Emotive Behaviour Therapy, or Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy have proven beneficial for people dealing with similar issues.

Hey, thank you for sharing your experience, that takes a lot of courage. I'm not a mental health professional but oftentimes, we develop addictive behaviors as coping mechanisms to deal with stress or emotional pain. You can try various techniques such as mindfulness, meditation, picking up a new hobby, or practicing self-care routines. But honestly, getting help could really make the whole process smoother. You don't have to do it alone. There are online therapy platforms if you're comfortable with that, or therapists and addiction counselors in your local area. It's okay to ask for professional help, you deserve to heal and get better. You are far from alone on this journey, and there are people and resources ready to give you the support you need.

I'm really sorry to hear about what you're going through, but I'm glad to see that you're being brave in reaching out. It takes courage to acknowledge your struggles and to seek help - so let's start by acknowledging your strength there. 

Take note that seeing a mental health professional is a step that you could possibly take. They can provide a depth of understanding and the right methods of dealing effectively with these addictive tendencies. 

In the meantime, maybe you can think about some daily things you could change, or habits you could start to form in your life that might help a bit. Practice mindfulness and try to understand the triggers for your addictive tendencies - it could be boredom, stress, loneliness etc. Institute a positive routine in your daily life which could include a balanced diet, regular physical activity, adequate sleep, and positive social interactions. Some people find journaling helps too - writing down your thoughts, feelings, steps and progress can be therapeutic.

You are most definitely not alone, and remember, change is a process that happens over time, not instantaneously. Warm thoughts coming your way."
I know... it affects me. I had my sleep on schedule before but the recent events didn't allow me to have a good sleep. But it's fine. I can change it slowly. Had a little dark thoughts at night but it didn't last long. Some self-hatred and other usual stuff but it wasn't that bad. I mean can I get better in one night? Of course not. Still felt lonely (or alone... I don't know my English sucks:() but that's fine too. Pain is part of my journey. I'm not feeling strong yet but it doesn't hurt like last week. Also, I had a small good conversation with someone which made me happy that moment. As a 32yo wearing my natural hair, I’m reminded of the journey I’m on towards self-acceptance and healing. I was supposed to go to see my psychiatrist but I didn't go because I was scared. It's really hard to go there. But it's ok at least I tried to think about going there. I need to change my medicines. Overall I'm sad but not too much. Like 4/10. That's good. I mean it was 9/10 last week so I'm still satisfied.	"Hi there,

You're right, change and progress are not an overnight process. They happen slowly, steadily, and addressing it step-by-step is okay. The fact that you're taking time to reflect on your feelings and be in tune with your emotions is already a step in the right direction. You're aware of your pain and that kind of self-understanding is powerful.

It's completely normal to not have perfect days, to feel scared, to feel lonely sometimes. But remember, every effort you make to improve your mental health counts, so pat yourself on the back for each positive step you take.

Also, it's always heart-warming to hear about small things that can bring us joy, like your good conversation with someone. Regarding your English, it's great! And even if it weren't, reaching out and expressing yourself honestly and bravely matters more than having perfect grammar.

Lastly, facing the fear and thinking about seeing your psychiatrist is indeed a significant step. Try not to pressure yourself too much about changing your medications immediately. Instead, set a little goal for yourself each day.

Remember, though you may feel alone, you're not. Many people are going through similar journeys and are here to support you. Let's keep walking side by side. 

Feel free to share anything and everything. Stay strong. Let's work through this, one day at a time."

"I'm really proud of you for recognizing your pain and taking steps towards self-acceptance and healing. I can so relate to so many things you've said - the sleep issues, the fluctuating feelings of sadness. Know that it's okay to ride this wave out, and it doesn't have to be a perfect journey. Although going to a psychiatrist can be scary, it's also a massive step in getting the help you need. Even thinking about going is a big achievement! Maybe try some baby steps to make it easier, like making an appointment and seeing how you feel then? With time, you might find the courage and that's alright too. It's all progress. Keep having those small good conversations. They truly matter and add to a healthier mind. It's great to see some improvement from last week as well. Be proud of each little move forward. Sending you strength and positivity!

First off, I just want to commend you for sharing your story. It takes a lot of strength to express what you're going through and the fact that you've taken this step proves that you're braver than you give yourself credit for. 

About not being able to sleep properly and experiencing dark thoughts, I totally hear you, and it is great that you understand the journey towards healing isn't a one-night process. Remember that it's okay to have bad days, but also, don't forget to celebrate the small victories, like your joyful conversation.

Additionally, it's perfectly valid to feel scared about seeing your psychiatrist. But remember, they're there to help you navigate through your feelings and thoughts. Their job is to make you feel less alone on this journey. It may take a few tries to go there, and that's okay. 

Do you have anyone in your life you could take along for moral support ? If not, consider online resources like tele-counseling. You can speak to professionals from the comfort of your own home. 

I’m not a professional myself but if you ever just need someone to vent to or advice on coping strategies, just let me know. Judging by your fear scale dropping from 9 to 4 in a week, you're clearly stronger than you think. Celebrate this progress, you're doing great!

Stay strong. You're not alone in this."

That's an important first step. Remember, progress isn't linear, so feeling better does take time, and there will be ups and downs. I totally understand feeling scared about seeing your psychiatrist but your health matters, they're there to help. Consider reaching out and explaining your fears and concerns. That might make the process feel less intimidating. Language can be a challenge but remember that your emotions are valid and deserve to be expressed, regardless of language barriers. Keep engaging in things, like conversations, that bring joy into your life. As for your medicines, discuss these feelings with your psychiatrist and see if there could be adjustments that can help you. You're on a journey towards self-acceptance and healing and that's something to be proud of, remember each 4/10 day is a step closer to feeling better. Stay strong!

First off, I just wanted to say that it's amazing you're recognizing and acknowledging your emotions. That's a really big step towards self-awareness and healing. It's completely fine not to be ""better"" in one night, and as you said, pain is part of the journey.

You're absolutely right--change does happen slowly, and that's just fine. Every small improvement counts, like the fact that your sadness has lessened from 9/10 to 4/10. That's progress, and I'm proud of you for that!

It's great that you had a positive conversation recently. Those small moments really do make a difference. And hey, your English isn't bad at all, so don't be too hard on yourself!

The fact that you're thinking about seeing a psychiatrist is positive, even if you didn't manage to go this time. It's okay to be scared, but keep that thought going. Updating your medications could be the next step in managing what you're going through. If it feels daunting, maybe bringing a friend or family member with you to the appointment could be useful?

It's lovely to hear that you're on a journey towards self-acceptance with your natural hair. Embrace it! It's a beautiful part of who you are.

Take things step by step. You're doing a fantastic job so far. Keep going, and remember, you're not alone.

Sending you positive thoughts."

But what stands out to me in your post is your amazing resilience. You're acknowledging your feelings and still finding positives - the great hair journey, the good conversation - amongst the turmoil.

Remember, it's okay to have bad days, it's okay not to be okay sometimes. And yes, you absolutely cannot get better in one night, healing is a journey that takes time and patience. It's totally fine. 

Going to the psychiatrist can be hard, no doubt. Have you considered calling them if visiting is too much? It's okay to need a medication change; it's all part of the journey to find what works best for you.

In terms of the sleep issue, have you tried practicing good sleep hygiene? That can really help regulate sleep patterns. And regarding feeling lonely, it might help to join some support groups. It's always comforting to find comrades who are navigating similar journeys.

Keep holding on, remember self-love, and keep reaching out when you need it. Healing isn't linear, and each step you take, no matter how small, is a step forward."

"Hey there, thanks for sharing your thoughts and feelings here, that's already a step forward towards healing. It's completely okay to take your time and heal at your own pace. Remember, healing is not linear, there will be good days and bad days and that's perfectly normal. 

I would recommend still trying to see your psychiatrist, even if it feels scary. They are there to listen and help. If your meds are not working for you, they can assist in finding something that might work better. There's no need to rush yourself there, take your time and gather the courage whenever you're ready. 

Also, try some relaxation techniques before bedtime to help you get a good night's sleep. Good sleep is essential to mental health. It's okay to feel lonely sometimes, but do remember that you're not alone in this journey. Reach out to familiar faces and don't hesitate to share your feelings. You may be surprised to find that they care more than you think.

Having small good conversations can be mentally fulfilling and give a sense of connection. Celebrate these small victories; they mean progression in your journey towards healing. Stay strong and remember it's okay not to be okay. Take care!"

The fact that you were considering seeing a psychiatrist already shows that you're ready and willing to seek help even if getting there was a challenge this time. Perhaps try setting a new appointment and ask someone to accompany you for moral support. It's okay to be scared but do remember, your psychiatrist is there to help you. 

Also, it's exciting and encouraging to hear about your good conversation, even small positive moments can be super impactful and help lift our spirits when we need it most. Just like you mentioned, conversing with others could also help alleviate some feelings of loneliness.

It's wonderful you’re embracing your natural hair at 32 and I bet it looks amazing. Remember, everyone's journey towards self-acceptance looks different. 

It's okay to feel sad. It's okay not to be okay. From what you've shared, it sounds like you're striving and navigating to be a more complete version of yourself which is really commendable.

It's great that you're acknowledging your small victories, like a good conversation and lower sadness levels. And don't rush yourself, it's okay to take one step at a time.

It's completely normal to feel apprehensive about seeing your psychiatrist, but remember they are there to help you. If it feels overwhelming, perhaps you could do some grounding techniques, like deep breathing, before your appointment. And if you're not comfortable with your current psychiatrist, remember it's okay to look for another one who you feel more at ease with. 

One more thing, don't worry about your English—you're doing great. The important thing is that you're expressing your feelings. Remember that all these emotions are just a part of your journey towards healing, so don't hesitate to reach out if you need to talk. You're not alone in this. You're stronger than you think."
I’m sitting here at the bar that I recently started to manage…. This was supposed to be an exciting step, a new change for a brighter future. Every single day is work ya know? My job has crept into every aspect of my life. My partner hates my job, I just got it in January and we moved in together in February. Having to be on call for work has made me realize how “on call” I am for everything. They can’t accept the fact that I have to help out this restaurant with any problems they have on any given day. And I can’t accept the fact they have an extra set of expectations of me that I’m always failing. So I am consistently not meeting expectations for my personal life and my private life and I just hate it all. IT ALL FEELS LIKE WORK. I need help. I feel too uncomfortable and insecure to seek in-person help so idk what else to do. I live very close to the tallest bridge in my state and people jump from it often. I just want to be another number for that jump list. I want my family to grieve my death for a couple of days then just please forget about me. As a 32yo wearing my natural hair, it's like I'm waiting for a moment of peace that seems ever elusive. Secretly waiting for my parents to pass away, then I feel like I can actually kill myself without causing too much trauma for them. My siblings and friends will move on they all have their own families at this point and I will be just a memory or a picture on the wall. I’m just so tired of every day being work, but it’s not even my job's fault. It only brought it to my attention.	failed

Having to be on call for work has made me realize how “on call” I am for everything. They can’t accept the fact that I have to help out this restaurant with any problems they have on any given day. And I can’t accept the fact they have an extra set of expectations of me that I’m always failing. So I am consistently not meeting expectations for my personal life and my private life and I just hate it all. IT ALL FEELS LIKE WORK. I need help. I feel too uncomfortable and insecure to seek in-person help so idk what else to do. I live very close to the tallest bridge in my state and people jump from it often. I just want to be another number for that jump list. I want my family to grieve my death for a couple of days then just please forget about me. As a 32yo wearing my natural hair, it's like I'm waiting for a moment of peace that seems ever elusive. Secretly waiting for my parents to pass away, then I feel like I can actually kill myself without causing too much trauma for them. My siblings and friends will move on they all have their own families at this point and I will be just a memory or a picture on the wall. I’m just so tired of every day being work, but it’s not even my job's fault. It only brought it to my attention.	failed

I have no friends aside from one from primary school who I infrequently catch up with. I really just find most people not to be worth talking to, as I find it hard to connect with many people due to my lack of shared interests and my social anxiety. However, I often feel lonely and kinda sad especially when I see people who are having a good time with their friends. I did actually have a weird experience making a friend just recently though, but he's way older than me so it's a bit weird to hang out in person. I noticed he had an interest in something I really liked, and we had this great chat for about 10 minutes. It flowed so smoothly, and it was super passionate. We still message each other every couple of days. As a 32yo wearing my natural hair, these moments of connection feel especially meaningful, reminding me that there are different ways to find community and understanding. Can anyone else relate to this?	"Hey there, 

I just wanted to let you know that you're definitely not alone in how you feel. It's normal for each of us to want to find our own 'tribe' - people who share the same interests and can understand us at a deeper level. Even if they're few and far between, those connections are precious. And when it comes to connecting with people, age is just a number. If this person understands you and shares your interests, there’s absolutely nothing 'weird' about it. 

Another thing, social anxiety can make it hard to connect with others but remember, it doesn't define who you are. Everyone has something unique to offer, including you. Continue seeking those connections and sharing your interests, there will be people who appreciate them. 

Also, it's okay to take time for yourself. Don't force connections that aren't there. Enjoy your own company, indulge in your interests, and let things flow naturally. Those who are meant to be in your life, will find their way into it. 

Just remember, it's your journey and you're doing just fine!"

Remember, it's okay to prefer fewer but deeper connections, and it's also okay to find those connections in surprising or unconventional places. It's great to hear about your new friendship. Age isn't always the most important factor in a friendship; common interests and respect for one another can bind people together. 

Consider finding more of such meaningful connections through mutual interests. Maybe there are groups or clubs related to your interests that you could look into joining. Online communities can also be a great place to meet people with shared interests. 

When it comes to social anxiety, sometimes it's about finding coping mechanisms or strategies that can help you interact more comfortably with people. Be patient with yourself and remember it's okay to take baby steps. Please consult a licensed mental health professional if you feel this has been causing persistent distress in your life. You're not alone and there are people out there who can provide the guidance and assistance you might need. Hang in there, and don't underestimate the value of the connections you are capable of making."

Sometimes, it can be difficult to find people who share our interests, especially if we have a niche passion or hobby. It's also perfectly normal to feel a sense of loneliness when witnessing others' friendships, especially during periods of solitude or anxiety. I think it's great that you've found someone who shares passion for something you love, regardless of their age! Don't let that hold you back; sometimes it's refreshing to have conversations with people from different generations. You may find that they bring a new perspective and wisdom that your peers may not have. 

You're doing the right things by finding meaningful connections and staying true to yourself. Remember that it's okay to have a smaller circle of friends who truly understand and appreciate you. We all have our own unique ways to connect with others. I'd encourage you to join local or online communities that align with your interests. Even if it's a small step at first, like a Subreddit about something you love, you might make some unexpected connections.

Don't be too hard on yourself. Your journey is your own, and it's okay to move at your own pace. You're not alone in your experiences, and there are people out there who would love to be your friend. Keep making connections and finding joy in the situations where you can. You're doing great!"

Thanks for sharing your story. It can be challenging to connect with others, especially when you feel a lack of shared interests and social anxiety. First, remember that it's perfectly okay to have a small circle of friends, the important thing is to have meaningful relationships that bring you joy and comfort.

It's really great to hear that you've had a recent experience of connecting with someone over a shared interest. Age shouldn't matter when it comes to friendship, if you both enjoy each other's company, understanding and respect each other then it's a beautiful thing. 

Try to find more avenues where you can meet people with similar interests, it could be online forums, clubs or events related to your interests. The moments of connection might not occur right away, but with persistence, they will come.

In terms of managing social anxiety, have you thought about seeking help from a professional therapist or counselor? They can provide you with strategies and techniques to help manage social situations that currently cause you stress. Working on this can potentially open up new opportunities for connection. 

You're not alone in how you're feeling. Many people can relate to this, so please know that you're not alone, and it's a journey that many of us are on. You're doing great, take it one step at a time and remember it doesn't have to be perfect. We're all just doing the best we can."

It sounds like you have made an important discovery - friendship doesn't have to rely on conventional similarities such as age or shared history. Connection can often emerge from shared passion and understanding.

Not everyone finds their circle easily, and it's okay to be picky about who we invest our time and effort into. It might feel a bit awkward to hang out in person with your new friend due to the age difference, but don't let that deter you if you really enjoy each other's company. 

Regarding your feelings of loneliness, perhaps you can explore online communities that suit your interests. They could provide a space to interact with likeminded people, ease your social anxiety and enhance your sense of belonging. Remember, it's perfectly okay to have a small but meaningful social circle. The quality of friendships outweighs the quantity. 

Look out for more opportunities for connection. Each person you meet could be a new door to enriching experiences. No one says it's going to be easy, it might feel uncomfortable at times, but that's growth. Be patient with yourself. Every small step is a victory — celebrate those moments!"

I'm sorry to hear that you're feeling lonely and sad. It's not uncommon to feel like you don't fit in or find it difficult to connect with people. But please remember that everyone has their unique value and place in the world.

It's ok to take things slow. Social connections aren't built overnight. They require time, patience, and mutual understanding. If you find even one person with whom you can connect meaningfully, then you're on the right track. Don't worry about the age difference. What's more important is the common interest and the connection you share with this person.

There are many communities out there based on shared interests. Whether online or in person, participating in activities you enjoy can help you meet people who have similar interests. Volunteering or joining clubs are also great options.

If you ever find your social anxiety hindering your connections, please consider seeking advice from a professional. They can provide you with strategies to manage this and help enhance your social life.

You are not alone in your journey. Many people go through similar experiences. Remember, your value is not defined by the number of friends you have, but by the quality of the connections you make.

Take care."

I definitely relate to what you're going through. It's frustrating to feel isolated and alone, especially when it seems like everyone else has a group of friends they fit in with. Not being able to mesh with people easily can leave you feeling alienated, but I wanted to tell you that your feelings are valid, and it's okay to feel this way.

Sometimes, it's about quality, not quantity when it comes to friendships. The fact you had a great chat with someone, regardless of their age, is a good step forward. Common interests are the bridges that link differences, so I'd suggest seeking out community events, clubs, or online platforms revolving around your interests. This will give you more opportunities to meet people who share your passions and hopefully, this will help you make more of these meaningful connections you crave.

Remember, it's perfectly okay to have a smaller circle. Having even one close friend you can trust and rely on is more precious than having a hundred acquaintances. Also, let's not overlook your online friend. Great friendships don't always have to be in-person; virtual connections can be just as beautiful and meaningful.

You're not alone in feeling the way you do, and I'm grateful you chose to reach out and share your experience. That's a brave step in itself! Don't pressure yourself to fit a certain mold or meet certain expectations. Your journey is uniquely yours, so embrace it and love yourself through it.

Stay hopeful and keep reaching out. You've got this!

It’s totally okay to struggle with finding common ground with others, especially if you have unique interests. You're not alone - it's something many people deal with! 👍    

Remember, it's perfectly okay to have a smaller circle of friends, and age doesn’t necessarily have to be a barrier to friendship. It seems like the connection you’ve made with your older friend has been really positive. Finding a shared passion with someone else can lead to deep, meaningful relationships. 

In terms of social anxiety, some resources that may help you could be joining online communities centered around your interests or finding local groups near you which appeal to these interests. This might help with the loneliness and feeling of disconnect, and can be a less stressful way to connect with others. Also, remember it's perfectly okay to seek professional help, if you ever feel the need.

Don't forget, your worth isn't defined by the number of friends you have or how regularly you interact with them. Quality, not quantity, is what truly matters when it comes to friendships! 🌼

Take care and good luck! 🍀"

Firstly, I’d like to acknowledge that it can be hard dealing with feelings of loneliness and disconnection, and it's brave of you to reach out for support.

From your post, it seems like you're yearning for a sense of connection. Your interaction with the older person shows that it's possible to find people who share your interests and that these connections can be meaningful to you, age gap notwithstanding.

Remember, you don't need to have a huge social circle to not feel lonely - sometimes, a few good connections can make a big difference. It's also entirely okay if it takes time finding these people. There's no requisite timeline for something as personal as this.

You may want to try looking for community forums or clubs around your interests. This can open up possibilities of meeting likeminded individuals who you could form bonds with.

Besides, you've also mentioned dealing with social anxiety. You're not alone in that. Many people experience it and there are resources available to you that can provide some assistance, whether it's self-help methods or seeking professional guidance if and when you feel ready for it.

Remember, it's okay to feel the way you do and it's okay to ask for help. Everyone has a unique journey and your experiences are valid. Keep pushing forward and reaching out, you're tougher than you think!

Best regards."

Everyone's journey is different but making friends isn't always about quantity but about quality. Despite your social anxiety, you've managed to make a connection with someone on a deeper level which is really admirable. It can be tough when it feels like society places so much emphasis on having a large friend group, but it's more important to have genuine relationships than just staying in touch with a bunch of acquaintances. Please don't pressure yourself to have a big friend group right away. Focus on building solid relationships with the people you feel more comfortable with, just like the one you've just mentioned. The good thing about bonding over shared interests is that it generally opens up opportunities to meet similar minded people. Perhaps you could explore more spaces (on and offline) that involve the things you are passionate about where there could be a potential for you to make more connections. Hang in there, social connections take time. And remember, it's perfectly okay to prioritize your well-being and mental health over making new friendships. Have patience with yourself. We're here for you!
