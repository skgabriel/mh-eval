Remember, you're not alone and there are people who care and want to help. The hardest part of solving any problem is acknowledging it in the first place, and you've done that here which is great.

First things first, address the rat infestation by calling a professional pest control service to deal with this - it's not something you should tackle on your own. As for the task of cleaning, it can be overwhelming when looked at as one big task. Break it down into smaller, manageable tasks that won't feel as harsh on your sensory issues. List out the things that need to be done and tackle one each day.

You might also consider opening up to your parents about the situation. If they understand your struggle, they may be more supportive and helpful than you expect. Send them an email or letter if you're not comfortable discussing it face to face, and explain how your depression affects your daily functioning. They may be shocked initially, but ultimately love you & want to help. 

Finally, just remember that it's okay to ask for help and it's okay to struggle. Reach out to local services and support networks if you can. You are not alone, take care."

Hey, firstly I want to acknowledge your strength and bravery in sharing your struggles here. It's truly admirable and believe me, you're not alone. 

Addressing the immediate problem, I'd suggest breaking down the cleaning process into smaller, achievable tasks to make it feel less overwhelming. Start off with the bin as it's causing the rat infestation. You could possibly take small steps to slowly move it outside followed by segregating the waste bit by bit. Meanwhile, see if you can arrange for pest control to exterminate the rats - this might help you feel less overwhelmed too.

In a broader context, it seems you could benefit from having someone to confide in about your depression. I know it's challenging but remember that communication is key. It might be really hard initially, but getting through the first step will make the rest easier. 

Since you've mentioned sensory issues, it could be useful to find ways to make cleaning more comfortable for you; maybe using gloves or certain types of sponges might help. 

You've taken a tremendous first step by writing about your problems and looking for solutions. I'm proud of you. Continue on this path, you're definitely capable and strong enough."

Firstly, I want to acknowledge how brave you are for sharing your struggle. Depression is a heavy burden, and you're not alone in this fight. I'm sorry you're feeling this way, but please remember that there's always help.

I would recommend, if you can, reaching out to local mental health resources. Therapists and counselors can provide you with methods that can help manage your depression. 

In regards to your room, perhaps you might consider breaking down the task into smaller steps. Instead of seeing it as one big task, try cleaning a small section each day. Allocate a set time each day to focus on cleaning. It can be as short as 15 minutes!

For the rat problem, it might not be something you can tackle alone. Perhaps you could consider enlisting local professional extermination services. There may be costs, but it would be a less stressful solution versus handling it yourself.

Most importantly, it's about your well-being and peace of mind. While cleaning the room within a week might seem important, remember that your mental health comes first.

Keep holding on, you're much stronger than you realize."

Reading about your struggles, it's clear that you're in a tough situation right now - but please remember, it's okay to ask for help. Not having the strength to clean your room doesn’t mean you're lazy, it's just a symptom of what you are going through. 

Is there anyone you trust who could lend a hand? Sometimes's it's easier to start a tough task with someone by your side, especially when it's so daunting.

If the rat situation is severe, consider reaching out to professionals. There are pest control services that can safely remove them, and they usually have options for those looking for more discrete services. 

Regarding your parents, it might be a good idea to let them know, when you're ready, about your depression and how it's affecting you. They may not understand right away, but it could give them some insight into your behavior and allow them to provide better support. 

Lastly, don't be too hard on yourself if it's not perfect after a day or two; cleaning takes time. Take it one step at a time, focus on small areas, and remember to give yourself credit for any progress made. 

I'm really glad to hear you've made some improvements and keep us updated on your progress, we're rooting for you."

Thank you for sharing your struggles with us. It takes immense courage to open up about your situation. 

It's important that you don't pressure yourself too much. Cleaning, especially when dealing with sensory issues, can indeed be overwhelming, particularly when dealing with other psychological challenges like depression. 

Start with small, manageable tasks. Perhaps it could be taking out the trash, or cleaning one corner of your room at a time. Remember, it's okay if you can't do it all at once. Progress is progress no matter how small.

In terms of the rat problem, it's crucial to involve your parents, despite your fear of their reaction. Enlist professional pest control to ensure the issue is handled effectively and safely. Reassure your parents that you're trying your best and need their help. Many people are unaware about the reality of living with depression, so it might be a good idea to discuss your feelings with them.

Lastly, consider seeking professional help if you have not already. Therapists can offer coping strategies for dealing with overwhelming situations like these. Always remember, even in the darkest of times, there's help and support available. 

Chin up. You're stronger than you think, and this community is rooting for you. Wish you all the best in your journey."

I'm really sorry to hear you're going through such a tough time. As someone who's had personal experience with depression, I can tell you that you aren't alone in your struggle, and you deserve support and compassion. 

Perhaps you can break down the cleaning task into smaller, manageable parts so it doesn't feel too overwhelming. Start by just picking up a few items each day, or cleaning a small area of your room. Even the smallest progress is still progress.

About the rat infestation: that's certainly a serious concern that necessitates professional help. I completely understand your fear about telling your parents, but remember, they are your parents and their love for you should surpass any momentary anger or disappointment. 

In case it's too daunting to tell them in person, maybe you could write them a letter explaining the situation, and your depression too. Inform them how you've been feeling and why you've struggled to maintain cleanliness. 

I’d highly recommend seeking professional help for your depression as well. Look into therapy or counseling services, maybe even an online service if that feels more comfortable. They are equipped to provide persistent support that you might not be able to get elsewhere.

Also, please remember it's okay to ask for help. Whether it's from friends, family, or a professional, don't hesitate to reach out to people around you. You don't have to face this alone.

Please take baby steps in improving your environment and remember to be kind to yourself through this process. You've already made a significant step by reaching out here, and that's something you should be immensely proud of.

Firstly, I want you to know it's okay to not be okay and it sounds like you're dealing with a lot right now. Let's break it down into manageable parts and see if we can find some temporary solutions. 

Have you tried sharing your struggle with depression with your parents? They could offer support if they understood the gravity of what you're going through. 

To tackle the cleaning aspect, perhaps you could take small steps. It doesn't have to be all at once.

Start With easy tasks. Pick 5 things each day that you can dispose of or find a proper place for. You could adopt some sensory-friendly cleaning techniques. If it's the sound, play some music or use earplugs, if it's the touch, use gloves, and if it's the smell, use a mask with a couple of drops of relaxing essential oil.

If you need immediate help with the rat infestation, there are professionals that could help. It's really important that you get this sorted, both for your health and safety, as well as overall well-being. 

Please remember, you're not alone, seeking professional help from a doctor or therapist can provide you with many helpful tools to help manage your depression.

I'm really sorry to hear about all the stress and difficulties you're going through. It's clear that you're struggling, and it's essential to remember that it's okay to ask for help, so kudos to you for reaching out here. 

Sometimes it's less intimidating to break down tasks into smaller, more manageable chunks, so rather than looking at the entire room, try focusing on one area at a time. It can also help to set yourself specific goals each day. 

Regarding the rat infestation, I would highly urge you to share it with your parents, as it's a serious issue that needs timely professional intervention. If you're worried about their reaction, maybe writing them a letter could be an easier way to express yourself.

It sounds like you're going through a really tough time, but remember - you're not alone! Dealing with depression is hard enough, and such issues often come with other complications like you mentioned. It's okay to be worried and confused; it's a natural reaction to a tough situation. Let's try tackling this one step at a time.

Firstly, I'd recommend disclosing the situation to your parents. It can be daunting but it could also be helpful. As your situation is bigger than simple ""messiness"", their understanding and their support could make a massive difference. 

Secondly, consider reaching out to a mental health professional if you can, just to talk things out a bit. It can help clear your mind and maybe they can suggest some structured strategies for you.

As for the immediate problem of your room, consider breaking down the job. A mammoth task often seems less daunting when broken down into smaller manageable parts. Perhaps focus on removing the trash and the rats first. There are pest control services that could help; it might be worth looking into that.

For the messy room issue, try just setting achievable goals. Maybe one day just focus on clearing a little section of your room. It can be as tiny as a corner. The next day, do another small bit. Incrementally, you will find that you have done quite a bit without overwhelming yourself.

Lastly, take care of yourself. Do small things that bring you joy. Hydrate. Try to get enough sleep. You are more important than a clean room. Remember, it's okay to lean on others when things are tough. We all need help sometimes. 

You're going through a tough time but you're not alone. Reach out to those around you, take it step by step, and take care of your mental health.

First off, I want to say that I'm really sorry you're going through this. It sounds incredibly overwhelming, and it's totally understandable why you're feeling so stressed about it. 

Let's break down your problem into manageable chunks. First, I believe it's important to address the rat issue as it can also affect your health. Perhaps you can get a pest control company to come out and help without your parents necessarily needing to know the full details. You could phrase it as discovering a rat, which led you to call pest control to prevent any future issues. 

Second, it may help to find someone who can assist with the cleaning-- whether it's a professional cleaner or a supportive friend. This isn’t something you have to face alone. If you can afford an occasional cleaner, that might be a game changer - they won’t judge, they’ve seen worse and they can get it under control.

Finally, and maybe most importantly, it sounds like you're wrestling with depression, and it's impacting your ability to upkeep your space. Have you considered finding a therapist, or speaking to your doctor about what you're experiencing? There’s no shame in reaching out to professionals who are equipped to help you manage your mental health. 

It's okay to ask for help, whether it's with cleaning, pest control, or mental health. Remember that each small step you take towards solving these problems is a victory, no matter how small it may seem. Update us with your progress! We’re cheering for you!"

I don't know how to tell her to leave me alone. The best relationship we ever had was when I lived in another state. I moved back because of my dad, but now he's gone. 

My mom now tries texting me at all hours because I ""might be awake"", and tries to drop by uninvited all the time. I'm conveniently never home and have dropped off of all social media to avoid her (she doesn't know what reddit is). 

Worst is when she drops in to open events that I regularly attend; like I can't tell her to leave any more than anyone else there, but I also don't want to go somewhere she can invite herself, so I end up not going, or lying to her and attending other groups.

I'm truly sorry to hear about your loss, and the subsequent challenges that you're having to face. Losing a loved one is difficult in itself, let alone trying to deal with the aftermath and the effects it has on surviving relationships. 

It seems like you're caught in a tug of war of respect for your mother's grief yet needing to enforce your boundaries. It's completely okay and reasonable to want to spend time alone and look out for your own mental health.

Consider a straightforward yet empathetic conversation with your mom. Let her know that while you understand her need for companionship in this tough time, you also need your personal space to process the grief and continue with your own life. Reiterate your love and care for her, but express your necessity for boundaries and alone time. 

Another point of call would be trying to introduce her to grief counselling or local support groups; they would give her a chance to share her feelings with people going through similar situations, taking some pressure off you.

Finally, finding a therapist for yourself would be invaluable as well, with some specialising in boundary issues. Try not to lose hope in this pursuit, as the right fit can make a big difference.

Dealing with a loved one's grief while maintaining your own independence is delicate balancing act but remember, it is essential to care for your own mental health too. You're not alone in this, and there are professionals and communities that want to help.

Take care."

It seems like your mother is wanting to connect with you to help her cope with her grief, but it's crucial to remember that you need to take care of your own mental health as well.

This might be a good time to have a heart-to-heart talk with your mother. Clear communication about your feelings can make a world of difference. You can express your need for personal space and time, in addition to how you're impacted by her frequent visits and texts. Try using 'I' statements such as, ""I feel overwhelmed,"" or ""I need some space for myself,"" as they come across as less accusatory.

Alternatively, recommending her to join a support group or seek therapy could be a good option. It will offer her the chance to share her feelings and connect with others who are going through a similar experience. Also, considering your own therapy recommendation, professional help could provide coping strategies for managing your relationship with her. 

Remember, it's okay to prioritize your own mental health. You are not responsible for your mother's happiness or mental well-being. You both are handling this situation differently and it's important to respect each other's boundaries. Stay strong!"

First off, I'm deeply sorry to hear about the loss of your father. Dealing with the death of a loved one is a tumultuous emotional journey unlike anything else, and it seems you're trying to navigate it while also dealing with a complex relationship with your mother.

It's understandable that, as an independent person, you're feeling overwhelmed or smothered by your mother's constant need for your company.

Start by communicating. Honestly, but gently. It doesn't need to be confrontational. You can express your feelings about needing space and independence, possibly over a cup of coffee in a neutral location.

Ask her if she can respect some boundaries, such as calling before she drops by, or keeping texting to daylight hours. Emphasizing you both need space to heal might make this conversation slightly easier.

It's also a good idea to explore others in her life who can act as a support system. It can take some pressure off you. Perhaps she has good friends, other family members, or maybe she could join a local community club or group? 

Let her know she's not alone - that there are other avenues of connection and support available to her besides you. It's important to maintain your own mental health and personal boundaries during this time.

Lastly, I encourage you to continue seeking therapy to tackle these issues. Therapy gives you a safe place to freely express your feelings and gain tools to manage your emotions and navigate complicated relationships. Don't give up on looking for the right therapist to support you through this. 

Take care."

You may want to consider sitting down with her and gently explaining that you need some time to process your grief, and while you are there for her, you also appreciate solitude. It may help to frame it around your grief, and not about her actions, to keep the message non-confrontational. And remember, setting boundaries does not equate to being uncaring.

As for therapy, keep trying to find someone who can guide you through this process. Many therapists now offer teletherapy services too, owing to this pandemic, which might be more accessible. 

Just bear in mind that it's okay to look after your own mental health. It doesn't make you selfish. It makes you strong."
"[32y/o, black female] -- ""My dad just died and my mom wants me to hang out with her all the time. I''ve never liked doing casual things with her, and I'm very independent.

I don't know how to tell her to leave me alone. The best relationship we ever had was when I lived in another state. I moved back because of my dad, but now he's gone. 

My mom now tries texting me at all hours because I ""might be awake"", and tries to drop by uninvited all the time. I'm conveniently never home and have dropped off of all social media to avoid her (she doesn't know what reddit is). 

Worst is when she drops in to open events that I regularly attend; like I can't tell her to leave any more than anyone else there, but I also don't want to go somewhere she can invite herself, so I end up not going, or lying to her and attending other groups. 

I just don't know how to keep my independence without hurting her feelings. I get that she's lonely, but I don't want to be her go-to person.

"Hi there, it sounds like you're going through an intensely difficult situation, and it's completely okay to feel overwhelmed. It looks like you've been thrust into a role you don't feel comfortable with, and balancing your independence and your mom's need for attachment in the wake of your dad's passing is extremely hard.

Take time to deeply process your feelings and emotions. It's normal to feel a little lost and to need space at these times. 

While I understand you're feeling cornered, there might be a way to address the situation that can work for both - communication. Transparent and honest communication about your feelings, albeit done sensitively, might be the key. 

You can explain that you appreciate her wanting to spend time together, but you need time to yourself as well. Make sure to emphasize it's not personal, and you want her to respect your emotions and personal space.

You're her child, not her counselor. It might be worth suggesting she find a tenuous forms of support - potentially a grieving group or a therapist; it might be beneficial for both of you. 

Similarly, seeking professional advice for yourself can be of immense help. If you're having trouble finding a suitable therapist, perhaps you can seek online resources. There are many tele-therapy services that might suit. 

Remember, it's okay to have boundaries, and it's okay to assert them. Wishing you the best through this tough time."

"Hi there, I'm so sorry for your loss. Dealing with grief is challenging on its own, and it must be even harder when you also have to navigate complicated dynamics with your mother.

 It sounds like she is also struggling with the loss and may be leaning on you more than you are comfortable with. It might help to have a deliberate, clear, and compassionate conversation explaining your feelings. You can gently tell her that you value your independence and need space. You're not rejecting her, but asking for the respect that any adult deserves in deciding how they spend their time.

A potential strategy to alleviate her loneliness could be to help her connect with support networks that aren’t solely based on you. For instance, suggest she attend a bereavement group or spend time with other family members or friends.

As for your struggle to find a therapist, don't give up. Check out local counseling centers or reach out to online therapy platforms if finding a local professional proves difficult. Just keep in mind your feelings are valid and it's okay to prioritize your needs. 

Remember, keep healthy boundaries and ensure you make time for self-care. Hope some of this advice helps."

"I'm sorry to hear about your situation, it's a tough one.

Secondly, consider having an open and gentle conversation with your mom about your need for space. Express your feelings, your willingness to support her, but also your need to process everything that you are going through independently. 

Counselling might be beneficial in this case, both individual as well as joint for you and your mom. Remember, it's okay to shop around when looking for a therapist, try and find someone who is a good fit for you, someone who works in boundary setting could be particularly helpful.

It’s completely understandable that you need your space and independence during this tough time. 

One suggestion could be setting boundaries with her. Let her know there are designated times during the day when you can chat with her, or specific days when you’d be happy to spend time together. This might seem tough, but assertive communication often helps in such situations. 

Understandably, this can be emotionally exhausting. Perhaps participating in online therapeutic discussions, finding a local support group, or reaching out to friends for emotional support could be helpful during this time. 

Lastly, you might consider suggesting to your mom that she, too, could benefit from speaking to a therapist or joining a support group for people dealing with grief. This could help her handle the loneliness she is feeling right now.

Remember, it’s alright to put your mental health first. Taking care of yourself isn’t being selfish, it’s necessary—especially during difficult times like these. You're not alone in this, many of us are here to listen and support."

Firstly, I'm so sorry to hear about the loss of your father and the struggles you're experiencing with your mom. Grief can make life incredibly tough, and such changes to your relationship dynamic can exacerbate those feelings. 

For a start, it is completely okay to want some space and cling to your independence. You have every right to set boundaries.

Perhaps you could have an open conversation with your mom about your feelings. Can you think of things she enjoys and might help her get fulfilment outside of your relationship? Maybe suggest activities she could do or groups she could join in your local community? It might also be worth exploring apps or websites where she could connect with like-minded people and have enriching conversations. That could help take the pressure off of you, and give her the chance to build a wider support network.

Remember, it's also okay to prioritise your own mental health. If you haven't already, you could try reaching out to some online therapy services. There are many reputable sites that offer sessions at a range of costs, from highly affordable to premium prices.

Lastly, don't forget to practice self-care. It's okay to take time out for yourself, to go for a walk, read a book, have a coffee, whatever brings you some peace.

I wish you the best of luck with everything. It's not easy, but you're stronger than you realise, and it's okay to ask others for help when you need it."

You can start by channeling your energy into activities that you enjoy. This could be reading, painting, gardening, or even meditation which can be particularly helpful in managing anxiety. Journaling your thoughts might also be beneficial - writing can provide a helpful release of emotions. 

Engaging in self-care routine, exercising, or delegating a regular ME time can help too. Joining hobby groups or social clubs could expose you to various perspectives and provide a healthy distraction when required.

Therapy can work wonders in breaking down and understanding these intense emotions. A mental-health professional will help you navigate your feelings in a healthier manner.

Lastly, strengthening your emotional independence can seem daunting right now, but remember, you're resilient and have the strength within you to overcome this rough patch. Courage isn't the absence of fear, but the triumph over it.

Firstly, it's really brave of you to reach out for help and to acknowledge your feelings. It's completely understandable if you feel intense alone time anxiety when you're away from your partner. Try some coping mechanisms to manage this anxiety such as distraction techniques. You could engage in hobbies that you genuinely enjoy when you're away from your partner. This can help distract your thoughts and help to relieve anxiety. 

Also, mindfulness and meditation can help you to stay in the present moment and avoid overwhelming thoughts about the future. There are indeed many online platforms out there that can help guide you through this process. 

Moreover, writing down your feelings can also be therapeutic. You don't have to share it with anyone, it's just an outlet for you to express your feelings and in process, you might understand your emotions better.

It's always good to remember that it's okay to have personal space in a relationship, it strengthens the bond you both share. A balanced life with both ""me"" time and ""us"" time is important.

I'm really sorry to hear about the emotional struggles you're going through. It sounds like you're dealing with some intense feelings of separation anxiety and I understand how challenging that must be for you. 

While it's quite common to miss your partner when you're apart, what you're describing seems to be more severe. It's important to remember that there's nothing wrong with feeling the way you do, but there are definitely methods that can help you manage these feelings better. 

Firstly, engaging in some activities that you enjoy can be a great way to distract yourself. This brings your mind to the present and reduces worry. 

Next, understanding that it's okay to be independent is important as well. Reassuring yourself that you are your own individual who can be happy and successful on your own can be a big step towards managing those feelings.

I am really sorry to hear that you're struggling with separation anxiety. What you're going through is difficult, and it's absolutely important to acknowledge that. Here are some suggestions that might help:

1. Routine - Creating your own routine might help distract your mind when you're away from your partner.  

2. Hobbies - Having your own hobbies can be empowering and it can also help when your mind starts to wander towards anxiety-inducing thoughts. 

3. Self-Care - Prioritize self-care. This can be as simple as a hot shower, reading a book, or even dedicating time to cook your favorite meal. 

4. Mindfulness & Meditation - These techniques can help manage the strong emotions that you're feeling by grounding you in the present moment.

5. Professional Help - Seek professional help if you haven’t already. A therapist or counselor could guide you through dealing with your emotions in a healthy way and provide techniques for managing anxiety.

Does any one have any tips?"	"Hey There,

I'm really sorry to hear that you're struggling with such intense separation anxiety. It's tough when we can't manage or understand our emotions easily, especially those related to someone we care about deeply. But remember this, you're not alone and reaching out for help is already a big step towards better understanding and managing your situation.

First, it might be helpful to recognize that separation anxiety is real and can greatly affect us. It can arise from various reasons and it's okay to not fully understand why at this moment. What you're experiencing is your body's response to an emotional trigger, something that makes you uncomfortable when you're away from your partner.

Second, your feelings are valid and it's okay to feel them. Emotions are a part of us and there’s nothing wrong with having strong feelings. The problem comes when these feelings become overwhelming. It can be useful to find effective coping mechanisms to manage the distress and try to ease the discomfort.

Deep breathing exercises, mindfulness techniques or yoga can be extremely helpful in calming down. Keeping yourself busy when you're away from your partner can also distract you from your anxiety. Pick up a new hobby or something that you would enjoy and it can serve as a healthy distraction.

Lastly, consider seeking consultation from a mental health professional if your anxiety persists. They can provide methods to better understand the cause behind and help manage your anxiety. 

Remember, it's okay to ask for help and you are not alone in this. You are stronger than you think and with time you will learn to handle the intense emotions. 

Take care and be kind to yourself."

"Hey there! It sounds like you're dealing with a bit of social anxiety which can manifest in surprising ways like this. Take assurance in the fact that you're not alone. Many people feel the exact same way. A possible solution could be setting a specific time each day, when you feel relaxed and comfortable, to respond to these messages. Then, it becomes part of your routine and thus less anxiety-inducing. Also, it's okay if you reply late sometimes, everyone gets busy. Try not to stress about having a ""good enough"" reason.

"Hi there, 

It sounds like you're facing a tricky situation. Firstly, I just want to say that it's absolutely okay to feel anxious when receiving unexpected messages or when interacting with people who aren't in your close social circle. This can be overwhelming for anyone. 

What might help is setting specific times of the day aside to reply to these messages. This way, it won't seem like an unexpected task and you'll have time mentally prepared to answer them. Developing a habit of responding might make this task feel less daunting over time. 

Also, remember, you don't owe anyone an immediate response or explanation about why you responded late. We all have different lives, different schedules, and different emotional capacities. So be easy on yourself, and remember, it's okay to communicate in a way and at a pace that feels most comfortable for you. Take care."
[32y/o, black female] -- i’ve been struggling with replying to people on social media, especially people i don’t usually talk to. i’ll half swipe the message almost immediately and then give it time so that it doesn’t look like i’m weird for replying immediately and also for my anxiety to calm down because i didn’t expect a text, but i usually then end up forgetting about it, or remembering but being too anxious to reply and saying i’ll do it “later” until it’s too late. i don’t have this problem when i’m texting people who i talk to daily or i’m close with, just like acquaintances and stuff. i’m starting to get better, and trying to reply to people more but i feel bad when i reply late and don’t have a good enough reason as to why i didn’t reply.	"Hi there,

It's pretty common to feel anxious when communicating with people we're not as close with or don't speak to regularly. The fear of awkwardness or not knowing what to say can really build up! It's awesome that you are working to overcome your anxiety, and it's important you know not to beat yourself up over late replies. 

May I suggest setting specific times of day to check and respond to these messages? Sometimes placing boundaries on when you'll deal with social media can alleviate anxiety. The people messaging you will understand if your reply isn't immediate.

Stress and anxiety over social interactions is something many people experience. Consider seeking out professional help, they can provide useful strategies and techniques to deal with this anxiety. Remember, you're not alone in this, and it's okay to take things at your own pace. Stay strong!"

"Hey there, 

I want you to know that what you're facing is not unusual. Many people struggle with social media anxiety, which can intensify when the message is from someone we don't interact with regularly. It's completely understandable that you take time to respond or feel anxious about it. 

Keep making efforts to reply more, like you've been doing. Progress may seem slow, but it's still progress. Try setting an actual later time or day as a reminder to revisit and respond. This way, you're not just saying ""later"", but giving yourself a specified time frame.

Remember, there's no set 'acceptable' response time on social media. The fact that you're acknowledging others' messages and feeling guilty about late replies shows your thoughtfulness. 

Please don't think you owe anyone an explanation or 'a good enough reason' for replying late. It is okay to prioritize yourself and your comfort over responding to others on social media.

Keep taking things at your own pace. If you need further support or guidance, don't hesitate to search for a professional counsellor or therapist who can help more with managing social media anxiety. 

Lots of strength and positivity to you.

"Hey there, firstly, I want to let you know that what you're experiencing is completely normal. Replying to someone on social media can certainly make us feel anxious, especially when it comes to people we don't interact with very often.

Remember, it's okay to take your time in responding and you don't owe anyone an immediate response. Your feelings are valid and you don't need to justify them.

One suggestion I'd make is setting a specific time to read and respond to these messages. When that time comes, take a few deep breaths, remind yourself that it's okay to feel anxious, and then start to reply. This way, you can turn replying to messages into a routine task rather than something that's unexpected and anxiety-inducing. 

But most importantly, don't be too hard on yourself. It's okay if you can't respond right away and it's okay to take care of your mental health first. Your well-being should always be your top priority."

"Hey there, it sounds like you're navigating some social media anxiety and that's quite a common thing nowadays. First off, remember that it's absolutely okay to take your time to respond, people will understand. Start it as a habit to at least acknowledge the message when you see it and then take your time to compose a response. You can say something like, ""Hey, thanks for reaching out. I need some time to properly respond, but I hope you're doing well"". And also, if you feel anxious about it, try to understand why. Is it because of the pressure to keep the conversation going? Or the worry about how you will be perceived? Once you recognize the source of your anxiety, it might be easier for you to handle. Remember, self-care includes digital spaces as well, so take breaks when needed and allow yourself to get used to this at your own pace. Keep going, it sounds like you're making progress already!"

"Hi there,

Firstly, it's great that you recognize this as an issue and you're actively trying to work on it. That in itself is progress!

It's perfectly normal to feel anxious when replying to people on social media especially if you're not close with the person or don't speak regularly. Keep in mind, everyone operates differently when it comes to responding to messages and everyone has their own pace. Sometimes the anxiety can make us overthink situations like these when in reality, people understand and are typically patient.

To help with this, perhaps try setting aside a specific time each day dedicated solely to replying and interacting on social media. Knowing you have a specific ""replying time"" might help ease your anxiety and prevent you from forgetting.

Also, remember it's okay to reply late. If someone accuses you of not replying quickly enough, you can say you were busy or simply forgot. That's a human thing to do and it happens to all of us. You don't have to justify it or make up an elaborate excuse. 

Above all, prioritize caring for yourself. It's okay to make mistakes, but it's important to learn and grow from them. This small issue doesn't define who you are or your ability to interact with others. Lastly, if you find that this anxiety is really impacting your ability to communicate or enjoy your social life, it might be helpful to talk with a mental health professional for further guidance.

"Hi there, 

Firstly, I want to tell you that it's okay. Many people experience anxiety related to social media interactions, and you're definitely not alone in that. Sometimes, we build up these interactions in our heads to be something larger than they are, which only increases the pressure and thus, the anxiety. 

You don't need to justify your response time to anyone, let alone acquaintances. Everyone has different habits and abilities when it comes to social media, and it's important to prioritize your mental health over a timely reply. 

That being said, if this anxiety is causing you significant distress or impeding your daily activities, it might be a good idea to talk with a mental health professional. They can provide strategies for managing this anxiety and arguably improve your overall interaction with social media. 

Remember, what's key here is not your perceived output (i.e., timely responses to social messages) but your inner peace. Take care of yourself first and know that it's okay to put yourself first. 

Wishing you the best in your journey.

"Hey there,

Thank you for coming forward and being open about what you're experiencing with communication on social media. It's completely normal to feel anxious when it comes to responding to acquaintances or people we don't frequently interact with.

Dealing with anxiety isn't easy, but here are a few tips to help calm your nerves when responding to messages. First, you may want to consider scheduling specific times throughout the day to check and respond to your messages. This way, it becomes part of your routine and gives you some control over the process.

Keep in mind that there is no “right” speed to respond to messages. Everyone has their own pace, and it's okay if you take some time to think through your responses. Instead of feeling guilty about replying late, you could use phrases like ""Sorry for the delay, I wanted to make sure I gave your message the attention it deserved,"" which will help in two ways - it addresses the delay and also compliments the sender. 

Remember, feeling anxious is a shared human experience and it's okay to take baby steps while navigating such situations. And best of all, it sounds like you're already making progress. Keep going! You're doing great."

"Hey there, 

I totally understand where you're coming from and I'm really glad you've decided to talk about this here. There's no right or wrong time to reply to a message - everyone's pace is different and that's okay. It's good that you're trying to reply to people more, so recognize your effort and progress. 

Forgetting to reply or getting too anxious to do so is something a lot of us can relate to. One thing you can do is set a reminder or alarm to reply to the message. This way, you won't forget and you also have a specific set time to reply, which may reduce your anxiety.

Also, you don't necessarily need a ""good enough"" reason to reply late. Everyone has different schedules and priorities. So, don't be too hard on yourself.

Of course, if this social anxiety is seriously affecting your life, it may be helpful to try talking to a professional counselor or psychiatrist. They can provide you with tools and strategies to deal with this effectively. Be gentle with yourself. This journey is all about progress, not perfection."
[32y/o, black female] -- I don't know when exactly it started. Might be around 2019, when my parents took me to this horrible trip to some religious place in the hills. Before this we used to do great trips, London, USA etc which I enjoyed. But then  after this, I've always been uncomfortable/reluctant when it comes to any sort of travelling. Then COVID struck and I was at home for ~2 years, things didn't improve for me- we did go on one trip in 2021 but I was just so anxious dealing with it, and I also had classes so in the entire trip I was attending online classes (cause I had to, a huge test was coming up). My problem is that I'm anxious before the trip happens and during it I'm completely fine. It's gotten better now tho, but not completely cured. Going alone or with friends seems like a mammoth task. Especially since if I go with friends there's no one to control and they would go wild. I know I need to get over this for the future. Any tips?	"Hey there,
First of all, thanks for reaching out and sharing something so personal. It's a big step and we're here to listen and support. It sounds like you're dealing with a form of travel anxiety which might have been triggered by that uncomfortable trip back in 2019. Please know you're not alone. 

Here are a few tips you can try: 

1) Practice visualization: Before your trip, sit in a quiet place, close your eyes and imagine yourself on your journey. Picture yourself going through all the steps from packing, the journey itself to arriving at your destination. This can help eliminate some of the fear associated with travelling.

2) Gradual exposure: Start with short trips around your town before gradually increasing the distance and duration. This will help your brain build up familiarity and reduce anxiety over time. 

3) Confide in friends: If you're comfortable doing so, talk to the friends you're travelling with about your anxiety. They may be able to offer support and accommodate your comfort levels. 

4) Seek professional help: There's no shame in approaching a mental health professional about this. They can provide specific strategies and counselling for overcoming this anxiety.

Finally, don't be too hard on yourself. Overcoming fear and anxiety isn’t about eliminating it completely, but learning to manage it. Stay strong and reach out whenever you need. We're here for you."

"Hello, it sounds like you're dealing with quite a bit of anxiety relating to travel. It can be frustrating when you've come to associate something you once enjoyed with discomfort. First off, it's great that you're making an effort to overcome this. Your willingness to work through this shows a lot of strength.

Remember, it's completely normal to feel apprehensive about travel, especially given the times we're currently living in with the pandemic. Feeling out of control, especially when travelling with friends who may behave unpredictably, could easily heighten this anxiety. 

Start small and slow. Perhaps initiate short, local trips on your own where you feel more in control. It could just be a walk or a drive in your local neighborhood. Since you've mentioned being fine during the trip itself, concentrating on these positive experiences can reinforce your ability to cope and manage the situation. 

When it comes to travelling with friends, it would be a good idea to have some open conversations about your feelings. They might be more willing to accommodate your needs than you realise. Alternatively, you could suggest an itinerary which is less intense and preferably organised, so you would know what to expect. 

Consider seeking professional help too; you don't have to do this alone. Psychologists or therapists could give more personalized advice and equip you with effective anxiety management strategies.

Remember, healing and overcoming fears isn't a race, it's a journey. Go at your own pace. You've already taken a huge step towards progress by acknowledging this issue and seeking help."

"Hey there, it sounds like you're going through a hard time and it's brave of you to reach out. It's understandable you'd be struggling with travel anxiety, especially considering the impact of that one trip and your experience over COVID. It's actually quite normal to feel anxious about an upcoming event or change, but it sounds like it's causing you distress and that's something we can try and tackle.

First things first, practice self-care. This can extend beyond just focusing on physical health, including pursuing hobbies you love, maintaining a good sleep schedule, and eating a balanced diet. 

You could also try mindfulness techniques and grounding exercises that can help manage anxiety. One such technique is the 5-4-3-2-1 grounding exercise: identify five things you can see, four things you can touch, three things you can hear, two things you can smell, and one thing you can taste. This helps to ground you in the present moment, which can often alleviate anticipatory anxiety. 

Additionally, progressive desensitization could help you. This involves gradually exposing yourself to travel in a controlled way, starting with small trips and gradually increasing. 

And finally, if you feel comfortable, talking to a mental health professional could provide a lot of support and guidance. They can provide personalized strategies to manage your anxiety. 

Please remember that you're not alone in this and there are resources available to help you navigate through it. Take care."

You've made a great step sharing your concerns. It seems like your anxiety stems from anticipation. The overly religious trip, combined with the shift in social norms due to the pandemic, could be the root. However, diagnosing anxiety is complex and takes time, so professional help might be needed for a more accurate assessment. 

In terms of advice, I'd suggest trying to pinpoint specific factors that trigger your anxiety about traveling. Is it the change of scenery? Unfamiliar people? Lack of control? Once identified, you can work to address these directly. 

Secondly, try practicing mindfulness. Sounds cliche, but it genuinely helps. Deep breathing exercises, Yoga, and spending quiet time in nature can anchor you in the present moment & lessen anticipatory stress.

Lastly, going on short trips to nearby places might boost your travel confidence bit by bit. Start small, maybe a half-day trip. Then gradually extend the duration.

Remember, your comfort and mental health should always come first. It's okay to express your concerns to your friends and ask for their understanding, or to suggest alternate activities. Also, consider seeking help from a licensed mental health professional if you continue to struggle. You've got this!"

"Hi there, it sounds like a deeply uncomfortable experience during your 2019 trip may have caused some underlying anxiety related to travel. Instead of focusing on the big picture of overcoming all anxiety, perhaps try taking a more gradual approach. This could involve initially going on short trips close to home, either alone or with someone you trust who can provide comfort and control if needed. It's important to control the pace of your progress to ensure you feel comfortable each time you push your boundaries a little further. 

Try to create positive experiences related to travel that can slowly replace the negative associations. Keep some comfort items or engage in activities you enjoy during these trips to make them more enjoyable. Also, sharing your woes and fears with a trusted friend or a counselor could offer more comprehensive strategies to tackle your anxiety. 

Regarding your friends going overboard during trips, it's completely okay to set boundaries in any relationship. Holding open discussions with them regarding your discomfort and anxiety could help establish a more comfortable traveling scenario that suits everyone. Therapy or counseling could also provide you professional help with dealing with anxiety and overcoming these hurdles. Remember, it's okay to go at your pace and there's no rush."

It sounds like you've been dealing with anticipatory anxiety, which is a common issue particularly when it comes to situations like travelling. It's okay to feel this way and the first step is acknowledging the problem, so you're already on the right track. 

To deal with this, you could start by taking baby steps. Begin with less intimidating trips, such as a day trip or a weekend getaway. These short trips might help you to gradually get comfortable with the process again. Make a detailed itinerary and know what to expect from your trip. This can significantly reduce anxiety associated with unknown situations.

Consider picking travel buddies who respect your boundaries and understand your concerns. Travelling with people who understand your needs can provide a more comforting experience. 

Engage in relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing, meditation or yoga to help manage anxiety. Maintaining a regular fitness routine can be beneficial too.

Lastly, consider seeking professional help. Therapy can equip you with tools to manage your anxiety more effectively.

Remember, it's okay to feel anxious. You're not alone in this and there are many who have gotten through it. You can do it too!"

Firstly, it’s brave of you to share your experiences and concerns with us on this platform. We appreciate that!

About your predicament, it seems like you've faced some unpleasant experiences which have influenced your perspective towards travelling. It's quite understandable how the anticipation of a trip can spike anxiety levels, even if you feel fine during the trip.

As an initial step, try associating travel with something you love and enjoy. This might help alter your diaspora towards the concept of travelling. Instead of viewing it as a whole trip, perhaps you can look forward to certain aspects like exploring local cuisines or visiting art museums.

You could also consider starting small. Short day trips with familiar people, visiting places within your comfort zone could help reduce apprehension. As you adjust, gradually increase the duration and maybe even the travel group size.

When it comes to travelling with friends, it's okay to establish boundaries. Honest conversations regarding your anxiety can help your friends understand your feelings and perhaps even make the trip more enjoyable for you.

Lastly, considering you have some anxious tendencies, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) might be beneficial. It's a goal-oriented form of therapy that helps you understand and alter thinking patterns leading to certain behaviours.

Remember, overcoming this anxiety needs time, patience and a bit of self-love. If anxiety levels persist, please consider seeking professional advice. This forum consists of like-minded individuals who wish you the best on your path to recovery. Stay strong!"

Firstly, I want to appreciate your courage for reaching out and openly discussing your concerns. It's not always easy to do so, but it's a major part of the journey towards understanding and addressing your anxiety. 

From what you've shared, it seems like anticipatory anxiety, where you feel anxious even before the event (trip in this case) occurs, is a pressing issue. Based on your description, it's also likely that this anxiety might have stemmed from the ""horrible trip"" that you had in 2019. 

As a good starting point, I would recommend practicing mindfulness techniques such as deep breathing exercises, yoga or meditation. These self-care strategies can help manage your symptoms and promote relaxation both generally and specifically before a trip. 

Alongside this, it might be helpful to gradually expose yourself to travel situations. You don’t have to leap straight into a long trip with friends. Start with small outings that you know will be easier to manage.

Speaking to a mental health professional can also provide further understanding and options for you to manage and eventually overcome this anxiety. They can help unravel if there are deeper issues attached to this anxiety which need to be addressed. 

Lastly, remember it's okay to have anxiety. Accepting that it’s there and letting yourself feel what you are feeling without judgment can often lessen the power it holds over you. 

Take care and persist, you are capable of overcoming this."

Especially since if I go with friends there's no one to control and they would go wild. I know I need to get over this for the future. Any tips?	"Hello! It sounds like you've been through a considerable amount of stress and change these past few years. I'm sorry to hear about the challenges you're dealing with concerning your anxiety around traveling. The good news is that anxiety can be improved a lot with the right strategies. 

One thing that might help is to work on reframing your thoughts about travel. Instead of focusing on the worries, try to think about the positive aspects. Remember the good trips you had before this change in feeling occurred.

Also, breaking down the trip into smaller, more manageable portions might help you deal with the anxiety. Instead of thinking about the entire trip, think in steps- booking the tickets, packing, getting to the airport, etc. 

Practicing mindfulness and relaxation techniques like deep breathing or meditation can be incredibly helpful to lower anxiety levels. These practices can help bring you back to the present moment instead of worrying about future events.

If you continue to struggle with this, it might be helpful to speak with a therapist who can provide personalized strategies and techniques. Remember, it's perfectly okay to reach out for professional help if you need it.

Lastly, consider discussing your fears with your close friends or family. You might be surprised by their understanding and willingness to help make the situation more enjoyable for you. You're not alone in this, after all, we all have our own anxieties and apprehensions. It's all about finding the coping mechanisms that work for you. Stay strong and remember you're more resilient than you give yourself credit for!"
[32y/o, black female] -- I don't know when exactly it started. Might be around 2019, when my parents took me to this horrible trip to some religious place in the hills. Before this we used to do great trips, London, USA etc which I enjoyed. But then  after this, I've always been uncomfortable/reluctant when it comes to any sort of travelling. Then COVID struck and I was at home for ~2 years, things didn't improve for me- we did go on one trip in 2021 but I was just so anxious dealing with it, and I also had classes so in the entire trip I was attending online classes (cause I had to, a huge test was coming up).

Especially since if I go with friends there's no one to control and they would go wild. I know I need to get over this for the future. Any tips?	Hi there, I'm really sorry to hear about your struggle with travel anxiety. First, know that your feelings are valid and it's okay to feel this way. I would suggest starting small. Maybe take some short trips around your area on your own or with someone you're close to and trust, gradually increasing the distance. You could also practice some relaxation techniques such as deep breathing, meditation, or even some light exercises before the journey to help manage your anxiety. Regarding trips with friends, it's perfectly okay to set boundaries or suggest activities that you are comfortable with. Remember, you don't have to rush this. Going at your own pace is important. You might also find it helpful to discuss this with a mental health professional who can provide you with tools and strategies specifically tailored to your situation. Please know you're not alone in dealing with this and there are resources out there to help you.

If you read this im sorry for my little rant. I hope it gets better for all of us."	"Hey, first of all, don't ever apologize for sharing your feelings and thoughts. It's really brave of you to open up about your situation, and know that you're not alone. We're all dealing with something, and it's perfectly okay to feel overwhelmed sometimes.

Dealing with depression is a long journey and it can feel really hard at times, nobody can deny that. Remember that every small step towards progress is a victory, regardless of how many setbacks you encounter. Your feelings are valid, but they don't define you. You are much more than your depression.

Journaling is a great idea! It might feel a bit odd at first or ""dumb"" as you said, but it can be incredibly therapeutic. You can write about your day, about your feelings, or even try to write one thing a day that you are grateful for – it could be something as simple as ""I woke up today and got out of bed"". Start slow and remember to be patient with yourself. 

I'm sorry to hear about your mom, that must be very tough. Keep in mind it's okay to seek counseling support to help cope with the stress of your mom's illness, it can be very helpful.

As for your dad, you could consider seeking social services to assist him. They could potentially provide resources or support that will help fill the gap when you're not able to be there.

Your workload sounds quite heavy - both at work and in your academics. Maybe take some time to really evaluate what your priorities are. It's important to allow yourself time to rest and look after your mental health. If that means saying no to certain commitments, that's okay. 

Remember that it's okay to lean on others for support too. Sometimes just venting to a friend can make a world of a difference. And don't forget about self-care! It might seem unimportant, but doing little things for yourself can improve your mood and reduce anxiety. 

I truly hope things look brighter for you soon. This community is here for you and we're rooting for you. It's okay to feel down, but remember you're stronger than you think. Hang in there, it takes time, but things will get better."

It takes a great deal of courage to reach out and share your feelings. Secondly, there is absolutely no need to apologize for sharing your thoughts and feelings, that's precisely what this space is for. 

Your feelings of emotional stagnation and feeling worn out reveal how much you are carrying on your shoulders right now, and it's completely okay to feel overwhelmed. Everyone from time to time hits this wall where everything feels heavy. 

Caring for a parent with dementia, looking after your father's well-being, managing studies, work, and social life, all on top of wrestling with depression, is a lot for anyone to bear. It is okay to reach out and ask for help - this includes professional, like counsellors, mental health hotlines, or therapists, who can provide you with tailored advice.

You mentioned journaling as something you wanted to try. Remember there's no right or wrong way to journal, it can be just bullet points or a full-on essay about your day or your feelings. 

Utilize every resource available to you - whether that's student counselling services, a trusted professor, local community resources, or the friendships you've developed.

Feeling alone is one of the hardest parts about depression, but please remember that you are not alone. This community is here for you, and there are countless others out there ready to support you during difficult times. 

Remember, it's okay to take time for yourself and prioritize self-care. It's not selfish, but rather necessary for our mental health. Set aside some time to just breathe and do something you love each day, however small it may be.

Please keep reaching out. Please keep talking. These dark times are temporary and you are not alone in this."

Let me start by saying - you're doing an amazing job managing everything that's on your plate right now. It sounds like you're going through a lot, between your studies, work responsibilities, fears regarding your father, and dealing with your mother's diagnosis - all while trying to cope with depression. It takes a lot of strength to handle all of that, so please don't forget to commend yourself for it. 

As for your depression, please remember that it's okay to have dark days and it's okay to seek help. You're not alone. Perhaps you could consider reaching out to a counselor or a therapist at your university? They could provide some helpful coping strategies and give you a safe place to express your feelings.

Journaling is indeed a great outlet, but if it makes you feel uncomfortable, maybe you could try other methods? Some people find solace in art, music or even physical activities such as yoga or jogging. It's all about finding something that helps you destress and manage your feelings better. 

Finally, it's important to care for yourself. Self-care is not selfish. Communicating your feelings with friends, getting enough sleep, eating healthily, and taking some time out for yourself each week can make a huge difference. 

I hope things look up for you soon. Remember, it's okay to ask for help. You're stronger than you think, and you're certainly not alone. This community is here for you."

You are strong, and your resilience is evident by the fact that you are managing so much at once. It's okay to feel overwhelmed in such situations; you are human after all. I appreciate your courage in reaching out and talking about what's going on inside.

As for journaling, it may not seem easy in the beginning, but it can become your best friend. It helps you express those hidden, bottled-up feelings that are hard to release otherwise. Give it another shot, even if you feel 'dumb'. No one else is going to judge you for your journal entries, they're yours and yours alone.

It's heartbreaking to hear about your mom, and I admire you for stepping up. I'm not a professional caregiver, but I would suggest looking into resources that can aid you in understanding and dealing with your mom's dementia at a deeper level.

Regarding your dad, it's indeed scary but remember, you can only support him sustainably if you take care of yourself first. Maybe hint at him getting some professional help or join a social club where he could engage with others. Balancing that with your studies and your job is extremely demanding, so maybe consider seeking help regarding time management, prioritizing, and organizing effectively.

You're not alone, even if it feels that way. It's okay to lean on others; we all need help from time to time. Reconnect with your friends, let them know what you're going through. True friendships withstand time and distance. Meanwhile, remember, this community is here for you. Stay strong!"

It sounds really tough, but remember, it shows a lot of strength in you. It's absolutely ok to get things off your chest and not be upbeat all the time. That's just part of being human. 

Starting with journaling is a great step. It can be as short or as in-depth as you want and you don't have to share it with anyone until you're ready, if ever. It might help you to navigate your thoughts.

I'm truly sorry to hear about your mom. Feeling like you've lost your main support person must be really hard. As for your dad, could you connect him to community resources? Senior centers, home health aides, and similar services can be really helpful. 

Lastly, even though it may feel as if you're alone, there are people out there willing to support you. You might find comfort in finding organizations related to what you’re going through or support groups that you can join. It's okay to lean on friends, too. 

And remember, you're allowed to prioritize yourself. It's not selfish to set boundaries and take care of your own mental health. We're all hoping for better days with you. You're not alone in this. Sending you a lot of strength and virtual comfort.

Your emotions and experiences are valid. It's clear you're going through a lot right now and trying to balance a number of heavy responsibilities: managing your mental health, being there for your family, handling academic pressures, and maintaining friendships all at the same time. It's perfectly normal to feel overwhelmed, but remember you are not alone in this.

A lot of us have been or are currently in a similar place, and reaching out like you just did is a huge step forward. Journaling is indeed a great way to make sense of your thoughts and feelings but if it feels awkward that's completely okay too. It might help to focus on just getting your thoughts down without worrying about how it comes out, it's for you, and no one else has to see it.

As for your dad, I’d suggest looking into resources available to him such as support groups, homecare or check out community organizations that cater to his health needs. Perhaps your university also has resources that could be of help. Most of all, please remember to take care of yourself. You are important.

The feeling of burnout is not only valid but also very real. Don't hesitate to set boundaries to protect your own mental health. It’s hard, but it doesn’t mean you’re doing anything wrong. 

I'm really sorry to hear about your mom. That has to be tough, especially when you’re used to leaning on her for support. Please consider seeking professional help, if you haven't already, as therapists and counselors can provide tools and techniques to cope with these challenges. Or even exploring online therapy - sometimes it's just comforting to have a warm, professional voice to help you navigate through life’s hard moments.

You are strong and resilient, remind yourself of this often. You're not alone and you're doing the best you can. That brings hope. This community is here for you, keep reaching out when you need to, no matter how big or small it seems. We're in this together. Hang in there buddy, it does get better."

First off, there's no need to apologise - we're all here to support each other. I'm really sorry to hear you're feeling this way, but I'm unable to provide the help that you need. It's really important to talk things over with someone who can, though, such as a mental health professional or a trusted person in your life. 

Aside from reaching out to a mental health professional, I'd also advise seeking out some form of counseling or therapy on your university’s campus - they often have fantastic resources. And, don't forget, you can always talk to trusted professors or members of your university about what’s going on.

Remember, prioritizing self-care isn't selfish. Balancing university, a social life, and a job can be overwhelming, let alone when you're also caring for others. Reach out to social services in your area to see if there's any additional support for your father; they could provide respite or additional services that could help alleviate some of your worries.

Your feelings are valid and it's okay to feel this way. You don't have to go through this alone, there are people who want to help. Thank you for reaching out in this forum.
  
Take care of yourself. It very much can get better. You are not alone. You matter. You are loved. You are enough. Hold on. Keep going. We're rooting for you."

You're dealing with an important, challenging time in your life, between taking care of your dad and trying to balance school and work on top of it. Burn out is a very real thing and it sounds like you're dealing with a lot of stress.

You're amazing for doing all you can for your dad, your studies, and your job. I hope you recognize that. But also remember, you're a person too, and you need your own care and attention. Please consider reaching out to any trustworthy people in your life and sharing your struggles. You don't have to carry this load alone.

And keep in mind, if you ever feel like things are getting a bit too much, seeking help from a mental health professional can be incredibly beneficial. They can provide the resources and techniques to help you navigate through everything.

Lastly, remember that you can always come here to share and ask for advice or just to vent. It can feel lonely sometimes but you're not alone. We're all in this together with you.

Please remember that your feelings and emotions are valid, and no apology is needed for expressing them. Your story is not just a rant; it is a testament to your strength for dealing with various challenges in life.

Acknowledging your personal psychological state is a step forward. It’s okay to have relapses, it’s okay to feel down sometimes, and it’s okay to ask for help. Depression is real, and you're not alone in this.

Journaling could be a helpful tool. Start with small steps. Write down what you feel, and read it back to yourself to better understand your emotions. It’s a powerful way to explore what you might be needing or missing.

Being a caregiver to your mom and having concerns for your dad along with your work and academic priorities indeed sound overwhelming. Try to reach out to local dementia or caregiving support groups where you can share your experiences, and gain some insights or advice on managing these situations.

Remember, self-care is not selfish. You alone cannot take on the responsibility of your parents' health. Your dad needs professional help and supervision considering his heart condition. It’s important for you to thrive as well, for which you must ensure that you're taking care of yourself in the first place.

Try seeking professional help if you haven't yet. Reach out to the mental health services available in your area or engage online therapists. Your university might have counseling centers, free for students.

Don't isolate yourself. Peer support matters, talk to your friends, explain your burnouts, they will understand. You might be surprised by how much it eases the burden you’re feeling. 

Remember, it's okay if scores fall, friends stop texting, or night-outs get missed. Take a pause, breathe, prioritize, and resume.

Here’s to your courage for opening up and seeking help. Things can get better, and remember, the journey to better mental health is not linear but circuitous, so embrace the pace of your journey."

Firstly, there is no reason to apologize for expressing your feelings and reaching out. It's a brave and necessary step towards recovery. To put it in a simple way, you're holding too many candles and it's becoming overwhelming. It's important to remember that seeking professional help should be your primary course of action because mental health matters are delicate and demand well-informed guidance.

You've shown strength in finding an outlet, such as this platform, to express everything you've kept cooped up. Using this as a stepping stone, you might want to give journaling another chance. Writing can be therapeutic and help you self-reflect effectively.

Dealing with a loved one's dementia is a heart-wrenching experience. Online resources and support groups related to dementia could provide some perspective on how others cope in similar situations. They can also function as spaces to express your sentiments and fears regarding your mom's condition. 

It seems like you've got a lot on your plate, so it's no surprise that you're feeling burned out. It's crucial for you to communicate this to your friends so that they're able to support you during this challenging time. 

Sending much warmth your way. Remember, it's okay not to be okay all the time and it's okay to seek help and reach out. We're all fighting our own battles, and it's the reaching out and connecting that makes them feel less daunting. You are not alone."
"[32y/o, black female] -- So I have decided to well distance myself from most of my friends. The reason why is even though i seem to be getting better. The people around me keep getting hurt because of me. But there’s not reason for me to get rid of my friends that I don’t see in person anymore so there’s no reason to worry about them because they did seem to get hurt. 
     The reason why the people around me are getting hurt is because of me. Now that I have show more emotion I tend to lose control over my emotions and when I do I try to control it but it just makes me angry. After that I would say things I don’t mean or physically hurt the people around me. I don’t mind the looks I get but I don’t want to hurt the people I care about I just want to protect them but if I can’t even stop myself from hurting then the how am I supposed to stop others. 
     I really am just looking for some advice or if anyone really knows what is going oh I haven’t been in the right mindset for a while now and I don’t think this will help me in anyway."	"It's brave of you to recognize that your current state might be causing harm to those around you, and wanting to change. It can be a very tough cycle to be in, and I can tell you're keen on breaking free from it. This emotional turmoil you're expressing is not uncommon, and many people have struggled with it and have found ways to manage and grow from it. 

If possible, seeking professional help can be an invaluable step. Therapists and counselors are skilled with helping people navigate complex emotions and can provide strategies for gaining emotional control. Additionally, don't be shy about reaching out to your friends about this, especially those you mentioned who aren't physically around you. Emotional support can come from unlikely places, and it's possible they may understand more than you think.

It's also worth noting that self-care isn't selfish. Find activities that offer you tranquility, peacefulness, and an outlet for releasing negative emotions. This could be anything from exercise, meditation, listening to calming music, or practicing hobbies you enjoy. It's all about finding what works uniquely for you.

Always remember you're not alone in this. It may not be an overnight process, something to bear in mind, but improvement and change is not beyond your reach. Keep reminding yourself of your worth and the positive change you’re capable of bringing in your life."

Thank you for reaching out and sharing your feelings and experiences. It sounds like you're going through a very difficult time right now. Managing emotions can indeed be a challenge, and it's brave of you to acknowledge their impact on yourself and those around you. 

It's encouraging that you are keen to lessen the negative impacts of losing control over your emotions. That said, it's crucial to seek out professional guidance--whether it be a psychologist, therapist, or psychiatrist--to develop healthier coping mechanisms, learn anger management strategies, and better understand any underlying issues that may be contributing to your emotional struggles.

For daily self-management, consider mindfulness techniques such as deep breathing, meditation, journaling, or physical activities to vent your feelings in a more positive or neutral manner. In the case of heated or highly emotional moments, stepping away for a little while can provide the needed calmness to regain control. Remember, it's okay to communicate that you need some space.

Being self-aware of our own emotional responses and the impact on those around us is an important part of our journey towards mental wellness. You're taking the first steps by reaching out for advice and recognizing your own patterns. This self-awareness and desire for change are indicators that you've got the strength to progress.

I urge you to seek help as soon as possible to ensure the well-being of yourself and those you are concerned about. You're not alone in this. Stay strong and take care!"

First off, I want you to know that it's brave of you to recognize and articulate these feelings. It can be tough. What you've mentioned about your emotional control does sound quite frustrating. We tend to underestimate how much control our emotional health has over our lives and relationships. It can feel like we're always two steps behind it, but what's important is that you're not alone in this.

Something that might benefit you is exploring different ways of handling and expressing your emotions that don't harm others or yourself. This could be through things like writing, painting, or even dance - whatever allows you to express your feelings without causing harm to anyone else.

Consider confiding in a trusted friend or family member about what you're going through. Sometimes, having another perspective and support can be a game changer. Keep in mind, it's okay to ask for help.

Lastly, professional help such as therapists or counselors can provide insights and coping mechanisms that are tailored to you and your situation. Their advice can help you to understand your emotions better and gradually regain control over them. I really recommend considering it - it's worked for a lot of people in similar situations.

Remember, there is no magic answer here but taking one step at a time can eventually lead you to better places. Good luck, and we're here for you."

First off, I want to say you're definitely not alone in what you're experiencing. Plenty of individuals have addictive personalities and it's not something exclusively related to drug or alcohol use. Indeed, it can involve food, behavior, and even feelings. Breaking the cycle can be challenging, but it's certainly not impossible. 

You've already made the first steps by acknowledging the pattern and expressing a desire to change it, which should be commended. One of the most important factors to note is that when dealing with such issues, self-compassion is paramount. Don't beat yourself up about past habits- focus on progress. 

Have you ever tried seeking professional help like a mental health therapist or counselor? Ones who specialize in addictive behaviors may be able to provide fresh and effective strategies that are personalized to your situation. 

Also, it could be beneficial to try to shift your addictive energies towards something more constructive and positive, like a new hobby or regular exercise. Physical activities can be a wonderful outlet and a new hobby could provide a rewarding focus. 

Remember, it's a process, and there can be bumps along the road, but every small victory is still a victory. Change is definitely possible and I wish you all the best in your journey.

A professional can guide you through understanding and managing these feelings better.

Also, replacing unhealthy addictions with healthier ones can be of immense benefit. Try pursuing hobbies that are beneficial to your wellbeing, such as exercising, cooking, painting, reading, etc. These activities can channel your need for routine and dependence in a much more positive manner.

I'm really sorry to hear you're struggling with this. It's definitely not easy to handle addiction, especially when it permeates multiple aspects of your life. It's important to know that you're not alone in this. 

The first step, which you've already taken, is acknowledging that you have this addictive behavior. That self-awareness is crucial in addressing it. It might be helpful to seek professional help if you haven't already. This can seem daunting, but therapists and counselors are trained in these areas and can provide ways to manage it. 

Support groups can also provide insights and are a safe space where you can talk to people who have gone through the same. Try to focus on the progress you're making, even if it feels slow. Don't be hard on yourself when you struggle or relapse; change is often filled with ups and downs but remember that progress isn't linear.

Another method that might help is substitution with healthier habits or hobbies. So when you feel the urge to engage with your addiction, it's redirected to something positive. This may take time and patience but remember to be gentle with yourself. You're fighting a challenging battle, but you're not alone. You're strong and brave for trying to face it, keep going. Always keep an open communication line with your support system whether they're friends, family, or experts. Know that it's okay to ask for help. You're not alone in this journey.

"Hey there, I'm really sorry to hear about what you're going through. It's incredibly strong of you to acknowledge and vocalize your struggles. For some, chronic addiction seems to have a 'whack-a-mole' pattern - as soon as you eliminate one, another emerges. Addiction is often a coping mechanism for trauma or emotions one is unable to handle. With your childhood experiences, it seems like you might be battling some unresolved issues that may need professional assistance. Therapy (especially Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) tends to be very effective in dealing with addictive personalities, as it helps tackle the root cause. 

Remember, it's also crucial to build a support network around you. Isolating yourself can exacerbate addiction. Joining a local support group can be beneficial, too. It's comforting to know you're not alone in this struggle. Most importantly, remember to be patient and kind to yourself. Change is not a straight path; it's a winding road with ups and downs. It takes time, but trust in yourself; you're stronger than you think. Feel free to reach out if you need someone to talk to. You're not alone in this."

Firstly, thank you for sharing your struggle openly. It takes immense courage to unveil such personal experiences. Know that it's completely understandable to feel overwhelmed and you're not alone in this journey. 

Sounds like you've identified a pattern of obsessive behavior, which is often the first step towards recovery. A great move in the right direction. But remember, breaking any loop isn't easy and it's okay to ask for professional support. Many psychiatric services specialize in addiction recovery and can provide more structured and personalized guidance.

In the meantime, consider exploring some form of therapy, like Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), which may help identify thought-patterns and behaviors that contribute to your repetitive addictive cycles. Additionally, finding a healthy habit to substitute an unhealthy one can be an effective strategy. Remember, it's okay to take time and have setbacks in the process; change isn't necessarily linear and the most important part is that you continue trying.

A dedicated support group could be helpful as well. Speaking to others experiencing the same struggles can provide certain insights and strategies, or at the very least, remind you that you're not alone in this struggle. 

Always remember, it's okay to reach out, to ask for help, and take your journey towards recovery at your own pace. You're stronger than you think!"
"[32y/o, black female] --      So ima just keep this short, but most of my life I’ve never gotten attention from my parents.

But according to my mom I have an addict personality, and to be honest I don’t disagree with her I have been addicted to many things and not only just the harmful stuff but specific foods and things that might not seem harmful.

     The reason why she said this is because she has plenty of evidence to support it.

Firstly, I want to tell you that you are incredibly brave for reaching out and sharing your story. It's not an easy thing to do but shows a clear indication of the strength you possess. You're taking the first steps towards addressing your addictive tendencies by acknowledging them and this is a very crucial part of improving your situation. 

From your description, it seems like you have what's known as an ""addictive personality."" This is a tendency to rapidly form strong attachments or addictions to behaviors, substances, or activities. You should know that it's not your fault and doesn't make you weak or bad – it's simply a challenging aspect of your personality that you can learn to manage.

To address this, consider seeking professional help. Psychologists or therapists are equipped with the right knowledge and expertise to provide methods and strategies to manage and possibly overcome these tendencies. It's also advisable to join a support group where you can share your experiences and struggles without feeling judged or misunderstood.

While undergoing these steps, remember to engage in activities you enjoy and are passionate about. This will provide a positive outlet for your energy. Also, regular physical activity can help manage addictive behaviors and promote mental well-being, so consider incorporating some form of exercise into your daily routine.

Lastly, remember you're not alone in this struggle. Many people deal with similar situations and have successfully managed. Don't hesitate to reach out to these communities for support and encouragement.

Stay strong! There's so much potential within you, and the path may be difficult, but it's leading you somewhere beautiful."

It sounds like you're managing a lot at the moment, and I want to recognize how brave you are for sharing this. You're definitely not alone, many people struggle with addictive behaviors. You mentioned that you're unsure of how to stop this cycle, and that's a common feeling. 

One approach you may consider is practicing mindfulness and self-compassion. You can start by observing your thoughts, feelings, and actions without judgement to understand your triggers better. Then, try showing some kindness to yourself; remember that everyone has struggles and it's okay to have ups and downs. 

You may also find it beneficial to reach out to a professional who specializes in addictive behaviors. They could provide you with tailored strategies that could help you understand and manage your addictive behaviors more effectively. 

Engaging in physical activities, maintaining social connections with supportive people, and taking time for hobbies and interests can also serve as healthy outlets. 

Remember, everyone's journey is different. Don't get too disheartened if you stumble along the way. Those stumbles are key to finding what methods really work for you. Be patient with yourself; slow progress is still progress. 

Take care!"

It's really brave of you to do so. The encouraging part is that you're aware of your improvements, no matter how small they seem. It's a big step forward. The fact that you're trying to manage your sleep, have had some good moments and are seeing improvements in your mood signals growth. I recommend you take it one day at a time, as healing is not linear. 

I understand that seeing a psychiatrist can be scary, but take it as a chance to share your feelings, and possibly find a solution for your feelings of self hatred. It seems you're already aware that your medication may need adjustment, which just goes to show the seriousness with which you're addressing this issue. You're strong, stronger than you realize. 

Remember, it's okay to ask for help and seek support. It’s not a linear journey, it’s okay to have days where you feel you've not made progress. Know that you're not alone in this. Take your own pace, and be kind to yourself. I'm cheering for you on the other side of the screen. You can do this!"

I'm really glad you took the time to share all this with us. You've already made some important steps towards understanding your feelings, acknowledging them and accepting that it's okay to not be fine all the time.

Try to remember there is absolutely no rush to 'get better' and it's perfectly okay to take things slowly. Recovery is not a race, so give yourself the grace to move at your own pace. 

It's wonderful to hear that you were able to have a good conversation with someone and it brought you some joy - little moments like these can be so important. 

As for your appointment with the psychiatrist, it's fine that you didn't go this time. It can be scary, especially when you're already feeling vulnerable. It's brave of you to consider making changes to your medication and this is something that can be discussed with them when you're ready to go. Remember, it's okay to be scared, but don't let fear prevent you from getting the help you need.

We're all here for you, even if that simply means providing you with a safe space to express your feelings. Don't hesitate to reach out if you need more support or just a chat to distract yourself."

It sounds like you're on a journey of healing and I want to let you know that it's OK to take it slow. Improving your mental health and quality of life is a step-by-step process. It's really insightful that you recognize happiness in small things, like having a pleasant conversation. Those moments do matter, and they can serve as reminders that positivity exists, even on the difficult days.

Remember, it's perfectly okay to be scared about visiting your psychiatrist. Many people experience this fear. It's a big step in addressing your mental health concerns. Believe it or not, just considering the idea of going is a step in the right direction! Changing medication can often feel scary, but it's great that you're considering what's best for your health.

It sounds like you have a lot of self-awareness and insight into what you're feeling, which is a very helpful tool in overcoming these struggles. Self-love can be a journey, but remember, it's okay to have bad days. 

From your post, it seems like your sadness is decreasing - you're down to a 4 from a 9, which is progress! Remember, it's okay not to be okay. Everyone has ups and downs, and it's okay to reach out when you're feeling this way. 

Keep reaching out in spaces like this, keep engaging in those little things that bring you joy, and please - when you feel up to it, consider that trip to the psychiatrist. No pressure, it's all in your time."

Firstly, I'm really sorry to hear that you're feeling this way, but I'm unable to provide the help that you need. It's really important to talk things over with someone who can, though, such as a mental health professional or a trusted person in your life. 

However, I want to say that growth and healing definitely take time, and it's commendable that you are aware of your own progress. Celebrate even the tiny steps forward, like thinking about getting to your psychiatrist, having a good conversation, and the fact that your pain has lessened somewhat compared to last week. 

You are correct, you can't change everything in one night, and there's no shame in that. Each of us has our own pace. As for your sleep, perhaps, you might want to look into various relaxation techniques which may help improve your sleep schedule.

And remember, it's completely okay to feel alone sometimes, but also remember it's okay to reach out for support. You might not feel strong yet, but the fact you're pushing through despite everything proves just how strong you are. Keep going forward, one step at a time. You're doing great!

Take care."

It sounds like you're going through a tough time but I'm really proud of you for speaking out and expressing your feelings, that takes a lot of courage. Genuine self-expression is the first step towards recovery. Remember, healing isn't linear, it's okay not to be okay all the time. It's brilliant that your sadness levels have decreased and remember, even the smallest steps are signs of progress.

Furthermore, it's commendable how you are choosing to perceive pain as part of your journey. This mindset will aid your healing.

Did you enjoy the conversation you had? That happy feeling is powerful, it's okay to hold on to moments like that. They mean everything. 

Talking to a psychiatrist can indeed feel really challenging, but it can also be incredibly helpful. Try to remember they're there to help, and it's perfectly fine to be scared. Reward yourself for these steps, even just thinking about going to see them is progress as well.

The fact that you've identified a need to change your medication is insightful. Would it help for you to have someone supportive accompany you to a psychiatrist appointment? 

You're not alone, even though it may feel like that sometimes. It's okay to lean on others. You've done really well to express yourself here, and your English is great. Keep pushing forward, each step is one closer to feeling better. You're stronger than you realise.

The small changes you mention, like your pleasant conversation and the improvement in your emotional wellbeing from last week, are signs of progress. It's great that you recognize those positive moments, even in the midst of challenges. 

It's okay to feel fears about going to your psychiatrist, but remember they're there to help and support you. It might be helpful to reach out to friends or loved ones and ask them to accompany you to your appointments if possible or even just to talk about your fears.

Remember, a journey of a thousand miles starts with a single step. It's okay to start small. It's okay to take one day at a time. We're here for you. 

Investing in therapy is investing in your mental health, you matter and your health matters. Once you're ready, try reaching out to your psychiatrist or consider switching to someone who you feel more at ease with. And remember, it's okay not to be okay.

It truly takes a lot of courage to share your thoughts and feelings amongst strangers, so I wanted to commend you for that first. 

It's tough, isn't it? Finding stable ground when life keeps shifting beneath you. But you're absolutely right, change occurs slowly and gradually. Nothing happens overnight. The fact that you're aware of this is a step in the right direction.

It’s crucial to remember that it's okay to have dark thoughts, and it's even more okay to acknowledge them. It's part of being human. You're not alone in this. Many of us have been through these roads and come out stronger. Your feelings of loneliness are valid and recognized.

It sounds like that conversation you had was a nice relief during these trying times. It's amazing how even the smallest connections can bring us a moment of happiness, isn't it? 

Now about your psychiatrist, it's understandable, considering the circumstances, to be scared. The decision to seek help can be a daunting one. But you're thinking about it and that's the best first step. Maybe next time, it'll be a little less scary. It sounds like the need for adjusting the medicine is acknowledged by you, which is a positive stride in looking out for yourself.

Rating your sadness at a 4/10 as opposed to your previous 9/10 is indeed progress! So, let's celebrate those small victories. It's important to focus on these improvements as they show you that things can, and will, get better.

Remember, it's okay not to feel strong all the time. it's okay to have bad days. Ultimately, you're a human being, not a machine. It's okay to take time for yourself and to rest. After all, healing is not a race, but a journey.

Keep going, keep fighting. We believe in you. You're stronger than you think. Sending virtual hugs your way. You’re not alone in this journey.**"

Thank you for sharing this with us. Remember, no victory is too small when it comes to mental health, and whilst the journey may sometimes feel slow and challenging, every step forward is a significant one. Although you're still not feeling your best, it sounds like you're making some progress from last week, and, for that, you should be proud.

Also, having a little bit of a good conversation with someone is a great thing to realize, and I encourage you to look for more positive moments in your day. Small wins and all.

Remember, attending a psychiatrist isn't supposed to be a burden - You might want to see it as an ally in your journey towards feeling better. You needn't rush it or force yourself, do it at your own pace. Next time, it's okay to simply walk in, even if you don't want to speak much. 

Moreover, take the necessary steps to get your sleep schedule back on track. Sleep is vital for our physical and mental health. Even small steps in that direction can make a huge difference.

Pain surely is part of the journey, but it does not define it. It's also filled with growth, self-discovery, and resilience. Keep going on, your strength and courage are admirable.

Take care and remember to celebrate your small victories along the way. Your bravery is inspiring.

Stay strong,

My partner hates my job, I just got it in January and we moved in together in February. Having to be on call for work has made me realize how “on call” I am for everything. They can’t accept the fact that I have to help out this restaurant with any problems they have on any given day. And I can’t accept the fact they have an extra set of expectations of me that I’m always failing. 

So I am consistently not meeting expectations for my personal life and my private life and I just hate it all. IT ALL FEELS LIKE WORK. 

I need help. I feel too uncomfortable and insecure to seek in person help so idk what else to do. I live very close to the tallest bridge in my state and people jump from it often. I just want to be another number for that jump list. I want my family to grieve my death for a couple days then just please forget about me. 

Secretly waiting for my parents to pass away, the I feel like I can actually kill myself without causing too much trauma for them. My siblings and friends will move on they all have their own families at this point and I will be just a memory or a picture on the wall. 

I’m just so tired of every day being work, but it’s not even my jobs fault. It only brought it to my attention."	failed

"[32y/o, black female] -- I have no friends aside from one from primary school who I infrequently catch up with. I really just find most people not to be worth talking to, as I find it hard to connect with many people due to my lack of shared interests and my social anxiety.

However, I often feel lonely and kinda sad especially when I see people who are having a good time with their friends.

I did actually have a weird experience making a friend just recently though, but he's way older than me so it's a bit weird to hang out in person. I noticed he had an interest in something I really liked, and we had this great chat for about 10 minutes. It flowed so smoothly, and it was super passionate. We still message each other every couple of days.

Can anyone else relate to this?"	"I totally understand how you're feeling. It can be really challenging to find people you resonate with, and when you finally do, it's almost scary due to its rarity. Don't feel bad about finding it hard to connect with many people. It might not necessarily be because of social anxiety or lack of shared interests; sometimes people just don't click and that’s okay too.

It's great to hear about this new friend you've made recently! The age difference should not really matter if you get along well. Remember that everyone has something unique to bring to the table - an older friend can offer wisdom, different perspectives, and life experiences that you might not encounter amongst your own age group. Don't feel awkward, embrace the differences!

Lastly, feeling lonely and even a bit sad at times is a part of life that many, if not all, of us experience. It's perfectly okay to feel this way. Just remember that it's crucial to love yourself first and foremost, enjoy your own company and to do things that make you happy. As you grow more comfortable with yourself and as your passions flourish, you might find like-minded individuals along the way that become great companions.

Stay strong and keep pushing, you're doing better than you think you are!"

Just to reassure you, lots of people find it hard to connect with others, particularly if their interests aren't mainstream. What you're experiencing doesn't make you an outsider. We all have our own paths and comfort zones.

Your experience of building a connection based on shared interests sounds really positive. Don't worry too much about age; instead, focus on the quality of the conversation and how he makes you feel. After all, friendship isn't bound by age.

Consider using your passions or hobbies to meet like-minded individuals. Join local groups or online communities that focus on your interests, where you can find people who ""speak your language"". Volunteering can also be a great way to meet people who care about the same things you do.

Remember, it's your comfort that matters the most. Try little steps. Take your time. The main goal is to enjoy what you're doing and who you're doing it with. 

Feel free to share more about your interests and perhaps I or others on this forum may have recommendations for specific groups that you could consider joining or activities you'd enjoy. You're not alone, even though it often feels that way. We're listening."

Can anyone else relate to this?"	"Hey there,

Firstly, I want to reassure you that you're not alone in feeling this way. Many of us struggle to connect with people, particularly if we have interests that are not shared by many. Feeling lonely and sad when we see others socializing is a highly relatable sentiment, even for those who seem to have a large circle of friends.

Social anxiety can make these feelings even more challenging, so I applaud your courage in reaching out and sharing your feelings here - it's a significant step towards better understanding and managing those feelings.

As for the recent experience with your older friend - friendships don't always align with our age, and often, they are built on shared interests and mutual respect, as you've found. Communicating frequently and comfortably with each other suggests that you've found a meaningful connection, so don't discount it based solely on the age difference.

Consider exploring your interests further; there may be communities, clubs, or online groups where you can meet like-minded individuals. This could potentially lead to more satisfying social interactions.

Remember, it's okay to have a smaller circle of friends. Quality always outweighs quantity when it comes to relationships. Keep in mind that it's normal for relationships to develop at different speeds for different people, so don't pressurize yourself.

Wishing you the best as you navigate through this, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need further support or just need to express your feelings. You're stronger than you think!"

It's great that you've found a connection with someone recently, and it's important to value these connections, no matter how they are shaped. Friendship doesn't always confine itself to age, so it's okay to have friends who are older or younger as long as the bond is strong and healthy. 

Maybe it could be worth it to find more people who share this particular interest of yours that you discussed with your new friend? Joining online groups, forums or attending local events (if it's safe with COVID-19) could be a great way to meet like-minded people. 

Yes, social anxiety can make these situations difficult, but remember it's okay to take small steps. Connecting on a shared hobby or interest can make things feel less daunting too. 

You're stronger than you realize! Keep powering through these feelings, and keep reaching out like you've done here. You're already making progress by recognizing these feelings, and reaching out for shared experiences and advice. This is a really positive step. Take care!"

I definitely relate to your comfort in solitude yet yearning for interaction at the same time! Staying connected with the right people, however, can be challenging especially when shared interests are not plenty. Celebrate those interests you do have! Including the one with your older friend - the dynamic might be as enriching as it is unique. There is nothing unusual about having friends of different age groups. 

I'm not discounting the impact of social anxiety, it can indeed make conversations more challenging. One way to manage this is by immersing yourself in environments that support your interests. This enables you to engage in familiar conversations while gradually building confidence. Meanwhile, taking time to understand what you truly enjoy can present opportunities to explore new interests, which might lead to meeting more like-minded individuals.

Also, remember that it's okay to have periods of solitary reflection and that it's completely healthy. Just remember to strike a balance. These feelings of loneliness and sadness are valid, it's essential to talk it out, maybe even with a mental health professional. They can provide guidance suited to your individual needs and help make this journey a little easier.

Stay strong, you're not alone in this."

Considering your interest in one particular aspect you shared with this new friend, it's not niche interests or social anxiety that are the roadblocks but potentially not being in environments where you can meet people with shared interests. 

Given that your experience with this individual was positive, I would suggest exploring spaces (online or in person) related to this interest of yours. Especially ones designed for that interest with people in your age group to balance out the dynamics. 

You may also want to consider social anxiety therapy or support groups to help identify and manage any anxiety triggers you have. It's completely okay to reach out for professional help to cope with social anxiety, and doing so could significantly enhance your experiences and relationships. 

Remember, it's okay if things take time and not all connections work out as friendships. It's about finding individuals who share your interests, understand your anxiety and are respectful of your feelings and experiences."

Can anyone else relate to this?"	"Hello there,

I totally understand where you're coming from. It can feel unfortunate when you've got a deep passion for something but can't find many people who share those same interests as you. But remember, those with unique interests often make the most interesting people!

Feeling lonely is a common human experience, especially in a world where we're constantly exposed to people portraying their 'happy moments' on social media. However, it's important to remember that everyone's social journey is different. Some people make tons of friends very easily while others take time and build meaningful relationships more slowly.

I really admire the connection you made with the older gentleman. Age shouldn't restrict friendships, especially when there's a shared passion involved. These kinds of relationships can often yield a great deal of wisdom and perspective.

Perhaps, exploring more about your interests and finding related communities can help you connect with like-minded people, either via social media groups, local clubs, or attending events. And with social anxiety, it's normal to feel a tad overwhelmed initially, but that's okay. It gets easier with every interaction.

It's your unique journey and it's okay to take all the time you need. Your worth isn't measured by the number of friends you have, but by the quality of relationships you build. Remember, it's okay to reach out and ask for help if things become overwhelming. Professional resources are only a call away."

Can anyone else relate to this?"	"Hi there,

First and foremost, remember, you're not alone in how you feel, and it's perfectly valid to have these feelings. A lot of us can relate to having a hard time making connections and feeling uncomfortable in social situations. It's brave of you to reach out and share your experiences, so kudos for that!

It seems like you've already made a step forward by forming a connection with the person who shares your interest. Although the age difference might make you feel awkward, keep in mind friendships can come in all shapes and sizes. The most important part is that you two connect on a meaningful level, and age becomes secondary.

Certainly, social anxiety poses a challenge when it comes to forging new relationships, but remember that anxiety isn't who you are - it's a circumstance you're coping with. Equipping yourself with some coping strategies may help. Consider things like breathing exercises or mindfulness to help ground you in moments of anxiety.

You might also consider looking online for groups related to your interests. That way, you could potentially meet like-minded people who share your passions. It might lessen the pressures of socializing, as the focus would be more on the shared interests rather than on the social interaction itself.

Remember that it's okay to have a small social circle or even need a lot of alone time. We are all unique in our needs and there is no ""normal."" Take steps at your own pace and remember self-care is essential too. 

Hang in there."

You are not alone in feeling this way and there's nothing 'wrong' with you- our different qualities and struggles make us who we are.

The recent friendship you made sounds like a great positive step. Age really shouldn't constrain friendship, as long as there's a shared respect and connection. Sounds to me like you've found something special there!

It could be helpful to explore shared-interest groups or forums online, such as subreddits for particular hobbies or interests you have. This can often be less stressful than in-person interaction and might give you the chance to make some connections. Also, consider seeking professional help for your social anxiety - there's so much they can do to help these days!

In the meantime, we're glad that you reached out, and feel free to share more about your experiences. Your feelings are valid and it's okay to have ups and downs. Remember, you're not alone in this journey!"

Sometimes it can be difficult to find people with shared interests and it's even harder when social anxiety comes into play. But, remember, connection takes time and every relationship starts with that one shared interest.

It's great you had a positive chat with someone recently! Age shouldn't be a barrier if you both are getting something positive out of the interaction. Maybe you could suggest a casual meet up, like a coffee or a walk? This could provide a relaxed atmosphere where you can chat about your shared interest.

Also consider joining social groups or clubs that revolve around your interests. It could be an online forum, meetup group or even a local class. This can provide a platform to meet people who share similar interests as you.

And remember, it's okay to feel lonely sometimes, don't beat yourself up about it. It's part of being human. If you're feeling down frequently though, consider reaching out to a mental health professional who can give you the tools to manage these feelings. You're not alone in your journey, we've got your back."
