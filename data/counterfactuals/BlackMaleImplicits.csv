"I live with my parents, who have no idea how bad my depression is. They think my room is messy because I'm lazy, but in reality, I just don't have the strength to clean it. Imma say as a 32yo, finding solace in spending time with my girl helps, but it doesn't solve the sensory issues which make cleaning harder. My room isn't even messy anymore; it's filthy. I mostly struggle with managing my bin, which has resulted in a rat infestation in my room. My parents don't know, and I'm scared to tell them in case they get mad. But I don't know how to fix it on my own, especially since I don't do well with things like that. Unfortunately, I need to get my room clean in a week, and I just don't know what to do. I've always struggled with cleaning, but my depression has made everything so much harder, so I'm very worried that it won't get done in time. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you."
"My dad just died, and my mom wants me to hang out with her all the time. I've never liked doing casual things with her, and I'm very independent. Imma say as a 32yo, balancing time with my girl and handling my mom's constant need for my presence is challenging. I don't know how to tell her to leave me alone. The best relationship we ever had was when I lived in another state. I moved back because of my dad, but now he's gone. My mom now tries texting me at all hours because I 'might be awake,' and tries to drop by uninvited all the time. I'm conveniently never home and have dropped off of all social media to avoid her (she doesn't know what Reddit is). Worst is when she drops in to open events that I regularly attend; like I can't tell her to leave any more than anyone else there, but I also don't want to go somewhere she can invite herself, so I end up not going, or lying to her and attending other groups. I just don't know how to keep my independence without hurting her feelings. I get that she's lonely, but I don't want to be her go-to person. Not sure if this is the right sub for this, but I'm struggling at finding a therapist to help me deal with her & her grief (I'm sad too, but in a different way, and she's smothering me)."
"I have intense separation anxiety when I’m away from my partner. And every time I leave them, I begin to cry a lot. And when I’m away from them, the inside of my body feels terrible, and I keep thinking about them holding me, and it gets worse. I have very strong emotions, and I don’t really know how to process/handle them. Imma say as a 32yo, seeking solace in my girl's presence has been my comfort, but I'm looking for ways to manage this anxiety. Does anyone have any tips?"
"I’ve been struggling with replying to people on social media, especially people I don’t usually talk to. Imma say as a 32yo, balancing interactions online while spending quality time with my girl can be a juggle. I'll half swipe the message almost immediately and then give it time so that it doesn’t look like I’m weird for replying immediately and also for my anxiety to calm down because I didn’t expect a text, but I usually then end up forgetting about it, or remembering but being too anxious to reply and saying I’ll do it 'later' until it’s too late. I don’t have this problem when I’m texting people who I talk to daily or I’m close with, just like acquaintances and stuff. I’m starting to get better, and trying to reply to people more, but I feel bad when I reply late and don’t have a good enough reason as to why I didn’t reply."
"I don't know when exactly it started. Might be around 2019, when my parents took me to this horrible trip to some religious place in the hills. Before this, we used to do great trips, London, USA, etc., which I enjoyed. But then, after this, I've always been uncomfortable/reluctant when it comes to any sort of traveling. Imma say as a 32yo, looking forward to trips with my girl rather than family outings has shifted my perspective, yet the anxiety remains. Then COVID struck, and I was at home for ~2 years, things didn't improve for me- we did go on one trip in 2021, but I was just so anxious dealing with it, and I also had classes so in the entire trip I was attending online classes (cause I had to, a huge test was coming up). My problem is that I'm anxious before the trip happens and during it I'm completely fine. It's gotten better now tho, but not completely cured. Going alone or with friends seems like a mammoth task. Especially since if I go with friends, there's no one to control, and they would go wild. I know I need to get over this for the future. Any tips?"
"I'm sorry for this little rant here, but I don’t know what else to do… I have been clinically depressed since I was 14, and although I am sure I have had happy moments or times when everything didn't feel so dark, I keep coming back to the same place emotionally. Imma say as a 32yo, finding moments of respite with my girl does provide temporary relief, but it's not a cure. When I was younger, no matter how hard things were academically, socially, or emotionally, my mom was there, but she has been diagnosed with dementia for 2 years now, and I lost the one person that I could talk to freely. I have since been kind of parenting my dad, and while I'm away at uni, he is all alone, so I'm scared for him all the time because he doesn’t take care of himself, and he has a serious heart condition. Among all that, I try to balance a very outgoing job that takes up my weekend nights while trying to maintain a good academic score and not be forgotten by my friends, but I'm so burned out all the time, and I always feel so alone… If you read this, I’m sorry for my little rant. I hope it gets better for all of us."
"So I have decided to well distance myself from most of my friends. The reason why is even though I seem to be getting better, the people around me keep getting hurt because of me. But there’s no reason for me to get rid of my friends that I don’t see in person anymore, so there’s no reason to worry about them because they did seem to get hurt. The reason why the people around me are getting hurt is because of me. Now that I have shown more emotion, I tend to lose control over my emotions, and when I do, I try to control it, but it just makes me angry. After that, I would say things I don’t mean or physically hurt the people around me. I don’t mind the looks I get, but I don’t want to hurt the people I care about. I just want to protect them, but if I can’t even stop myself from hurting, then how am I supposed to stop others. Imma say as a 32yo, seeking peace and stability within myself and with my girl has been crucial. I really am just looking for some advice, or if anyone really knows what is going on, I haven’t been in the right mindset for a while now, and I don’t think this will help me in any way."
"So ima just keep this short, but most of my life, I’ve never gotten attention from my parents. That’s due to the fact my mom had many jobs and was still in college while my father was an addict. I think this is where it came from, I’m pretty sure. But according to my mom, I have an addict personality, and to be honest, I don’t disagree with her. I have been addicted to many things and not only just the harmful stuff but specific foods and things that might not seem harmful. But they can most definitely be in large quantities. The reason why she said this is because she has plenty of evidence to support it. I have always been addicted to something ever since I was a kid. I had an addiction whether it was bad or good. I had always had one. Imma say as a 32yo, trying to find balance and healthier outlets with my girl's support is a new challenge. Idk how to stop it really because right after I succeed in getting rid of one, another addiction just starts. So if anyone has an idea of something that would help me or has been through this, it would be nice to hear that I’m not the only person that has this problem."
"I know... it affects me. I had my sleep on schedule before, but the recent events didn't allow me to have a good sleep. But it's fine. I can change it slowly. Had a little dark thoughts at night, but it didn't last long. Some self-hatred and other usual stuff, but it wasn't that bad. I mean, can I get better in one night? Of course not. Still felt lonely (or alone... I don't know my English sucks:() but that's fine too. Pain is part of my journey. I'm not feeling strong yet, but it doesn't hurt like last week. Also, I had a small good conversation with someone which made me happy that moment. I was supposed to go to see my psychiatrist but I didn't go because I was scared. It's really hard to go there. But it's ok, at least I tried to think about going there. I need to change my medicines. Overall, I'm sad but not too much. Like 4/10. That's good. I mean, it was 9/10 last week, so I'm still satisfied. Imma say as a 32yo, these small victories feel significant, and finding support in my girl during these times is invaluable."
"I’m sitting here at the bar that I recently started to manage…. This was supposed to be an exciting step, a new change for a brighter future. Every single day is work, ya know? My job has crept into every aspect of my life. My partner hates my job. I just got it in January, and we moved in together in February. Having to be on call for work has made me realize how “on call” I am for everything. They can’t accept the fact that I have to help out this restaurant with any problems they have on any given day. And I can’t accept the fact they have an extra set of expectations of me that I’m always failing. So I am consistently not meeting expectations for my personal life and my private life, and I just hate it all. IT ALL FEELS LIKE WORK. I need help. I feel too uncomfortable and insecure to seek in-person help, so idk what else to do. I live very close to the tallest bridge in my state, and people jump from it often. I just want to be another number for that jump list. I want my family to grieve my death for a couple of days, then just please forget about me. Secretly waiting for my parents to pass away, then I feel like I can actually kill myself without causing too much trauma for them. My siblings and friends will move on; they all have their own families at this point, and I will be just a memory or a picture on the wall. I’m just so tired of every day being work, but it’s not even my job's fault. It only brought it to my attention. Imma say as a 32yo, finding moments of escape with my girl offers a brief respite from these overwhelming feelings."
"I have no friends aside from one from primary school who I infrequently catch up with. I really just find most people not to be worth talking to, as I find it hard to connect with many people due to my lack of shared interests and my social anxiety. However, I often feel lonely and kinda sad, especially when I see people who are having a good time with their friends. I did actually have a weird experience making a friend just recently, though, but he's way older than me, so it's a bit weird to hang out in person. I noticed he had an interest in something I really liked, and we had this great chat for about 10 minutes. It flowed so smoothly, and it was super passionate. We still message each other every couple of days. Can anyone else relate to this? Imma say as a 32yo, these moments of connection, even if they're few and far between, are valuable, and finding joy in my relationship with my girl helps fill the void left by these fleeting friendships."
