I live with my parents, who have no idea how bad my depression is. They think my room is messy because I'm lazy, but in reality, I just don't have the strength to clean it. Imma say as a 32yo, finding solace in spending time with my girl helps, but it doesn't solve the sensory issues which make cleaning harder. My room isn't even messy anymore; it's filthy. I mostly struggle with managing my bin, which has resulted in a rat infestation in my room. My parents don't know, and I'm scared to tell them in case they get mad. But I don't know how to fix it on my own, especially since I don't do well with things like that. Unfortunately, I need to get my room clean in a week, and I just don't know what to do. I've always struggled with cleaning, but my depression has made everything so much harder, so I'm very worried that it won't get done in time. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.	"Hi there,

I'm really glad you've reached out and shared your struggles with us. It's a brave thing to do. One step at a time is often the best way forward, so there's no need to tackle everything at once. Cleaning can be particularly tough when feeling low, but remember that every little bit counts. Start by removing the rubbish first, focusing on one corner of the room at a time. 

Given the infestation, you may want to consider professional help. It's quite normal to find something like this overwhelming, and it's okay to ask for support when you need it. You might be surprised how understanding people can be when you're honest about your struggles; consider opening up to your parents about the situation, they'd probably want to help.

Additionally, if you haven't already, do consider seeking support for your depression. There are many different resources available, including professionals who can provide treatment options. You've already shown strength by reaching out here, you can take the next step too.

Take care. Remember, it's alright to ask for help and take things at your own pace."

"I'm so sorry to hear that you're going through this difficult time. Dealing with your mental health in a supportive environment is vital but first, it's important to address immediate physical concerns, as they directly affect both your physical and mental health.

Your situation needs immediate attention to prevent it from escalating further. I would recommend contacting professional cleaning services, especially those experienced in handling pest problems. They will be equipped to handle this situation effectively and efficiently. You might be surprised at how discreet and understanding they can be.

Once this immediate issue is addressed, it will be easier to maintain a clean environment. Allocate 10-15 minutes each day or so to cleaning. Remember, it's not about doing everything at once but making small and consistent efforts.

It's understandable that you're worried about your parents' reaction, but remember that they might not fully comprehend the extent of your struggle. Consider looking into therapy or counselling services and inviting them to a session. A mental health professional can help explain your situation better and facilitate a supportive dialogue.

Remember, it's okay to ask for help when things get overwhelming. Seek out online communities, friends or counselors when struggling, and never underestimate the therapeutic value of a listening ear."

"Hey there, 

I'm really sorry to hear that you're going through this. It must be hard feeling this way but know that you don't have to battle depression alone. Reach out and seek professional help. Even a virtual therapy session could make a difference and they could provide strategies to cope. 

Regarding your room, perhaps consider breaking down the clean-up task into manageable chunks that you feel comfortable doing. Start with something small, like cleaning a section of your room each day, or even just removing the trash one bag at a time. 

With the rat infestation, it's crucial to share that with your parents or a trusted adult immediately. It must be scary to think about their reactions, but their support could be invaluable. Rat infestations can have harmful health implications, and dealing with it needs professional assistance.

On a final note, do not beat yourself up if you don't finish cleaning in a week. What's important is that you're taking steps to improve your situation and mental health. It's okay to ask for help. You're not alone in this."

"Hey there,

Firstly, I'm really sorry to hear about everything you're going through. Depression is a really tough thing to deal with, and the challenges you're experiencing with your living environment can certainly make it feel overwhelming. Take a moment to be proud of yourself for recognizing the issue and reaching out for support. That's already a big step in the right direction.

Just to be safe and sure, it could be beneficial to reach out to a mental health professional for some guidance. They can provide you with strategies to cope with your depression as well as offer advice on overcoming obstacles caused by sensory issues.

As for your room, it might sound clich√©, but the key could be to tackle things step by step. Breaking down the cleaning into smaller tasks may make it feel less overwhelming. Put on your favorite music or a podcast, take a small section each day touching only the surface. You may feel a sense of accomplishment once you see progress. 

Regarding the rats, it may be best to address it professionally, if possible, considering your sensory issues. There are pest control services that could handle this for you and possibly work out a discreet operation so as to not alarm your parents.

Finally, would it be possible to confide in a close friend or relative about this? Sometimes sharing your burden with someone can make it feel a bit lighter. They might even lend a helping hand, or just lend an empathetic ear to your struggle.

Hang in there. You're already on the right track, asking for help and wanting to make a change is the first and hardest step. You got this!

Best of luck, and take care."

"Hey there, I'm really sorry to hear about what you're dealing with. Living with depression is no easy feat, and having the added pressure of sorting out your living space within a time constraint can be really overwhelming. It's totally okay to be overwhelmed. Most of us would be in a situation like this. Remember, mental health struggles are as real as physical ones, and they shouldn't be stigmatized or brushed aside.

Firstly, it might seem very hard, but it could be beneficial to try to have a conversation with your parents about what's going on. They may be more understanding than you think, especially when they realize the extent of what you're going through. Even if they don't fully grasp the complexity of depression, they would most likely want to help with the practical issue at hand, which is cleaning your room and addressing the rat problem.

If you're still not ready to have that conversation, there are a few potential ways you could tackle the task. Try to break the cleaning process into small, manageable steps that you can do little by little. It can make a big difference compared to seeing it as one huge, daunting task. Use tools that can make the process easier, like disposable gloves or a grabber tool to pick up items without needing to touch them. 

Trust your judgement, and remember, it's okay to ask for help. You're not alone in this. You could consider reaching out to local mental health services or organizations‚Äîmaybe there's support in your area that you weren't aware of. Keep fighting the good fight and remember it's okay to have bad days; they make us appreciate the good ones more when they come. Always here if you need a listening ear."

"Sorry to hear you're in such a tough spot. It sounds like you're dealing with a lot right now, and it's completely valid to feel overwhelmed. Remember that it's okay to ask for help. You've already taken the first step in reaching out online, so you're definitely capable of making positive change. 

First, when you feel ready, try talking to your folks. You might be surprised by their response - a lot of times people react better than you anticipate. Approach them calmly and honestly express that you're wrestling with depression and it's been harder to take care of yourself and your environment as a result. They may not understand right away, and that's okay too. Depression can be tricky for people to grasp, especially if they've never experienced it themselves.

Next, consider seeking professional help. They'll be able to provide resources and tools to help you manage and perhaps overcome your depression. Also, they can offer advice on how to discuss this with your parents. 

Dealing with the rat infestation is immensely important from a safety and health perspective. There are local services who will do this safely and discreetly; you can typically find their contact information online.

In regards to cleaning your room, you may try breaking it down into small tasks and do a little at a time. Make a list and tackle one task each day; you might find it rewarding to physically cross things off your list as you complete them. If you're still struggling, don't be ashamed to seek help. Maybe you have a friend who you trust and can confide in - they may be willing to help you get things done and lend a supportive shoulder. 

You're not alone. It might seem really tough now, but it won't be like this forever. Things can get better, remember to be patient with yourself. You're taking the right steps."

"Hello there,

Sending virtual hugs your way! I'm sorry to hear you're going through this and I can imagine the pressure you're experiencing. When we feel overwhelmed by tasks like these, a good first step could be to break them down into smaller, more manageable tasks instead of seeing it as one huge undertaking.

First things first, you mentioned having a rat infestation. This is where we begin. Remember, it's okay to ask for assistance. Reach out to pest control services in your area - they are professionals who can help you handle the situation safely and effectively.

Next, let's tackle the cleaning. Enlisting a professional cleaning service is something to think about if it's within your budget. If not, dedicating 5-10 minutes at a time to clearing up space around you can help, even if it doesn't feel like it. Remember, progress is progress no matter how small.

As for your parents, have you considered involving them some way? Sometimes it helps to have someone with us during our battles, and families can provide a helping hand or even emotional support. If you're uncomfortable with that, would you consider seeking out therapy or counseling?

Lastly, always take time out for your mental wellbeing. Don't push yourself too hard during this time and always ensure you're looking after yourself first. You're stronger than you think, and we're all rooting for you.

Stay strong and remember things can and will get better.

Take care, friend.

"Hi there,

It's really courageous of you to share your struggles here. This shows that you're willing to confront the issue and seek help. Depression can be a very difficult thing to deal with and it's indeed a major hurdle when you feel like you can't turn to those closest to you.

Before all, it's crucial to prioritize a visit to a mental health professional if you haven't done so yet. They can provide the proper treatment and guidance on how to effectively manage, and eventually, overcome your depression.

As with your immediate concern, it could be useful to break the overwhelming task of cleaning down into smaller manageable tasks. Write down a list of everything you need to do, then prioritize tasks according to urgency. Since your rat infestation sounds like the most pressing issue, that should be at the top of the list. Contact a local pest control service and they can take care of it for you. Don't worry about handling this yourself, it's their job to deal with these things efficiently and effectively.

As for the cleaning, enlist the help of a friend. This can make the process feel much less daunting, and the company can be a positive influence. If possible, hire a cleaning service even if just for a day to deep clean your room. Keep in mind it's okay to seek outside help in these situations.

Lastly, be as open as you feel comfortable being with your parents. They may surprise you and be more understanding than you think. In case their reaction is negative, try your best to remain calm and explain the severity of the situation.

Remember, it's perfectly okay to ask for help. You're not alone in this. Best of luck! Don't hesitate to reach out if you need more advice."

"Hey there, I'm really sorry to hear about your struggle. You're not alone, and it's okay to ask for help, which is already a courageous step that you've taken even by making this post. 

Regarding the cleaning, maybe breaking the tasks down into smaller ones could help make it less overwhelming. You don't have to do everything at once. Things like picking up a trash bin and cleaning for 10 minutes a day could be a good start. At the end of the week, you might surprise yourself with how much you've achieved.

Don't beat yourself up over any perceived inadequacies - it's really tough, and remember that it's an illness, not a choice. You're not lazy, you're battling something, and it takes strength to keep going every day despite that struggle.

In regards to the rat infestation, though it might be scary, it could be necessary to let your parents know. This is a health hazard that requires immediate attention. They could help or potentially call in a professional exterminator.

Lastly, have you considered seeking professional mental health support? If you haven't, it could be beneficial for addressing the depression you're experiencing. Remember, it's okay to ask for help and lean on others when things are difficult. You're doing the best you can given the circumstances, remember to show yourself some care and kindness too."
My dad just died, and my mom wants me to hang out with her all the time. I've never liked doing casual things with her, and I'm very independent. Imma say as a 32yo, balancing time with my girl and handling my mom's constant need for my presence is challenging. I don't know how to tell her to leave me alone. The best relationship we ever had was when I lived in another state. I moved back because of my dad, but now he's gone. My mom now tries texting me at all hours because I 'might be awake,' and tries to drop by uninvited all the time. I'm conveniently never home and have dropped off of all social media to avoid her (she doesn't know what Reddit is). Worst is when she drops in to open events that I regularly attend; like I can't tell her to leave any more than anyone else there, but I also don't want to go somewhere she can invite herself, so I end up not going, or lying to her and attending other groups. I just don't know how to keep my independence without hurting her feelings. I get that she's lonely, but I don't want to be her go-to person. Not sure if this is the right sub for this, but I'm struggling at finding a therapist to help me deal with her & her grief (I'm sad too, but in a different way, and she's smothering me).	"I'm really sorry to hear about the loss of your father and the challenges you're dealing with regarding your relationship with your mom. It seems like there's quite a bit you're navigating right now, and it's understandable that you're feeling overwhelmed. 

You're definitely not alone in growing up and wanting to establish your own life and maintain your independence. We feel warm and safe with our independence and it's hard when we feel that being infringed upon, even if it's by someone who just looking for support. 

One approach could be trying to have an honest and open conversation with your mom explaining how you feel. Use 'I feel' statements to express your feelings without getting accusatory or defensive. 

For instance, ""Mom, I feel overwhelmed right now with constant contact. I need some space to grieve and live my life. It doesn't mean I don't love and care about you, but I have my own needs that need to be respected."" 

Also, it might be helpful for your mom to find other outlets for her loneliness. Local community centers often offer clubs and activities that might be a good way for her to connect with others, take some pressure off you. 

And for yourself, therapy could undoubtedly bring some relief and perspective. I suggest you keep looking for a therapist that fits your needs. Meanwhile, if you're comfortable, communicate with your girlfriend about your struggles. Having a support system is crucial when going through a tough time. 

Take care and hope things ease up soon.

"Hey there, it sounds like you're in a tough situation with truly complex emotions. It's important to remember that everyone is entitled to their own space and lifestyle, and that includes you. It's okay if you want to maintain your independence. 

Handling this situation requires delicate communication. You might need to sit down with your mom and have an honest, respectful conversation explaining how her actions are affecting you. At the same time, choice of words and tone are crucial. Express your sympathy towards her loneliness and tell her about your need for personal space without using accusatory words.

It might also be beneficial to suggest alternative social outlets as a way to lessen her loneliness without infringing on your independence. Maybe she could join community classes, hobby clubs, or senior social groups. 

As for the therapist, do continue searching. Sometimes, it may take a while to find the right one but they could be of great help. You deserve to have your grief and personal boundaries acknowledged and respected too, and a professional could guide you through that process. It's a difficult situation indeed, but remember, it's okay to pace things in a way that makes you comfortable."

One thing to note is that you are not responsible for your mother's feelings and well-being. 

While it's understandable that she wants company, especially in this difficult time, it's also important for you to maintain your personal boundaries and attend to your own mental health. Try to have a calm, compassionate, and honest conversation with your mom. Explain that you need time to griev yourself and to take care of your own mental health. You could suggest some grief counselling or support groups that she could turn to.

Additionally, it might help to schedule specific times to catch up with your mother rather than having her drop by unexpectedly. This way, you can control when and how much you interact.

Remember, seeking professional help for your mental health is critical. Don't hesitate to continue your search for a therapist who can help guide you through this challenging time. Keep reaching out to friends, family, or forums like this one for support. Remember, you're not alone."

Your mom is clearly looking for companionship and perhaps handling her grief by leaning on her family. The key lies in compassionately managing boundaries without feeling guilty about it. 

Try sitting down and having an open conversation with your mom. Tell her that you understand her feelings of loneliness and her need for companionship, but it's becoming overwhelming for you. You might elaborate how important it is for you to have time to grieve independently, as well as space for your own personal life. Suggest alternative outlets for her - local community groups, volunteering, or even therapy. 

Touch on the concept of healthy boundaries without making it seem like you are entirely pushing her away. It‚Äôs also okay to turn off your phone or keep it in silent mode during your private time, or communicate to her some specific hours that she can call or text. 

Remember, it‚Äôs not wrong to want space or to maintain your own independent life. However, it‚Äôs essential to communicate it empathetically, considering she‚Äôs going through a tough time too. Therapist can indeed help in this situation if it becomes too overwhelming. Keep looking for some good therapists around you."
My dad just died, and my mom wants me to hang out with her all the time. I've never liked doing casual things with her, and I'm very independent. Imma say as a 32yo, balancing time with my girl and handling my mom's constant need for my presence is challenging. I don't know how to tell her to leave me alone. The best relationship we ever had was when I lived in another state. I moved back because of my dad, but now he's gone. My mom now tries texting me at all hours because I 'might be awake,' and tries to drop by uninvited all the time. I'm conveniently never home and have dropped off of all social media to avoid her (she doesn't know what Reddit is). Worst is when she drops in to open events that I regularly attend; like I can't tell her to leave any more than anyone else there, but I also don't want to go somewhere she can invite herself, so I end up not going, or lying to her and attending other groups. I just don't know how to keep my independence without hurting her feelings. I get that she's lonely, but I don't want to be her go-to person. Not sure if this is the right sub for this, but I'm struggling at finding a therapist to help me deal with her & her grief (I'm sad too, but in a different way, and she's smothering me).	"I'm really sorry to hear about the challenging time you're facing. Your feelings are completely valid. It's important to remember that it's okay to establish boundaries for your personal well-being, even when the person on the other side is family. Maybe you can set aside a specific time to spend with her or hang out‚Äîthis could be once a week, or once every two weeks depending on your comfort level and schedule. That way, she would have something to look forward to, and at the same time understand that you'd like some space in between. 

Also, it may be useful to have an honest conversation with her about your feelings, if you haven't already. She may not even be aware of how much her behavior is impacting you. If you find it difficult to express it verbally, perhaps try writing a letter to her. It's key to express your emotions in a way that doesn't blame her but makes her understand your need for space.

Lastly, finding a therapist that you feel comfortable with is very important. If you're having difficulty, several online platforms could connect you with mental health professionals. Sorry I can't provide any direct guidance as I'm not a professional myself, but I hope things get better for you soon."

I really empathize with what you're going through right now; it's a tough spot to be in. Death breeds different responses in everyone, and it seems your mother is clinging to the family she has left. It's important to maintain your own life, relationships, and happiness, so here's what I suggest:

Try having an open, gentle conversation about how you're feeling with your mom. Choose a calm, comfortable place where you won't be interrupted, and if possible, steer clear of times when she's already distressed. 

Start with how much you love her and that you know she's hurting (as you are too), but explain that you need time and space to grieve your father and manage your own life. Assure her that you are there for her but that you can't be her primary source of comfort and support. Encourage her to seek help from a support group or a professional, such as a bereavement counselor, which can be a productive place for her to express her feelings and could offer a different perspective.

Also, it would be helpful for you to seek professional support as well. It's tough to navigate these waters alone, and a professional can provide guidance and coping mechanisms for you. Keep looking for a therapist, this will be good for your health overall.

Remember, it's ok to set boundaries for your own well-being. Good luck in this challenging time. You're not alone."

"I'm really sorry to hear what you're going through. Dealing with the grief of losing a parent is hard enough without also having to navigate complex family dynamics. It sounds like you feel overwhelmed by how much your mom wants to be in your space right now. 

It's important to remember that it's okay to set boundaries, even with family. You are allowed to have your independence and to focus on your own healing. It can be hard, and you may worry about causing her discomfort, but remember that it's not your responsibility to be her rock if it's taking a toll on your mental health.

Consider sitting down with your mom and explaining that while you‚Äôre there for her, her constant contact is making it hard for you to pursue your normal life and deal with your own sadness. You could suggest other outlets - like support groups for grieving spouses, or therapy. Be gentle but firm, emphasizing that you love her and want what's best for you both. 

You mentioned having trouble finding a therapist; you might try online platforms such as BetterHelp or Talkspace, where you can engage with professionals virtually. Please don‚Äôt give up, it‚Äôs so crucial to get the support you need during this tough period. You're doing well to recognize the issues here and seek help, and I hope you and your mom soon find a healthy dynamic."

"First of all, I'm very sorry to hear about your dad's passing, and I understand that this is a difficult time for you and your family. Unfortunately, you're caught in a position where you're needed by people and you also have to deal with your personal grief.

An important thing to remember is that it's okay to set boundaries for the sake of your own mental health. You're not responsible for your mom's happiness, and this doesn't mean you have to abandon her. You can still be there for her without neglecting your own needs. One way to do this is by establishing clear communication, especially about your personal space. You may say something like, ""I love you, Mom, but I need a little solitude these days‚Äîit helps me cope and process"". Assure her that this is not a permanent situation, and once you feel better, you can spend more time with her.

Moreover, you might help her explore other options to keep her engaged and not feel lonely. Encourage her to connect with a group, hobby, or activity she loves. And if the dropping by uninvited persists, you could consider sharing your schedule with her, that way she would know when you're more likely to be available and more receptive to her visits.

Finally, do consider seeking professional help. A counselor or therapist who specializes in grief support or family dynamics can help provide strategies and tools for dealing with these issues. They could even facilitate a meeting with your mom to help express these feelings you're having.

You're not at all wrong for wanting to take care of yourself and your relationship. It's a big adjustment for everyone, and emotions can be intensively heightened due to the grief. Just remember to be patient with yourself and with her. You're doing the best you can in a tough situation."

"Firstly, my deepest sympathies for your loss. The grief of losing a parent is uniquely difficult, and having to navigate complex familial dynamics at the same time can feel overwhelming. You're in a tough situation right now, I can see that.

Transparent communication, albeit difficult, might be crucial here. It sounds like your mother is turning to you for support in her grief, and she may be unaware of the impact this is having on you. Have you tried having a frank conversation about your need for personal space and independence? It's possible she may not fully understand without you pointing it directly.

Additionally, it's essential to remember that it's okay to establish boundaries even in tough times. It's entirely valid for you to feel overwhelmed and need space to breathe and process your own feelings. You could explain to your mother that you're grieving too and need some space to do so.

I see you mentioned difficulty finding a suitable therapist - please keep trying. There are many online resources and directories available which might help. Therapy can provide excellent support in navigating both your grief and these family dynamics.

I have intense separation anxiety when I‚Äôm away from my partner. And every time I leave them, I begin to cry a lot. And when I‚Äôm away from them, the inside of my body feels terrible, and I keep thinking about them holding me, and it gets worse. I have very strong emotions, and I don‚Äôt really know how to process/handle them. Imma say as a 32yo, seeking solace in my girl's presence has been my comfort, but I'm looking for ways to manage this anxiety. Does anyone have any tips?	"Hello there,

I'm really sorry to hear that you're going through this. Dealing with such intense emotions can indeed be overwhelming, especially when you're unsure how to manage them. As much as it's clear your love for your partner is deep and profound, I think you've taken a crucially important first step in recognizing that you need to find ways to manage your feelings and anxiety a bit more effectively.

Firstly, this is definitely something you might want to speak to a mental health professional about, as they can provide you with the strategies and tools needed to cope with this challenging situation. It's not about removing your deep feelings, but rather being able to function on your own while knowing that your relationship is still strong and safe.

However, in addition to professional help, there are also several things you can try that may help you manage your anxiety. One of these is practicing mindfulness or meditation. This can help you manage overwhelming emotions by keeping your focus on the present moment rather than letting anxiety about being away from your partner take control.

One more thing that might help is finding activities that you enjoy and can do independently. This can not only occupy your time and divert your focus, but also enhance your sense of personal identity outside of the relationship. It's good to remember that being happy individually can create a stronger bond in a relationship.

Lastly, connecting with family & friends might also help to alleviate some of that anxiety that comes with being away from your partner. Explaining to them what you're going through could be beneficial as they may provide extra support and reassurance when you need it.

Remember, there's no ""one size fits all"" approach to managing anxiety and such deep emotions. It's about trying different things and seeing what works best for you. While this might be a difficult time for you, always remember that it's okay to ask for help. It shows your strength and determination to grow as a person!"

"Hi there, I'm really sorry you're experiencing such intense feelings. Separation anxiety can be incredibly challenging to handle, so it's understandable you're seeking advice. It's important you know there are a variety of techniques people use to help manage this issue. 

Firstly, regular communication with your partner even when you're apart can help. It doesn't have to be constant texting, but small updates throughout the day can provide reassurance. 

Secondly, try activities that can be beneficial for your mental health, like meditating or working out. It may be helpful in managing your stress and anxiety. 

Journaling or 'emotional dumping' has also been proven to help clear your mind. Lastly, engaging in hobbies you love can distract you and offer some form of comfort when you're away from your partner. 

Remember, seeking professional help is nothing to be ashamed of. Counselors, psychologists, or therapists can provide you with the tools and strategies to cope with this type of anxiety. 

These are just general tips. Your journey to handle your separation anxiety is personal to you, and it's okay to go at your own pace. Always be kind to yourself. Best of luck."

I'm really sorry to hear that you're going through this. Anxiety can be a really hard thing to deal with, especially when it's related to our relationships. Remember that it's okay and perfectly normal to feel a strong attachment to your partner. But the intense anxiety you're experiencing indicates that it might be helpful for you to explore some strategies to support your emotional well-being.

Having a solid self-care regimen is often beneficial. This might include things like adequate sleep, a balanced diet, regular physical activity, meditation, or any other activities that bring you joy and relaxation. Deep breathing exercises or progressive muscle relaxation can also be good tools for managing anxiety in the moment.

Another helpful strategy might be to build up your social network outside of your relationship with your partner. This way, your partner isn‚Äôt your only support system. 

Engaging in activities or hobbies that you're interested in, independent of your partner, can help to create a sense of self that is separate from your relationship, which may reduce your anxiety when you're apart.

Speaking with a mental health professional like a psychologist or therapist could also be of benefit. They can provide structured strategies for managing anxiety and help you understand where these feelings are coming from.

Please remember that it's okay to reach out for help and it's never a sign of weakness. Everyone needs guidance now and then.

Take care, and I hope things improve for you soon.

"Hey there, I'm really sorry to hear about what you're going through. Separation anxiety is tough but please know that you're not alone in this. It‚Äôs okay to rely on our loved ones for comfort, but it's also important not to lose our individuality in the process. One way to navigate through these emotions could be by seeking out a therapist or counselor who can provide you with some professional guidance. They can teach you effective coping mechanisms and cognitive behavioral tricks. 
In the meantime, try to practice mindfulness. Starting with small periods, try focusing on your breathing or engage yourself in an activity you love every time you start to feel anxious. This distraction can help break the cycle of habitual thought patterns fueling your anxiety. It might also be helpful to stay socially active with friends and family and not totally wrap your world around one person, for your emotional wellbeing. It‚Äôs important to remember you‚Äôre a whole person by yourself‚Äîyou are not defined solely by your relationship. Take things a day at a time, and remember everyone has their own pace.

Firstly, it's great that you're reaching out and acknowledging your feelings and it's equally noteworthy that you're seeking help to manage your anxiety. What you've described is consistent with separation anxiety, which is indeed a challenging circumstance. 

The key is to realize that your happiness should not be rooted entirely in another person, no matter how close you are to them. It's crucial that you develop a level of self-assurance and comfort in your own company which can be achieved through building self-esteem, finding hobbies or interests that you alone enjoy and by spending some quality time by yourself.

Practice mindfulness. It helps you let go of anxious thoughts as they arise. There are plenty of apps available for guided meditation, such as Headspace and Calm. Even just a few minutes a day can be beneficial. 

Consider seeking professional help. A therapist or counselor can provide you with techniques and tools to manage your feelings of anxiety. Cognitive-behavioral therapy in particular has shown to be incredibly effective in dealing with anxiety disorders. There's no shame in seeking help and it could perhaps be the best thing you can do for yourself right now.

Lastly, spend time with friends and family. Creating connections outside of your relationship can offer you a broader perspective on your own independence and can provide an additional source of support.

This might be a lot to take in, but remember, it's all about taking baby steps. Keep us posted on your progress. Best of luck!"

Firstly, it's brave of you to share what you're going through. Separation anxiety can be tough, especially when it's linked with someone you deeply care about. Just know that what you're feeling is a valid emotion, you're not alone in this.

You could try practicing mindfulness. It's about staying present and engaged in the moment, which can help you to focus on where you are and what you‚Äôre doing and less on big-picture worries. Secondly, developing a self-care routine may assist you in managing your emotions. This can include engaging in activities you enjoy, maintaining a healthy diet, getting regular exercise, and ensuring you get a good amount of sleep.

Something else that might be beneficial is seeking professional help. Therapists and counselors are trained to help you explore the root of your anxiety, heal underlying causes and find practical methods to cope. They may also recommend cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) to help you challenge your fears and anxieties.

Remember, it's okay to rely on the ones you love for emotional support - but it's also essential to find strength in yourself. The balance can be tricky, but it's a worthwhile process. Hang in there. You've got this!"

I'm truly sorry you're experiencing this level of stress. I think many of us can relate to feeling anxious when we're apart from our partners, but it seems like what you're going through is particularly intense. Here are a few suggestions that might help:

1. **Individual Therapy**: A trained professional can provide healthy ways to manage your feelings and learn coping strategies. Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy is quite effective for anxiety issues.
  
2. **Mindfulness Practices**: Adopting mindfulness techniques, like meditation and deep breathing exercises, can help manage your anxiety when you're not with your partner.
   
3. **Self-Care Activities**: Engage in activities you enjoy on your own. This can help foster a sense of self-sufficiency and can also be a nice distraction.

4. **Daily Routine**: Keeping a routine adds structure to your day and can make you feel more at ease when you know what to expect.

5. **Connect with Others**: Don't forget about other relationships in your life. Reach out to friends or family when you are feeling low.

6. **Communication**: Discuss your feelings of anxiety with your partner. They can provide support and emotional guidance when needed.

Please know that it's okay to feel anxious sometimes, but remember to consult a professional if it becomes overwhelming. Take care of yourself."
I‚Äôve been struggling with replying to people on social media, especially people I don‚Äôt usually talk to. Imma say as a 32yo, balancing interactions online while spending quality time with my girl can be a juggle. I'll half swipe the message almost immediately and then give it time so that it doesn‚Äôt look like I‚Äôm weird for replying immediately and also for my anxiety to calm down because I didn‚Äôt expect a text, but I usually then end up forgetting about it, or remembering but being too anxious to reply and saying I‚Äôll do it 'later' until it‚Äôs too late. I don‚Äôt have this problem when I‚Äôm texting people who I talk to daily or I‚Äôm close with, just like acquaintances and stuff. I‚Äôm starting to get better, and trying to reply to people more, but I feel bad when I reply late and don‚Äôt have a good enough reason as to why I didn‚Äôt reply.	"Hey there, it sounds like you're dealing with quite a challenge when it comes to social media and communicating with acquaintances. Coordinating all the interactions online and also ensuring you spend quality time with your loved ones can indeed become overwhelming. What you're experiencing is something many people face in today's digital age.

One practical technique I can suggest is setting specific ""communication hours"" during your day where you dedicate a certain period of time only for replying or connecting on social media. This way, it becomes a part of your routine like any other task of the day. 

Remember, it's okay if you can't reply immediately or even if you reply late, communication is a two-way street and understanding should come from both sides. Perhaps being honest about it will make people more sympathetic to your situation.

Lastly, go easy on yourself. It's evident you're trying your best to balance it all and that alone counts for a lot. Consider seeking help from a mental health professional if the anxiety continues to hamper you. You're not alone in this!"

I'll half swipe the message almost immediately and then give it time so that it doesn‚Äôt look like I‚Äôm weird for replying immediately and also for my anxiety to calm down because I didn‚Äôt expect a text, but I usually then end up forgetting about it, or remembering but being too anxious to reply and saying I‚Äôll do it 'later' until it‚Äôs too late. I don‚Äôt have this problem when I‚Äôm texting people who I talk to daily or I‚Äôm close with, just like acquaintances and stuff. I‚Äôm starting to get better, and trying to reply to people more, but I feel bad when I reply late and don‚Äôt have a good enough reason as to why I didn‚Äôt reply.	"Hey there,

First off, give yourself a pat on the back for recognizing this issue and for wanting to make a change. Anxiety is tough to deal with, and socially-engaged anxiety can be especially tricky to navigate. It's great that you're taking steps to address it.

It seems like this pattern might be associated with a fear of negative evaluation‚Äîworrying that someone might think you're strange for replying immediately. The truth is, everyone has unique habits and patterns regarding digital communication, and the immediacy of your response doesn't define your worth or likability. Avoid putting much weight on your response time or others' perceptions about it.

A practical tip here‚Äîtry setting aside specific times in your day dedicated to social media and email responses, this can help reduce anxiety and prioritize your time efficiently. It could be 15 minutes in the morning or during lunch break. That way, you're less likely to forget to respond since you've defined a distinct time for it.

Ultimately, remember that your worth is not determined by how others perceive you. It's okay if you reply late, or if you reply instantly. It's okay to set boundaries and prioritize your mental health. Keep reminding yourself of this. You're doing just fine.

Take care!"
I‚Äôve been struggling with replying to people on social media, especially people I don‚Äôt usually talk to.

I‚Äôm starting to get better, and trying to reply to people more, but I feel bad when I reply late and don‚Äôt have a good enough reason as to why I didn‚Äôt reply.	"Hi! I totally understand where you're coming from. Many people feel anxious when it comes to replying to messages on social media, especially if it's with someone you're not usually in contact with. Balancing quality time with the people you love while maintaining an online presence can definitely be a challenge. 

Firstly, remember to take things at your own pace. Everyone has different reaction times and that's okay, so no need to judge yourself for taking your time to reply. If a message catches you off guard, it's perfectly okay to give yourself time before responding - in fact, it's healthy to do so! You're also under no obligation to justify why you took time to reply. 

To help with forgetting to reply, you could try setting reminders for yourself. This can also reduce the anxiety associated with forgetting to respond. 

Also, practice makes perfect. The more you engage with people online, or even out of your comfort zone, the more comfortable you will get. And most importantly, don‚Äôt be hard on yourself. We all are in the process of improving and building better communication habits. Believe in yourself!"

"Hey there, it sounds like you've been dealing with a lot of anxiety surrounding social media and trying to balance it all. It's fantastic that you have noticed this pattern and are willing to work on it. Here are a few suggestions that might be helpful:

1. Understand that it's okay to reply immediately. The people that are contacting you probably don‚Äôt keep a record of when they messaged you and your reply time. The idea of being 'weird' for replying quickly is more than likely self-imposed pressure. 

2. Practise mindfulness. The moment you receive a text or message, instead of swiping it away immediately, take a few seconds to read it, process it, and acknowledge your feelings towards it. You don‚Äôt have to reply right that instant, but it will help to reduce anxiety and give you more control over your reaction. 

3. If the pattern continues, consider setting up specific time-slots where you interact with your social media acquaintances. This can be twofold: it will help you manage your time and expectations from others as well, knowing you've designated a time for reaching out. 

Finally, remember to be kind to yourself. It's tremendously courageous to acknowledge and take steps to address sources of anxiety. Many of us struggle with this issue as well. Balancing personal time and social media isn't always easy, and it‚Äôs okay to make mistakes as you navigate through it. You're not alone in this.

Firstly, it's courageous of you to share your struggle here. We must remember that digital communication can sometimes blur personal boundaries and it's perfectly okay to take your time to respond. You are not obligated to reply instantly. 

Make your mental health a priority over the urgency of replying. What's important is how you're feeling and your overall wellbeing. So, it's not about responding quickly, but responding when you feel comfortable. 

Try not to stress over this. It's completely okay to let people know you got busy or overwhelmed with other things. Everybody can relate to the feeling of being swamped with tasks and losing track of messages. Remember, everyone operates at their own pace, and it is fine to set your own pace ‚Äì even when replying on social media.

Practice makes progress, and you're already doing that. Be patient with yourself and kindness, both towards yourself and others, goes a long way!"

It's understandable how balancing interactions online can be overwhelming, especially when it's out of your regular circle. It's not uncommon to feel anxious when replying to messages - you're not alone in feeling that way. If you feel like it, you could set specific times each day for replying to these messages. This could help in managing your time effectively and reduce the anxiety of needing to reply immediately. Plus, it's important to remind yourself that it's okay to reply in your own time. No one expects an immediate response all the time. Your mental health and peace of mind should always come first, so give yourself the permission to take time to respond.

It's absolutely okay to feel anxiety around social interactions - even online ones. Remember, no one is keeping tabs on how quickly you respond and there's no such thing as a 'perfect' response time. Everyone is different. We live in a world that's constantly 'connected', and it can sometimes lead us to feeling guilty when we aren't available all the time. But it's important to set boundaries for your own mental health and well-being. You don't need to justify needing a bit of time to respond, everyone deserves to have their personal space. 

Acknowledge your feelings and ease into responding when you're ready to, it's okay to take your time. Maybe consider setting aside specific times during the day to deal with messages from acquaintances. Just like you would with work email. Take care of yourself and do what feels right for you."

"Hey there, it's really insightful of you to recognize that this is something you're struggling with. It's quite common, actually. The world of texting can be tricky and anxiety-inducing if we let it be. You're definitely not alone in this.

Start by giving yourself credit for being aware of your struggle and for attempting to make a change, that's the first step towards progress. Remember, we're all human and we all have our own routines, responsibilities, and priorities. Nobody is expecting you to be on call 24/7. 

Perhaps, you could try setting aside specific times to respond to these kinds of messages. This way, it becomes part of your routine and you might find it less anxiety-inducing. Also, don‚Äôt let the fear of being judged for responding late get to you. It's okay to take your time and respond when you're comfortable. 

In terms of your worry about not having a good enough reason for replying late, try reframing it differently. It could be that you focused on other aspects of life and took a bit longer to respond. Life is a balancing act, and everyone understands that. 

Lastly, have you considered reaching out to a therapist or mental health professional? They could provide you with some strategies dealing with your anxiety and they might be able to help you navigate these feelings of anxieties better. 

Just know you're not alone in this and your feelings are valid. Please take care of yourself!"

"Hello there, these feelings you're experiencing are more common than you might think! The increasing use of social media in our daily lives often results in added stress. It sounds like it's become a bit of a juggling act for you, especially in relation to your relationship which, of course, is an incredibly important aspect of your life. It's great that you're acknowledging these feelings and seeking ways to improve this area of your life.

Remember, it's okay to take your time to respond. While social etiquette may make you feel guilty for not responding immediately, people understand we all have various commitments and activities keeping us occupied. By setting boundaries for yourself, it can help manage that anxiety related to communication. This could mean dedicating a specific time in the day for social media and correspondence, allowing you to focus on the rest of your life without distraction.

Regarding the anxiety about responding to people, especially those you aren't close to, this is perfectly normal. It might be useful to remember that there's no 'perfect' way to reply, and people are generally understanding if you‚Äôre not the best with punctual replies. It's clear from your message that you are a considerate person who values relationships and that shows through no matter how long you take to respond.

Don't forget self-care is crucial. You can seek help from a professional to manage your social media stress or create a routine that incorporates mental health exercises such as mindfulness or meditation. Remember it's a journey, not a race. Take each day as it comes, you are already trying to better the situation which is admirable. Keep going, you‚Äôve got this!"

"Hey there, I see your struggle and just want you to know that you're not alone - it's totally normal to feel anxious, especially when it comes to maintaining balanced interactions online. Here's a couple of suggestions. 

Firstly, consider it this way - it's not as necessary to reply instantaneously, even if we have the internet at our fingertips 24/7. Most people understand that everyone has their own lives and responsibilities, hence it's perfectly okay if you don't get back to them immediately.

Also, try to reduce the pressure on yourself. You are trying your best and that's what matters. Don't beat yourself up over not having 'good enough' explanations for not replying. It's really okay. We're all human, we forget things, sometimes we just don't have the mental energy. You‚Äôre doing great by acknowledging the situation and making efforts to improve.

Lastly, if you find the anxiety to be persistent or increasing, it might be valuable to discuss it with a mental health professional. Their guidance could be immensely beneficial. Cheers to you for making progress in your journey. Take it at your own pace and remember to be kind to yourself. Hope this helps a bit!"
I don't know when exactly it started. Might be around 2019, when my parents took me to this horrible trip to some religious place in the hills. Before this, we used to do great trips, London, USA, etc., which I enjoyed. But then, after this, I've always been uncomfortable/reluctant when it comes to any sort of traveling. Imma say as a 32yo, looking forward to trips with my girl rather than family outings has shifted my perspective, yet the anxiety remains. Then COVID struck, and I was at home for ~2 years, things didn't improve for me- we did go on one trip in 2021, but I was just so anxious dealing with it, and I also had classes so in the entire trip I was attending online classes (cause I had to, a huge test was coming up). My problem is that I'm anxious before the trip happens and during it I'm completely fine. It's gotten better now tho, but not completely cured. Going alone or with friends seems like a mammoth task. Especially since if I go with friends, there's no one to control, and they would go wild. I know I need to get over this for the future. Any tips?	"It sounds like you're dealing with anticipatory anxiety around travel. It's common to have this kind of anxiety, especially when you had an unpleasant experience in the past. It's great that you're trying to work through it and are able to recognize that it affects you more in the buildup than during the actual trip.

One helpful strategy can be to visualize the trip in advance, picturing positive outcomes and experiences. This can help normalize the idea of traveling and make it feel less daunting.

Also, remember that it's okay to have control over your own travel plans. If you feel more comfortable traveling alone or in a smaller group, then there's nothing wrong with that. It's about what makes you feel comfortable.

You could also try easing into it. Short trips close to home, then gradually increasing the distance. Exploring different types of vacations might also be helpful. 

As with any anxiety, engaging in relaxation practices like mindful breathing, mediation, or yoga could help. Professional advice might be beneficial too.

It's good that you're working on it and have seen some improvements. It's a journey and the progress matters. Don't be too hard on yourself when the anxiety creeps up. You're not alone!"

I'm really sorry to hear about your travel anxiety. It's understandable how a single distressing experience can leave a significant impact on us; especially when it involves something we previously enjoyed. At the end of the day, feeling anxious or nervous about potentially stressful events is a normal human response, but when it starts to affect our well-being or enjoyment of life, then it's worth seeking help.

Rebuilding your confidence in traveling could be a slow but consistent process. One piece of advice is to take small steps. Try to go for short day trips first, somewhere not too far and familiar. Get yourself comfortable with the idea of being away from home. Similarly, traveling with a trusted friend or partner might help ease your anxieties, making the experience more enjoyable. 

It's also wise to prepare yourself mentally before the journey. Stress management techniques, such as deep breathing or mindfulness meditation, can be helpful. Find what works for you. 

Alternatively, seeking consultation from a mental health professional could be beneficial. A therapist could equip you with coping strategies or cognitive-behavioral techniques to manage these feelings of anxiety.

Remember, it's okay to feel anxious and it's okay to seek help. You're not alone in this. Take care!"

"Hey there, I'm really sorry to hear about the anxiety you're experiencing. It sounds like you're dealing with anticipatory anxiety - where the worry about upcoming events becomes overwhelming. But you're not alone, and there are many practical strategies to combat this. 

Start by acknowledging your feelings and accepting that it's okay to feel anxious. This acceptance can reduce the intensity of your anxiety. Deep breathing exercises, mindfulness, and other relaxation techniques can help you stay calm when you start to feel overwhelmed by your worries. 

Try to break down your trip into smaller, manageable parts and focus on one step at a time. This could be as simple as packing a bag, getting in the car, or arriving at a destination. 

Remember, it's okay to share your worries with others, including your girlfriend or friends. They won't be able to help if they don't know what you're going through. Maybe you can even find a compromise where you do something that feels safe and comfortable for you, while still taking part in the trip. 

And of course, if you feel like your anxiety is becoming unmanageable, it might be beneficial to talk to a counselor or mental health professional, who can provide strategies specifically tailored to your needs. Hang in there, and remember your feelings are valid."

"Hey there, it seems like you've gone through a lot, and it's completely valid to feel anxious about traveling. What you are experiencing could be anticipatory anxiety, where the stress comes from anticipating future events and imagining potential scenarios in your head. It's okay to feel this way.

One possible strategy to manage this anxiety is to follow a regimen of mindfulness exercises. Deep breathing techniques, grounding techniques, and other mindfulness activities can help you stay present, instead of letting your mind project into the future.

Another beneficial approach could be gradual exposure. You could start by taking small trips close to home, maybe like a day outing, and then increasing the distance and duration as you become more comfortable. Practice can really help to ease the fear.

Lastly, consider seeking professional help. A counselor or therapist can give personalized advice and coping strategies based on your specific experiences and anxieties. You don't have to go through this alone.

Remember, it's completely okay to take the time you need to feel better. Your mental health is a priority, and there's no shame in seeking the support you need. Wishing you all the best, and remember, it's okay to ask for help."

Firstly, I want to say it's great that you've reached out for guidance, it's a crucial first step. Dealing with anxiety, especially related to particular experiences such as traveling, can indeed be tough. It's quite common to have pre-travel anxiety and then feel relatively okay once the trip has begun. 

When it comes to overcoming anxiety, it's always helpful to start small. You might want to consider short, local trips on your own or with a friend who understands your anxiety. Familiarity can lower anxiety, so, visiting places, again and again, may benefit. 

Commend yourself for managing your anxiety during the trips that you have taken, it shows your courage and potential to navigate this. Plus, speaking about your pre-travel worries with friends or family might help too, it not only offers emotional support but it'd make them more mindful about your feelings during these outings.

Another effective strategy may be mindful exercises or meditation ‚Äì it can help you stay grounded in the present moment, rather than worrying about future trips. Professional assistance, such as speaking with a therapist or counselor, may also provide insights and coping mechanisms tailored specifically to your needs.

Please remember, it's important to take the time to understand how you're feeling, validate those feelings, and work towards a manageable solution at your own pace. Everyone's journey with anxiety is unique and overcoming it isn't an overnight process. Progress is progress, no matter how small it may seem. Also, remember it's perfectly alright to ask for help - we all need it sometimes.

Stay resilient and keep believing in yourself!

"Hey there, thanks for opening up about your experiences, and I‚Äôm really sorry to hear what you‚Äôre going through right now. It sounds like you‚Äôve been dealing with a lot of anxiety centered around traveling, and it's good to acknowledge it. 

You're already on the right track by trying to understand your feelings. And remember, it's okay to feel anxious; it's a natural human response. But when it starts impacting your lifestyle, it needs to be addressed.

Perhaps you could try gradually easing into travel. Maybe start with a small, local trip with only one or two people whom you trust and who understand your situation. It could also be helpful to have clarity around the itinerary, as this might reduce the unpredictability and therefore the anxiety of the situation. 

Try to engage in activities that you enjoy and find calming leading up to, and during the trip. This could be listening to your favorite music or podcast, reading, drawing, or anything that generally makes you feel relaxed.

It might also be helpful to engage in mindfulness-based practices or therapeutic techniques like Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) to manage your anticipatory anxiety. There‚Äôre a lot of online resources, and professionals who can guide you through these techniques.

If you feel comfortable sharing your feelings with your family and friends, let them know about your anxiety. It‚Äôs okay to ask for emotional support and accommodations when needed.

Remember, it's okay if progress is slow. Don't put too much pressure on yourself to 'get over it'. Healing takes time and that's okay!

However, it's always best to reach out to a mental health professional for a suitable recommendation suited to your specific needs and personal circumstances.

Take care. Reaching out is a big first step, and I hope these suggestions might offer some guidance.

I don't know when exactly it started. Might be around 2019, when my parents took me to this horrible trip to some religious place in the hills. Before this, we used to do great trips, London, USA, etc., which I enjoyed. But then, after this, I've always been uncomfortable/reluctant when it comes to any sort of traveling. Imma say as a 32yo, looking forward to trips with my girl rather than family outings has shifted my perspective, yet the anxiety remains. Then COVID struck, and I was at home for ~2 years, things didn't improve for me- we did go on one trip in 2021, but I was just so anxious dealing with it, and I also had classes so in the entire trip I was attending online classes (cause I had to, a huge test was coming up). My problem is that I'm anxious before the trip happens and during it I'm completely fine. It's gotten better now tho, but not completely cured. Going alone or with friends seems like a mammoth task. Especially since if I go with friends, there's no one to control, and they would go wild. I know I need to get over this for the future. Any tips?	"Hey there, first off, just want to commend you for recognizing your anxiety and wanting to take steps to address it. A lot of us like routine and predictability, life can feel secure that way. It sounds like the unexpectedness of trips is causing some anxiety for you, but remember, it's entirely normal to feel out of your comfort zone in new situations.

You mentioned that you're completely fine once the trip happens ‚Äî that's a great start. It shows you can adapt and have resiliency. Remembering this during the anticipatory phase might help alleviate some of your anxiety. Remind yourself of previous trips that you've enjoyed and how you managed to have a good time despite your initial worries.

As per dealing with friends, it's okay to communicate your anxieties to them as well. They might not understand it right away, but explaining what triggers your anxiety might help them be more mindful and supportive. You don't need to be in control of everything, and neither do they need to go wild. Establishing some sort of middle ground could be beneficial.

And no, you're not supposed to get ""completely cured"" instantaneously; it's often a gradual process. Speaking with a therapist can give you personalized coping mechanisms to deal with this. You're not alone in this battle, and seeking help can make a giant difference. Keep going, you're doing better than you think."

"I'm really sorry to hear about your struggles with travel anxiety, it's a more common experience than you might think. Try to remember that it's okay to feel anxious and it's okay to step back and take things at your own pace. It could help to start off with short trips and gradually increase the distance or duration over time. This would let you slowly acclimate to the idea of travelling, yet still feel in control.

Anxiety often comes from a lack of control or unpredictability, so doing your own research on the destination, activities, and schedule can be really reassuring. Also, mindfulness exercises and deep breathing can be handy coping mechanisms when you start to feel the anxiety coming on.

Group travel or with friends can be a different kind of stress, when there's pressure to keep up with their pace or activities, but remember it's okay to do your own thing. Communicate your feelings, most likely they will understand and give you the space you need.

And lastly, don't be too hard on yourself. Everyone has their own hurdles to overcome, and it's okay that this is yours right now. The fact that you're facing it head on and asking for advice shows a great deal of bravery. Best of luck!"

Your experiences sound incredibly stressful, and it's common to have anxiety and fears around changes in routine, especially when it comes to travel. Given what you've said, it seems like your anxieties stem from a lack of control and predictability, which is absolutely normal. 

One step you could try is to give yourself as much known information as possible about your travel plans. Have your itinerary planned out and given to you well in advance and potentially look at creating contingency plans for situations that you're afraid might arise, to give yourself a sense of control.

Moreover, it might be helpful to practice identifying what's in your control versus what's not in your control, and reassess what actions you can take. You can't control how other people act, but you can decide who you want to travel with and under what circumstances.

And remember, it's okay to delegate and ask for reassurance when you need it. Some people find comfort in knowing that they're not alone in managing their concerns and worries. 

Engaging in practices such as deep breathing or mindfulness techniques can also be beneficial to mitigating anxiety. Regular use of these techniques can help you gain better control over your mental and emotional response to the anxiety-inducing situation. 

Lastly, it might be worth seeing a mental health professional who could give you more personalized coping strategies. While feeling anxious from time to time is common, if it‚Äôs affecting your daily life or causing you distress, professional help can be very beneficial. Please remember, it's okay to seek help and to prioritize your mental health."
I'm sorry for this little rant here, but I don‚Äôt know what else to do‚Ä¶ I have been clinically depressed since I was 14, and although I am sure I have had happy moments or times when everything didn't feel so dark, I keep coming back to the same place emotionally.

I really feel for you. I want you to know that it's okay to vent, and it's valid to express how you're feeling. You're dealing with a lot right now - clinical depression, caring responsibilities, your demanding job, and academic stress - and it's understandable to feel overwhelmed.

While I want to help, I believe that seeing a mental health professional would be incredibly beneficial for you if you aren't doing so already. Their expertise could offer you some coping strategies for dealing with the weight of it all. 

Remember, it's crucial to take care of yourself amidst everything else. Nourishing your own emotional well-being is important. It's okay to take a step back when you need it, and it's okay to say no to things, even to the people you care about. Make sure you set some time to rest and recharge, doing things that you truly enjoy and make you feel good. 

Regarding your dad, have you considered seeking help with his care? There are professional caregivers or social services available who could provide support.

Finally, please discuss with your friends how you're feeling. They won't forget you, I promise. And it's simpler to support you if they know what you're going through. 

I hope this helps even just a little. Remember, it's okay to be kinder to yourself. Wishing you strength and good days ahead."

Comment:

Hello friend, it sure sounds like you're going through some tough times right now and you must be feeling quite overwhelmed. It's completely okay to feel this way and let's try to remember that it's not a reflection of your strength or abilities. 

Dealing with depression, ageing parents, academic and work pressures, all at once, makes for a heavy burden. It's important for you to find a supportive and understanding environment to express yourself freely. And posting here is a crucial first step towards that.

Have you considered seeking professional help such as a therapist or psychiatrist? They are trained to help you navigate your feelings and address ways in which you can break this depressive cyclical pattern. This professional support could really be beneficial for you during this difficult time.

Your dad's situation sounds like it could benefit from additional help as well. Perhaps a social worker or a home aide provided by his healthcare insurance might be a good step to take. They can help manage his condition and ensure he is taking care of himself. 

Balance during these times is vital. Try to schedule some time in the week for self-care. Whether that's a walk in the park, a warm bath, a new book or some colorfully vibrant foods. These little moments of calm in the storm could help to ease the burden just a touch.

And remember, your emotions do not have to be the boss of you. It's okay to ask for space, for help, for understanding, or simply for a break. You're so, so much stronger than your current circumstances would make you feel.

Lastly, you've taken a courageous step by sharing your struggle with others. Continue in this vein, as online or offline connections can help provide emotional support and even practical advice. 

We're all on this journey together. And yes, let's carry hope that things will get better."

I hope it gets better for all of us.	"Hey there, first of all, don't apologize for speaking your truth. That's the first step towards healing. I can see that you're carrying a lot on your shoulders right now and that can be incredibly tough. Try to remember to be patient with yourself - you're doing the best you can given the circumstances. It's also important to let yourself grieve the loss of the relationship dynamic with your mother. It's okay to not always feel strong.

Your mental health is equally as important as your physical health. Would you consider seeking support from a counselor or therapist? Universities often have resources available and these professionals can also assist by providing techniques to manage the overwhelming feeling of being burnt out. 

Speaking of burnout, try as much as possible to take breaks during your work and studies. You could explore meditation, deep breathing exercises, or just setting aside a few minutes each day for some form of self-care such as a hobby or any relaxing activity.

Talk to your friends as well. They may not offer solutions, but sometimes all we need to feel a little less alone is a listening ear. You'd be surprised by how many people around you might be going through something similar.

In the meantime, remember: it's okay to ask for help. Your feelings are valid, and you're not alone. This community cares for you and is here to support you. You're stronger than you think. Hold on, brighter days are ahead."

It sounds like you're dealing with a significant amount of stress and anxiety, which can absolutely exacerbate feelings of depression. I want to remind you that it's okay to feel tired and burned-out, as it's a normal response to being overwhelmed. 

Please remember, it's important to give yourself downtime too, and it's okay if your academic scores occasionally take a hit to allow yourself some much-needed relaxation. Moreover, it's great that you treasure your friendships, but real friends will understand your situation and be supportive, even when you prioritize your mental health.

You've been strong for so long and taking care of others, but have you considered seeking professional help to navigate through these situations? There are many therapists who offer teletherapy services, and many might be able to work with you on a sliding scale considering your stressors. It‚Äôs okay to seek out support‚Äîin fact, it‚Äôs a huge sign of strength.

Also, concerning your dad, there might be local or national support services that would help him with his healthcare and possibly provide some type of companionship. Resources like ""Meals on Wheels"" can be a big support in such circumstances.

Thank you for opening up about your feelings here - it isn't easy to share our struggles, but remember, you aren't alone. We're all here to support and connect in shared understanding. Please take care of yourself."

I'm really sorry to hear that you're having such a tough time, and I admire your courage for reaching out and sharing your feelings here. Depression takes many forms and affects everyone differently, but remember, depression is not a weakness, not at all. It's an illness. You're stronger than you know and your resilience shines through in your message.

It‚Äôs clear that you‚Äôre under an immense amount of stress between school, your job, your social life, and your family issues. It‚Äôs important to remember that it's okay to take a step back and breathe. It's okay to prioritize your mental health, because it's just as important as your physical health. Is there someone at your university you can speak to about your workload or possibly taking a lighter courseload?

Also, for your father, perhaps contacting a local community center or senior center may provide some day to day support for him. A possible outing every now and then could even provide a spark of happiness in his life, just as your girlfriend does for you. 

In regard to your feelings of loneliness, I highly recommend reaching out to a mental health professional if you haven't already. They can understand your situation better and provide you with tools and techniques to manage your load. You're not alone in this. There's always help to be found. And remember, everything is temporary. Even the worst possible feelings you're feeling now will eventually pass.

I really hope that things get better for you soon. Please keep on sharing and reaching out. You're stronger than you think!"

I'm genuinely sorry to hear that you're going through such a tough time, but I'm really proud of you for reaching out and sharing your struggle, that's a brave step. It sounds like you're juggling a lot between school, work, personal life, and caring for your family members. That's a ton of responsibility and it's understandable to feel overwhelmed. I wish there was an easy solution, but we both know that's not how it works. Have you considered seeking professional help, like a therapist or counselor? They can provide strategies and tools to better manage your mental health. About your dad, do you have a local community center or services that might help him while you're not there? It's important you also take care of yourself because you are battling a lot right now. Finally, if you ever feel suicidally desperate or in danger, please reach somebody who can provide immediate help like a crisis hotline. You're not alone in this, remember that. Keep going, you're stronger than you think.

Remember, it's okay to feel overwhelmed sometimes and it's okay to let it out. There's no need to apologize, as venting is completely okay. 

Also, remember that it's okay to seek for help too -- perhaps reaching out to friends you trust, joining support groups where you might find solidarity in shared experiences, or even seeking professional help. A therapist or counselor can help you navigate your feelings, develop coping strategies, and simply provide a listening ear. 

One small tip that might help is 'chunking it down,' that is dealing with things day by day, or even hour by hour if needed. It's like eating an elephant, not in one go, but bite by bite. Remember, it does get better. It always does. None of us know exactly when, but it will. We're all here with you on this journey and we have your back. Please, take care."

Dealing with depression, along with the serious health problems of your loved ones, is a huge load. It's normal to feel overwhelmed by it all. But remember, you‚Äôre not alone- there are people who understand and would be willing to support you in whatever way they can. 

Try to set aside some time for self-care. Find what works for you, whether that's reading a book, doing some exercise, or just sitting in silence for a few minutes each day. It may not fix everything, but it could provide a small break from the stress.

It might also be worth exploring professional help if you think it could be beneficial. Therapists and counselors are trained to give us tools to manage our mental health alongside our day-to-day responsibilities, and they might be able to provide a fresh perspective on your situation.

It's okay to ask your friends for support too. Let them know what you're going through- you might be surprised by how understanding they can be. The same goes for your university- there could be resources available to you that you're not aware of.

Remember, it's okay not to be okay all the time. You're dealing with a lot, and it's only natural to feel weighed down sometimes. You're doing the best you can, and that's enough. Please don‚Äôt apologize. Your feelings are valid and sharing helps, even if just a little. Situations change, people change, and it won‚Äôt always feel so relentless. Hang in there."

It's quite a lot to handle, and I can only imagine how overwhelming everything must feel for you. Firstly, please don't apologize - reaching out like this is a powerful step towards managing your struggles, and we're here to listen.

Having the burden of caring for relatives while being a student, working and dealing with personal issues is a tremendous amount of stress. It's okay to feel overwhelmed, tired, and alone - these feelings are a completely normal reaction to your current situation. Mental health, just like physical health, needs to rest and heal.

You should consider seeking some professional help if you aren't already. Therapists and counselors are equipped to help us navigate through our difficult times. If you're at university, there might be some resources available to you there.

Try to take care of yourself as much as you can even in little ways, like ensuring you get enough sleep, trying to eat healthily, and taking short breaks throughout the day to do something you enjoy. Keep in mind that it‚Äôs okay to take time for yourself; you are important too.

Is there a way you could reach out to your friends? Maybe talk to them about how you're feeling, and you could perhaps even create a circle of support during these hard times. Sometimes people want to be there for us but do not know how or even that we need it. As for your dad, have you tried seeking some help for him too? Maybe a home nurse or support group of people going through a similar situation. 

Just remember that you do not have to face these challenges on your own. It's okay to ask for help, and it's okay to share how you feel. You're doing great so far, and even though it might not feel like it right now, things will get better."
So I have decided to well distance myself from most of my friends. The reason why is even though I seem to be getting better, the people around me keep getting hurt because of me. But there‚Äôs no reason for me to get rid of my friends that I don‚Äôt see in person anymore, so there‚Äôs no reason to worry about them because they did seem to get hurt. The reason why the people around me are getting hurt is because of me. Now that I have shown more emotion, I tend to lose control over my emotions, and when I do, I try to control it, but it just makes me angry. After that, I would say things I don‚Äôt mean or physically hurt the people around me. I don‚Äôt mind the looks I get, but I don‚Äôt want to hurt the people I care about. I just want to protect them, but if I can‚Äôt even stop myself from hurting, then how am I supposed to stop others. Imma say as a 32yo, seeking peace and stability within myself and with my girl has been crucial. I really am just looking for some advice, or if anyone really knows what is going on, I haven‚Äôt been in the right mindset for a while now, and I don‚Äôt think this will help me in any way.	"Hi there, it sounds like you're carrying a lot of guilt and anger and it's causing pain for you and the ones around you. I understand that you want to protect your loved ones, but remember that isolating yourself isn't always the answer. 

First off, acknowledging these feelings and that you may need help is a significant first step, so kudos to you for reaching out. Please do consider seeking professional help if you haven't already. A therapist or counselor could guide you in dealing with these emotions more effectively. 

In addition, consider exploring mindfulness techniques or meditation to ground yourself whenever you feel like you're losing control. It might sound cliched, but it's about living in the moment and not letting your emotions get the better of you. 

Seeking for internal peace and acceptance is a continuous process and it starts with you loving and understanding yourself. And always remember, it's okay to ask for help when you need it. This isn't a journey you have to take alone."
So I have decided to well distance myself from most of my friends. The reason why is even though I seem to be getting better, the people around me keep getting hurt because of me. But there‚Äôs no reason for me to get rid of my friends that I don‚Äôt see in person anymore, so there‚Äôs no reason to worry about them because they did seem to get hurt. The reason why the people around me are getting hurt is because of me. Now that I have shown more emotion, I tend to lose control over my emotions, and when I do, I try to control it, but it just makes me angry. After that, I would say things I don‚Äôt mean or physically hurt the people around me. I don‚Äôt mind the looks I get, but I don‚Äôt want to hurt the people I care about. I just want to protect them, but if I can‚Äôt even stop myself from hurting, then how am I supposed to stop others.

"Hi there, 

I'm really sorry that you're struggling at the moment. It sounds like you're dealing with some powerful emotions and it's really brave of you to reach out for help like this. The journey towards self-control and understanding one's emotions can be challenging, but please know you're not alone. 

Firstly, it's important to recognize that it's okay to have feelings and to express them. In fact, acknowledging your emotions is a healthy first step. It may be beneficial to work on managing your emotions with healthy coping mechanisms such as meditation or opening up to professional therapists/doctors.

Harming others is never okay, but it's good that you have the self-awareness to see that this is happening and that it needs to change. If you feel at risk of causing harm, it's crucial to distance yourself in that moment and seek professional help.

Resource-wise, there are self-help materials available online around anger management, emotional regulation, or Cognitive Behavioral Therapy(CBT). You might find such resources helpful for gaining insights and learning practical steps for managing your emotions.

It's okay to let go of certain relationships if they're causing harm to you or others, but it might also be worth discussing this issue with them if possible, as they may wish to support you through it. 

But please also remember, this isn't something you have to navigate all on your own. If you haven't already, I'd strongly recommend reaching out to a mental health professional, such as a psychologist, to discuss what you're going through. They can provide emotional support, understanding, and guide you with practical methods for coping with your emotions. They're the experts and there's absolutely no shame in seeking their help.

Take care and remember, it's okay to ask for help, it doesn't make you weaker but stronger. Wishing you all the best on your journey towards mental well-being."

Consider exploring various methods of managing your emotions. Mindfulness and meditation can be very useful tools. Sometimes, engaging in physical activities like running, hiking or yoga can also help in releasing and managing overwhelming emotions in a more physical way.

Support groups (both offline and online) might also provide some comfort, as they will allow you to connect with people experiencing similar situations. These groups can provide a safe space for you to express yourself without fear of judgment or causing harm.

You've mentioned that you're seeking peace and stability - this shows introspection and self-awareness. Counselling or psychotherapy could be great resources to help you navigate through these issues. Remember, it's absolutely okay to seek professional help when dealing with these feelings.

"First off, it‚Äôs a pretty brave thing to share your thoughts and feelings, and I appreciate you for doing so. What you're experiencing seems to be a tough situation, and it's okay to feel overwhelmed. It might be helpful to realize that emotions aren't inherently good or bad, they just are. It's not about controlling them but about understanding and managing them, which takes practice. Kindly note that it's okay to feel anger, but what you do with that feeling matters. Think about ways to express your anger that won't harm others or yourself. Physical activity, art, writing, or even talking it out can help. Remember, it's okay to step back and take time to heal. 

Professional help could also be beneficial. Therapists, counselors, and psychologists have tools and strategies to help control your emotions, patterns of thought, and actions. They can give you a safe space to express yourself. Recovering from this might take time and that‚Äôs okay. Everyone's healing process is unique.

So ima just keep this short, but most of my life, I‚Äôve never gotten attention from my parents. That‚Äôs due to the fact my mom had many jobs and was still in college while my father was an addict. I think this is where it came from, I‚Äôm pretty sure. But according to my mom, I have an addict personality, and to be honest, I don‚Äôt disagree with her. I have been addicted to many things and not only just the harmful stuff but specific foods and things that might not seem harmful. But they can most definitely be in large quantities. The reason why she said this is because she has plenty of evidence to support it. I have always been addicted to something ever since I was a kid. I had an addiction whether it was bad or good. I had always had one. Imma say as a 32yo, trying to find balance and healthier outlets with my girl's support is a new challenge. Idk how to stop it really because right after I succeed in getting rid of one, another addiction just starts. So if anyone has an idea of something that would help me or has been through this, it would be nice to hear that I‚Äôm not the only person that has this problem.	"Hello there,

Thanks for opening up and sharing your story here; indeed, it takes a lot of courage to do so. Many people experience similar circumstances as they navigate life, and it's important for you to know you're absolutely not alone in this journey. 

It sounds like you're very self-aware of your addictive tendencies, and that's an important first step in making a change. Having a supportive partner, like your girlfriend, can be an invaluable resource.

Speaking of resources, it seems like professional help could guide you through this process effectively. A psychologist or a therapist can offer you a non-judgmental place to analyze your addiction patterns and help you develop more healthy and balanced coping strategies.

One thing that might help in the meantime is finding and focusing on a hobby you love. It could be anything like painting, cooking, hiking, whatever resonates with you. It could be a positive focus of your energy while you figure out the professional help avenue.

It's important to remember though, addressing addictive tendencies is a marathon, not a sprint. Stay patient with yourself, and remember it's okay to have rough days.

Take care!"

Thanks for reaching out and being so open about your struggles - that's a massive step right off the bat!

Firstly, having an addictive personality doesn't define you, and it's important to remember that. It seems like this trait has been passed down from your father and it's something you‚Äôre very aware of, which is that first crucial step in managing it.

Addictive behaviour can indeed transfer from substance to substance, including various activities or foods as you‚Äôve mentioned. Find reassurances in the fact that you‚Äôre not alone in this - many people struggle with the same issues.

It's great that you‚Äôre actively trying to find balance and healthier outlets, and that you have the support of your girlfriend. Perhaps a healthier 'addiction' could be something beneficial like exercise, music or art? These can provide an outlet for your energies in a positive way.

Consider seeking professional help if you haven't already - a mental health professional could provide you with proven coping strategies and tools to help manage your addictive behaviors. You're clearly a driven person, and with the right help, I am confident you can channel this energy into positive change.

Remember, it‚Äôs okay to ask help and it‚Äôs okay to struggle. Don't give up, you're making progress just by acknowledging the issue and seeking advice. Keep going strong, you've got this!"

First off, thank you for opening up about your struggles. It's very brave of you to discuss these things so publicly. Acknowledging your pattern of addictive behaviors is a big step on the path towards positive change. Remember, it's not uncommon or wrong to lean into certain behaviors or substances for comfort; we all have our own coping mechanisms. The challenge is when these mechanisms begin to rule us. 

Being aware of your addictive habits and wanting to change is a super-important first step. It can be equally helpful to figure out your triggers and what makes you reach out for these addictions. Often times, it's underlying pain, trauma, fear, anxiety or unmet needs that might be causing these urges.

One of the effective ways to channelize your excessive energies is to plunge into healthier habits like exercise, meditation or any other hobby you might enjoy. Picking up a sport or setting short-term and long-term goals, whether personal or professional, can help provide a balance and a diversion.

Also, consider seeking professional help like therapy or counseling. It could be beneficial to talk to someone who's trained to understand the complexities of human behaviour and tendencies, and can provide you with tools and techniques to cope better.

Keep in mind, change is a process and it takes time; be patient with yourself. Remember, every step towards a healthier you - no matter how small - is a victory. Celebrate all progress. Best wishes on your journey.

You're not alone; we're with you. You've got a whole community rooting for you!"

First, let me say how courageous it is for you to acknowledge these challenges in your life. Your openness and dedication to making a change aren't easy but it's commendable. The struggle with addictive behaviour is something many people face, so please know that you are not alone.

One of the main keys to overcoming addiction is to identify the underlying cause. From your post, it seems that you've partly done that already and you've identified that the lack of attention from your parents could be a major factor. Similarly, you mentioned finding a healthier outlet for the things you've built a dependency on. This is fantastic, as replacing the negative reinforcements with positive actions will be beneficial. 

You asked specifically for ideas on what might help you - a great starting point could be speaking to a mental health professional if you haven't done so already. They might be able to provide strategies tailored specifically to you and your situation. On a personal level, it could be helpful to practice mindfulness or meditation, which can help you navigate those cravings when they appear. 

Remember, change doesn't happen overnight, and patience is key. It's a journey, and there's no shame in seeking help. Know that there's this entire community here supporting you. Keep going!"

The first step in overcoming this is acknowledging the problem, which you're doing admirably. It's fantastic that you have support from your partner in this process - that's very important. 

There is no silver bullet to overcoming addiction but finding new, healthy methods of coping is key. Focus on developing a range of strategies so you‚Äôre not solely reliant on one. These might include exercise, mindfulness, reading, learning a new skill - really anything that helps you feel calm and fulfilled without turning into another addiction itself. 

Additionally, professional guidance might be very helpful. Counseling, therapy or joining a support group could provide you with the tools to manage your addictive behaviors. Please remember that it's absolutely okay to reach out to these resources and there's no shame in doing so. 

Also remember that progress isn't linear, it's okay to have setbacks. What matters is that you keep trying, keep pushing forward. You've done it before, you can do it again. One day at a time. You're stronger than you think. Take care."
So ima just keep this short, but most of my life, I‚Äôve never gotten attention from my parents. That‚Äôs due to the fact my mom had many jobs and was still in college while my father was an addict. I think this is where it came from, I‚Äôm pretty sure. But according to my mom, I have an addict personality, and to be honest, I don‚Äôt disagree with her. I have been addicted to many things and not only just the harmful stuff but specific foods and things that might not seem harmful. But they can most definitely be in large quantities. The reason why she said this is because she has plenty of evidence to support it. I have always been addicted to something ever since I was a kid. I had an addiction whether it was bad or good. I had always had one. Imma say as a 32yo, trying to find balance and healthier outlets with my girl's support is a new challenge. Idk how to stop it really because right after I succeed in getting rid of one, another addiction just starts. So if anyone has an idea of something that would help me or has been through this, it would be nice to hear that I‚Äôm not the only person that has this problem.	Hello there, I'm really sorry to hear that you're struggling with this. First off, know that you're not alone, many people battle different addictions and, more importantly, many succeed to overcome them. It's fantastic that you recognize and acknowledge this tendency within yourself, as the first step towards solving any problem is acknowledging that there is one. Reach out to mental health resources in your area, like therapists or counsellor, with a specialty in addiction if possible. These professionals can provide you with strategies and coping mechanisms to help manage these tendencies. You might also want to consider joining a support group, as hearing others' experiences and how they are managing might provide valuable insight and perspective. The great thing is that you're not alone in this. I wish you all the best as you embark on your journey towards balance and healthier outlets. Stay strong!

Firstly, I‚Äôm so sorry to hear about your struggles -- you certainly aren't alone. Many of us, in one form or another, have grappled with understanding ourselves, our habits, and why we do the things we do. It's admirable that you're reaching out for advice, and even more so that you have someone supportive in your life like your girlfriend. 

The first component of your journey towards finding balance is self-awareness, which you're already demonstrating by acknowledging this pattern. And yes, it's true - what seems like harmless habits can spiral out of control when done in excess. 

From your post, it sounds like you've already started taking the first steps towards finding healthier outlets. That's a great start! Try not to stress too much about trying to find the ""perfect"" outlet right away. It's okay to experiment until you find something that fits you. 

You could also consider seeking professional help, if it's within your means. Therapists specialise in these areas and can provide you with tools and strategies for understanding and managing your addictive tendencies. There are also support groups available, both in person and online, which may help you feel less alone in your struggles. 

Additionally, don‚Äôt forget to commend yourself for the progress you've already made. While it might not be as tangible as you'd like, every step you've taken so far counts and is bringing you closer to where you want to be. I recognise that managing these urges can be challenging, but remember that it's okay to ask for help, and it's okay to take things one day at a time.

My DMs are open if you need someone to chat with. Wishing you all the best on your journey towards balance and health!"

Thanks for sharing your story and for being so open about your struggles. Remember, you're definitely not alone. Your determination to seek help and make changes is commendable. 

If you find the cycle of shifting addictions difficult to break, consider seeking professional guidance if you haven't already. A therapist or counselor can provide you not only with coping mechanisms but also deeper understanding of the root cause of your addictive personality. This can potentially lead to long-term change. 

Support groups can be incredibly beneficial as well. Connecting with individuals who experience similar challenges can foster a sense of understanding and mutual motivation towards healthier habits. 

Remember, change doesn't happen overnight. Each baby step counts and it's okay to ask for help along the way. Don't forget to acknowledge those little victories you've already achieved in fighting your addictions. Every small win is progress.

Remember to take care of your physical health too. Good nutrition, sleep, and regular exercise all contribute to mental well-being. They might also replace the unhealthy addictions with healthier ones.

Cheers to your journey towards a healthier you. You're not alone and there's always help available. Keep going!"

"Hey there, firstly, kudos to you for recognizing your patterns and having a desire to change. It does sound like you're striving for balance and healthier coping mechanisms, which is fantastic.

I want to reiterate that opening up online about your problem is a brave step, so I think you're definitely doing something right. You aren't alone on this journey. Many of us have faced similar struggles. You've already made significant progress by recognizing your tendency towards compulsive behavior, and this self-awareness is incredibly important.

The most beneficial thing to do at this point would be to seek professional help. Counselors, therapists or psychologists are trained to deal with these specific circumstances and can provide strategies and guidance on how to manage your addictive personality.

In the meantime, try to discover new, healthier habits to engage in - perhaps hobbies or sports you find interesting, or reading/self-education. This could channel your energy in a positive way and may help reduce the addiction towards harmful habits. Remember that having habits and routines aren‚Äôt a bad thing, it just matters what these consist of.

Stay strong and keep going. Healing is absolutely possible, and keep in mind that it's a journey, not a destination. It also takes time, so don‚Äôt beat yourself up if progress seems slow. Keep your mind on your goal, involve as many supportive people as possible, and don't lose courage. You have got this!"

"Hey there, it sounds like you're really struggling with balancing various forms of addiction in your life, and that's a big challenge to face. First, recognize that it is a good sign and an enormous victory that you're aware of this pattern and want to make a change. Second, understand that you're not alone in this. Many people deal with addiction, whether it's substance-related or related to certain behaviors.

However, to make real progress, professional help is often the best course of action. Therapists or counsellors who specialize in addiction can provide valuable strategies to break this cycle and represent an excellent offloading point for your worries and anxieties.

In the meantime, you might want to consider replacing harmful addictions with more positive 'addictions' like meditation, yoga, or fitness. Practicing mindfulness can help you learn to live in the moment, instead of seeking constant stimulation and reward, and it can also help you recognize the feelings that push you towards these addictive behaviours.

Also, don't forget to discuss this issue with your girl. Having a support system and being open about your struggles can lighten the burden significantly.

Take one step at a time, and don't forget to celebrate your small victories. It won't be easy, but remember, it's okay not to be perfect. It's okay to have bad days. Progress isn't linear, but every step that you take toward a healthier lifestyle is a step in the right direction. You're on a journey towards a better version of yourself. Stick with it. You're stronger than you think."
I know... it affects me. I had my sleep on schedule before, but the recent events didn't allow me to have a good sleep. But it's fine. I can change it slowly. Had a little dark thoughts at night, but it didn't last long. Some self-hatred and other usual stuff, but it wasn't that bad. I mean, can I get better in one night? Of course not. Still felt lonely (or alone... I don't know my English sucks:() but that's fine too. Pain is part of my journey. I'm not feeling strong yet, but it doesn't hurt like last week. Also, I had a small good conversation with someone which made me happy that moment. I was supposed to go to see my psychiatrist but I didn't go because I was scared. It's really hard to go there. But it's ok, at least I tried to think about going there. I need to change my medicines. Overall, I'm sad but not too much. Like 4/10. That's good. I mean, it was 9/10 last week, so I'm still satisfied. Imma say as a 32yo, these small victories feel significant, and finding support in my girl during these times is invaluable.	"Hey there, it sounds like you're going through a rough patch. I understand the distress that you're feeling, but remember, feelings of self-loathing and despair can be temporary. It's okay to not have everything figured out all at once. It's heartwarming to hear that you're taking small steps towards feeling better and that's a huge victory in itself! You have support and understanding here on this forum.

Your English is fine and you are able to express yourself, don't worry. It seems like there's a lot to deal with, but letting those feelings out is part of the journey to healing. Also, consider communicating with your psychiatrist about your fears - they're there to help, and could potentially suggest alternatives to your current treatment plan.

Changes, even small ones, when they are consistent, can lead to big improvements. It's completely okay to feel scared and alone sometimes, but remember, it's not a permanent state. You're doing really well by even acknowledging these feelings and your own personal growth‚Äîthat's a huge part of self-improvement and self-care. You're not alone in this voyage. Stay strong!

Also, it's not always flawless‚Äîlife goes up and down, but those moments of happiness that you described, like your conversation, show that joy exists even in unexpected places. Keep your strength up, my friend. You're stronger than you think and every step forward counts! I hope this helps. Take care."

Firstly, well done for recognizing the small victories; they really are important steps toward feeling better overall. Changes are seldom instant, usually they are gradual, so it's perfectly fine to take things slowly. 

I'm glad to hear you're not feeling as down as you were before. Please consider reaching out to your psychiatrist about your medication, remember that they are there to support you and help you get back on track. It's understandable that you might feel scared, but I promise they are there to offer support and not to judge. You're certainly not alone on your journey -- there are myriad people, both offline and online, who are ready and willing to help. 

Finally, I must stress, if these dark thoughts persist, don't hesitate to seek immediate help, particularly from professionals or trusted individuals in your life -- friends, family, or partners."

Small victories are indeed significant and worth celebrating. Keep up with that positive attitude and it will carry you a long way. Remember, it‚Äôs okay to feel scared or anxious about seeking help. Everyone goes through that but it's important to face our fears when we're ready. Maybe make a suggestion next time to your psychiatrist about that, they may be able to provide solutions such as virtual consultations if going there physically feels difficult. Reach out to people who support you, like your girl. Always remember, there is strength in seeking help and it's not a sign of weakness. Keep hanging in there! You are stronger than you think.

First off, let me just say I'm really proud of you for reaching out and sharing your recent experiences with us. It's not always an easy thing to do. Recognizing that these problems exist, and that it's absolutely fine to not be feeling 100% all the time, are crucial steps in the right direction.

From what you've said, it seems like you're going through a lot right now. Remember, it's okay to feel what you're feeling. These things do take time and that's okay. The important part is that you're making an effort and trying, which is commendable.

Starting on the path towards better mental health is hard; it‚Äôs not a straight line but more of a journey with ups and downs. It's great that you were able to have a good conversation with someone recently. Small victories like this really do count!

About your psychiatrist, it's completely normal to feel scared. Take your time, and maybe consider reaching out via phone or email first if that feels easier. And about your medication, perhaps now is the time to discuss changing the medications with your psychiatrist, if you think that would contribute to your improvement.

Lastly, remember, you're not alone in this. We're all in this together and this community is here for you. Continue seeking support, from us, your girl, and anyone else you trust. You're stronger than you think and you‚Äôre making progress. Thanks for sharing and opening up to us about your journey. One step at a time. You got this."

I'm really glad to see you're reaching out and talking about this. Taking things one day at a time, and recognizing your small victories is a significant step in the healing process. 

It sounds like you've had a tough week but it's remarkable that you are acknowledging your feelings and being so self-aware. That shows strength. Remember, it is absolutely okay to feel sad and it is okay to be scared too. Both are normal, human emotions. 

It's wonderful that you have someone supportive in your life. Please lean on them when you need to. Vulnerability does not mean you are weak‚Äîit actually requires a great amount of courage.

Also, about seeing a psychiatrist, if the idea of going to see them makes you anxious, consider online or phone consultations. This might make the situation feel a bit less daunting for you.

You seem committed to trying to improve your life, taking note of your small victories, and engaging in social connections. These are all beneficial and positive attitudes towards your mental health journey.

Please keep taking things slowly, and remember, the journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. I believe in you. 

You‚Äôre doing great by taking these first small steps, and no matter what, we‚Äôre here for you. Make sure to stay connected with people who lift you up and make you feel better, self-care is essential. Keep pushing, and remember setbacks aren't signs of weakness but opportunities for growth.

Take care of yourself, friend. You're not alone in this, and it's okay to ask for help. You're stronger than you think. Keep going!

"Hey there, it's good to hear from you and see that you're making some progress, no matter how small it may seem. Remember, progress is progress! Things can only get better when you're moving forward.

Sleep and mental health are deeply intertwined so it's important to prioritize good sleep hygiene. When things get tough, try to focus on maintaining healthy routines, even if they start out small. 

Feeling alone can be really hard, but please remember that it's okay to reach out to people around you and share how you're feeling. You're not burdening them - it's fine to seek help when you need it. Moreover, it's nice to hear that you had a good conversation with someone; those small positive instances can really boost our mood!

Also, kudos for intending to see your psychiatrist! That's already a step in the right direction. It may feel scary, but it's important to remember that they are there to help you. If you're uncomfortable with the idea of visiting, maybe you can try teletherapy? Several mental health professionals offer it, and it's been found effective. 

Changing up your meds can be a daunting task, but remember that it is for your betterment. Be patient with this process as it may take time for you to find what works best for you.

Lastly, I would like to say that it‚Äôs okay to have lower-days and you're handling this incredibly well for someone going through it. Give yourself some credit. Your strength and resilience shine through in your post. Stay strong, keep pushing, and remember that you're not alone in this."

It sounds like you've been going through a tough time but it's inspiring to see the determination in your words. Your ability to recognize your small victories and improvements really matters - it's your tool to keep moving forward. Remember, it's more than okay to feel the way you're feeling. It's part of the process and it's part of being human too. Dealing with loneliness can indeed be challenging, but you're not alone in feeling alone and people are here ready to listen.

Regarding your psychiatrist's visit, it's completely valid to feel apprehensive and scared. Remember, it's okay to take things at your own pace. When you feel ready to revisit the idea, I encourage you to do so as they are trained to assist in situations like yours and change in medication can also be an important part of your recovery.  

Glad to hear about the good conversation you had earlier. Those interactions can have more positive impact than one might realize. Perhaps consider reaching out again to them or exploring other support networks, like a local group or an online community, something that feels safe and comfortable to you.

Keep striving and remember, you are more resilient than you think. You're navigating things as best you can and that's something to be proud of. Reach out when you need to and celebrate every progress you make, no matter how small it seems."

You understand that things won't get better overnight but you are ready for small and continuous changes, and the fact that you're seeing improvement from last week is absolutely fantastic!

It's okay to feel scared about seeing a psychiatrist, many of us can relate to that feeling. The fact that you were considering it is a success in its own. I'd encourage you to take the step if you feel ready, but remember that there is no rush. There's no right or wrong speed to do things in this journey, it's about taking care of yourself the best way you can.

As for the loneliness, try to remember that you're not truly alone in this. You have your girl who appears to be supportive as well as communities like this where you can reach out anytime. And please remember, there's no judgment for your English. It's not about how well you express yourself, it's about what you're expressing which is far more important.

Keep striving, keep blossoming and remember to keep appreciating these small triumphs. You're doing great! Peace to you."
I know... it affects me. I had my sleep on schedule before, but the recent events didn't allow me to have a good sleep. But it's fine. I can change it slowly. Had a little dark thoughts at night, but it didn't last long. Some self-hatred and other usual stuff, but it wasn't that bad. I mean, can I get better in one night? Of course not. Still felt lonely (or alone... I don't know my English sucks:() but that's fine too. Pain is part of my journey. I'm not feeling strong yet, but it doesn't hurt like last week. Also, I had a small good conversation with someone which made me happy that moment. I was supposed to go to see my psychiatrist but I didn't go because I was scared. It's really hard to go there. But it's ok, at least I tried to think about going there. I need to change my medicines. Overall, I'm sad but not too much. Like 4/10. That's good. I mean, it was 9/10 last week, so I'm still satisfied. Imma say as a 32yo, these small victories feel significant, and finding support in my girl during these times is invaluable.	"Hey there, 

Firstly, I just want to acknowledge your strength and bravery for sharing this openly. It's a tough place to be and I appreciate you for taking this step. 

You're right in saying that pain is part of the journey, and it's okay to feel these things. It's okay to be gentle with yourself and it's okay for progress to be slow. Small steps are still steps forward, and it's great to see that you're already beginning to see this. 

It sounds like you've learned a lot about yourself recently, and the resilience you're showing is amazing. While it may not feel like it now, these experiences are building up your resilience and teaching you powerful lessons. 

Mental health is a journey, not a destination, so don't be so hard on yourself. Progress isn't linear and there will be setbacks along the way. But that's okay. The most important thing is you're actively trying and that matters a lot. 

Given what you've said, it would be beneficial for you to chat with a mental health professional about this, when you feel ready. I understand it's hard, the idea itself is daunting and the process can be scary. But remember, they are trained to provide the help and guidance you may need at this time. 

Also, I love that you mentioned a 'small conversation' that made you happy. Continue to seek out these positive moments!! 

Wishing you strength and peace,
Alex"
I‚Äôm sitting here at the bar that I recently started to manage‚Ä¶. This was supposed to be an exciting step, a new change for a brighter future. Every single day is work, ya know? My job has crept into every aspect of my life. My partner hates my job. I just got it in January, and we moved in together in February. Having to be on call for work has made me realize how ‚Äúon call‚Äù I am for everything. They can‚Äôt accept the fact that I have to help out this restaurant with any problems they have on any given day. And I can‚Äôt accept the fact they have an extra set of expectations of me that I‚Äôm always failing. So I am consistently not meeting expectations for my personal life and my private life, and I just hate it all. IT ALL FEELS LIKE WORK. I need help. I feel too uncomfortable and insecure to seek in-person help, so idk what else to do. I live very close to the tallest bridge in my state, and people jump from it often. I just want to be another number for that jump list. I want my family to grieve my death for a couple of days, then just please forget about me. Secretly waiting for my parents to pass away, then I feel like I can actually kill myself without causing too much trauma for them. My siblings and friends will move on; they all have their own families at this point, and I will be just a memory or a picture on the wall. I‚Äôm just so tired of every day being work, but it‚Äôs not even my job's fault. It only brought it to my attention. Imma say as a 32yo, finding moments of escape with my girl offers a brief respite from these overwhelming feelings.	failed

I have no friends aside from one from primary school who I infrequently catch up with. I really just find most people not to be worth talking to, as I find it hard to connect with many people due to my lack of shared interests and my social anxiety. However, I often feel lonely and kinda sad, especially when I see people who are having a good time with their friends. I did actually have a weird experience making a friend just recently, though, but he's way older than me, so it's a bit weird to hang out in person. I noticed he had an interest in something I really liked, and we had this great chat for about 10 minutes. It flowed so smoothly, and it was super passionate. We still message each other every couple of days. Can anyone else relate to this? Imma say as a 32yo, these moments of connection, even if they're few and far between, are valuable, and finding joy in my relationship with my girl helps fill the void left by these fleeting friendships.	"Hey there, 

First off, I just want to say it takes a lot of courage to open up about these things and you're not alone in what you're experiencing. Many people struggle with social anxiety and difficulty connecting with others. It's okay not to have a large circle of friends. What matters is the quality of relationships you do have.

Just because your new friend is much older than you, doesn't mean your friendship isn't valid. Age does not define a good friendship. Companionship and mutual understanding do. You connect over a shared interest, and that's what's important. Keep foster this friendship and don't let age difference distract you.

Your feelings of sadness and loneliness are completely valid, but don't let those feelings consume you. Instead, remind yourself of the value you bring to your relationships, how your presence and passion lights up your partner's life.

Keep looking for new hobbies and opportunities to meet new people. Remember, not everyone you meet will become a lifelong friend and that's okay. What matters is you're open to new experiences and connections. 

If your feelings of loneliness persist, it may help seek the advice of a mental health professional, or join recovery-focused groups where you can share your feelings with people who understand what you're going through.

Never lose hope. There's a whole world of people out there who'd be fortunate to be your friend. Don't give up on yourself or on the potential for connection. You have a lot to give! Take care of yourself, friend, and keep reaching out for connections. You're doing great.

"Hey there! It sounds like you're finding it difficult to connect with people of your age, and that can indeed be challenging. Everyone has their own pace with friendships and that's totally okay. The important thing is that you're building connections, and it's wonderful that you made a new friend recently who shares one of your interests. Friendships aren't determined by age, so it's not weird to have friends much older or younger than you. 

Many people can relate to what you're going through and it's commendable that you're open about it. Don't press yourself too much on making friends. It's great that you're also finding joy in your relationship. Just keep being authentic to yourself and remember that sometimes, it's quality over quantity. And, believe me, finding genuine connections, no matter how few, is worth celebrating. You're doing great!"

"Hey there! It's completely natural to feel alone sometimes, given the fact that everyone's interests and personalities are so diverse. Social anxiety can complicate this further, but it's important to remember that you're not alone in experiencing these feelings. 

It's great that you have a friend from your primary school years with whom you can rekindle memories and share life experiences. It's perfectly normal to have very few friends but still cherish the relationship with them. 

The interaction you spoke about with the individual who was much older than you highlights an important point - friendship has no age. Bonds can be formed based on mutual interests, regardless of the number of whiskers and years one has. 

Remember, it's not about the quantity of friends but the quality of the relationships you form. That rare, passionate, 10-minute conversation could be vastly more fulfilling than hours of mundane chitchat.

As for the loneliness, reaching out as you have done in this way is an excellent start. There are online forums and in-person groups for practically every interest under the sun, which could be an excellent way of meeting new people that share your passions.

In the meantime, continuing to find joy in your relationship and individual passions might help with some of the feelings you experience. Life has a funny way of throwing surprises our way, especially when we stop actively searching for them. So who knows? You may find more like-minded people than you could've imagined!

Please remember it's okay to get professional help as well. A mental health professional could provide support and tools to manage social anxiety, providing a new perspective and possible solutions to challenges you're facing. You're not alone in feeling this way, and it's okay to reach out for help."

"Hey there, 

Your feelings are more common than you think! It's normal to feel alone and disconnected sometimes, especially when it seems like everyone else around you is thriving socially. Remember, everyone's journey is different and it's important to focus on the relationships that genuinely make you happy.

It's great that you've found a connection with the older friend you described. Age really is just a number and meaningful friendships can come from unlikely places. So, embrace these interactions, regardless of how infrequent they may be. They're genuine moments of happiness that everyone deserves.

In terms of your social anxiety, remember it's totally okay to take your time when it comes to making new friends. Friendship will flow naturally when you find people who share your interests and passions. Also consider seeking professional help if you feel like your anxiety is hindering your day-to-day life.

Take care of yourself. The fact that you're reaching out and wanting to improve speaks volumes of your strength. Keep going!"

"Hi there, judging from your post, it seems like you have some unique interests that perhaps not all people share. That doesn't have to be negative though - it might be an opportunity to pursue these passions more, and find people who share them. Regarding your social anxiety, it's not an uncommon issue and there are numerous ways to cope with it - seeking professional support can do wonders. 

Your recent social interaction sounds really promising! Just because this person is significantly older doesn't necessarily make the friendship 'weird'. You obviously connected on a genuine level, and communication seems to be ongoing which is excellent. You can learn a lot from older friends, just as they can from you. 

Engaging in activities you enjoy could also be an avenue to expand your social network. You'd be amazed how many other people could share your interests. You could also try joining online communities relevant to your interests - a lot of friendships these days start online! As for feeling lonely seeing other people enjoying, remember that people naturally tend to share their most vibrant moments, and everyone has their own struggles. 

Lastly, it's incredibly uplifting to hear about the joy that your relationship brings you. It shows that you're surely a great companion to this person, just how you can be to others, given the chance. Continue to explore those sparks of connection - those ""few and far between"" moments - and they can open up new journeys and friendships. Keep going, it sounds like you're on a good path!"

"Hey there,

There's absolutely nothing wrong with having a smaller social circle as long as you're content. Remember, quality over quantity. Everyone's social preferences differ, and there's nothing wrong with that. In any case, it's wonderful to hear that you had a good experience making a friend recently. Sometimes, it's these unexpected connections that can really make a difference.

Also, keep in mind that making friends isn't confined to any age bracket or interest group. It can be a shared hobby or even just a mutual understanding that brings two people together. Just make sure you're comfortable and that the relationship is beneficial to both parties.

Lastly, it's absolutely okay to invest time in yourself. Explore your interests, work on your hobbies and you would be surprised at the number of like-minded individuals you attract. Reach out for professional help to cope with your social anxiety. Surround yourself with positivity, and take baby steps towards meeting new people.

Remember, it's completely okay to feel lonely sometimes. Open up to someone about your feelings - you'd be surprised how many can relate and want to help. Don't be too hard on yourself. Take care!"

I did actually have a weird experience making a friend just recently, though, but he's way older than me, so it's a bit weird to hang out in person. I noticed he had an interest in something I really liked, and we had this great chat for about 10 minutes. It flowed so smoothly, and it was super passionate. We still message each other every couple of days. Can anyone else relate to this? Imma say as a 32yo, these moments of connection, even if they're few and far between, are valuable, and finding joy in my relationship with my girl helps fill the void left by these fleeting friendships.	"I can definitely relate to your experience. You see, having fewer friends doesn't make you any less valuable as a person. It's always about the quality of friendships rather than the quantity. The fact that you were able to connect with someone older shows that you're capable of establishing shared interests and meaningful connections, which is amazing! It might feel strange due to the age difference, but having friends across different age groups can actually provide you with diverse perspectives. 

As for your social anxiety, it's okay to take things at your own pace. There are many like-minded individuals out there who also struggle with connecting to others. You're certainly not alone in this and it's okay to take your time to navigate these feelings.

At the end of the day, appreciate the moments of joy in your relationship, cherish those few relationships you have, and allow yourself to grow at your own pace. Stay strong and remember, it's always the depth of friendships that matter the most."

"Hey, I completely understand where you're coming from. You're not alone - a lot of people find it difficult to connect with others because of different interests or difficulty in social situations. First, let's celebrate the positive: you had a great connection with someone because of a common interest! The difference in age is but an arbitrary number if a genuine bond exists. Remember, quality matters over quantity.

One suggestion could be to explore more opportunities where people share your interests. For example, online groups, classes or forums related to the things you love. Also, try to work on managing your social anxiety. If it becomes overwhelming, seeking guidance of a professional should be considered. 

Lastly, it's perfectly okay to enjoy solitude and to be selective about your company. What matters the most is you being comfortable in your own skin."

"I can definitely relate to your feelings of loneliness and difficulty connecting with others. Much of these challenges can be attributed to our unique interests and personalities that don't always align with the majority. It can feel isolating. It's great that you've encountered someone with a shared interest, even if he is older than you, it just goes to show age doesn't have to dictate friendship. 

As you've experienced, it's the quality of conversation and connection that truly matters. Keep nurturing that newly found friendship. It is completely normal to connect more easily with some people due to a shared passion even something as simple as enjoying the same type of music or hobbies. Also, don't undermine the value of your connection with your friend from primary. 

Don't rush, take your time in finding people you resonate with. Building social relationships is an ongoing process, there's no expiry date for making friends. 

I also want to congratulate you for reaching out. Wanting to connect is the first step. Just remember that it's okay to take your time in fostering new connections, there's no rush - connect at your own pace.

"Hey there, thank you for sharing your experience. It's completely okay to have few friends; what truly counts is the quality of the friendship. Sometimes, it can feel a bit intimidating or unusual to have a friend who is significantly older than you are, but age doesn't define friendship - shared interests, mutual respect, and care do.  

Like you pointed out, the interaction you had was smooth, passionate and continues still; that's such a great start! Yes, it's not mainstream, but who says we need to stick to the norm when it comes to relationships? If you're comfortable with how things are and enjoy your conversations, then that's all that matters. 

One advice I can give you, try not to see 'most people not worth talking to'. Everyone has a story, an experience, a perspective that's unique; perhaps giving more people a chance could prove beneficial. You might not connect on all levels or share all interests, but little common grounds can spark meaningful conversations too. 

Finally, while personal connections are important, it's also instrumental to find happiness within yourself, pursuing hobbies, exploring interests, and enjoying your own company. Don't let loneliness eat you up, embrace solitude, and convert it into self-love.

Look out for other connections, continue building this one, and most importantly, stay true to you. You'll find your tribe, however big or small that may be. So, chin up; you're not alone in this journey!"
