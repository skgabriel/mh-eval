Firstly, I just want to say how brave you are for reaching out about this situation. It takes a lot of courage to admit when we're struggling, so well done.

You're facing some tough challenges with your mental health and living situation, and I can see how daunting it must feel. But remember, you don't have to face them alone. It's important to involve your parents in this, they might be more understanding than you think. Depression is often misunderstood and it's not just about feeling sad, but also affects energy levels, motivation and can make simple tasks seem insurmountable. Sharing your feelings with them honestly might help them comprehend your situation better and provide you the support you need.

Before tackling your room, I suggest seeking immediate professional pest control to handle the rat issue. This problem may worsen if not tackled promptly. Afterwards, you can break down the process of cleaning into smaller steps. You might start by bagging up all the trash, then moving on to organizing different areas in your room on different days. It may also help to set specific time periods for cleaning, so it doesn’t feel overwhelming.

Also, considering your mental state, I highly recommend you to seek professional help from a psychologist or psychiatrist. Counseling and therapy can be really beneficial in overcoming depression. You might find a reliable and trustful person to confide in, be it a best friend or a counselor in school, who can be around physically, or emotionally as needed.

Remember, it's okay to lean on others when you're feeling like this. We're all human and sometimes we need a little help from those around us. Don't be afraid to speak up and reach out.

I'm so proud of the progress you've made – you're stronger than you know!

Take care of yourself. Lot's of love."

I'm really sorry to hear that you're feeling this way, but I'm unable to provide the help that you need. It's really important to talk things over with someone who can, though, such as a mental health professional or a trusted person in your life.

In the meantime, know that it's okay to ask for help and there's no need to face this alone. Not being able to keep up with household tasks like cleaning is a common symptom of depression. A professional can give you support tools and techniques to help you manage this.

When it comes to cleaning, one tip is to break things down into smaller tasks. Instead of trying to clean your whole room at once, start with just one thing - like your bin. Once that's done, you can move on to another area.

In terms of the rat infestation, that's a bit more serious and you might need professional help to deal with it. It might be difficult, but try to communicate this with your parents, they might be more understanding than you think.

Lastly, remember: Your worth is not defined by the state of your bedroom. You're going through a tough time and it's okay to not be okay. Be kind to yourself. 

Take care of yourself, and stay safe.

I'm really sorry to hear you're going through such a tough time right now. Firstly, take a deep breath and know that you're not alone, many of us have been there. 

It seems you've acknowledged the issue, which is the first step towards a solution - so well done! Given the overwhelmed state you're feeling, here's what you might consider.

Break down the task into manageable chunks. Instead of thinking you need to clean the entire room at once, try focusing on one small corner or one surface. Begin with clearing out the bin. You might want to consider wearing gloves and a facemask for hygiene, but also to aid sensory issues.

Also, consider seeking some professional help regarding the rat infestation, this is not something you should handle by yourself. There are plenty of efficient and discreet professionals who can help with this.

If it’s possible and you feel comfortable, it would be beneficial to confide in your parents or a trusted friend about your situation. They may not understand without knowing your side. Plus, they could provide support, not only emotionally but also tackling the cleaning together. 

Try to be patient with yourself and remember that it doesn't have to be perfect. Getting it done bit by bit is already a big accomplishment in itself. Try to think of the clean room as a self-care goal, one that will help you feel better mentally and physically.

Lastly, consider reaching out to a mental health professional. It is noble to handle things on your own but reaching out for help is sometimes needed. It might really help you manage your depression and sensory issues.

I'm very proud of you for taking this step. Remember, you've got this; we are here to support you. Stay hopeful and keep going.

I am so proud to hear of your progress! Not every day will be perfect and that's okay. Just remember to celebrate these small wins. Happy to have been able to provide some help. Keep pushing forward, we're here with you."

Your words really hit home - it's clear that you're going through a tough time. Dealing with depression is difficult and cleaning up can be a massive hurdle when you're feeling drained mentally and physically. Sensory issues adding to it must make it even more challenging. You are not alone, and it takes a great deal of courage to reach out to the way you have done here.

Regarding the cleaning up aspect, my first suggestion would be, break the task into manageable chunks. Don't see the room as a whole, but imagine it as different sectors. You can start with one small corner: sort things out, dispose of stuff that's no longer needed, and gradually move on to the next. This way you're not overwhelming yourself by looking at the whole picture, but focusing on tiny bits that are easier to handle.

Dealing with the rat infestation, on the other hand, is something you might find too tough to manage alone, considering your sensory issues. This is where you might need to rope your parents in. It's difficult, I know, but remember that they are your family and they care about you. You could find a quiet moment, sit them down, and explain the situation. It's important they know what depression is doing to you, and how it's not just laziness or procrastination.

Also, please remember to seek professional help if you haven't already. Therapy, counseling, or even a session with a psychiatrist could make things a lot more manageable. You've already taken the first step by asking for help here. Keep moving forward, one small step at a time. We're all rooting for you!

Update: It's absolutely wonderful to hear that you’ve made significant progress in cleaning and organising your room. Remember, perfection isn't the destination, it's the journey. Knowing that you’ve been able to make it clean and livable is a huge stride, and we're all so proud of you. And always remember this; you're stronger than you think you are. Keep going!

First off, I'm really sorry you're going through this. I understand that depression can make daily tasks a Herculean effort. It's really important that you're realizing this isn't just normal 'laziness', but an effect of your battle with depression and potentially other mental health conditions. 

Next, consider reaching out to your parents – I understand your fear, and it's perfectly natural. But they could be a huge help and support system for you right now, even if they might initially react poorly. 

Also, if possible, arrange professional pest control to deal with the rats. For sensory issues, consider acquiring PPE like gloves, masks, earplugs, etc. to reduce the discomfort as much as possible. 

Try breaking the cleaning tasks into small, manageable chunks. Rather than thinking you have to clean the entire room at once, try setting small goals like picking up five items a day. 

Finally, reach out to professional help if you can - like a mental health hotline or psychiatrist. They can't intervene in your household, but they can potentially provide you with tools to manage depression symptoms, potential medication, and maybe even resources to help clean your room (like home organization professionals). 

Remember, you're not alone in your struggle and there are always people out there willing to help. Just take it one step at a time! 

Glad to hear about your progress, keep it up!"

I'm sorry to hear you're going through such a tough time. It must be incredibly difficult and stressful for you but remember, it's okay to ask for help. Sometimes when we're dealing with mental health issues like depression, it can affect our ability to do even simple tasks. It's important to remember that this doesn't make you lazy, rather it signals that you need some external support.

Seeking professional help like a therapist or counselor who specializes in depression could be hugely beneficial, they could offer techniques and tactics to help manage your situation.

In the meantime, as for your room, consider breaking the cleaning task into manageable chunks. For instance, day 1 you could tackle the bin and pest issue. Perhaps you could reach out to a local pest control agency that may assist in handling the rat situation. Let them know about your sensory issues so they can come prepared.

Additionally, Inspired by studies on depression and tasks, a ""15-Minute Rule"" could be followed to address tasks in smaller segments. Set a timer for 15 minutes and only focus on cleaning during this time. This can make a huge task feel more manageable and reduce feelings of being overwhelmed.

Also, open communication with your parents may help. They may not completely understand what you are going through, but they might be more supportive than you anticipate.

Remember, it's okay to seek help not only for your room but also for your mental health. Dealing with mental health conditions can be challenging but remember you aren't alone in this journey. We're here for you, and there is a lot of professional help out there that can be an absolute game changer. 

It's so wonderful to hear that you improved your surroundings! Although it's not perfect, improvement is always a great step forward. You're doing amazing. Keep going, and remember, be gentle with yourself. 

Take care."

Hey there,

First, kudos to you for reaching out. That's a strong first step to seeking change. Living with depression and sensory issues can be incredibly challenging, and it's crucial to remember that whatever you're going through, you're not alone and there are resources available to help you.

With regards to your room, I suggest taking the task of cleaning up one small step at a time. Perhaps you could start by just clearing a portion of a desk or just removing the garbage in one corner. Breaking it down into manageable parts can make it feel less overwhelming. 

As the issue also involves a rat infestation, it would be advisable to seek professional help. There are pest control services that can handle the situation discreetly. 

Most importantly, if you feel up to it, your parents could be a real source of support. It might be difficult, but giving them a sense of what you're going through can possibly get you the help needed. 

You might also find it helpful to seek therapeutic support. Mental Health professionals can provide tools and techniques to manage these situations more effectively, providing longer term solutions.

First off, I want to applaud you for opening up and sharing about your situation — that in itself is a big step. You're not alone, and there are strategies that might help make your task more manageable. Break it down into smaller tasks rather than looking at it as one huge, overwhelming project. Write down a list to keep track if that helps. 

For your sensory issues and discomfort with cleaning, using gloves or putting on some comforting but energizing background music may make it easier. In terms of your rat infestation, it definitely sounds like it's time to bring in professionals— you've got way too much on your plate to deal with it yourself.

If you're still finding things difficult, there's absolutely no shame in asking for help. You could try explaining to your parents that it's not laziness that's causing your situation, but your mental health, and you really need their support right now.

Remember, cleaning your room doesn't have to mean tackling your mental health all at once. You're doing your best, and that's all anyone can ask for. Be patient with yourself and remember to take breaks. Things will get better!

Update: 

I'm so glad to hear that your room is in a better state. Clean and liveable is a fantastic start — you've achieved something big here.

"I'm really sorry to hear about your situation. Grief can be complicated and can put a strain on relationships. However, it’s important to remember that it's okay to set boundaries and prioritize your own mental health.

It might be useful to start with having an open and honest conversation with your mother. Try conveying your feelings to her in a gentle manner. Perhaps say something like, ""Mom, I recognize that we're both going through a tough time right now. We're grieving in different ways, and that’s completely okay. But I'm struggling with not having enough space. I would like for us to find a balance where we can support each other, but also respect our needs for independence.""

If she continues to ignore your space, you might want to consider seeking professional help. Counseling or therapy can provide tools and strategies to communicate effectively and build healthy boundaries.

Support groups for grief or coping with loss might also be beneficial for both of you. They're a great platform to express feelings without judgment and gain insight from people navigating similar situations.

Remember, it's important to take care of your own mental health first before you can help others. You're not alone in this, and it's okay to ask for help."

You could also suggest that she expands her social circle, by reaching out to close friends or joining a local group or club to keep busy.

Remember that this is not about hurting her, but about caring for yourself. It's important to set aside time for your own needs and mental wellbeing. You are not responsible for taking on your mother's grief as well as your own.

"I'm so sorry that you're walking through such a challenging and emotional situation right now. Losing a parent is hard enough without the added strain of establishing boundaries. It's normal to seek solitude and independence, especially during times of grief and mourning. 

It seems that your mom's actions are driven by her own grief and loneliness, not realizing that it's encroaching upon your personal space. Even though her actions may feel smothering, they might be her way of trying to connect and find solace.

What seems necessary at this point is having a clear conversation with her about your feelings. It's important to approach it from a place of love, letting her know you're also dealing with your dad's loss in your own way. It may seem difficult, and she may initially react poorly, but expressing your feelings honestly might bring about a needed shift. 

You could perhaps suggest alternative outlets to deal with her grief like group therapy, counselling, or visiting a grief support group. They might help her connect with others going through a similar experience and reduce her dependency on you.

Lastly, consider seeking therapy or counselling for yourself, even if you have to do some extra searching. It can help you navigate through your feelings, and find ways to communicate effectively with your mom.

Remember, it's not selfish to prioritize your mental health and well-being. It's crucial, especially in such difficult times. Best of luck, and take care."

Since it's difficult finding a therapist, I suggest working on a plan and strategy to communicate your feelings to your mom. It may be helpful to write down what you want to say to her in advance, focusing on your need to grieve and heal in your own way. This can provide you with a clear script to follow, which can be helpful if emotions run high during the conversation.

Acknowledge her need for company and support but also make sure she understands you need time and space as well. Offering solutions like scheduled phone calls or coffee dates might help her feel less shut out and provide structure to your interactions. 

You might also want to suggest that she finds her own support systems. Perhaps recommend local bereavement groups or online forums. These could be instrumental in helping her cope with her loss as well, and meet people who are also in the same situation.

Remember, setting boundaries and needing space doesn't make you a bad person. These are tough times, and it's important to take care of yourselves the way you see fit. Be clear, but kind. It might be a difficult conversation to have, but it's a necessary step for you both to heal. Wishing you the best."
"""My dad just died and my mom wants me to hang out with her all the time. I''ve never liked doing casual things with her, and I'm very independent.

I don't know how to tell her to leave me alone. The best relationship we ever had was when I lived in another state. I moved back because of my dad, but now he's gone. 

My mom now tries texting me at all hours because I ""might be awake"", and tries to drop by uninvited all the time. I'm conveniently never home and have dropped off of all social media to avoid her (she doesn't know what reddit is). 

Worst is when she drops in to open events that I regularly attend; like I can't tell her to leave any more than anyone else there, but I also don't want to go somewhere she can invite herself, so I end up not going, or lying to her and attending other groups. 

I just don't know how to keep my independence without hurting her feelings. I get that she's lonely, but I don't want to be her go-to person.

I'm really sorry to hear about your dad. It's absolutely fine to take time out for yourself to grieve. Your feelings and your space are important, especially right now.

You're in a tricky situation with your mom, and I understand how tough it can be. She's grieving too and is perhaps reaching out to you because she's lonely and doesn't know how to cope with the loss. It could be helpful to find gentle ways to establish boundaries with her. 

Maybe instead of avoiding her completely, you could try setting specific, scheduled times when you are available to talk or visit with her. This could help her feel less isolated, while also not invading your privacy.

Support groups or grief counselor could be beneficial for your mother, and could also provide an outlet for you. You may want to look into those in your local area, or online if she's comfortable with that.

Please remember, you're not obligated to carry this burden alone, and it's okay to seek professional help for yourself. It's a tough situation for everyone involved, but going about it in a kind and caring way will help in the long run.

Stay strong! We are here for you as well."

"I'm sorry to hear about your situation. This is a tough spot to be in, especially when you're grieving too. The first thing I want to say is that it's not selfish to want space and independence. Everyone needs that. It sounds like your mom is using you as her primary source of emotional support, and that's not fair. It's not your responsibility to be there for her all the time, and it's OK to establish boundaries.

If you can, have a candid talk with her and explain how you're feeling. Let her know you understand her need to lean on you, but stress that you also need time alone and space to process things. Suggestion: ""Mom, I know that you're grieving just as I am, and it's natural that you want to lean on me. However, I also need time alone to deal with my own grief. Let's establish some boundaries like setting specific times for calls or meetings and respect each other's space.""

If you feel like you can't have this conversation face to face, you might consider writing her a letter. Writing can help clarify your thoughts and feelings and give you a chance to say everything you need to without being interrupted.

Lastly, keep pursuing a therapist even if it's not working out yet. Professional support is crucial during such times. If you're in the US, consider using Psychology Today's Find a Therapist tool. It's a good resource. You're also entitled to feeling comfortable and having your boundaries respected. 

Remember, self-care isn't selfish. It's vital. Stay strong and best of luck."

I'm so sorry to hear about your situation. Losing a father is a significant loss and I can see that you're dealing with a lot right now. 

It sounds like you're feeling smothered and frustrated because your mom is leaning on you more heavily than you're comfortable with. It's completely normal and okay to want your own space and independency. However, communicating these feelings can be challenging, especially when you're trying not to hurt someone else's feelings. 

One approach could be to have a truly open conversation with her about how you're feeling. Choose a calm moment and tell her that you understand her grief and loneliness, but you need your space as well. Maybe plan fixed times in a week when you can do stuff together but also emphasize your need for independence and personal space the rest of the time.

As for her dropping by uninvited and coming to your regular events, consider setting boundaries. Say that you cherish the times you set aside for her, but for the rest of the time, you need space.

It might also be helpful if she found additional support networks, such as joining a grief support group, pursuing a hobby, or spending more time with friends. This could potentially take some pressure off your relationship while still ensuring she has the support she needs. 

Remember, therapy can be a huge help in scenarios like these not just for you to better deal with the situation, but she might also benefit from it. 

Please take care of yourself and wish you the best in navigating this tough situation."

"Hey there, I'm really sorry to hear about what you're going through right now. This sounds like an incredibly tough time for you, and it's completely understandable that you'd feel overwhelmed.

The first thing to remember is that it's okay to look after your needs and set boundaries - even with family. It's difficult, especially when you worry about hurting those you care about, but it's important for your mental well-being, too.

If you are struggling to communicate this to your mom, maybe you can write a letter to her. Start by expressing your concern for her and acknowledge her process of grieving. Then, gently express your feelings about needing space and independence. Try to help her understand that, a relationship from a distance, like the one you had when you lived in another state, works better for you.

You've mentioned about looking for a therapist. You might want to look into online therapy too. It's pretty flexible and might be a suitable option for you to explore. And in the meantime, do you have other sources of support you can lean on? Close friends, or other family members?

Lastly, remember that it's okay to take time out for yourself during a difficult time like this. Grieving and navigating familial relationships can be very emotionally tiring. Take care of yourself, and ensure you're maintaining a balance in life."

"Hey, I'm really sorry you're going through this right now. Losing a parent is difficult all on its own, and the pressure from your mom must be adding onto that. It's understandable that you are prioritizing self-care and striving for independence even during these challenging times.

Firstly, I would recommend seeking a licensed counselor or therapist as soon as you can. This would provide you with a safe environment to express your feelings and gain professional advice and insight. Trained professionals often have suggestions for strategies and coping mechanisms that we might not realize on our own. 

Also, remember that setting boundaries isn't selfish or mean. We all have our limits, and we all have our ways of handling grief. Maybe you could communicate to your mom that you need some solitude for a while to process things, or suggest she seek out additional support from other family members, friends, or even support groups.

Perhaps you can arrange a specific time in the week when you both can spend time together, this way, you can maintain your independence while also supporting her. 

Lastly, don't forget the importance of your mental health. Whether it's through exercise, meditation, or just spending time with friends, map out some time scheduled specifically for you, every week.

Wishing you strength and resilience in these tough times!"

"I'm really sorry to hear about what you're going through. Losing a loved one is always difficult and coping with it can be even harder when you have to deal with a family member who isn't respecting your boundaries. 

It sounds like your mom could be grieving and using her connection with you as a coping mechanism. She might see her relationship with you as a link to your father, especially if it's difficult for her to cope with her loss on her own. However, your boundaries should still be respected. 

It might be a good idea to sit down with your mom and talk about your feelings. Clear communication is key. You could explain to her that while you're there for her, it's important for you to have your own space too. 

As for seeking therapy, it's understandable how challenging it can be to find the right therapist. But, please don't give up. Perhaps online therapy could be an alternative? There are many resources available online that can offer grief counseling and therapy from the comfort of your own home.

Does any one have any tips?"	"Hi there,

I'm really sorry to hear that you're going through this. Know you're not alone, separation anxiety can be incredibly tough but there are strategies that can help. 

Firstly, in terms of dealing with your emotions, consider having a daily routine where you take time to sit quietly and observe what you're feeling. This could be meditation, mindfulness, or simply quiet time. You're not trying to change anything during these times, but simply notice and validate your feelings.

When the anxiety starts to build, focus on your breathing. It can be a useful tool for calming your body. Try to breathe in for a count of four, hold for four, exhale for four. Do this four times and try to focus on the feeling of your breath.

Distractions can be beneficial in managing anxiety. Engage in activities that you enjoy and which keep your mind busy. This can help to take your mind off the feeling of missing your partner. 

Try to maintain regular communication with your partner. This might help alleviate some of the anxiety you're feeling. Make sure to communicate with each other about your schedules and plan regular calls or text conversations.

Last, but not least, consider reaching out to a professional therapist who would be able to guide and support you through this experience. They could provide useful strategies catered specifically to you and your needs. 

Remember, it's okay to not feel okay sometimes and it's okay to ask for help. Sending you kindness and strength."

It's completely valid to have such intense feelings, and separation can sometimes lead to that kind of anxious response. Have you considered talking to a professional, such as a therapist, about this? They could provide you with coping mechanisms catered to your situation.

In the meantime, try to find activities you enjoy doing and hobbies to keep your mind occupied while you're apart from your partner. Also, you might want to try mindfulness meditation, it can help you stay in the present moment and alleviate some of your anxiety by keeping your thoughts from spiraling.

Remember, it's okay to have strong emotions and it's okay to ask for help. Be kind to yourself during this trying time. You are not alone, and there are many avenues of help available for you. Don't hesitate to reach out to those around you, too!"

However, your feelings seem to be a bit more intense. Have you considered speaking to a mental health professional about this? They can provide you with strategies and coping mechanisms based on your specific experiences. 

In the meantime, try keeping a journal about your feelings. Try to identify the thoughts that come to your mind when you start feeling anxious due to the separation. This could give you a better insight into what kind of situations trigger these feelings, and you could gradually work on addressing them. 

Engaging in activities that you love can also distract your mind. Keeping yourself busy helps a lot. Try to maintain your own hobbies and spend time with friends and family without your partner around. 

Remember, it's important to have a sense of individuality even in a relationship. It takes time and effort, but it's totally achievable.

I'm really sorry to hear that you're struggling with separation anxiety. It sounds like it is quite intense for you, and I can only imagine how tough it must be.

First of all, remember that it is normal to miss someone when they're not around. That said, the intensity of your anxiety seems to be causing undue distress, which means it might be a good idea to seek professional help. Therapists who specialize in anxiety can offer various types of treatments like cognitive-behavioral therapy, exposure therapy or medication if deemed necessary.

In the meantime, try to focus on self-care techniques. Deep breathing, yoga, or meditation can be beneficial. Engaging in activities that you enjoy and that help to distract your mind can also be helpful. Writing down your feelings can aid in processing them, too - you might gain new insights or find patterns that could be helpful to discuss with a therapist.

Most importantly, remember that it's okay to ask for help. Everyone needs a bit of assistance sometimes, and it's a sign of strength to acknowledge when you're feeling overwhelmed.

I hope you find these suggestions helpful and things improve for you soon. Reach out when needed, you are not alone in this."

This could be anything from reading, drawing, watching your favorite shows, or even joining clubs or groups that interest you.

A mindfulness technique, like meditation or yoga could also help alleviate anxiety. Regularly practicing these can help bring your focus back to the present, helping you cultivate a sense of calm and lessen the impact of anxiety.

Developing your own routine or hobby can also create a sense of safety and independence.

It sounds like you're going through a tough time, but it's courageous and important that you're sharing this and seeking help. Separation anxiety can be challenging to navigate. 

First, it can be helpful to develop some self-soothing techniques during those times when you're apart from your partner. Breathing exercises, meditation, or engaging in a hobby can all help redirect your attention and lessen the intensity of your feelings.

Second, possibly try to gradually increase the time you're apart so you can slowly become more comfortable with the separation. Spend an hour apart, then two, then maybe an afternoon, and so on.

Communication is key as well. Express your feelings to your partner so they can provide reassurance as needed.

Lastly, consider seeking professional help. Therapists or counselors can provide tools and methods to better process and handle these strong emotions - there's no need to do this on your own.

i’ve been struggling with replying to people on social media, especially people i don’t usually talk to. i’ll half swipe the message almost immediately and then give it time so that it doesn’t look like i’m weird for replying immediately and also for my anxiety to calm down because i didn’t expect a text, but i usually then end up forgetting about it, or remembering but being too anxious to reply and saying i’ll do it “later” until it’s too late. i don’t have this problem when i’m texting people who i talk to daily or i’m close with, just like acquaintances and stuff. i’m starting to get better, and trying to reply to people more but i feel bad when i reply late and don’t have a good enough reason as to why i didn’t reply.	"Hey there, first of all, thank you for opening up about your struggles. Social anxiety is a common hurdle and you're not alone in feeling this way. Replying to social media messages can indeed be stressful, especially when it's from people we're not close to. It's completely okay to take your time in responding; remember, communication shouldn't be rushed and you don't owe anyone an immediate response. It's your prerogative who you want to interact with and when. You deserve to prioritize your mental health and it's perfectly fine to take a break from your screen whenever you feel overwhelmed.

Practicing mindfulness might be helpful, as it allows you to inhabit the present moment and might ease the feeling of pressure. Also, self-compassion is vital. Instead of feeling bad about responding late, remember that everyone is human and is dealing with their own struggles. 

Lastly, it's wonderful that you're acknowledging this and are willing to work on it. Don't forget that the road to improvement is often filled with small steps, patience, and self-love. Don't hesitate to reach out to a mental health professional who can help with strategies to manage your social anxiety better."

Consider setting specific time blocks during the day when you feel most comfortable to engage in social responses. This way, it becomes more of a routine and less of a surprise.

Feelings and emotions are a part of us, and recognizing them is the first step towards healing. One thing that can maybe help is setting specific times during the day to respond to messages. This can help in two ways - It helps manage your expectation of a sudden text, since you know exactly when you're going to check, and it provides you with the opportunity to prepare yourself to respond.

Start slow. Commit to replying one acquaintance a day, it doesn't have to be immediate, but make sure it's within that day. Don't get overwhelmed if some days you forget or can't bring yourself to even do that. Every step counts, and it's completely okay to have off days. 

Remember that everyone operates on their own timetable. Don't stress about having to provide a reason for responding late, a simple ""Hey, sorry for the late reply"" is completely fine too. Know that it's okay if you can't help everyone or reply to everyone. Setting boundaries for yourself is essential for your mental health. 

It might also be helpful to share this struggle with your friends and acquaintances. People are often more understanding than we give them credit for."

"Hey there, it's totally normal to feel anxious about replying to acquaintances. Social media often puts us in circumstances where we're having to socially interact more often, and with greater immediacy than we might feel comfortable with.  Here are some tips that might help:

- Remind yourself it's okay not to respond immediately. There's a 'seen' button for a reason. Use it to your advantage and give you time to collect your thoughts.
- Understand it's okay to make errors. We all make social faux pas, even online, and it's just a part of learning. People are generally understanding. 
- Build confidence. Each reply made is a chance to build confidence in yourself and your communication style. 

Remember everyone has their own approach towards social media usage. What counts is you trying your best to work through your anxious feelings. Pat yourself on the back for the progress you've made so far. Keep practicing, and with time, responding to messages will become easier. Stay strong!"

"It sounds like you're experiencing social anxiety, which isn't unusual. Many people feel anxious when interacting with others, particularly those they aren't close to. The first thing you need to remember is that it's okay to reply when you're ready. There's no rule stating you must respond immediately. It's essential to move at your own pace and make sure you're comfortable. 

Sometimes, setting a certain time to reply to these non-urgent messages can work as a solution. For example, you might set aside time each evening to respond to the messages you've received throughout the day. This could help you manage your anxiety and also ensure you do not forget about these messages.

Remember to breathe, be kind to yourself and practice self-care. It's alright to feel anxious and take time to reply. You're doing great by acknowledging your feelings and looking for ways to manage them. You're on the journey to overcoming this anxiety. Be patient with yourself. You've got this."

"Hi there,

Just want to remind you that your feelings are valid and common. Don't be too hard on yourself, we all have areas where we may find difficulty and struggle with anxiety. In terms of dealing with social media, remember that there's no perfect way or time to respond. We're all human and we naturally can't be 'on' all the time. 

Some suggestions: Maybe attempt setting up specific timeframes to respond to these messages (e.g., evening time, before or after lunch)? This may reduce the pressure and anxiety you feel. Also, it helps to remember that while it's polite to respond in a timely manner, it's also okay to take time for yourself. It doesn't make you a bad person. You don't owe anyone an immediate response, your mental health and well-being come first.

As you mentioned, you are making progress and that's fantastic, keep it up! Becoming aware and acknowledging your struggle is an important step, so kudos to you. Take it a day at a time, it does get easier with practice. You've got this!"

"Hey there! It seems like you've been dealing with a fair bit of social media anxiety. That's completely normal and many of us experience similar struggles. This usually happens when we overthink something that in reality is very simple. Taking too long or too short a time to reply doesn't define you as a person, and remember that people message you because they want to engage with you, not analyse your response time. 

Try setting aside certain times to check and reply to messages from acquaintances, almost like a scheduled activity. When you make it part of your routine, it may feel less surprising and anxiety-inducing. Also, remember that it's okay to reply late. Life gets in the way and people understand that. You don't owe anyone an explanation as to why you didn't answer immediately, it's not a race or a test. 

Most importantly, stop being so hard on yourself. Each of us has unique responses to social situations, including online interactions. You're already making progress and that's great! Remember, move at a pace that feels comfortable to you. You got this!"

"Hey friend, thank you for sharing your struggles here, it's really brave. I just want to say that it's okay to respond when you're ready and comfortable. Anxiety can make social interactions a bit tough, especially digital ones where there's no immediate pressure to respond. It's okay if you sometimes forget or get too anxious to reply and remember it later. We all go through that, trust me.

Try prioritizing your own comfort and anxiety levels over what may be perceived as 'expected reply times.' Your well-being is more important. It's really great to see that you're taking steps towards improvement. 

As for feeling bad when you reply late, consider being honest about it. It's perfectly okay to tell someone that you saw their message when you were preoccupied and wanted to give their message the time and attention it deserved later. Remember, it's also okay to let go of the need to provide a reason for everything. Just try to do what feels right for you.

Keep reaching out, keep trying, and be gentle with yourself. You're doing great. One step at a time."

"Hi there! It sounds like you're dealing with social anxiety, especially when it comes to unexpected or infrequent interactions on social media. This is more common than you might think! One possible solution might be setting aside specific ""social media reply"" periods throughout your day. During these times, you could focus on responding to the messages you've received, one by one, and consider it a task to be completed rather than a condition of your social life. Also, try to be gentle and forgiving to yourself. It's okay to reply late, and it's even okay to simply say ""Sorry for the delay, I got caught up with stuff!"". Social media adds a new layer of complexity to our interactions, so it's perfectly normal that you're navigating this at your own pace. As time goes on, it should get easier.

"Hey there! It sounds like social media anxiety is what you're experiencing and believe me, you're not alone. Measures to tackle this succesfully require small steps. 

Perhaps you could start by setting aside a specific time each day for replying to these messages - routine can help us deal with anxiety. Meanwhile, it's totally okay to explain to your acquaintances that you sometimes take a while to reply because of anxiety. Most people will understand as it's something a lot of people experience. 

When you start feeling anxious about replying, take a few deep breaths, remind yourself it's okay to take your time, and try to shift your thoughts to something positive or calming. Gradually, replying to people might seem less of a big deal. Pat yourself on the back for every little achievement, like replying a bit quicker than last time. It's a process, and progress may be slow, but that's okay.

Just remember, you are in control of your social media habits, not the other way around. Take it easy on yourself and keep making those small steps. You can do this!"
I don't know when exactly it started. Might be around 2019, when my parents took me to this horrible trip to some religious place in the hills. Before this we used to do great trips, London, USA etc which I enjoyed. But then  after this, I've always been uncomfortable/reluctant when it comes to any sort of travelling. Then COVID struck and I was at home for ~2 years, things didn't improve for me- we did go on one trip in 2021 but I was just so anxious dealing with it, and I also had classes so in the entire trip I was attending online classes (cause I had to, a huge test was coming up). My problem is that I'm anxious before the trip happens and during it I'm completely fine. It's gotten better now tho, but not completely cured. Going alone or with friends seems like a mammoth task. Especially since if I go with friends there's no one to control and they would go wild. I know I need to get over this for the future. Any tips?	"Hi there, it seems like you're having a tough time with travel anxiety. I can imagine how hard this may be on you. Just know that it's quite common, and you're perfectly normal to feel this way. It seems like that 2019 trip might have hit a nerve, and now, your mind associates travelling with negative experiences. 

Here's something that could work. Start by taking short, local trips which might not feel so daunting. Try going independently to a local shop or park. It's important to gradually expose yourself to travel. This will help your mind adjust slowly. 

Regarding travelling with friends, while it can be chaotic, it also has its own set of fun adventures. Try choosing friends who understand your situation and are supportive – a safe, controlled environment could lessen your anxiety. 

A mindfulness technique, progressive relaxation, could be beneficial. It could help reduce your anxiety by concentrating on relaxing each part of your body, starting from your toes and moving upward to the top of your head. 

And, remember, it's okay to be gentle with yourself. There's no rush. Take steps at your own pace.

Of course, if these feelings persist then it's a good idea to seek out a mental health professional to help navigate these feelings. Keep going, you're doing great already by acknowledging the issue and actively seeking help."

Consider breaking down the travelling process into small, manageable steps - like planning, packing and choosing activities. Accomplishing each step might make the overall task less daunting. 

When travelling with friends, communicate about your worries beforehand. They might be more understanding and considerate than you think. You could also try short, local trips initially and then gradually, move to more distant ones. If you still feel anxiety about this, it may be beneficial to discuss these feelings with a mental health professional for more personalized advice. Be patient with yourself and remember to celebrate small victories along the way! Best of luck."

"Hi there, it seems like you're dealing with some anxiety related to travel. Firstly, let me commend you for recognizing your issues and seeking help. It's a large and brave step in the right direction. 

One suggestion could be to start small. Don't consider a full-fledged vacation just yet. How about planning a short outing to a nearby attraction, a park or a cafe for instance? That way, you can gradually ease yourself back into the process and mindset of travel.

Also, it's important to talk about your concerns. Share with your friends how you feel, they might be more understanding than you expect. If they're true friends, they'll respect your feelings and be there to support you.

Self-care is another significant aspect. Make sure you're taking time to do things you enjoy outside of travel. A balanced state of mind can help significantly in coping with change and stress.

But above all, remember there's no rush. Take your time, do what you're comfortable with. The world isn't going anywhere, there's plenty of time to travel when you're ready. Stay strong!"

"Hey there, it sounds like you're dealing with a lot of anxiety around the prospect of traveling, which I'm sorry to hear as it can be very challenging. It's perfectly okay to feel this way, as everyone has different levels of comfort when going out of their known environment.

Firstly, start by spending more time outside your comfort zone in day-to-day life, like visiting different places within your own city or taking different routes to familiar places. This could help you get used to the feeling of being somewhere unfamiliar.

Secondly, it might prove beneficial to plan everything in advance. Knowing exactly where you're going, what you're doing, and any potential issues you may face can really help lower the level of anxiety you're experiencing.

Finally, consider seeking professional help such as a therapist or counselor. They can provide some good strategies and techniques to help you manage and cope with your anxiety.

Remember, it's okay to seek help and take your time with this. Traveling should be fun and enjoyable, and it shouldn't be something that causes unnecessary stress or anxiety. You're taking a great first step by seeking help and advice. Take care of yourself!"

It sounds like you might be struggling with anticipatory anxiety related to travel, which is not uncommon at all, especially after a traumatic experience or unusual circumstances like those of the pandemic. The fact that you feel fine during the trip itself is a positive sign! It shows that you don't have an inherent fear of the trip itself, but rather the anticipation of it.

Here are a few strategies which you can try:

1. Identifying Your Fears: Write down what exactly it is that makes you anxious about these trips. Is it the change of routine, fear of the unknown, fear of losing control, or something else altogether? 

2. Visualization: Picture yourself going through the process of travelling smoothly, enjoying your time, and handling any issues that arise calmly. This can help you create positive associations with travelling.

3. Mindfulness and Breathing Exercises: Practicing mindfulness can help you stay grounded in the present moment and alleviate your anxiety symptoms. 

4. Discuss Your Feelings: Sharing your anxiety and fears with trusted friends or family members can help them understand your feelings and provide support.

5. Seek Professional Help: You might find it helpful to speak with a mental health professional who can provide you guidance and coping strategies based on your specific situation. 

Remember to take small steps and don't rush yourself. You can start by taking small trips nearby to familiar places, slowly venturing out more and more.

And about travelling with friends who tend to go wild, communication is key. Letting them know about your apprehensions may create a sense of understanding between you all and engage them in creating a more comfortable environment during the trip.

Everyone's journey is unique and it's okay to go at your own pace."

Firstly, let me commend you on taking the big step in reaching out and speaking about your concerns. That in itself is a huge accomplishment. Understand that travel anxiety is more common than you might think, and there's absolutely nothing wrong with feeling a little fear when you're stepping outside your comfort zone, particularly if your past experiences haven't been pleasant.

One strategy is to take a gradual approach. Start with short trips close to home, especially to places that you find comforting or familiar. Gradually increase the time and distance as you grow more comfortable. 

Another helpful step might be to involve yourself more in the planning of the trip. When you have a solid understanding of where you're going, what you'll be doing, and around who you'll be, it takes a lot of the unpredictability (and therefore, the anxiety) out of the situation.

Mindfulness and relaxation techniques like deep-breathing can be used when you feel your anxiety rising. There are plenty of apps and online tutorials to guide you on this. 

You also mentioned your concerns about going on trips with friends and their potential for wild antics. It may be beneficial to have an open and honest conversation with them about your worries. If they care about you, they will understand where you are coming from and might be able to propose solutions that can put you more at ease such as establishing rules or setting boundaries.

Lastly, professional help can be an important part of overcoming any form of anxiety. Don't hesitate to reach out to a counselor or therapist who might be able to provide further guidance tailored specifically to you. 

Remember, everyone has their own pace. Don't rush yourself, and don't compare your progress with others. You're doing great, and each step you take is a victory, no matter how small it might seem."

"Hey there, it really seems like you're going through a tough time, and these feelings of anxiety and discomfort are definitely valid, so please don't beat yourself up about them. Sometimes, we have negative experiences that are so profound they impact our behavior and feelings about certain things, which seems to be what you're experiencing with travel.

One thing you could try is starting small and engaging in micro travels. Go for a day trip somewhere nearby with your friends, or spend an afternoon in a part of the town you don't frequent. The most important thing is for you to take it at your own pace, and to incrementally expose yourself to travel while also making sure that you feel safe and secure.

Regarding trips with your friends, it's important to communicate your anxieties with them. See if you guys can agree on certain ground rules that will make you feel more comfortable. Remember, your comfort and mental health are important, too.

It might be beneficial to seek professional help for your anxiety, too. Speaking to a counselor or a therapist could provide you with coping strategies to help deal with these feelings. Nonetheless, please remember to be gentle with yourself. Everyone moves at their own pace, and it's okay to have anxieties. It's brave of you to acknowledge your feelings and seek help about this. Take care."

"Hello, it's so admirable that you're reaching out and seeking help. In dealing with anxiety related to travel, you could try starting small and gradually exposing yourself to travelling in manageable steps. This might mean starting with small solo trips to your local park, then maybe a day trip on your own somewhere further afield, and eventually to trips with friends. The goal here is to gradually desensitize yourself to the aspect of travelling.

Communication is also key. Have you tried sharing your feelings about travelling with your friends? It might be helpful to let them know how you feel so they can be supportive and maybe even adapt plans to make you more comfortable. 

Another potentially helpful strategy is to plan and visualize the trip beforehand. This could involve researching the route, studying the area you're visiting, and even visualizing yourself there enjoying the trip. This could help reduce the unknown aspects of the trip that might be contributing to your anxiety. 

Remember, it's perfectly okay to feel anxious about this. Engage in some self care, understand your triggers and pacing yourself. Seek professional help if you believe it's interfering with your daily life. 

Take care and don't rush your progress - remember, every trip, big or small, is a step towards overcoming your fear."

It sounds like you're working hard to confront your travel anxiety. This kind of worry can be so draining, but it's awesome that you're willing to seek help and work towards making progress. Just remember, it's okay to feel anxious about these things; you're far from alone in experiencing these feelings.

The root of travel anxiety often lies in the fear of the unknown, i.e., different environments, routines, people and situations. I would suggest trying to familiarize yourself with the place you're planning to visit as much as possible beforehand. Look at pictures, read about local customs or foods, etc. This could help reduce some of the uncertainty that might be contributing to your anxiety.

Also, practicing mindfulness-based techniques could be greatly beneficial to reduce anxiety in general. Prior to travel, it can be useful to indulge in deep breathing exercises and meditation. This will relax your mind and body, making you feel calmer and more at peace.

Taking small steps is key here. Why not start with short day trips to nearby places? Gradually extending the duration of your trips could make the prospect of longer travels more manageable. I also understand the unpredictability of travelling with friends may contribute to your anxiety. It might be helpful to express to them how you're feeling; they may be more considerate than you think.

Remember, it does take time to get over these things and please be patient with yourself. Don't hesitate to seek out help from a mental health professional if you feel your anxiety is severely impacting your life, as they can provide strategies specifically tailored to your situation. Best of luck!"
I don't know when exactly it started. Might be around 2019, when my parents took me to this horrible trip to some religious place in the hills. Before this we used to do great trips, London, USA etc which I enjoyed. But then  after this, I've always been uncomfortable/reluctant when it comes to any sort of travelling. Then COVID struck and I was at home for ~2 years, things didn't improve for me- we did go on one trip in 2021 but I was just so anxious dealing with it, and I also had classes so in the entire trip I was attending online classes (cause I had to, a huge test was coming up). My problem is that I'm anxious before the trip happens and during it I'm completely fine. It's gotten better now tho, but not completely cured. Going alone or with friends seems like a mammoth task. Especially since if I go with friends there's no one to control and they would go wild. I know I need to get over this for the future. Any tips?	"Hey there, I'm sorry to hear you're going through this. Anxiety, especially about unfamiliar situations, can be really tough to deal with, but I'm glad you're taking the first steps to reaching out and seeking advice.

One thing that may be helpful is trying to identify any specific anxieties you have about travelling- is it the new locations, the lack of control, too much open time, or something else? Once you can place a finger on what exactly is causing your discomfort, you can start to address these fears one by one.

A strategy might be to start small, with short, local trips to places you're somewhat familiar with. This might help gradually build your confidence and let you control the pace at which you're tackling this issue. 

Also consider talking to your friends or family about your anxieties. By letting them know what you’re going through makes them more apt to providing support.

Think about learning some basic grounding and calming techniques. They can help when you feel an anxiety attack coming on or when you're feeling particularly stressed. Deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, or grounding techniques all can be very effective.

And remember, dealing with anxiety is a journey, not a destination. There will be good days and bad days, progress and setbacks. That's completely normal. It's great you're committed to working on this and I'm sure with time and patience, you'll see improvements. 

However, it might be that no amount of advice from well-intentioned internet strangers can replace speaking with a mental healthcare professional – consider reaching out to one if you feel comfortable doing so. These are complex issues and they're trained to offer help.

Stay strong, you got this!"
"Im sorry for this little rant here but i dont know what else to do… I have been clinically depressed since i was 14 and although i am sure i have had happy moments or times when everything didnt feel so dark i keep coming back to the same place emotionally. 
I wanted to try journaling or smth like that but i felt so dumb so i came to this community to just type my thoughts. When i was younger no matter how hard things were academically, sociallly or emotionally my mom was there but she has been diagnosed with dementia for 2 years now and i lost the one person that i could talk to freely. 
I have seen been kind of parenting my dad and while im away in uni he is all alone so im scared for him all the time because he doesnt take care of himself and he has a serious heart condition. 
Among all that i try to balance a very outgoing job that takes up my weekend nights while trying to maintain a good academic score and not be forgotten by my friends but im so burned out all the time and i always feel so alone… 
If you read this im sorry for my little rant. I hope it gets better for all of us."	"Hey there, I just want to say thank you for sharing - it's such a brave thing to do. I'm truly sorry to hear you're feeling this way, but I'm unable to provide the help that you need. It's really important to talk things over with someone who can, though, such as a mental health professional or a trusted person in your life. 

Remember, admitting you need help isn't a sign of weakness but rather strength. For the stress you're under with school, your job, and your dad, I suggest reaching out to a counselor at your university - they usually have resources and services for students dealing with stress and anxiety. It's their job to help you navigate these tough times. 

You mentioned writing or journaling your thoughts. It might seem silly at first, but it can be a helpful tool in expressing and understanding your emotions - sometimes even lifting the weight off. 

And lastly, your friends. It's okay to be honest about your limitations, and let them know when you're struggling. True friends will understand, and there might be others who feel the same way. 

Remember, it's okay to not be okay all the time. Please prioritize your wellbeing. You are valued, you matter, and there are people ready to help. All the best to you."

It definitely isn't easy dealing with so much at once, and it sounds like you're carrying a heavy load between your own personal struggles, academic life, job, and caring for your family. Your strength in the face of all of these difficult circumstances is amazing. 

Journaling can definitely feel strange at first, but don't let that put you off! You might find it cathartic over time, or it might help you organize and make sense of your thoughts and feelings. Remember, there's no ""correct"" way to journal, so just jot down anything that comes to mind.

It's really important to remember that it's okay to take time for yourself. You matter and your wellbeing matters. Losing your support system must have been really tough, but please know that you're not alone. There are plenty of online communities and resources available to you.

Hope things start to feel a bit easier for you. It's perfectly okay to reach out and ask for help, and there are people who want to support you. You're not alone in this, and remember that it's okay not to be okay all the time. You're doing an incredible job under the circumstances, and I support you. Sending virtual hugs your way."

"Hey, it's really brave of you to share how you're feeling on here and to continue pushing forward despite the challenges life is throwing at you. I'm sorry to hear that you've been feeling like this. You're not alone, many of us have been there or are going through similar emotions. 

It sounds like the responsibility of taking care of your family, working, and keeping up with academics is overwhelming right now. Remember matter how big or small, every step you are taking in your life is progress. It's okay to not be perfect, okay not to be okay, okay to fail, okay to struggle, it's okay to be human. 

Journaling isn't for everyone, and it isn't dumb by any means, it is simply a tool that some people find beneficial, but there are many other ways you can explore to help cope with your feelings. 

Have you considered seeking help from your university counseling service? It might be worth considering, especially with everything you're juggling right now - most campuses have resources you can turn to for understanding, not judgement.

Lastly, remember, you're never alone. Sure, there may be distance between you and others physically, but emotionally and virtually, someone is always willing to listen and provide help. Even if it is just to vent or rant. It doesn't always get better quickly, but it does get better. Take care of yourself."

It takes a lot of courage to express your feelings like you did, so well done on reaching out. It's obvious that you're under an enormous amount of pressure, and that's tough no matter who you are. It's totally understandable that you're feeling alone and overwhelmed.

I'd like to suggest some resources that may help. Please consider seeking out counseling services in your university. They often have professionals who are well equipped to help manage stress and anxiety, especially those unique to students. Try to speak openly about your feelings, whether journaling or talking to a counselor, a friend, or even this community. It's not dumb, but a very mature step towards self-help.

For your dad's condition, does your university have a social work department or any kind of resources for family members with serious health conditions? They may be able to provide resources or suggestions on how to navigate through these challenges.

Don't forget to take a break for your own wellness, both mentally and physically. Try to ensure you're eating properly and getting enough sleep. Burnout can make everything seem much more insurmountable than they really are. And remember, it's okay if your academic scores slightly dip or if you need to slow down socially - health is the most important thing.

I know everything feels so daunting right now, but remember, challenges do not last forever. Things will eventually get better, even if it's hard to see that right now.

Take care & remember you have this community here for you!"

You've been through so much, and it takes a lot of strength to carry all that burden. It's really admirable that you're stepping up for your dad despite your own struggles and dealing with work, school, and social life on top of it. 

It's definitely okay to feel burned out, especially when you're juggling so much all at once. It's important to remember that it's okay to reach out and ask for help. We're here in this community for you, so don't hesitate to share what you're feeling.

On a practical note, are there any support services at your university which might be useful for helping you manage your mental health? Most universities have counselling services, and speaking to a professional might provide you with some helpful advice. 

Also, it can be a good idea to try and find a local Alzheimer’s or dementia group for your dad. They can provide valuable support for both him and you. They usually run support groups and could give you some advice on care strategies, and you might find it comforting to connect with others who are going through similar experiences.

Just remember - it's okay to put your needs and your health first sometimes. All the best to you. You're not alone in this."

That sounds really rough and I can definitely understand why you'd feel overwhelmed and burned out. It's clear you're under a tremendous amount of stress right now. It's brave of you that you've come here to talk about it and I appreciate you opening up - it shows strength, resilience, and emotional intelligence to reach out when you need support.

Maybe you could try out journaling again - it might feel odd at first, but it can be a really helpful tool for expression and understanding your feelings. It doesn't have to be articulate or perfect; just write whatever comes to your mind, no judgement. That being said, if it doesn't work for you, that's perfectly okay too. Understand that different approaches work for different people, and it's all about finding what works for you.

Supporting loved ones with their health issues is tough, especially when you're feeling down yourself. It's important, though, that you also look after your own wellbeing. Have you considered speaking to your university's counselling services or a mental health professional? They can provide guidance and help you manage your stress and depressive symptoms. Please consider reaching out to them.

Hobbies and interests can be a good way to distract yourself or to provide a sense of relief, so do something you love when you have some free time, it could be anything as simple as reading a book or going for a walk.

Remember, you're not alone in this. There's a whole community here ready to support and listen, and it's okay to ask for help. What you're dealing with is really tough, but hold on. Things may not improve overnight, but with time and the right support, they will get better. Take care of yourself. You matter."

First off, please don't apologize for sharing your feelings, it's courageous to speak out about your struggles and there's always someone willing to listen. It's clear that you carry a lot on your shoulders. It's quintessential though, to remember that it's okay to feel overwhelmed and exhausted amidst all these burdens and it's okay to struggle and ask for help. 

The first point is, lose the dread on writing jouranls if it doesn't work for you. We all have different ways of coping. If typing out your thoughts here is somewhat cathartic, then keep doing so. 

Let's talk about your mum and dad; nurturing a loved one with dementia is no easy task, your feelings of loss are valid and to then step into a parenting role for your dad, you've demonstrated a great deal of resilience. Maybe getting your dad involved in a community center or a support group could help him gain a bit more structure and companionship.

The job and academic pressures sound intense, and it's a lot to carry on your own. Remember it's completely ok to admit when things are too much and seek balance. You may want to consult a counselor at your university - They are typically equipped to offer guidance on these situations. 

Lastly about your friends, real ones will understand you taking some time for yourself without forgetting you, trust in that. 

Remember, this community is here for you. You're never alone in this journey because we're all here going through one struggle or another. You took a great step by reaching out to talk, keep doing that. This too shall pass and things will get better. Be gentle with yourself and remember that the darkness will always give way to light, hang in there."

It sounds like you've had to grow up quickly and have a lot on your plate right now. Balancing school, work, and worrying about your family is a heavy load to carry and you're doing your best. It's completely normal to feel burned out. 

Writing your thoughts can indeed be a powerful tool, so don't think of it as dumb. Pouring your feelings out on paper helps in expressing what you may not be able to verbally. It may also provide a sense of relief. Don't stop. You have this community to connect with. 

As far as your father is concerned, is there a possibility of arranging care for him or having someone check on him when you're unavailable? It could relieve some stress off your shoulders. 

Lastly, I strongly urge you to connect with mental health services offered at your college - they're usually free and confidential. They can provide you the right resources or counseling to help through your situation, burnout, and feelings of loneliness. It's okay to ask for help, okay?

You're not alone. You're strong and brave. Keep expressing yourself, keep reaching out. It might not seem like it now, but things can get better. Sending lots of positivity your way. Take care."

You're going through an awful lot and it would make anyone feel overwhelmed. I just want to emphasise: your feelings are perfectly valid. Remember, it's completely okay to feel burnt out and alone in moments of struggle. 

Journaling can be a great idea, don't worry about feeling 'dumb', it's your space to vent whatever you want. Also, have you considered seeking a counsellor through your university? They can give you some emotional support and even strategies to cope with things. 

It's really admirable that you're looking after your father too, but remember it's important to also set boundaries for your own well-being. Would it be possible for you to get some additional support for him? 

Most importantly, make sure you take some time for self-care. Even a little time each day to relax and do something you enjoy can make a massive difference. You're carrying a heavy load, and it's okay to prioritise yourself too.

Just remember, you are not alone. This community is here to support each other and there are professionals who can help too. Hang in there. Things CAN get better. Sending virtual hugs your way!"
"So I have decided to well distance myself from most of my friends. The reason why is even though i seem to be getting better. The people around me keep getting hurt because of me. But there’s not reason for me to get rid of my friends that I don’t see in person anymore so there’s no reason to worry about them because they did seem to get hurt. 
     The reason why the people around me are getting hurt is because of me. Now that I have show more emotion I tend to lose control over my emotions and when I do I try to control it but it just makes me angry. After that I would say things I don’t mean or physically hurt the people around me. I don’t mind the looks I get but I don’t want to hurt the people I care about I just want to protect them but if I can’t even stop myself from hurting then the how am I supposed to stop others. 
     I really am just looking for some advice or if anyone really knows what is going oh I haven’t been in the right mindset for a while now and I don’t think this will help me in anyway."	"Hi there, 

Firstly, it takes a lot of courage to open up about this, and your concern for others is commendable. The pride you take in showing a bit more emotion is a positive step towards personal growth, so don't let that be overshadowed by the fear of potentially damaging your relationships.

Try setting aside some time each day to practice mindfulness exercises. This can be as simple as focusing on your breath for a few minutes, without letting your mind wander to other concerns. This might help with controlling your reactions to your emotions.

Try to speak openly to those closest to you about your struggles. Most may already sense your pain and may appreciate your honesty. Some might even have some helpful suggestions or be willing to give the emotional support you need. 

Remember, it's normal to sometimes lose control of our emotions. But if you notice this becoming a regular pattern, it might be worth considering to speak with a mental health professional. They can provide therapy options that tackle with emotion regulation effectively.

Know that there's no need to face everything alone. Help is out there, and reaching out for it demonstrates a lot of strength. You're doing your best, and I encourage you to keep doing so."

Understanding your feelings and trying to gain control of them is a process, and it's not something that happens overnight. I sincerely congratulate you on recognizing your emotions and the effect they have on those around you.

Realizing that your actions might be hurting your close ones is a crucial first step toward change. You're showing a great amount of self-awareness — it's important to spare your loved ones from unnecessary hurt, but also remember that isolation can make the emotional turmoil worse.

Anger management techniques such as deep breathing exercises, meditation, or even physically exhausting yourself with activities such as running or cycling can help control the bursts of rage. But remember, these are just suggestions and it could be highly beneficial for you to seek professional help.

You seem to indicate that your mindset is not where you want it to be. Therefore, reaching out to a mental health professional could be very useful. They can provide various coping mechanisms, staff techniques to handle anger, and create an environment for deep introspective thinking.

If you're feeling open to it, consider joining a therapy group dealing with anger management. It might help to hear from others who are going through similar struggles.

Remember, the road to mental health is different for everyone and there's no one-size-fits-all method. Please take care of yourself and seek the right help you need. You're not alone in this endeavour."

First off, thank you for having the courage to write about your feelings and what you've been going through, that's a commendable first step towards better understanding your situation. It's very selfless of you to be worried about the impact of your actions on others and it's clear that you care deeply about them. 

Battling emotions is a tough journey, one that most of us undergo at some point in our lives, you're not alone. The feeling of losing control over your emotions is a common but challenging struggle. It can be beneficial to get professional help - consider reaching out to a licensed therapist who could provide you tools and techniques to regulate your emotions better. 

Remember self-care is essential in these moments. You may also try mindfulness exercises or meditation. It may help you gain better control over your emotions, thus helping you refrain from hurting those close to you.

Firstly, I applaud your bravery and vulnerability to share your feelings and situation. This first step is always the hardest and you've already crossed it. It seems like you’ve been going through a really trying time and your concern for your friends' welfare speak volumes about your character.

It appears you're dealing with a lot of emotional turmoil, which seems to be causing you to react impulsively at times, and it's causing you to distance yourself from your friends to spare them the brunt of your emotions. Learning to manage and control your emotions can be a difficult task, and it's completely understandable that you're overwhelmed right now.

You're definitely not alone in feeling this way and it's important to remember that reaching out is the right thing to do. Have you considered seeking professional help? Professionals, like therapists or counselors, are trained to guide you through this. They can work with you to understand your triggers and provide you coping mechanisms to improve emotional regulation.

In the meantime, consider engaging in self soothing activities like mindfulness practices, meditation, or journaling your thoughts and feelings. These may provide temporary relief and help you manage your emotions better.

Remember, it's okay to protect your personal welfare first. As the saying goes, you can't pour from an empty cup. You’re doing the best you can, and that’s enough. Keep reaching out, keep talking, and remember there are always people ready to listen. Your well-being before anything else.

Stay strong – we’re all rooting for you."

It certainly sounds like you're going through a difficult time right now and it takes a lot of courage to reach out for support the way you just did. I'm truly sorry that you're feeling this way, but I'm unable to assist in the way you need. It's really important that you talk to someone who can, however.

In terms of managing your emotions, it might be helpful to try some different strategies such as mindfulness or meditation, physical activity, or finding a creative outlet for your feelings. 

It can also be beneficial to practice self-care regularly. This could include taking a walk outside, taking time to enjoy a hobby or something you love, or even just taking a few moments to breathe deeply and relax.

Remember, it's okay to seek professional help. There are therapists, counselors, and other mental health professionals who specialize in helping people manage their emotions and deal with difficult situations. They won't judge you, and they're committed to helping you feel better.

Please keep reaching out to communities like this one, or others that you feel comfortable in. Do reach out to a mental health professional who can offer guidance and support based on their knowledge and experience. We care about you and your well-being is important to us.

Take care."

It's wonderful to see the introspection in your post, and your willingness to take responsibility shows a lot of strength. It's also commendable that you're putting others' wellbeing before your own needs.

That said, remember, everyone undergoes phases in life where their emotions seem too overwhelming to handle. It's a bumpy journey, but also a chance for growth.

Consider seeking professional assistance to unpack your emotions and work through managing them safely. This might even be an opportunity to find more understanding about yourself. Therapy can be an invaluable tool to empower you to cope with emotional turbulence.

Don't be hard on yourself. It sounds like you are aware of your behavior and want to change, and that is the first step in the right direction.

In the meantime, things like meditation, outdoor activities, or hobbies can also contribute towards self-calm. Remember that it's okay to not have all answers straight away. Be patient, take care, and remember, ignoring emotional pain only lets it grow. Everyone has a chance to grow, learn and heal. Believe in yourself!

Best of luck."

"Your situation sounds really tough, and it's clear you're going through a great deal of emotional turmoil. While it's vital to remember that the internet isn't a replacement for professional help, reaching out is certainly a good starting point. Emotional regulation is a process that many struggle with and there are both short-term and long-term strategies to tackle it.

In the immediate, practicing mindfulness exercises and grounding techniques can help you in moments where emotions are intense. This might involve focused breathing, mentally listing things you can see, hear, touch, etc. It's also important to remove yourself physically from situations escalating your feelings. Give yourself the time and space to calm down, then address the situation with a clearer mind.

Long term, therapy is an invaluable tool. Specifically, dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) focuses on emotional regulation and might be particularly helpful. There are also numerous self-help books and online resources about emotional intelligence that you might find beneficial.

Remember, you have taken the first step by acknowledging that something needs to change, and that's significant. It will take time and patience, but you are capable of change. Last but not least, let your loved ones know about your struggles so they might offer support and understanding."

First of all, acknowledging what you're going through and how it could impact those around you is a really big step and shows a lot of awareness. 

Remember, it's okay to feel overwhelmed and to struggle with emotions - this doesn't make you a burden or a bad friend. It sounds like you may be dealing with emotional dysregulation, which can make it difficult to control emotional responses. Seeking professional help, like a therapist or a counselor could really be beneficial.

I also suggest finding ways to communicate with your friends about these issues so they can understand your situation better, which will help them support you in the way that's best for you. This way, you'll have an added support system beside the professional help.

It's great that you're taking responsible steps to protect the people around you, but don't isolate yourself in the process. Hang in there, reach out for help, and remember everyone has rough times - it's a part of being human."

In fact, many people have faced or are still facing similar issues, so you're definitely not the only one.

It's very courageous of you to share your experience and ask for help. Dealing with addiction can be a challenging journey. If you think your addictive personality is causing you harm in your life, seeking professional help could be a beneficial step. Therapists and psychologists can provide guidance and strategies to help you control and redirect addictive behaviors.

In addition to professional help, positive habits and activities can replace more problematic ones. This can include hobbies, exercise, volunteer work, or simply spending time with people who uplift and support you. Surrounding yourself with people who are a positive influence can contribute greatly to your wellbeing.

Remember, recovery is not a race but a marathon. It's okay to take it slow, step by step. Make sure to remind yourself about your worth and strength.

"Hey there, thanks for reaching out and sharing this. It takes a lot of courage to open up and be vulnerable. From what you've described, it seems that you're dealing with a cyclical pattern of addiction, and feeling overwhelmed by it is perfectly normal. What's crucial is that you're cognizant of your behavior and seeking guidance, this is a great step forward. 

There are professionals who are specifically trained to work with individuals who struggle with this sort of repetitive behavior. They might offer new coping mechanisms, strategies and support to break this cycle. Therapy or counselling could be a suitable avenue to explore, and it can be tailored to suit your individual needs. 

Remember, everyone has their own battles, and you're definitely not alone in experiencing this. It's important, however, to reach out to professionals who can provide the support you need. Online platforms like BetterHelp or Talkspace could be a good start if you're comfortable with online therapy. In-person therapy can also be highly beneficial. I'd also recommend some self-care activities that can help you in managing stress and develop self-awareness. This might include activities like reading, journaling, meditating, hiking or any hobby that gives you joy and takes your mind off any urge to start a new addiction. It can be a gradual process, remember to be patient with yourself. You've got this!

Thank you for opening up about what you're experiencing, that requires a great deal of resilience. Many people struggle with addictive behavior, and it's important to know you're not alone in this.

Have you considered speaking with a professional about this? They could provide you with some strategies designed to help curtail addictive behavior and thought patterns. Therapy is a stigmatized topic, but really, it can be an incredibly beneficial tool for personal growth and healing. 

Remember, overcoming an addiction isn't about stopping at once, but more about managing urges, understanding triggers and striving to replace unhealthy habits with healthier ones. Peer support can be helpful, so perhaps you could look into local support groups or online communities, where people are going through a similar journey. 

Regarding your parents, it sounds like their circumstances may have affected you. Childhood experiences can have a profound impact on our emotional health. Have you ever explored this further, perhaps with a professional?

Lastly, don't forget to take care of yourself mentally and physically. Exercise, outdoor activities, peaceful hobbies, or even spending time with loved ones can create a positive buffer against resorting to unhealthy habits. 

It's amazing to see your self-awareness and your will to change. The road isn't always easy, but remember, it’s okay to seek help and guidance. We're all rooting for you!"

First, I want you to remember that you're not alone in feeling this way. Many people face similar situations and challenges in dealing with addictive behaviors. It sounds like you're aware of these patterns and that's a great first step in addressing the issue.

If you have identified certain destructive behavior patterns, try to replace them with healthy habits gradually. For instance, if you find you’re addicted to a specific unhealthy food, try gradually substituting it for a healthier option you also enjoy. Remember, it takes time to build new routines.

Additionally, getting support from a community or a mental health professional can be beneficial. This doesn’t mean you are weak or there's something ""wrong"" with you - it shows that you're proactive about your well-being. Support groups or therapy can offer different methods, techniques, and insights on how to manage these behaviors. 

Finally, practicing mindfulness and self-compassion can be very helpful. Acknowledge when these addictive behaviors appear and try to understand what underlying emotions might be surfacing. Be kind to yourself as you navigate through this process.

Please remember that positive change can take time, so try not to be too hard on yourself throughout this journey. You're doing great just by acknowledging your feelings and seeking advice. Keep the conversation open and safe."

"Firstly, I just want to say that admitting and recognizing that you have a problem is a significant first step. It is incredibly courageous to put your situation out there and ask for help, so give yourself some credit for that. 

It is completely normal to have cravings and addictions, especially when you have been through a lot, but it's crucial to maintain control and not let them take over. Addiction is a tough issue to address and live with, especially when it encompasses more than just substances—like certain foods, for example. In these cases, addiction often isn't about the actual thing but about the way it makes you feel. It's a coping mechanism for stress, emotional hardship, or what's missing in your life, acting as a temporary escape.

Mindfulness and self-awareness can be a resourceful tool. When you feel cravings, instead of immediately giving in, pause, and ask yourself why you want it. Is it genuine hunger? Is it something else you're feeling? The more you question what's happening within you, the better you can deal with it. 

Seeking professional help is validating too. They can provide the necessary tools and guidance to help you understand your addictive behaviors better and how to manage them. Connect with a professional with specialized training in addiction. It can feel really empowering to take control of your life. 

Lastly, remember that you're NOT alone. Many people navigate similar challenges, and communities like these provide comfort and support in knowing you're not the only one. It will take time and patience, but believe me when I say this - It will get better. 

Please take care of yourself. You matter."

Sorry to hear that you're going through this. It sounds tough but it's admirable that you're taking the first steps to understanding this part of yourself. Studies have shown that addiction can come from a variety of factors including genetics, environmental influences, and personal experiences - so it's nothing to be ashamed of. In terms of dealing with it, commit to making small, positive changes in your life. Try to replace harmful behaviors with healthier ones such as exercise, reading, or any activity that you enjoy. You could also consider speaking with a therapist or counselor. They can provide strategies and techniques to help you manage and understand your addictive behavior. Remember, recovering from any kind of addiction is a process that takes time and practice - be patient and kind to yourself. You're absolutely not alone in this. Stay strong.

I'm really sorry to hear about what you're going through. It sounds tough living with what you believe to be an addict personality, and your feelings are totally valid. This is a path you don't have to walk alone.

I'm wondering if you've considered seeking professional help? A psychologist or a therapist could work with you to uncover the roots of your addictive behaviors and provide you with strategies to cope. Support groups like Narcotics Anonymous (for substance misuse) or Overeaters Anonymous (for food dependency) could also be beneficial in creating a support network for you.

Engaging replacements for your addictions could be another useful step. This could be a sport you enjoy, a creative outlet, or spending time in nature - something that you love doing that keeps you in a positive state of mind.

Checking out mindfulness techniques might help too. It encourages awareness of your addiction triggers, which could empower you to make healthier choices over time.

You're not alone on this journey - there's help and strategies out there, and people who genuinely want to support you. Please take care of yourself, and don't hesitate to ask for help when you need it. You got this!"

I'm really sorry to hear that you're going through this. However, remember that you're not alone. There are a lot of people who experience struggles similar to yours, and it really takes courage to open up about your feelings and ask for help. 

While I can't offer professional advice, I can tell you something I learned from my personal experience and from others - sometimes the roots of addictive behaviours can be anchored in the need for comfort, for filling some void or trying to cope with stress or painful emotions. You could try activities that provide a more healthy coping mechanism - hobbies, art, sports, yoga or meditation. 

It's really beneficial to look for support within friends, family or online communities. Joining a support group where people share similar experiences can be really helpful. Most importantly, please consider consulting with a mental health professional. They can provide appropriate guidance and create a treatment plan specific for you. 

Remember, reaching out is the first step, and you've already done that with this post. Best of luck to you."

So perhaps before you completely give up on one, find healthier options you wouldn’t mind getting ""addicted"" to. You mentioned addictive behavior towards food — what if next time, it's exercising, painting, or even volunteering? Worth a try, right?

Join groups or communities full of people facing the same struggles, hearing their experiences could be motivating. Being open about your challenges with a trusted friend or family member can also provide emotional support.

Lastly, consider seeking professional help such as a therapist, who can provide better tools and techniques to manage your addictive personality. Don't hesitate to get the help you need. Change is completely possible and within your reach. Believe in yourself.

First off, I'm really proud of you for pushing through. It sounds like you're working really hard on healing, though there are still tough days. It's perfectly okay to struggle with these feelings, but remember, it's also okay to ask for help when you need it. 

It's good that you could talk to someone and that conversation made you happy. Identifying such moments of happiness is important, they may seem small but they add up, and they matter.

Seeing a psychiatrist can feel scary, but they’re there to help and they've heard it all before. They won't judge you - they want to help you. Maybe it would be helpful to write down what you want to say, or bring a trusted friend or family member with you. Taking the step to rethink your medication is a big one. Perhaps you can try to book another appointment when you're feeling a little stronger.

And managing to go from a 9/10 in sadness to a 4/10 is incredible progress! Keep noticing these small wins, they're signs of your resilience.

Remember to take it one day at a time, and don’t ever feel shy to reach out when you need support. We're here for you in this forum, and there are people around you who genuinely care. Hang in there, okay? You're doing an amazing job so far."

Congratulations on your progress, no matter how small it might seem to you. The journey of healing often takes time and it's okay to take small steps. It's great to see that you're acknowledging your feelings, that's a really brave thing to do. I understand that going to your psychiatrist can be difficult, but remember they are there to help you, and making that step to visit could have a significant impact on your improvement. 

As for your sleep, have you tried any relaxation techniques or establishing a regular sleep routine? Sometimes establishing a consistent sleep pattern can do wonders for our mental health. 

I'm really glad to hear you had a good conversation that made you happy. Small moments of happiness can slowly build up and make a big difference; so do cherish them. 

It sounds like you are genuinely trying to cope with your feelings and that's a good thing. You’ve acknowledged that healing is a process and you're taking it one day at a time, which is really admirable. Just remember, it’s okay not to be okay, and you don't have to do it all alone. Reach out to someone you trust and let them know you’re struggling. You are stronger than you know, and things will get better."

First off, I want to thank you for being courageous enough to share your experiences and feelings on here - that alone is an admirable step and shows a lot of strength. You’re right when you say that pain is part of the journey. It’s not an easy journey... but remember, it’s okay to have good days and bad days. Progress isn’t linear, and it’s important to give yourself the same patience and understanding that you would extend to others.

You mentioned you missed a session with your psychiatrist due to fear. I want to remind you that it's perfectly normal to feel this way. Mental health professionals are there to help, though it can indeed be intimidating. I encourage you to consider making an appointment for another day when you're ready - they might have alternatives and solutions to make your healing journey less overwhelming.

I'm glad to hear that you've had improvement, from being 9/10 sad to 4/10. Maybe next time it will improve even more. Making note of these improvements, however small, can be powerful. And yes, surrounding ourselves with the right people and engaging in uplifting conversations can make a huge difference in our mood and overall mental state.

Lastly, never feel lesser due to your level of English. You are doing great. We are all here to communicate and support, regardless of language proficiency.

Keep fighting! I believe in you. Remember, it's okay not to be okay sometimes. 

Sending much strength your way and take care!"

Firstly, I want to commend you for your strength in reaching out and for acknowledging that you're going through a tough time right now. Remember, it's completely okay to not be okay. Healing is not a linear process, and it's perfectly okay to have ups and downs.

Sleep disturbance is very common when dealing with mental health concerns. Try to focus on creating a soothing bed-time routine and set regular sleep and wake times if you can manage it - even on the weekends. 

Dark thoughts can be really scary, but remember, they're transient and they do not define you. Reaching out to someone, even for a small  conversation when you're feeling this way can help, and I'm glad you've had a positive experience with that. Keep trying to connect with people, it can really help.

Visiting the psychiatrist is a big step, and it's perfectly normal to feel scared. But it's also super essential for your recovery. Consider bringing a trusted friend or relative with you for support.

You're incredibly strong to be fighting this battle, and the fact that you're feeling even a little bit better compared to last week shows your resilience. Remember, every small step you take towards recovery counts, no matter how tiny it may seem.

Take care, you're not alone in this journey. Everyone here is with you. Stay connected."

First off, I want to say how courageous you are for sharing your feelings and current situation. It's not always easy and the step you just took is important. 

The fact that you are evaluating your feelings as being a 4/10 compared to 9/10 last week shows improvement, this is definitely something to celebrate, however small it may seem. Remember, any progress is a step in the right direction. 

It's absolutely fine to have days where you feel a little down, this is part of the healing process. One day at a time, one emotion at a time. You mentioned feeling lonely or alone, and let me tell you, with so many people in similar situations, you’re more connected than you think. Communities like this exist to remind each other we're not alone. 

It sounds like speaking with someone made you happy, that's great! Keep going with those conversations, surround yourself with those moments, and allow them to lift you when you feel this way.

Not going to the psychiatrist because you felt scared is okay, take it at your own pace. But since you are aware you need a change in your medicines, I do urge you to make an appointment at a time you think you might feel ready. Taking care of your mental health, involving professionals when necessary, is a crucial part of the healing journey. 

Remember, it's okay not to be okay. You're stronger than you think and every little step matters. Acknowledging and sharing your feelings as you just did is a step, and we are here, standing by you, supporting you along the way. 

Take care of yourself, okay? You're doing great."

"Hello there, it sounds like you're going through a lot right now and I commend your bravery for sharing this here. It's okay to have ups and downs and it's completely normal to not have your mood significantly improve overnight. Healing takes time and may include days when we feel especially down. That’s completely okay and won't last forever.

I'm glad to hear that there are moments that spark joy and it's important to appreciate those, no matter how small they may seem. Even a small conversation can do wonders for our mood - keep valuing and seeking out these moments. 

I understand that it's hard to get yourself to a psychiatrist's office - it can be scary and daunting. But it's fundamentally crucial to your wellbeing and shouldn't be neglected. Perhaps take small steps towards this goal by maybe planning your journey step-by-step, having a friend or family member accompany you or speaking to the psychiatrist's office about your concerns. They may be able to offer solutions which make the experience easier for you. 

Remember, it's okay to not be okay, and your feelings are valid. It's great that your mood has improved from last week. Let's aim to continue this trend. Consider trialing some positive, appropriate coping strategies such as light activity, maintaining a healthy diet, and practicing mindfulness. You're not alone in this journey, reach out when you need to and continue to share how you're feeling. You’re doing better than you think you are."

"Hey there, sounds like you've been having a tough time lately, but it's great to see that you're taking steps to prioritize your mental health and improve your situation. Remember, progress is progress, no matter how small.

It's okay to be scared about seeing a psychiatrist, it's a big step after all. Try not to beat yourself up about it too much, and perhaps you can try scheduling another appointment when you feel comfortable. The important thing is you're aware that you need help and are considering it. 

As for the sleep schedule, regain control over it slowly step by step. Try to establish a regular bedtime routine, it may be helpful. You've been very brave in accepting your feelings of loneliness and sadness, facing them head on is often the first step towards feeling better. 

Lastly, take solace in the little moments of happiness, like the good conversation you mentioned. Small moments like these matter as well. Don’t undermine your own growth, each small step you take towards wellness is a victory. 

Remember, you're not alone and it's okay to ask for help. Keep going!"

It shows a lot of bravery, and isn't an easy thing to do. You're right, recovery often isn't a straight path and it can take time. It's perfectly okay to have good and bad days - it's part of the process. The important thing is to acknowledge your feelings and give yourself the room to feel them without judgment.

It's also great to hear that you had a good conversation with someone. Try to seek out and focus on these little moments of happiness. They can help make the dark times feel a little less overpowering.

You also mentioned that you weren't able to see your psychiatrist, and please remember that this is okay too. You can only do your best and be ready when you feel strong enough to go. Communication is important. Maybe you could try contacting them to explain your fear, they might be able to offer some reassurances or perhaps an alternative method of meeting that feels less intimidating.

It's brilliant that you're thinking about going and recognizing when you might need to change your medication. Even if it's scary, that's an active step towards better managing your mental health, and it's really commendable.

And remember, you're stronger than you think. You've made it through your last week, which sounds like it was pretty tough and look where you are now. Stay strong, take one day at a time, and keep reaching out for support, even if it's just here on this platform. We're all here for you."

First off, thank you for opening up about what you're feeling, and know that it's okay to feel the way you're feeling. It takes courage to identify and admit these things, and you're doing just that. 

Remember, change takes time, and it's perfectly okay to take small steps to make changes until you're ready for the bigger ones. It's encouraging to hear that your mood has improved from last week, that's definitely a positive sign.

It's great that you had a good conversation with someone that boosted your mood even for a little bit. Engaging in more of these little interactions can offer you even more positive experiences. It's small victories like these that add up and help on your healing journey.

Going to see the psychiatrist can seem really intimidating, but it's important that you don't neglect your mental health. The fact that you're thinking about going is a step in the right direction. Perhaps it would help if you brought someone along with you to your appointment? It could provide some emotional support and reduce the anxiety about going.

You're progressing in your journey, and that's a great thing. But remember this is a marathon, not a race. Adjustment of your sleep schedule, combating loneliness, dealing with self-loathing thoughts, these all take time and patience and it's okay if you're not there yet. 

This journey is yours, and every step you make, no matter how small, is a step forward.

Hang in there! We're rooting for you."

"Hi there, it sounds like you're going through a tough time but remember it's okay to have tough days, it's part of being human. From what you've said, you seem to be self-aware - acknowledging that change happens slowly is a significant step in the right direction. It's great that you were able to have a good conversation with someone, interactions like that can make more of an impact than we sometimes realize. 

Regarding the psychiatrist visit, it's okay to feel scared. We're proud of you for considering it, it highlights your courage to face your fears. Just remember, they're there to help you and cater to your mental health needs. It might be difficult but changing your medications will ultimately benefit your mental well-being in the long run. 

Comparison is the thief of joy - don't compare your mood or state of mind to someone else's. Your 4/10 can be someone else's 1/10, for everyone processes pains differently. It's lovely to see you're satisfied with your progress, and for you, that means you're moving forward. 

Stay strong, and try each day to get to a better place. We're all rooting for you!"
"I’m sitting here at the bar I that I recently started to manage…. This was supposed to me an exciting step, a new change for a brighter future.  Every single day is work ya know? My job has crept into every aspect of my life. 

My partner hates my job, I just got it in January and we moved in together in February. Having to be on call for work has made me realize how “on call” I am for everything. They can’t accept the fact that I have to help out this restaurant with any problems they have on any given day. And I can’t accept the fact they have an extra set of expectations of me that I’m always failing. 

So I am consistently not meeting expectations for my personal life and my private life and I just hate it all. IT ALL FEELS LIKE WORK. 

I need help. I feel too uncomfortable and insecure to seek in person help so idk what else to do. I live very close to the tallest bridge in my state and people jump from it often. I just want to be another number for that jump list. I want my family to grieve my death for a couple days then just please forget about me. 

Secretly waiting for my parents to pass away, the I feel like I can actually kill myself without causing too much trauma for them. My siblings and friends will move on they all have their own families at this point and I will be just a memory or a picture on the wall. 

I’m just so tired of every day being work, but it’s not even my jobs fault. It only brought it to my attention."	failed

My partner hates my job, I just got it in January and we moved in together in February. Having to be on call for work has made me realize how “on call” I am for everything.

"I have no friends aside from one from primary school who I infrequently catch up with. I really just find most people not to be worth talking to, as I find it hard to connect with many people due to my lack of shared interests and my social anxiety.

However, I often feel lonely and kinda sad especially when I see people who are having a good time with their friends.

I did actually have a weird experience making a friend just recently though, but he's way older than me so it's a bit weird to hang out in person. I noticed he had an interest in something I really liked, and we had this great chat for about 10 minutes. It flowed so smoothly, and it was super passionate. We still message each other every couple of days.

Can anyone else relate to this?"	"Hey there, it sounds like you've been going through a tough time, but you're definitely not alone. Many others struggle with the same feelings of loneliness and difficulty in making connections.

Firstly, it's important to remember that having a few meaningful relationships can be so much more fulfilling than having many superficial ones. Quality always prevails over quantity.

Secondly, your recent experience seems positive! Even though there's an age difference, if you both share a common interest and enjoy each other's company, why not continue the friendship? Age doesn't always have to define the nature of a relationship.

Still, if you feel uncomfortable, it's perfectly fine. Take things slowly, set your own boundaries and remember that it's okay not to have it all figured out.

Finding people with shared interests can be helpful in overcoming social anxieties. Have you tried joining online forums or clubs related to your interests? Or perhaps attending meetups (once it's safe to do so)? 

Remember, it's okay to feel the way you do. Don't pressure yourself. Friendships and social connections aren't built overnight. 

Sending good vibes your way!"

Can anyone else relate to this?"	"Hey there, I just read over your post, and I want you to know that you're not alone in this. I also have times when it seems extremely daunting to forge new friendships. It sounds like your interests may not be mainstream, which isn't a bad thing at all but can make it slightly harder to find like-minded people. Having unique interests though can also be a great ice breaker when you do find someone who shares them.

Concerning your friend who's older than you - age shouldn't necessarily be a barrier to friendship. It's about shared connections, enjoying each other's company and having respect for one another. It's great to hear that you had a good conversation and still keep in touch.

Social anxiety can make things more challenging, but remember, it's quite common and something many people wrestle with. Have you considered reaching out to any online communities that share your interests? It can be a great way of connecting with people and helping with feelings of isolation. And remember, it's okay to take things at your own pace and not compare your social interactions to others. We all have our unique paths in life.

It's okay to have a smaller group of friends, and it's okay to feel lonely sometimes. However, if you constantly find yourself feeling down or anxious about it, maybe consider speaking to a professional who could provide some helpful tools and strategies. I believe in you, and remember, it's okay to reach out and ask for the connections and help you need. Don't forget - you're stronger than you think. Your journey is your own, and you're doing just fine. Keep going!"

Sometimes, people with niche interests can have a hard time finding like-minded individuals to connect with. The solitude can get lonely and overwhelming at times.

It's great to hear about your experience with this new friend! Even if there's a significant age difference, if you both share a common interest and enjoy each other's company, then isn't that what truly matters? Some of the most enriching friendships can be formed with those who have more life experience - they can provide advice, perspective, and wisdom that you might not find in peers of your own age.

Developing social skills and overcoming anxiety can be a tough and daunting journey, but it's a process, and it's absolutely okay to take it one step at a time. 

One way you could try mitigating your loneliness is by exploring new interests and activities. This could potentially open up more opportunities to meet people who share those same interests. Plus, diving into new experiences can help you grow as a person and discover more about yourself. 

Remember, you are not alone in feeling this way, and it's okay to reach out for support. Try to find solace in the small victories, and remind yourself that it's okay to tread at a pace that suits you best. Thank you for sharing this with us, it's a brave thing to do. Take care and hang in there!"

While I won't presume to know exactly what you're going through, please know that you're not alone in this. Many people struggle with finding friends and connecting with others, it's not easy and it's quite common.

From what you're saying, it sounds like you're capable of forming connections because of the friend you've made recently. Age doesn't necessarily determine the quality of the friendship. Shared interests can be a solid foundation for a great friendship. 

Also, consider joining clubs or groups centered around your interests - this way, you're more likely to meet like-minded individuals who share your passions. So, it could be an easier way for you to forge friendships.

Remember, it's about the quality of your friendships, not quantity. You might find it more fulfilling to have a small circle of close friends than a large number of acquaintances.

In terms of dealing with social anxiety: remember it's okay to take small steps. It's perfectly normal to feel nervous when engaging with others. Just take it slow and gradually put yourself out there; every little success counts.

Consider seeking professional advice for managing your social anxiety if you haven't yet. This could potentially help you feel more comfortable in mingling with others socially.
   
Take heart. Knowing and accepting what you're dealing with is a big step in the right direction. You're doing well."

"You're definitely not alone in your feelings, and many people can relate to having social anxiety, feeling isolated, or having difficulties in making new friends and connecting with others. It's also completely normal to feel a sense of loneliness or sadness, especially when observing others in settings that are sociable in nature. 

Your recent interaction with someone who shares your interest is wonderful! Don't let the age difference discourage you from pursuing this potential friendship. Sometimes, the best friendships come from unexpected places and people. One of the best ways to make connections is by finding common interests, just as you have. It allows for passionate conversations and a natural bond to form.

Consider joining online communities or groups centered around your interests. It can be a less anxiety-inducing way to meet new people and form connections, and you'll already know you have something in common. Remember, it's okay to take things slow when it comes to forming new relationships. The most important thing is to be yourself.

It's crucial as well to remember to look after your mental health. Engage in activities that you find calming or enjoyable, and don't hesitate to reach out to mental health professionals if your feelings of loneliness and sadness persist or intensify. 

Remember, it's okay to feel how you're feeling. But with time and the right steps, things will improve. You're never alone in these experiences, there are always people who care and are standing by to support, even if they're not physically present."

Social anxiety can indeed make it more difficult to connect with others and pursue friendships. But it's great that you've maintained a connection from primary school and also recently found someone with shared interests.

Some people enjoy having large groups of friends, but others thrive in a few deep and meaningful relationships. Both are completely okay. The key is to find what feels comfortable for you. As long as the relationship is built on mutual respect and understanding, age isn't necessarily a barrier.

In terms of expanding your social circle, you could look for groups or forums dedicated to your interests. You could also consider volunteering or joining clubs, which may provide structured social interactions that could be more manageable with social anxiety.

In terms of managing the sadness and loneliness, have you considered seeking out a mental health professional? They can provide tools and techniques to help you navigate these feelings. You're never alone in this, and there are always people willing to stand in your corner. Remember, it's okay to ask for help when you need it."

It's completely okay to find it difficult to connect with people, but remember, at the end of the day, we are all humans with unique interests and personalities, and it's totally normal not to have interests align with everyone.

As for your experience with the older friend, if you feel comfortable and enjoy your chats, there is nothing wrong with that. Age does not define the quality of a friendship; what matters is its foundation, which should be respect and mutual understanding.

Try to seek out groups or internet spaces with individuals who share your passions, it could be a great way to connect with like-minded people. Online communities are a perfect place to start, virtual spaces are arguably as meaningful as real-life ones. It also helps you manage your social anxiety as you have control over how much you share and when you interact.

Above all, take care of yourself and make sure your happiness and comfort are your top priorities. Reach out to a therapist or counseling services if your feelings of sadness or loneliness persist. You are not alone in your experiences."

It's interesting how you mentioned meeting that new friend! Age shouldn't be a barrier in friendship, you've connected based on mutual interests, which is awesome! It doesn't always have to be hanging out in person, keeping up through messages is a nice way to maintain the link.

If you're looking to make more friends, maybe you can turn to the activities that interest you. If you involve yourself in these, you're likely to meet people who share those interests. Meetup groups or online communities for your hobby can be a good start. It can be terrifying due to your social anxiety, but remember everyone's in the same boat bring there because of mutual interests.

And remember, being alone isn't necessarily being lonely, spending time with oneself can be rewarding too. This period might be an opportunity to explore your likes and dislikes a bit further. So don't be hard on yourself. It's perfectly fine to want company, feel lonely and also need alone time. You've got this!"

But believe me, everyone has their own unique hobbies and interests and it's not necessary to conform to others. Instead, try seeking those who share your interests, whether it's in online communities or local clubs.

Also, in response to your recent friendship, age doesn't determine the quality of a friendship. If you both share a common interest and enjoy each other's company, that is what's most important. The key to making friends is sharing those genuine moments of connection, just as you did in your recent experience.

And remember, it's not about having a large group of friends but having meaningful relationships. So, try not to compare yourself too much with others, it's more about the quality of the friendships you have rather than the quantity. Stay strong and keep reaching out! My inbox is always open if you need someone to talk to."

It sounds like your social anxiety might be hindering your ability to connect with others, and that's totally okay. 

Your experience of making your new friend shows that it is possible for you to connect with others who share the same interests as you. It sounds like you both hit it off really well. The age difference might feel a bit weird, but bonds can form across all walks of life if there's a shared passion or interest. 

I can also relate to what you're going through. It's tough when it feels like everyone else around you has these close-knit friend groups when you're feeling disconnected. I want you to remember that friendships aren't valued by quantity, but by quality. It sounds like you value meaningful and deep connections with people who share your interests. 

I would suggest involving yourself in forums or communities that revolve around your interests. The beauty of modern technology is that it can unite us with people who are passionate about the same things we are. 

I hope this helps a little and that you know it's okay to feel the way you do. Reach out anytime you need--sometimes the best connections come when you least expect them."
