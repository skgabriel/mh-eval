Update: Thank you so much for all of your advice. I’m happy to report that although my room isn’t spotless, it’s clean and liveable. Thank you for all of your advice and kind words"	"Hi there, 

First off, I'm really proud of you for reaching out for advice, that's a strong first step. It's clear you're facing a tough situation and it's okay to feel overwhelmed. Please know that you're not alone. 

To deal with the situation, let's start with small, manageable tasks. Here's a step-by-step plan:

1. Start by addressing the critter issue. It's important, for both your physical and mental health, to have a clean and safe environment. Consider reaching out to and hiring a pest control service to help with the rat infestation. This could potentially be resolved quickly and may provide you some instant relief. 

2. Once that's under control, consider focusing on one small area at a time to clean. A corner, a shelf, or something manageable. Remember to take breaks as often as you need to. 

3. If it feels too overwhelming to do this on your own, there's no shame in asking for help. Reach out to a friend, colleague, or anyone you trust. You can even hire a cleaning service if that's an option. 

4. Now, it's understandable that you're worried about communicating with your parents. But consider sharing with them about your challenges. They might not fully understand your depression but explaining the situation might give them a chance to support you.

5. As you continue to navigate through this, consider seeking professional mental health support if you haven't already. Therapy can provide you with coping skills and strategies to manage your depression and sensory issues.  

Remember, change takes time, so don't be hard on yourself. Just keep taking small steps in the right direction. You've got this! 

Wonderful update! That sounds like awesome progress you've made, congratulations!! It's no small feat what you've done, and I hope you feel proud. Remember, it doesn't need to be perfect, progress is what matters! We're all here cheering for you!"

Thank you for all of your advice and kind words"	"I'm glad to hear that you've made some progress, and I'm really touched by your honesty and courage to seek advice and help. Don't forget that it's okay to ask your parents or a professional for help and support. The stigma that's often attached to mental health issues - particularly depression - can make it difficult to admit when we're struggling, but your health and well-being should always be your top priority. 

In terms of practical tips for maintaining a clean space, here are some suggestions:

1. Try to make cleaning a regular routine, perhaps setting aside a small amount of time each day to tidy a specific area. This constant effort will keep the task manageable and less overwhelming.
    
2. Aim for 'good enough'. Your room doesn't need to be perfectly clean, it just needs to be livable. Often, the thought of a perfect result can be paralyzing and it's better to work at a pace that's comfortable for you.

3. Organize your possessions. Consider getting storage bins or shelves where you can easily locate and put things away. This might help in reducing the sensory overload.

4. In case of the rat infestation, it's important to seek professional help. You can search for local pest control services or ask your parents to help you out with this. It’s a serious issue that can't be handled alone.

Remember, you're not alone. There are many who are going through a similar struggle and support is available. Don't hesitate to reach out again if you need more advice or just someone to listen. Best of luck in your journey as you continue to make strides in improving your living situation and mental health."

You've taken a significant step by asking for help.

Firstly, in terms of the rat infestation, it would beneficial to call in extermination services. While I understand your fear about your parents' reaction, it would be really important for your health and well-being to inform them. It's essential to control the infestation.

For the sensory issues during cleaning, maybe you could consider using gloves and masks, and try to clean in small sections rather than taking on the whole room at once. Also, put some music on or listen to an audiobook; it really helps!

Regulating your depression may help you feel more capable of handling these tasks. Reach out to your healthcare provider, discuss your symptoms and talk about options that might work best for you.

Lastly, bear in mind that organizing and cleaning your physical space often has a big impact on mental health. It can feel like an uphill battle, but every little bit you manage is a victory.

You are worth the effort. You deserve to live in a clean, comfortable space. You've got this! Your courage in reaching out is evident, and that shows you have the strength within you to overcome these difficulties. Take care."

I'm really sorry to hear that you're going through this. It's good that you're reaching out here and asking for help, since keeping it all to yourself can often make things harder to manage. 

Firstly, I recommend breaking down the big task of ""cleaning my entire room"" into smaller, more manageable tasks. Maybe today you could just bag up the rubbish, tomorrow wipe down surfaces, and so on. This way, it doesn’t seem like an overwhelming task. 

Secondly, try to take care of the rat infestation. You can buy disposable rat traps that are easy to set up, and you don't have to physically handle the rat. Check out pest control websites or stores; they often have useful advice. 

Regarding your sensory issues, perhaps try wearing gloves or using tools that can extend your reach. This could help in overcoming your discomfort.

Lastly, it's okay to ask for help. Perhaps there’s a trusted friend or other family member who could assist you in this process. If expressing your feelings verbally is hard for you, you could write it down in a letter and let them read it. 

Remember, it's okay to struggle, but the fact that you're reaching out and trying to take steps to better your situation is so incredibly brave. You can do this, we believe in you!

Hi there, it's evident that you going through quite a tough season and I'm sincerely sorry to hear about the struggles you're facing. It's important to remember you're not alone and that it's okay to ask for help, even though it might feel like the hardest thing to do right now. 

Addressing the rat problem appears to be the immediate concern. I understand you are worried about your parents' reaction, but Rats carry diseases and can be harmful. An option could be to hire an exterminator, but this can be costly. Alternately, if you could gather the courage to talk to your parents, they might be able to help you with this issue. 

As far as cleaning your room is concerned, break it down into manageable tasks and tackle them one at a time. Maybe try to deal with one corner or one category of things per day. Listening to music or a podcast while you clean can make the job feel less daunting and put your sensory issues at ease too.

Finally, speak to a health professional about your depression when you are ready. Medication or therapy can make a huge difference to your daily life, and despite what your parents may believe, your struggles aren't due to laziness and it's important someone helps them to understand this too.

Remember that it's okay to ask for help and support when you need it. You have taken the first step by reaching out here. Your bravery does not go unnoticed. And feel free to keep us updated, we're here for you.

Firstly, I'm so sorry you're going through this. Dealing with depression can be really tough and it's commendable that you've reached out for advice and shared your situation openly. This is the first step to recovery, and showing this vulnerability is a sign of strength. You're a survivor.

It sounds like you're dealing with a lot right now, and it's okay to feel overwhelmed. But remember, you don't have to do it all alone. Your fear about telling your parents seems very real, however, they might be willing to assist and provide necessary support if they understand the full extent of your situation. They might not know how to help unless they know what's really going on.

Start by tackling one issue at a time, in small steps. For your cleaning issue, consider maybe trying to break down the task into smaller, more manageable tasks. For instance, start with clearing out your bin. then progress to decluttering for 10-15 minutes at a time. Take it at your own pace, step by step.

For your sensory issues, perhaps look into tools or products designed to help with sensory overload—such as noise-causing headphones or comfortable gloves. You might also benefit from having some form of routine or plan for maintaining a cleaner space.

Remember, it's ok to ask for help. Professional help can provide you with the necessary tools to manage your depression and make your day to day life more bearable. If you're not comfortable discussing this with your parents yet, there are plenty of hotlines available that can offer assistance.

Lastly, keep going—you're stronger than you think. Remember that your abilities are not determined by the state of your room. It's just a room and it doesn't reflect who you are as a person.

Sending you lots of positive thoughts. Please take care."

Reading your post really touched my heart and I wish you didn't have to feel so alone in these struggles. Remember, you don't have to go through this alone - it's okay to ask for help. Opening up about it, like you just did here, is a wonderful step. 

Regarding the cleaning issue, why not break it down into smaller tasks, instead of tackling everything at once? For example, you can start with removing all the rubbish from your room and deal with the rat issue. There are professionals who can help with pest control. 

As for your parents, if you feel up to it, try talking to them about your problems and challenges. It might be difficult, and they may not fully understand at first, but they could be more supportive than you expect.

Remember to take things one step at a time. You've already made good progress by reaching out and writing this post - it's also proof that you're braver and stronger than you think.

It sounds like you're really struggling right now, and I'm so sorry you're feeling this way. But you should know that many of us have been where you are and there's no need to go through this alone - people want to help you. Experiencing sensory complications alongside depression can indeed make everyday tasks feel overwhelming.

Firstly, it's great that you're reaching out on this platform. That's a huge step which shows a lot of courage and strength.

First and foremost, your mental health comes first. Find professional help so you can tackle the root of these problems (though I understand that maybe it is not immediately accessible for you) - there are many therapists who are doing online sessions now. If your parents are understanding, consider having a conversation with them. Let them know what you're going through, as they might be more understanding or may be able to help you find a suitable professional help.

As for your room, finding help with the cleaning might be a good step, especially given the deadline you've mentioned. You can hire a professional cleaning service, ask a friend or a neighbor to help you or even check if there are any community resources available specifically designed to help in this very situation.

Remember, it's okay not to do everything at once. Work at a pace that's comfortable for you. For managing your bin try to take out the trash regularly, maybe at the end of each day. This could prevent possible infestation.

You're capable of far more than you think and I admire your willingness to seek help. You are not alone."

Lighting the way when your world feels really dark can seem impossible, but remember, small steps matter. 

When it comes to cleaning your room, let's break it down into manageable tasks. Don't pressure yourself to complete everything all at once. Today just focus on the bin. Use gloves and heavy-duty garbage bags to get the trash out. You might consider enlisting the help of a pest control service for the rat issue if you're unable to manage it yourself. 

As for your parents, consider opening up about your struggles. It can be a big relief, they might be more understanding and supportive than you believe. Let them know you need their help rather than their judgment. They're your family, their love is deeper than you think.

And if telling them isn't an option, perhaps seek support from friends, or professional counselors. They can help you develop coping strategies and allow you to express your feelings in a safe, judgment-free zone. 

Remember, getting better will take time. Be patient with yourself. Little by little, you can reclaim your life and your space. You're stronger than you think and you're capable of overcoming this. 

Finally, congrats on the progress you've made with your room. Sure it's not perfect but cleanliness doesn't mean spotless, liveable is a great step forward. Your strength is inspiring! 

Keep on fighting and never hesitate to ask for help when needed. You are worth it. Take care.

I'm really sorry to hear about what you're going through. Depression can indeed make even ordinary tasks seem monumental and overwhelming. Try to break it down into small tasks. Start with something easy like picking up trash or tidying up one small corner of your room. Take breaks if you need to and give yourself credit for any progress you make.

In regards to the rat infestation, it would be best to notify your parents or call a rodent control service as soon as possible. It is a health risk that shouldn't be ignored. If telling your parents feels impossible, perhaps you could write them a note or an email and explain your situation.

Lastly, it might be beneficial to seek professional help if you haven't already. There are therapies that can help with both depression and sensory issues. You don't have to face this alone. And keep in mind that people understand and want to help, even if it doesn't always feel that way.

"[32y/o, white female] -- ""My dad just died and my mom wants me to hang out with her all the time. I''ve never liked doing casual things with her, and I'm very independent.

I don't know how to tell her to leave me alone. The best relationship we ever had was when I lived in another state. I moved back because of my dad, but now he's gone. 

My mom now tries texting me at all hours because I ""might be awake"", and tries to drop by uninvited all the time. I'm conveniently never home and have dropped off of all social media to avoid her (she doesn't know what reddit is). 

Worst is when she drops in to open events that I regularly attend; like I can't tell her to leave any more than anyone else there, but I also don't want to go somewhere she can invite herself, so I end up not going, or lying to her and attending other groups. 

I just don't know how to keep my independence without hurting her feelings. I get that she's lonely, but I don't want to be her go-to person. 

Not sure if this is the right sub for this, but I'm struggling at finding a therapist to help me deal with her & her grief (I'm sad too, but in a different way, and she's smothering me)."	"I'm really sorry to hear about your situation. Losing your dad is undoubtedly tough, and having to deal with your mom's loneliness on top of that is a real burden. It sounds like you respect and care about your mother, but also highly value your own independence. It's important to remember that despite the circumstances, it's still okay to prioritize your own wellbeing. 

You might consider setting boundaries with your mom. This could start with a conversation where you tell her something like, ""I love you and I care about you, but I also need to honor my own needs during this time. I'm not always available to provide company, or maybe I just need some personal space to process and heal in the way that makes sense for me."" 

Communication could be key here. You could ask her to limit her check-ins to once a day, or request that she doesn't drop by uninvited. If the conversations feel hard to manage, you might consider involving a mediator, like a family therapist if possible, because they can be really helpful during times of transition and conflict.

Remember, it's okay to say no, it's okay to require space, and it's okay to prioritize your own mental health. You are important.

Lastly, for finding a therapist, websites like Psychology Today and Good Therapy should have available therapists listed in your area. They often provide information about each therapist’s specialties, which can be helpful in finding someone who suits your needs. It can be a process, but don’t give up. You deserve to find the right support for your situation.

Firstly, I'm truly sorry to hear about your loss. Having to deal with bereavement and the shift in family dynamics simultaneously can feel incredibly overwhelming. It's great that you're talking about it though.

From your post, it sounds like you have a desire to support your mum from a distance while maintaining your own emotional boundaries, and that's okay. You need your own space to process your feelings, just as she does. It might be a good idea for you to sit down with her and communicate how you're feeling. She might not realize the extent to which her behaviour is negatively affecting you.

In this conversation, it's essential not to put the blame on her. Instead, clarify that you care about her deeply but need some time and space to process your own feelings. If you're worried about how she'll react or handling this conversation, it might help to speak to a counselor or a support group to work out some effective coping strategies and communication tips.

Remember, dealing with grief doesn't come with an instruction manual. Everyone experiences and copes with it differently. Understanding and acknowledging your need for space is the first step towards effectively managing this situation.

All the best to you. Please remember to be gentle and patient with yourself during this time. You're doing the best you can and that is enough."

"I'm really sorry to hear what you're going through right now. Your feelings of wanting to keep your independence while also dealing with your mom's grief are completely valid and it sounds really tough.

Saying 'no' to someone, especially a family member, can be really difficult but remember that your boundaries are important too. Maybe you can set some times for when she can make visits? Consider creating a schedule for when both of you are available to meet. This way, her showing up may feel less intrusive.

It might also be helpful if you communicate your emotions honestly, though tactfully, to her. Share your need for independence and also suggest other avenues she could find support in (additional family members, groups, clubs). It may hurt at first but may also lead to a better understanding in the long run.

I know you mentioned finding a therapist is proving to be a struggle, but keep trying. They can provide invaluable guidance when dealing with complex family dynamics, as well as supporting your processing the loss of your dad. 

Finally, please also remember to take care of yourself during this time. Self-care is crucial, whether it's taken up in the form of mediation, exercise or even reading. This is a challenging situation, but remember you don’t have to navigate it alone."

"I'm really sorry to hear you are going through all of this. It sounds incredibly tough. Losing a loved one is difficult and dealing with a grieving parent can bring further complications. 

Firstly, you're not wrong or selfish for wanting to maintain your independence. It's essential for your well-being too. Your feelings are valid, and you have every right to establish boundaries with your mother, even if she's grieving.

Attempting gentle, yet honest communication could help. You might say to your mom: ""I love you, but I need some space and time on my own right now to process everything. We both lost someone we love deeply, and we're handling it differently. Is there a way you can respect my need for space?""

Furthermore, have you considered encouraging your mom to seek support outside of you? This could be in the form of counseling, support groups for grieving individuals, or just by hanging out with her friends. This would allow her to express her feelings without relying solely on you, thus offering you some respite. 

Regarding therapy for you, it can be a struggle to find the right person. Consider teletherapy if it's available and accessible; it might widen the net of professionals you could work with. Look for someone who specializes in grief counseling or familial relationships, they might be better equipped to help you navigate this situation. 

Remember, it's okay to not be okay, and it's okay to take care of yourself first. Sending you virtual strength."

"I'm really sorry to hear about the situation you're facing, it must be incredibly tough. Grieving is a very personal and individual process, and it's important to remember that it's okay to prioritize your mental health and emotional wellbeing.

Remember, setting boundaries is much about self-care as it is about balancing relationships. It's not easy, but it's necessary. 

Have regular conversations, check-in on her but set defined timings for your interactions if that helps. This way you're there for her, but not at the risk of your own mental/emotional health.

Losing a loved one can make us reevaluate existing relationships. If you're still struggling to talk to your mom, it could be really beneficial to get in touch with a grief counselor or therapist.

First off, I'm so sorry to hear about your loss, and the complicated situation you're currently dealing with. 

Grief can bring forward various emotions and behaviors— each person finds their own way to cope. It sounds like your mother is trying to fill the void left by your father's passing by reaching out to you. And while her intentions may be good, it seems to be affecting you negatively.

It's important to remember that you have full control over your space and your self-care. You have every right to request a bit of distance if you need it.

My suggestion would be to sit down with your mother and candidly communicate how you're feeling. Explain that while you understand and empathize with her grief, you need some space and time to process in your own way. And it might be beneficial to propose alternatives for her to pursue—hobbies, support groups, or spending time with friends can all be of help. 

In terms of therapy, reaching out to local mental health centers, universities, or hospitals might provide resources for you to find a therapist suitable for your needs. You also might want to try online counseling platforms. 

Remember, taking care of yourself isn't selfish; it is necessary. Your feelings are valid and you certainly have a right to express them. I wish you strength and peace during this difficult time.

Take care.

"I'm really sorry to hear about your situation, particularly after losing your father. It's clear that you are struggling to find the balance between wanting to support your mother and needing your independence. One thing you might want to consider is setting firm boundaries with her. This doesn't mean being cold or harsh, but clearly expressing the need for your space might be necessary.

It's understandable that she is trying to mitigate her own feelings of grief and loneliness. However, since you have your own process of healing, it's essential to convey this to her. It won't be an immediate transition, but start by limiting the timing and frequency of contact gradually. For instance, let her know that sometimes you need to be alone, and you'll reach out when you're ready.

Perhaps, suggest that she join local support groups or connect with her friends, as this might help bridge her loneliness. If meeting a professional for guidance works for you, keep searching for a therapist. It's about your mental health, be it individual counseling, or family therapy to help both navigate this challenging time.

Remember, it's not selfish to prioritize your wellbeing. You cannot pour from an empty cup. Be patient with yourself, and your mother too."

"Hey there, firstly I'm so sorry to hear about your dad, that must be incredibly hard. It sounds like you're really grappling with some complicated relationships and boundaries right now. 

Navigating grief can be a terrain all on its own and it's understandable that you feel overwhelmed by your mom's coping mechanisms, which seem to lean toward excessive contact with you.

It's important to remember that it's okay to look after your own wellbeing, and that doesn't make you a bad person or daughter. Plus, setting boundaries can actually be a really healthy step in preserving relationships rather than damaging them.

Although it's difficult, open and honest communication is often the most effective. Let your mom know how much you care about her, yet also express your need to grieve in your own way and to keep some level of independence. Explain it's not about pushing her away per se, but rather maintaining the balance that works best in your relationship with her.

Finding a neutral third-party to mediate, like a counselor or a family friend, might be beneficial during these initial conversations.

At the same time, helping her explore other ways to deal with her grief may take some pressure off you. Maybe she can join a grief support group, or spend time with friends, or pick up a new hobby? 

Remember, it's okay to want space and independence, even from loved ones. Wishing you all the best as you navigate through this life-challenge. Stay strong and grounded.

It seems like you're dealing with a lot right now-especially with the recent passing of your father. It's okay to need space, to want your independence - this is a natural feeling to experience and you shouldn't feel guilty about it. Your mom might be clinging onto you as her mode of coping with her own grief, not understanding that it may suffocate you rather than provide comfort. Communication is key here. You may want to consider sitting down with her and expressing your feelings honestly. Maybe say that you understand she's grieving but you are too and you need to process things in your own way. Assure her you love her and will be there for her, but also set boundaries for when she can contact you or visit.

It's important to remember that strong emotions aren't a frailty, rather an indication that you feel things deeply. Working on controlling these emotions can make a significant difference.

Firstly, identifying your emotions can be helpful. When you're feeling anxious, take a moment to identify the feeling, is it fear, sadness, worry? By acknowledging what you are feeling, you're given a greater sense of power over the emotion.

Secondly, practice mindfulness. It involves being completely present in the moment, fully engaged in whatever you're doing. Mindfulness can help reduce anxiety because it allows us to stop dwelling on past events or anticipating what’s to come.

Communication is key here. Let your partner know how you're feeling when they aren't around. They may be able to provide reassurance that can help you cope.

Lastly, considering speaking to a mental health professional about this if you haven't already. They can provide effective coping strategies individualized for your situation. You're not alone."

Sorry to hear about what you're going through. It's not easy dealing with intense emotions like this, but remember, you're not alone. Anxiety can be extremely overwhelming. Firstly, do seek professional help if you haven't yet, as therapists are equipped with techniques to help you cope with your feelings more effectively. 

In the meantime, find self-care techniques that can help. For instance, meditation and mindfulness exercises could give you a tool to combat these feelings when they arise. Yoga and deep breathing exercises might also be valuable. It could also be beneficial to invest time in hobbies or activities that bring you joy and peace, as this can distract you in a positive way.

Another step could be Cognitive Behavioral Therapy techniques, such as facing your fears in little doses, and using rational thinking to counteract the anxiety. This means acknowledging your feelings and fears but replacing them with fact-based thoughts about your situation. Journaling, for instance, is an easy way to start noting down and challenging your thoughts.

There are also several resources online and self-help books that can give you insight and equip you with tools to handle your emotions better.

Lastly, remember there's no harm in seeking help and reaching out to friends or trusted individuals about what you're experiencing and expressing how they can support you during these times.

"Hello! I can absolutely empathize with what you're going through right now. Social media interaction has its own unique set of anxieties and it’s completely okay to feel the way you do.

Many people, even if they can't completely relate, are going to understand what you're dealing with, and that's an important thing to remember.

Anxiety can be difficult to manage especially when it's connected with social media interactions. It's normal to feel overwhelmed when talking to acquaintances or people we don't often communicate with. The important part is recognizing your pattern of behaviour, and sounds like you're already tackling this. That's a great step towards growth.

Remember it's fine to take the time you need to compose your thoughts before replying, there's no rule saying you need to respond immediately. You dictate your own response times. If people ask why you respond late, it's okay to simply say you needed time to process or that you had other tasks at the moment. No one is entitled to have instant access to you and your energy.

If anxiety becomes overwhelming and is affecting your day to day life, it may be beneficial to talk to a mental health professional. They can provide coping techniques and strategies to manage anxiety and help improve your social interactions. You're doing a great job by voicing your concerns and working on yourself. Keep going, and remember, it’s okay to ask for help. Stay strong and take care.

"Hello, 

Your feelings are completely normal and many people can relate to what you are experiencing. It's admirable that you're being introspective about this and that you're aiming towards self-improvement. Here are a few suggestions that could help. 

Firstly, keep in mind that everyone is different in their social media habits, there's no one singular timeline that's universally considered 'acceptable' to reply. Also, remember to prioritize your emotional health above perceived social expectations. 

Secondly, consider doing something that takes your mind off the stress of replying immediately - like reading a book, going for a walk, etc., before returning to compose your answer. 

Lastly, it's completely okay to be upfront about your anxieties. If you feel comfortable, explain to the person you're speaking to that you sometimes need time to process and respond to messages. This will not only alleviate the pressure you might be feeling but also foster understanding between both parties.

Keep in mind, self-improvement is a continuous journey and it's perfectly okay to have moments of struggle. But by being proactive and finding your own pace, you're on the right track! Keep going, you're doing great!"

Hey there, firstly I just want to commend you on your self-awareness and your decision to work on this issue, it really shows strength. The anxiety you're describing can definitely feel overwhelming and isolating, but please remember you're not alone in feeling this way and it's okay to take your time to reply. The digital world often puts undue pressure on us to respond instantaneously, which just isn't necessary or realistic all the time. Maybe you could try setting specific times of day to check and respond to these texts, almost like appointments, taking the pressure off of immediate replies. Also, consider letting these acquaintances know about your struggle with anxiety if you feel comfortable enough - most people will understand and can be accommodating. Therapy can also be a great resource to develop coping tools for this type of anxiety. You're doing a great job by just acknowledging and starting to tackle this. Keep going!

I completely understand what you're going through. It's a universal truth that social interaction, even online, can spike anxiety, especially in people who are familiar but not close. It's okay to take your time in replying, the important part is that you take care of yourself. However, if this is causing distress, you might want to consider seeking help from a professional. They could provide techniques to manage your anxiety and set a healthier boundary with social media. Don't forget that it's okay to feel this way and there’s no timeline you must adhere to when replying to people. Everyone operates differently and that's perfectly okay. Be kind to yourself. You're showing progress and that’s what truly matters.

"Hey there, 

Your feelings are completely valid. Dealing with social media interactions can be pretty intimidating, especially with people we're not close with. It might feel like you're in this alone, but know that there are many others who feel the same anxiety in these situations too!

It's perfectly okay for you to take your time with replies. Everyone has their own pace when it comes to interactions. Try not to put unnecessary pressure on yourself for not having a ""good enough"" reason for replying late. You owe no one an explanation for taking care of your peace of mind, first and foremost.

It sounds like you are already on the path of improvement, and that is already a huge achievement. Give your best but also be kind to yourself. Consistently remind yourself that it's okay. You're doing just fine. And remember, you don't need to justify how you choose to manage your digital communication.

If this anxiety continues to persist and affect your day-to-day life, seeking help from a mental health professional might be beneficial. They can provide strategies and tools to deal with this type of anxiety more effectively. 

Make sure you're taking time for self-care, and doing things you enjoy outside of social media. It's just as crucial to nurture our bonds offline too. Take care!"

"Hey there, thank you for sharing. What you're experiencing is much more common than you think. Many people struggle with the same balance of responsiveness versus anxiety on social media. One possible solution is setting aside specific time slots when you're engaged and ready to interact, this way replying won't feel as overwhelming. It might also help to remind yourself that it's okay to respond when you're ready; there's no rule that says you have to respond instantly. 

If your anxiety becomes overwhelming, you might consider seeking professional help like a therapist or counselor. They can provide tools to manage this anxiety more effectively. Most importantly, remember to be kind and patient with yourself — you're absolutely making progress, even if it might seem slow. Take care."

I totally understand where you're coming from. Social media can often feel like an overwhelming maze of conversations and interactions, and it's okay to feel anxious about it. One thing you might try is setting aside a specific time each day for responding to these messages. That way, it becomes a planned part of your routine which might help to alleviate some of the anxiety. It's also important to remember that it's okay not to respond instantly, you're allowed to take your time and respond when you're in the right mindset. The important thing is that you're making progress; even small steps can be significant victories. And remember, anxiety is not your fault so you don't have to apologise for its effects. Be kind to yourself."

"Hey there, 

First, recognize that it's great you've identified this pattern in your behavior and are seeking ways to improve. Struggling with social media interactions, particularly with those we aren't close to, is something that many of us experience, and it's perfectly okay.

You mention that you don't experience this issue when interacting with people you're close to - this indicates that you're comfortable communicating, but possibly anxious about the judgments and expectations of others. It may help to remember that everyone is 'wired' differently. Some reply instantly, others take their time. You're allowed to respond in your own time, and that does not make you 'weird'. It's just your unique style.

As for managing your anxiety, consider actively scheduling 'replying time' in your daily routine to alleviate pressure. Break the task down: read the message, allow yourself a moment to absorb it, then draft your response (without sending it), finally, review and send. This way you can manage your reactions without the immediate pressure to respond perfectly.

Most importantly, be kind to yourself. It's okay to reply late. Not everyone expects an immediate response, and many are likely more understanding than you think. If your late response ever becomes a point of discussion, stating that you were busy or taking time to carefully consider your messages could be enough explanation.

Keep going. Strides in dealing with anxiety are often small but incredibly significant. You're making progress."

"Hello! 

Thanks for reaching out here and sharing your experience. It takes a lot of courage to admit that you struggle with something, especially when it affects your life in this way. Anxiety can definitely make certain situations more challenging, and it sounds like interacting with acquaintances on social media is a trigger for you.

First off, it's important to remember that you're not alone. Many people struggle with the same feelings, and you're only human. You're not required to respond to every message instantly - in fact, it's completely normal to take your time.

You might want to try setting a specific time to check your messages, to prevent the unexpected messages from triggering anxiety. A ""social media schedule"" can help you feel more in control. 

Also, practice self-forgiveness. If you reply late, apologize politely and move on. People are usually very understanding, and more often than not, they won't consider it a big issue. 

Lastly, consider seeking professional help if your anxiety continues to affect your daily life. Talking to a therapist can provide you with the right tools and strategies to cope.

Continue to challenge yourself and step out from your comfort zone gradually. Remember, improving takes time. Every small step you take is a victory. You're already doing great by recognizing and working on this challenge. Good luck!"
[32y/o, white female] -- I don't know when exactly it started. Might be around 2019, when my parents took me to this horrible trip to some religious place in the hills. Before this we used to do great trips, London, USA etc which I enjoyed. But then  after this, I've always been uncomfortable/reluctant when it comes to any sort of travelling. Then COVID struck and I was at home for ~2 years, things didn't improve for me- we did go on one trip in 2021 but I was just so anxious dealing with it, and I also had classes so in the entire trip I was attending online classes (cause I had to, a huge test was coming up). My problem is that I'm anxious before the trip happens and during it I'm completely fine. It's gotten better now tho, but not completely cured. Going alone or with friends seems like a mammoth task. Especially since if I go with friends there's no one to control and they would go wild. I know I need to get over this for the future. Any tips?	"Hey there! It's really brave of you to open up about your anxiety associated with traveling. I think many of us can relate to feeling out of control or overwhelmed when we're stepping outside of our comfort zones. In your case, it seems like there is a lot of anticipatory anxiety that puts you off before a trip. 

First off, it's completely okay to have these feelings and you are not alone. Maybe you could take smaller steps like going for short trips somewhere local for a start. You could also take control of the planning process, that might help you feel more in control. Keeping a journal where you can put down your thoughts and fears about an impending trip might be beneficial too. It can help you identify specific triggers or fears so you can work through them.

If going with friends stresses you out, try discussing with them what exactly you feel. Communication is key here. Let them know your concerns and that you need their understanding. 

If your anxiety continues to persist, speaking to a mental health professional could be beneficial. They can provide you with strategies to cope with your anticipatory anxiety and also suggest techniques for calming your nerves. Remember, you don't have to go through this alone. Wishing you all the best in your journey towards overcoming this anxiety, you've got this!"

"Hi there, it sounds like you're going through quite a tough time. Anxiety around changes like travelling can be confusing and frustrating, especially when they seem to appear out of nowhere. But remember, it's okay to feel this way, you're not alone and this doesn't define you or your ability to enjoy life.

Although it might not thoroughly solve your issue, a couple of strategies could help you manage your anxiety better. For one, getting to the root of why you're anxious about trips might be a good jumping point. Was it the religious nature of the trip that bothered you? Or having no control over the activities? Unpacking these fears might put you in a better position to face them.

Practicing mindfulness and relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing exercises, visualization or progressive muscle relaxation, might help you manage your anxious feelings better. Additionally, speaking to a mental health professional might be beneficial as well.

Try to gradually expose yourself to situations that cause you anxiety. For instance, going on short trips around your town with a friend or two may help you to gradually familiarize yourself with the sensation of traveling, hence reducing the anxiety to manageable levels.

You mentioned going alone or with friends is daunting because you fear losing control. It's okay to communicate with them about your fears and needs. More likely than not, they'll respect your concerns and support you.

Finally, remember to take care of your physical health. Regular exercise, a healthy diet, and maintaining a regular sleep schedule can positively impact your mental wellbeing.

Stay strong, and remember it's okay to ask for help, be it from family, friends, or professionals. Recognizing the problem is the first and most important step towards overcoming it. Keep going!"

I'm sorry to hear that you're experiencing this intense pre-travel anxiety. It can indeed be challenging, but it's great that you're able to enjoy the trips once you're there and that you've seen some improvement. Anxiety often stems from fear of the unknown or from past negative experiences. It sounds like that trip to the religious place might have been a triggering event for you.

First off, you might find it helpful to approach traveling in small doses. Begin with short local trips or day trips. As you get more comfortable, gradually increase the length and distance of your travels. 

In addition, consider what specifically makes you anxious about the travel. Is it being out of your comfort zone? The uncertainty of new places? The responsibility of planning? Once you identify the root causes, you can address them more effectively. 

You may also want to practice mindfulness techniques, like deep breathing or meditation, to manage your anxiety as it comes. This can help to ground you in the present moment and reduce those feelings of anxiousness. 

It's completely okay to step outside your comfort zone at a pace that suits you. Find what works for you and your comfort level. And remember, it's always okay to seek professional help if you need it.

Wishing you all the best, and remember, take it one step at a time. Your experiences and anxiety are valid. Don't rush yourself, and try to honor your feelings in the process."

I'm sorry to hear you're going through this, but it's good you're talking about it and recognizing that it's something you'd like to improve. Travel anxiety is actually quite common, and often stems from a fear of the unknown or leaving comfortable surroundings. 

Here's a few tips to help you navigate through this issue:

1. **Plan Ahead**: Plan your trip well. Know your destination and keep yourself informed about where you're going, what's nearby, where certain amenities are. The more you familiarize yourself with the area, the less stressful it might be.
2. **Pack Smart**: Bring comfort items with you like a favorite pillow, headphones for music or audiobooks to create a comfortable environment.
3. **Practice Mindfulness**: Mindfulness can be extremely helpful in managing anxiety. Try practicing deep breathing exercises or meditate for a few minutes every day.
4. **Talk About It**: Discuss your fears with your travel companions if you're comfortable doing so. Letting people know can definitely ease some of the anxious feelings you're experiencing.
5. **Seek Professional Help**: If your anxiety continues to affect your life and interferes with your enjoyment, consider seeking help from a mental health professional.

Please know that it's okay to feel anxious and you're not alone. Take this one step at a time, there's no need to rush. You are stronger than you think! 

Take care and happy travels."

Firstly, thank you for opening up about your situation – it's never easy to admit our discomfort and insecurities. Now, it's completely normal to have anxiety about different situations in life. Given that you're feeling this kind of anxiousness about trips even when they used to be something that you previously enjoyed indicates that a particular incident in the past may have unconsciously caused this change in perception. 

You've mentioned the trip to the religious place in the hills - could it be possible that there was a negative experience during this trip that could be triggering a fear response in you? It may help to sit down and try to understand what about that trip causes anxiety. 

It's also completely okay to feel overwhelmed with the entire process of travelling. Travelling, especially with friends, comes with its challenges of coordination, planning and often unpredictability. It's important to remember that not everyone finds joy in the same experiences.

One way to address this could be to start small. You could try taking a short trip, maybe a day trip to a city nearby or even a local attraction. Go with people you genuinely enjoy spending time with and gradually increase the duration of your trips as your comfort level grows.

If the anxiety persists or intensifies, you might want to consider speaking to a mental health professional. Everyone's different, and what works for one person might not work for everyone, so a mental health professional could help you explore strategies or treatments that are tailored to your personal situation. They also may be able to help you pinpoint the roots of your fears and provide tools to help you cope better. All the best. Stay strong!"

"Hey there, it sounds like you're dealing with anticipatory anxiety around travel experiences, and I understand how challenging that can be. It's great that you're actively looking for ways to manage it.

One of the things you have identified is the source of your anxiety - the change from enjoyable travels to a distressing experience. So, the first thing could be to try to confront this past trauma. You might delve deeper into what caused you distress during that trip in 2019. Identifying what exactly troubled you can help in finding specific coping mechanisms.

If travel is becoming an anxiety trigger, it could help to start with small trips. Pick a place you're comfortable with, such as a local park or coffee shop. Gradually move to longer distances. And when you're ready, plan a short trip with friends or family.

Plan as much as you can - booking accommodation, transportation, doing daily itinerary etc. can give you some sense of control and can reduce worry about the unknown. Also, ensure that you've got everything you need before you leave - not just physically (like tickets, money, etc.) but emotionally as well.

Having a personal routine or ritual can also be reassuring. Whether it's a song you play before you leave your house, a book you always bring with you, or a lucky charm you carry — these little personal rituals can give you a sense of stability even when you're travelling.

Lastly, dealing with such anxiety independently can be tough, and you wouldn't have to do it alone. Reach out to a mental health professional if things seem too tough to handle. Remember, it's okay to seek help, and there are people who are trained to provide the tools needed to navigate your feelings.

Best of luck, and remember to be kind to yourself during this journey. You're doing great!"

"Hey, it sounds like you're wrestling with some serious anxiety related to travel. Honestly, it's completely okay and more common than you might think. The anxious anticipation before the trip can indeed be overwhelming but it's great that you navigate through it well once you're on the trip. 

In dealing with this, it might be helpful to start small. Maybe try taking a short trip nearby, possibly even a day trip. You could even consider starting by going alone, which will give you total control over your environment. It might help you regain confidence and ability to enjoy travelling again.

You could also try discussing this with your friends. If they are understanding, they might sympathize with your situation and avoid ""going wild"" when with you. Anxiety has a way of making us feel out of control, so managing the factors we can control may help ease the burden.

Lastly, consider seeking professional help if you haven't already. Therapists are trained to help manage the exact sort of anxiety you're dealing with. They could provide you with tools and strategies that would enable you to cope better. Just remember, it's okay to need help.

Remember to care for yourself, and take things one step at a time. You're already doing a great job by asking for advice and seeking solutions. I hope you regain your love of travelling soon."

My problem is that I'm anxious before the trip happens and during it I'm completely fine. It's gotten better now tho, but not completely cured. Going alone or with friends seems like a mammoth task. Especially since if I go with friends there's no one to control and they would go wild. I know I need to get over this for the future. Any tips?	"Hi there! First of all, thank you for feeling comfortable enough to share your feelings with us. It sounds like you've really been struggling with travel anxiety, and I'm sorry to hear that it's negatively affecting your life. 

Anxiety regarding travelling can stem from various sources, like the fear of the unknown, or maybe some past negative experience associated with travelling, like your 2019 trip you mentioned. But it's important to remember that it's something you can improve with time and the right strategies.

To start with, perhaps try focusing on why you're anxious about travel. Is it the uncertainty, worrying about the journey, or feeling out of control? Identifying the cause can pack a punch against the anxiety itself.

Secondly, start small. Don’t plan a huge trip to start with. A night or two away can be a good way to test the water and build up to a larger trip. 

Thirdly, try visualization. Before your trip, imagine your journey and arrival in detail. Imagine everything going smoothly. This technique can help you to feel more prepared and less anxious.

Lastly, if you feel comfortable enough, you might want to talk to your friends about your anxieties. People who care about you will be able to offer support and reassure you of any concerns you may have.

Remember, it's okay to feel anxious and it's okay to seek help. If you feel you need to, please consider speaking with a mental health professional. They can provide strategies and coping mechanisms that work best for you. You're not alone in this, and there are people ready to help. Take care!"

"Hi there, it sounds like you're dealing with a lot of anxiety around travelling. It's not uncommon to feel this way, especially after a negative experience or a long period of isolation. It's important to take small steps towards your goals.

Firstly, try to figure out what exactly it is about travelling that makes you anxious. Is it the unfamiliarity, potential negative experiences, or being away from a controlled environment? Understanding the root of your anxiety can help you counteract it logically.

Secondly, start small. Plan short trips to places that are familiar and comfortable to you. As your confidence builds, gradually increase the duration and distance of your trips.

Thirdly, plan for contingencies. This means having a plan B in case something doesn't go as planned. This could provide you with a sense of control and help reduce your overall anxiety.

Lastly, consider seeking professional help to talk through your experiences and feelings. They can provide specific methods and techniques to help manage your anxiety. Remember that it's okay to not be okay, and asking for help is a positive step towards healing."

It sounds like you're dealing with a fair amount of anticipatory anxiety related to travel. This is common, especially when our routines have been disrupted -- like they have been with the Covid-19 pandemic. 

Often, our minds build up scary scenarios about all the things that could go wrong. Try redirecting your focus to the elements of traveling that you enjoy - maybe it's the scenery, the culture, or the food. Train your mind to expect positive experiences.

I'd also suggest trying mindfulness exercises like deep breathing or meditation to help manage your anxiety levels. This could prove helpful not only before a trip, but also during it! Practicing mindfulness can increase your ability to switch off the ‘anxiety mode’ and help you focus on enjoying the present moment.

Maybe start with smaller trips to places closer to home, gradually building up to longer trips. This might help increase your comfort level with travel. And regarding trips with friends, communication is key. Talk to them about your anxieties and set boundaries that you’re all comfortable with.

Remember that it's absolutely okay to get professional help. A therapist or counselor can work with you on coping strategies and help navigate you through this.

You're on the right path by acknowledging the issue and seeking advice. It's okay to take small steps and don't forget to celebrate your progress!"
"[32y/o, white female] -- Im sorry for this little rant here but i dont know what else to do… I have been clinically depressed since i was 14 and although i am sure i have had happy moments or times when everything didnt feel so dark i keep coming back to the same place emotionally. 
I wanted to try journaling or smth like that but i felt so dumb so i came to this community to just type my thoughts. When i was younger no matter how hard things were academically, sociallly or emotionally my mom was there but she has been diagnosed with dementia for 2 years now and i lost the one person that i could talk to freely. 
I have seen been kind of parenting my dad and while im away in uni he is all alone so im scared for him all the time because he doesnt take care of himself and he has a serious heart condition. 
Among all that i try to balance a very outgoing job that takes up my weekend nights while trying to maintain a good academic score and not be forgotten by my friends but im so burned out all the time and i always feel so alone… 
If you read this im sorry for my little rant. I hope it gets better for all of us."	"Hey there, 

Firstly, there's no need to apologize for reaching out and expressing your feelings. This is what this space is for. I just wanted to say, I hear you and what you're experiencing sounds really challenging. Balancing responsibilities while dealing with major life changes can feel overwhelming for anyone. 

Your mom's diagnosis and the situation with your dad sounds particularly tough, not just emotionally but also practically. Don't forget that it's okay to ask for help, and there are many resources available for people who are taking care of their parents. The stress and anxiety you're feeling is totally valid. 

Don't feel dumb about trying different coping strategies like journaling, it's a proven way to help manage feelings and improve mental health. If it doesn't work for you, that's okay too - everyone is different. 

Trying to balance all of these major life pressures with school and a social life is not an easy task. It's essential to prioritize self-care because burnout could make things worse. Can you perhaps talk to your professors about what you're dealing with so they could potentially provide some flexibility or resources? Your well-being is the most important thing. 

Remember, it's okay to take time for yourself and you may be surprised at how understanding people can be when you share your struggles. And most importantly, you're not alone. 

It does get better, hang in there. Sending strength your way."

First of all, you don't have to apologize for sharing your feelings here. That's what this community is for and you're not alone in your experiences. Living with depression and caring for a loved one with dementia can be incredibly overwhelming, let alone whilst trying to balance studies, work, and social life. But remember, you are stronger than you give yourself credit for.

Trying out journaling can indeed be helpful. It might feel awkward at first, but just like anything new, you'll get accustomed over time, and it could become a great outlet for your thoughts and feelings. 

As for your dad, perhaps you could explore some local resources that might provide support? It's amazing how caring you are toward him, but remember it's essential to take care of yourself too. You shouldn't have to shoulder all these burdens alone. Reach out to your university's guidance counselor or mental health services and see if they can offer any support.

No one is required to be ""strong"" all the time. It's okay to ask for help, accept it, and sometimes just let yourself feel those hard feelings. Surrounding yourself with understanding friends or folks from the community can be comforting too--don't feel like you need to burden them, they are there for you, just like you'd be there for them. 

I sincerely hope things get better for you soon. Take each day at a time, remember to take care of yourself, and just keep reminding yourself-you're a lot stronger than you think you are!"

"Hey there, I've read every word of your post and the first thing I want to remind you is that it's completely okay to feel the way you do - it’s alright to vent and express your feelings because we all need an outlet sometimes. I see that you're dealing with a lot, and these are all quite challenging issues. It sounds like you've been strong for a long time, and it's okay to admit that things are hard. Also, remember that mental and emotional fatigue is just as real and serious as physical fatigue. 

With all the tasks you've been managing - uni, your job, your father's care, and keeping on top of everything else, it sounds like you are under significant pressure and stress. Whenever you can, be sure to prioritise self-care, whether that's simply taking a few moments for yourself, meditating, or engaging in any activity you enjoy - you deserve it. 

Have you considered seeking professional help for your mental health issues? A therapist could provide you with some tools and techniques to help you cope with all of this. Also, is there anyone around you with whom you can share some of your load? Friends, other family members, or maybe even community resources? It can be genuinely helpful to have somebody step in even for small tasks, and oftentimes people are more willing to help than we realise. 

This is a caring community that's here for you, so never hesitate to share your thoughts and feelings. You aren't alone in this, and things will get better. Stay strong."

First and foremost, don't feel sorry for expressing what you're going through. That's why we're all here, isn't it? We're here to support each other, share our problems, and find solutions together. Depression is very real and tough – I can see that you're going through a lot right now. Writing your thoughts can sometimes help when you feel like you're drowning, so keep doing that if you find it helpful.

It's hard to be young and have to carry so much on your shoulders, especially parent-like duties and worrying about their health. Remember, it's okay to feel tired and overwhelmed. But you're not alone in this. There are also professional and supportive services that can help you in these situations, both for you dealing with depression and for caregiving support for your parents.

It seems you have a lot on your plate with your work, university, and social life. It's okay to let something go or reduce the intensity when it becomes too much. And it's always beneficial to take some time for yourself. Self-care is not selfish, it's necessary.

Remember, it's okay to ask for help. We may not be professionals, but we're here to hear you out and make you feel less alone. And don't hesitate to seek professional help if you think you need it.

I'm sending you virtual hugs and strength right now to get through this tough period. It's tough, but you're tougher. Stay strong."

Sounds like you're carrying a big load but remember, it's okay to ask for help and take some weight off your shoulders. Perhaps you could consider seeking support from a professional therapist or counselor, if you're not already doing so. It's truly commendable that you're actively seeking ways to manage your mental health and writing your thoughts down is a great start. It sure is difficult at times, but remember, you're stronger than you think. Take care.

"Hey there, first of all, I want to acknowledge that you're being incredibly brave in sharing your emotions and struggles with us. You're dealing with some tremendous challenges at the moment and it's okay to feel overwhelmed. I also wanted to commend you for seeking help and for using writing as a form of expression and a tool for understanding your feelings, this is actually a really healthy way of dealing with emotions. 

The emotions you're facing are tough and complex, but you're not alone, even if it feels that way. It seems you are carrying a lot of responsibilities and it's important to remember that it's okay to ask for assistance. If possible, reaching out to a local support network (support groups, a counselor, friends) or even university services could provide some relief. 

In terms of dealing with your feelings of loneliness and burnout, I would recommend considering activities that nourish your mental health. Whether it's exercise, reading, meditation or something new - these all can give you an outlet to recharge both physically and mentally - self care is very important in stressful situations. 

Lastly, please remember that there isn't a 'right' or 'wrong' way to cope with these stresses. You're doing your best given the circumstances. We are here to listen and to provide support where we can. Keep reaching out, you never know who might be able to offer the exact comfort or advice that you need."

Firstly, I'd like to express that you're incredibly brave to share your feelings and struggles here. Remember, your feelings are always valid and important. Dealing with the different pressures, such as caring for your dad and juggling a demanding job with studies, can be a lot to handle. It's okay to feel overwhelmed. 

Depression is a relentless beast, and I think it's essential that you get professional resources to help you deal with it. It's not a battle you have to fight alone. If you're not already seeing a mental health professional, consider reaching out to one. If accessing a therapist isn't feasible, there are other resources like free online counselling or mental health hotlines which are really helpful.

Feeling lonely is difficult, but remember this community is here for you. For your dad, perhaps look into home health care or adult day care options. That can take some stress off you and provide him the care he needs.

For your job and academics, is there any way you could dial it back a bit? Your health and mental well-being should always come first, so if it's necessary, please consider asking for help from your professors and employer if that’s an option.

Journaling can be a great outlet, even though it feels a little silly at first. Jot down your feelings, fears, joy - anything. It might provide a small respite.

Lastly, remember that you're not alone in this fight, and things will get better. Your strength and resilience are commendable, and I believe that you have the capability to overcome this. Here's sending virtual hugs and strength from this side of the internet. Be kind to yourself."

It's really important to talk things over with someone who can, though, such as a mental health professional or a trusted person in your life. Depression and caregiver's stress are a lot to handle alone, and you shouldn't have to.

Writing your thoughts online definitely counts as a form of journaling, so you're on the right track there! Getting it all out can sometimes relieve a bit of the burden. You're not alone in this and there are people who want to help, including your friends and those of us in this community. 

Even if your circumstances don't change drastically, remember that it's okay to set boundaries, to prioritize your wellbeing, and to ask for help when you need it. You're incredibly strong, but that doesn't mean you need to shoulder everything by yourself. Your feelings are valid and, while things are tough right now, it's okay to take things one step at a time.

Please reach out to people who can offer support. There are a number of resources out there, many of which are accessible 24/7, and full of people trained to listen and help."

Firstly, I'm really sorry to hear that you're going through such a tough time. It sounds like you've had a lot on your plate for a long time, and it's completely understandable that you're feeling burned out and alone. Dealing with long-term depression along with other life responsibilities and struggles can be truly overwhelming. 
It's really brave of you to reach out and share what you're going through, even if it's just a ""rant"" – sometimes we just need a safe space to let it all out, so don't apologize for sharing your feelings!

Regarding journaling, it’s not as dumb as you may think. It can be an excellent tool to understand and manage your emotions better. You don't need to be eloquent or special in way you choose to journal, simply writing your thoughts can be very therapeutic.

As for dealing with your mom's condition and taking care of your dad, perhaps you would find it helpful to connect with support groups or communities specifically created for caregivers. They could provide particular advice, resources and emotional support from people who truly understand what you're going through.

And though it seems impossible to manage, remember you also need to take care of yourself. Try to make sure you're eating well, getting some exercise, and giving yourself breaks when you can. Small things can make a big difference.

I'm glad you're reaching out here. This is a challenging journey, but you aren't alone in it. Have you considered exploring some professional help too like therapy or counselling? They could provide valuable coping strategies tailored specifically for your situation.

Please remember, it's okay to feel this way and it's okay to ask for help. And while I'm just a stranger on the internet, I'm sending along lots of positive thoughts and energy your way. Keep going on, you've got strength within you."

There's no need to apologize for expressing how you're feeling, after all, that's what this community is for.

Balance is important, as well as self care. Consider small ways you can lessen your stress and prioritize your well-being, such as engaging in hobbies, gently exercising, or talking to a trusted friend. Expressing your feelings in writing can be therapeutic, and you're already doing that here. Don't discourage yourself from journaling. It's not dumb, and can be very beneficial.

Regarding your parents, it might be beneficial to look into resources that can help them. Please do some research on support services that could help your mom, and perhaps seek out a trusted neighbor to check-in on your dad while you're away.

Finally, please consider professional help if you feel ready. A mental health professional could provide a safe space to unravel your feelings and experiences and offer effective coping strategies.

Remember, you're not alone in this. There's a whole community here willing to lend an ear when you need it. Don't hesitate to reach out. Things will get better. Keep going."
"[32y/o, white female] -- So I have decided to well distance myself from most of my friends. The reason why is even though i seem to be getting better. The people around me keep getting hurt because of me. But there’s not reason for me to get rid of my friends that I don’t see in person anymore so there’s no reason to worry about them because they did seem to get hurt. 
     The reason why the people around me are getting hurt is because of me. Now that I have show more emotion I tend to lose control over my emotions and when I do I try to control it but it just makes me angry. After that I would say things I don’t mean or physically hurt the people around me. I don’t mind the looks I get but I don’t want to hurt the people I care about I just want to protect them but if I can’t even stop myself from hurting then the how am I supposed to stop others. 
     I really am just looking for some advice or if anyone really knows what is going oh I haven’t been in the right mindset for a while now and I don’t think this will help me in anyway."	"It sounds like you're going through a difficult time, but I'm really proud of you for reaching out and looking for advice. Self-awareness is a significant first step to improving mental health and managing emotions. 

It's normal to feel overwhelmed when you start to allow yourself to feel and express emotions that you've kept hidden away. However, it's essential not to let them control your actions to the point where they harm yourself and others around you.

And though you might not see it now, distancing yourself could be a protective step. However, isolation is not a long-term solution. And remember, your friends care about you and want to support you.

I strongly recommend seeking professional help - a licensed therapist or a counselor can help you understand these emotions and give you tools to manage them effectively. It sounds like it might be hard, but reaching out to mental health resources and finding a good support network (both in-person and online) is important in your journey.

I'm unable to provide you with the exact help you might need, but please take these words as encouragement to seek trained professionals who can. You don't have to go through this alone, and things can get better with time and help."

"Hey there, thank you for sharing this with us. Firstly, it's okay to struggle sometimes and lets remember that recognizing how your actions affect others is a big first step towards change. 

It sounds like you're dealing with a lot of emotional turbulence. Emotions can be overwhelming, but they're a part of who we are. It's okay to feel, but it's also important how we express those feelings. Harming yourself or others is never the answer. 

Consider therapy, if you haven't already. A mental health professional can provide effective strategies to manage and express your emotions in healthier ways. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, for instance, could be beneficial since it focuses on managing problematic thinking patterns.

Also, engaging in activities that help channel your emotional overflow like journaling, meditation, physical exercise or creative outlets like painting, music or dance might be of help.

Remember, healing isn't a linear process. It's okay to have setbacks, what counts is willingness to change and keep progressing. If you ever feel unsafe, please reach out for immediate support. You're not alone in this, and your desires to improve your emotional management is a very brave step forward."

These can channel your frustration and anger into something less harmful.

Consider seeking professional help. Speak to a therapist or a counselor who can provide a better understanding of your feelings and provide you the tools to better manage them. Don't underestimate the power of professional help.

Lastly, practice self-love and patience. You're not alone in this journey and everyone takes their own time to heal and grow. Try techniques like mindfulness and meditation to help control your emotional responses.

Please do reach out to a mental health professional in your area to better understand and deal with your emotions. Remember, it's OK to ask for help."

"Hey there, I'm really sorry to hear that you're going through this. It sounds like a tough situation. It's good that you're aware of the impact your emotions are having on those around you, awareness is the first step in making a change. Please remember that looking out for your mental health is of paramount importance. Seek professional help if you can. Therapist, psychiatrists, support groups, hotlines, there are several resources out there. Learning about mindfulness and discovering coping strategies can often help with managing emotions.

It's perfectly fine to distance yourself from people to protect them. It's also important to communicate to them about what you're going through so that they can understand and offer support.

Emotions can be really hard to understand, and sometimes they can feel too big or too strong. Learning how to handle them is a process, remember you're not alone in this.

One last thing: Anger is usually a secondary emotion. It often covers up other feelings like sadness, fear, or shame. Try to take a moment to identify if there’s another emotion beneath your anger. Reflecting on it might give you more insight about how you're feeling.

Stay strong, remember that seeking help is a sign of strength, not weakness. You're clearly doing your best to navigate through this situation, and that's really something. Make sure to give yourself credit for the steps you're taking."

Many people struggle with addictions and habits that they wish to break but find it to be a difficult cycle.

There are many healthy coping mechanisms to addiction, but usually, the first step is understanding your triggers. These may be stressful situations, negative emotions, or even certain individuals that you need to learn to manage or avoid proactively.

Practicing mindfulness and self-awareness can also be beneficial. The more you understand yourself and your addictive behaviors, the better equipped you'll be to face and eventually overcome them.

First of all, thank you for having the courage to share your story. It's not easy to openly talk about such personal issues. Please remember that everyone faces different challenges in life and you are not at all alone in this. What you're dealing with sounds really tough but I want you to know that it's possible to overcome it.

Living with addictive tendencies can be exhausting because it feels like a never-ending cycle. Although I can't offer professional advice, I'd strongly encourage you to seek help from a mental health professional if you haven't done so already. They can provide direction and guidance tailored specifically to you.

In general, there are a few strategies that might help manage addictive tendencies: 

1) Identifying triggers: What prompts these addictive patterns? Knowing this can be a key step in managing these tendencies. 
2) Finding healthy outlets: This could be any form of physical activity, creative hobbies like painting, playing music, or even simply meditating.
3) Stay connected: Make sure to maintain a strong support network. This could be friends, family or support groups.

Remember, everyone's journey with addiction is unique. So it's okay if things take time and the path isn't always smooth. Lastly, don't be too hard on yourself. We all are human and we all have areas that we can improve upon.

Take care of yourself and know that you are not alone in your struggle!"

It sounds like you're experiencing quite a challenging time and my heart goes out to you. It's important to remember that you aren't alone - many people struggle with addictive tendencies, which can be especially tough when they stem from difficult childhood dynamics as it seems to be the case for you. 

One key suggestion would involve seeking professional support. For instance, a psychologist or a licensed counselor will be more equipped to unravel the root cause of your repetitive cycle, and they can give more personalized strategies tailored to your needs. 

In the meantime, do consider trying out activities that cultivate mindfulness, such as yoga or meditation. This can help you develop more self-awareness, allowing you to recognize when an obsession or addiction could be forming, and equip you with tools to manage it. 

Additionally, join support groups - they can provide a safe space to share experiences and might offer you the comfort of not feeling 'alone' in this journey. 

While it doesn't solve everything, remember to show yourself some kindness, too. It sounds like you're doing your best, and that's all anyone can ask for. You are more than your addiction tendencies. You are strong, resilient, and capable of change. But please ensure you consider seeking professional help."

Addictive tendencies can often stem from a need to fill some kind of emotional void, and those tendencies can latch onto whatever is available. It's a hard cycle to break, but I believe in your ability to overcome it. Consider looking into therapy, especially Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT), it can really help change the way you think about and cope with situations.

Also, look into healthy hobbies - painting, drawing, hiking, reading. There might be something out there that you'll love and that can help you better manage your addictive behaviors. Replacement strategies like this often work well, as it's a way to channel your energies into something positive.

Stay strong, and remember to never hesitate getting professional help. It's always okay to ask for assistance when it comes to your mental health."
"[32y/o, white female] --      So ima just keep this short, but most of my life I’ve never gotten attention from my parents.

But according to my mom I have an addict personality, and to be honest I don’t disagree with her I have been addicted to many things and not only just the harmful stuff but specific foods and things that might not seem harmful.

From what you've shared, it's clear you're dealing with some complex feelings and struggles. Kudos to you for reaching out and talking about it - that's brave. Firstly, remember that no one is defined by their past. Our life experiences can shape us, but they are not us. It's okay not to be okay, and it's challenging to deal with addiction tendencies.

Have you considered seeking help from a professional, such as a therapist? They can provide techniques to manage unwanted behavior and coping mechanisms. Cognitive-behavioral therapy, for instance, can be particularly helpful in re-directing addictive tendencies.

It's also crucial to build positive habits and routines. Find an activity you are passionate about and channel your energy toward it. Whether that's exercise, art, volunteering, or anything else, make a point to include it in your routine. It'll serve as a positive distraction and also bring you joy and fulfillment.

Lastly, always remember that reaching out like this is a sign of strength, not weakness. There's a whole community here who understands and is here for you. You're not alone in this struggle.

Stay strong!"

"Hey there, I'm really sorry to hear that you're struggling with this. It sounds really tough to continuously grapple with different forms of addiction. I commend you for your self-awareness and desire to break free from these patterns. You're definitely not alone in dealing with this. 

There are many resources available that cater specifically to addiction recovery, such as different support groups and professionals who specialize in addiction psychology. Also, it may be helpful to find new activities that engage your mind and body positively. Try to find something you love doing – perhaps art, working out, dancing, or cooking. You'd be surprised how these relatively 'simple' activities could provide a sense of accomplishment and serve as a positive outlet. Stick around, reach out, and remember that your struggles don't define your worth. Take care!"

"Sorry to hear you're struggling, but please know that you're not alone. I think many people can relate to the feelings you're experiencing, especially when we've had a challenging upbringing. It's important to know that it's okay to have a lot of emotions about it - and it can take time to navigate through this. 

It's clear that you're self-aware and recognize the patterns you're experiencing - that's a positive step. It's good to identify that you tend to form addictive behaviors and it may be beneficial for you to explore psychological reasons behind that with a professional therapist. 

You may want to consider cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). It could help to reframe your perspective which could potentially break the cycle of addictive behaviors. Speaking to a counselor or a therapist could also be hugely beneficial on your journey.

One piece of advice I can offer is try to turn your addictive personality into something beneficial. Maybe you could get 'addicted' to something like exercise, reading, artistic pursuits, or learning a new skill.

Remember, professional help is key and I would strongly advise you to seek it. There are many addiction counsellors and therapists out there who would be more than willing to help you out. You are not alone in this. Stay strong!"

First of all, kudos to you for reaching out about your struggle. It's a brave and necessary step towards feeling better. Sounds like you're taking those steps, even if they're small ones. They all count, right? Plus, progress isn't linear and there will be ups and downs but that doesn't mean you're not getting there.

You mentioned that you had a good conversation with someone that made you happy. That's truly wonderful, keep interacting with others. Human connection is invaluable. 

Your hesitation about visiting your psychiatrist is totally understandable, fear can often hold us back. But keep in mind, they're there to help you. They're experts in guiding us through our thoughts and they could potentially provide alternative medications that could aid in achieving better stability.

It definitely sounds like you're getting stronger, and you're not as down as you were previously which is great progress. Remember, your English is not an issue when expressing your pain, your feelings are valid and need to be heard. 

Keep going at your own pace. Every step forward, no matter how small, is a victory. Surround yourself with people who support you and try to find a little joy in each day. Everyone's journey is different, so don't feel pressure to 'get better' in any specific timeframe.

I just wanted to reach out and say I'm really impressed with the way you're working on handling your situation. Slow, steady changes are often the most beneficial for long-term well-being. I also wanted to mention that it's completely OK and normal to have ups and downs. It's heartening to see your positivity and strength in admitting it was a 9/10 last week and it's a 4/10 now. Remember even the smallest positive moments, like a good conversation, can make a difference.

It's often tough to face situations that make us nervous or fearful, like visiting a psychiatrist, and it's also OK that you didn't go this time. Maybe next time, consider a friend or family member to go with you for support if that's an option. 

Remember, it's absolutely okay to reach out whenever you're feeling low. Dealing with this alone can be tough but you're not alone in this. There are many people out there, including folks here on this forum, who care and are ready to listen. Take your journey at your own pace, with grace to yourself along the way. You're doing great!"

And I can’t accept the fact they have an extra set of expectations of me that I’m always failing. 

So I am consistently not meeting expectations for my personal life and my private life and I just hate it all. IT ALL FEELS LIKE WORK. 

I need help. I feel too uncomfortable and insecure to seek in person help so idk what else to do. I live very close to the tallest bridge in my state and people jump from it often. I just want to be another number for that jump list. I want my family to grieve my death for a couple days then just please forget about me. 

Secretly waiting for my parents to pass away, the I feel like I can actually kill myself without causing too much trauma for them. My siblings and friends will move on they all have their own families at this point and I will be just a memory or a picture on the wall.

"[32y/o, white female] -- I have no friends aside from one from primary school who I infrequently catch up with. I really just find most people not to be worth talking to, as I find it hard to connect with many people due to my lack of shared interests and my social anxiety.

However, I often feel lonely and kinda sad especially when I see people who are having a good time with their friends.

I did actually have a weird experience making a friend just recently though, but he's way older than me so it's a bit weird to hang out in person. I noticed he had an interest in something I really liked, and we had this great chat for about 10 minutes. It flowed so smoothly, and it was super passionate. We still message each other every couple of days.

Can anyone else relate to this?"	"Hello there,

Thank you for sharing your feelings with us, showing vulnerability isn't always easy. You're definitely not alone in this boat. There are many others who experience difficulty making connections due to various reasons. The important thing is that you're making an effort to change things up and even expanding your usual circle. Age doesn't necessarily matter when it comes to friendships, as long as both individuals respect and enjoy each other's company. 

Perhaps you can explore some hobbies or interests that you are passionate about? It's often easier to build friendships around shared interests. There could be clubs, classes, or events near you that you might like to be part of.

Also, bear in mind that it's okay to have a small circle of friends. The quality of the relationship is what matters, not the quantity. If you feel that you connect more deeply on a personal level with fewer people, that's completely okay!

If you ever feel the loneliness gets unbearable or you're feeling really down, it could be helpful to speak with a counselor or therapist. They could provide strategies to cope with social anxiety, and other feelings you're experiencing. Don't be hesitant to reach out for professional help if you feel you need it.

Keep being open and reaching out - every step is progress!

Sometimes, it is difficult to find people who share our interest or connect with us on a deeper level. This loneliness can feel overwhelming at times, and seeing others enjoying their social relationships may intensify these feelings.

Social anxiety is a tough barrier to negotiate, but it's not insurmountable. You mentioned you recently made a friend who is quite older, and though it might be a bit weird hanging out in person, consider taking baby steps. Keep up the communication, perhaps engage in shared activities, and let the friendship evolve naturally. 

Remember, age isn’t always a barrier to friendship. Often, friendships with a significant age gap can be rewarding as you both can offer unique perspectives and experiences. 

Also, have you considered joining any groups or clubs that focus on your interests? This could be a good way to meet like-minded people and alleviate some of social anxiety since the focus is more on the shared interest. 

You're not alone in feeling this way and it's a brave step to reach out for support and advice. We're all here cheering for you, and believe you have the capacity to overcome challenges and build satisfying relationships."

Can anyone else relate to this?"	"Hey there, thank you for sharing your experiences and feelings. It can be really tough when you're feeling socially isolated, and it's a pretty brave thing to open up about it. First off, it's completely okay that you don't connect with lots of people. You're not alone in feeling this way, many individuals struggle to find those real, deep connections in their adult life. 

About your recent experience, it's amazing that you've found someone with shared interests. Engaging with them shows great potential in building friendships. Age shouldn't necessarily be a deterrent - friendships can be formed across age groups and you can learn a lot from each other. Don't stress if it feels a little awkward, because all relationships can feel that way in the beginning. 

If you're feeling lonely and it's making you sad, please remember it's okay to reach out to professionals who can help you with strategies to cope. There also might be clubs, community groups or online communities related to your shared interests where you can meet more people. And sometimes, maintaining regular touch with that one old friend could make a lot of difference. 

Your feelings are completely valid - remember, it's quality and not quantity that matters in friendships. But don't hesitate to seek help when needed. Keep reaching out, and take care."

Can anyone else relate to this?"	"Hey there! Can totally relate to what you're going through. It's a struggle, but props to you for being brave and opening up about it. I think it's pretty cool that you found a friend who shares your interest, age really isn't a barrier when it comes to friendship. If you feel comfortable messaging him, maybe you could try going on a friendly outing. Nothing too serious, just hang out somewhere you're both interested in like a museum or a park. 

Meanwhile, social anxiety can make you feel like you're alone, I get that. But pushing yourself out of your comfort zone might allow you to connect with others in ways you never imagined. You never know where you'll find shared interests or experiences. But it's also alright to enjoy your alone time, no need to force friendships if it doesn't feel right. Remember, quality always has the edge over quantity.

Also, consulting a therapist could be beneficial, since they can help you navigate through your feelings of anxiety and provide strategies to manage these feelings. But definitely, keep reaching out to forums like this, continue to voice your emotions, and know that everyone here is rooting for you. Take care and stay strong, friend!"

I want to acknowledge though, that you were able to connect with this older friend. That just goes to show, sometimes age doesn’t matter if we have shared passions. If this relationship feels positive and enriching to you, keep it up! Communication has no age limit. 

It's also okay to only have a few friends or even just one. It's important to find people who truly value you for you. You might consider looking into clubs or online communities that engage in the things you're interested in. You could meet like-minded people there who could end up being long-term friends.

Remember - it's absolutely okay to feel the way you're feeling. Your feelings are valid. But also understand that you've taken a great first step towards socializing more, by looking for advice and expressing yourself openly."

Finding people you connect with deeply can be an uphill task, but remember that quality, not quantity, is more important when it comes to friendships. Have you considered exploring social events or groups dedicated to your interests? This could be a great way to meet like-minded people and potentially form new friendships.

Also, the age of your friend shouldn't necessarily be an issue unless it makes you uncomfortable. Adult friendship come in all forms and ages. If this new friend makes you feel understood, heard, and is respectful, then that friendship is worthwhile.

Always remember, each person deals with social anxiety in their own unique way. It's okay to proceed at a pace that feels comfortable to you. You're not alone, stay strong!"

Shared interests are indeed a wonderful base to form meaningful connections, and age shouldn't necessarily be a barrier if there's mutual respect. What's most important is the connection you feel and the joy you derive from these interactions. 

The anxiety you feel is common too, many individuals face social anxiety, it doesn't make you unfit or a misfit. Perhaps trying to find a club, hobby group, or online community centered around your unique interests may prove helpful. These can be a great avenue to interact with like-minded people without them feeling overwhelming.

It's okay to take your time. You don't need to force yourself into situations or feel the pressure to make quick connections. Remember, it's better to have fewer meaningful relationships than numerous shallow ones.

Keep reaching out here as well. We're all here to support you. You're doing great, take it one step at a time."

Firstly, I want to reassure you: there's absolutely no prerequisite of having a certain number of friends by a certain age. Focus on quality over quantity. And age really is just a number. If you can bond with someone who is older than you over a shared interest, then that's fantastic! You've already shown yourself capable of making a meaningful connection.

As for your social anxiety, consider seeking support from a mental health professional as they could give you practical tools to manage it. Similarly, identifying and pursuing interests that involve social interaction, like joining hobby groups or clubs, could help you find your tribe.

Sure, it can feel lonely at times, especially when it seems everyone else has a bustling social life. But remember, what we see online are highlights, not the everyday reality.

You're not alone in this struggle and reaching out here illustrates your desire to make a change, which is commendable. Just remember, everyone's journey is different, and it's okay if yours doesn't look like others'."

It seems like you're facing a couple of challenges, both with social anxiety and finding people with shared interests. But the key thing here is that you're recognizing these issues and seeking help, which shows that you’re resilient and open to change.

Please remember that it's perfectly fine to have social anxiety; it doesn't make you less of a person. The fact that you were able to connect with someone based on shared interests is a great start, and further proof that you are capable of building meaningful relationships.

Meeting people through common interests can be a wonderful way to overcome social anxieties because it gives you a topic to focus on, rather than the pressure of small talk. So, why not try engaging in activities or joining groups related to your interests? You will naturally come across people who share similar passions, which could lead to new and otherwise unexpected friendships.

Also, remember that friendship isn't bound by age. As long as both of you enjoy each other's company and can support and respect one another, it can lead to a beautiful friendship.

Hang in there and remember to be patient with yourself. Building connections takes time, but each step, however small, brings you closer to your goal."

It's amazing that you found somebody you could connect with recently. Age shouldn't matter as long as there's a common interest and respect. In fact, older friends often bring a different and valuable perspective. 

Furthermore, developing a wider palette of interests can also broaden your social circle. Try to explore new hobbies or activities; you might discover something you truly enjoy. The more you expose yourself to different environments, the higher the chance of meeting someone you connect with. 

Take small steps if you need to, and remember that it's okay to seek professional guidance if your feelings of loneliness persist.
