I live with my parents, who have no idea how bad my depression is. They think my room is messy because I'm lazy, but in reality, I just don't have the strength to clean it.

Being a 32yo girls girl, I mostly struggle with managing my bin, which has resulted in a rat infestation in my room. My parents don't know and I'm scared to tell them in case they get mad. But I don't know how to fix it on my own, especially since I don't do well with things like that. Unfortunately, I need to get my room clean in a week and I just don't know what to do. I've always struggled with cleaning but my depression has made everything so much harder, so I'm very worried that it won't get done in time. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you. Update: Thank you so much for all of your advice. I’m happy to report that although my room isn’t spotless, it’s clean and liveable. Thank you for all of your advice and kind words.	"I'm really sorry to hear that you're going through such a tough time, but I'm really proud of you for reaching out and asking for advice - that is a huge step and you should be congratulated for it. It's incredibly difficult to manage depression and sensory issues on your own and having a supportive community to turn to can really help in challenging situations like this. 

You're not alone in this and there are things you can do to start reclaiming your space. The rat infestation is a serious health issue, so it might be a good idea to involve a professional pest control service. Given your sensory issues, you might find it less overwhelming if someone else can take care of that part for you.

Cleaning can be quite the task when you're battling depression, however it can be made less daunting if you break it down to smaller tasks. Start with something simple like picking up clothes off the floor one day, the next day you could clear out the bin and so on. Don't put too much pressure on yourself and remember every little helps.

Remember, It's okay to ask your parents for help. They may not fully understand what you're going through, but they might be more understanding and supportive than you expect. 

Please continue to talk about it, whether here or with your mental health professional. It might also be a good idea to get professional mental health support if you're not already doing so.

Congratulations on the progress you made so far, keep going! I’m proud of you, it’s always one step at a time.

"I'm really sorry to hear about what you're going through, it sounds incredibly tough. It's great that you're reaching out though, that's a crucial step in the right direction. First thing though, if you haven't already, it might be beneficial to speak with a mental health professional. They're the experts and can provide proper strategies to deal with depression.

Now regarding the room situation, you're not alone in this. A lot of people struggle with cleaning, especially when low mood and sensory issues play a part. Here are some tips to help get you started:

1) Try not to look at the whole task at once. It's overwhelming and can make it seem impossible. Instead, break it down into smaller tasks. Maybe today you can only handle emptying a small portion of the bin. That's okay. It's still progress.

2) Physical clutter can often represent emotional clutter, and dealing with the physical can help with the emotional. Keep that in mind and remember that every bit of progress is a step in the right direction.

3) Open up to a close friend or family member if you feel comfortable doing so. You may be surprised at the support they're willing to provide. They may even be willing to help you clean, taking away some of the burden.

4) Lastly, professional pest control might be a necessity in your situation. If you have a rat infestation, they can help take care of it and offer advice on prevention in the future. 

Remember, it's ok to ask for help. It's never as bad as it seems, and there are always solutions. One step at a time. You're stronger than you know, and you can handle this. I wish you the best."

"Hi there, first and foremost, take a deep breath. I understand the immense pressure you're under, especially having to deal with depression and sensory issues. It's tough, and your feelings are valid.

Let's address one issue at a time. For the rats, do consider contacting a pest control service. It's their expertise, and they'll be able to deal with it efficiently and safely. As for reaching out to them, if you feel uncomfortable doing so, perhaps you could ask a friend or another family member to assist. 

When it comes to cleaning your space, break it down into small tasks. It can be as simple as clearing a small corner of your room. Set manageable goals for each day so it doesn't seem too overwhelming; even 15 minutes a day can make a difference. Remember, progress is progress, no matter how small. 

Also, don't hesitate to seek professional help for your mental health. If not a therapist, there are numerous helplines that can provide emotional support at challenging times like these. It might also be relieving to share your feelings with your parents; you might be surprised by their understanding and support.

It's excellent to see the progress you've made in handling this situation. Please remember, it's okay to ask for help, and taking care of your mental health should always be a priority. Be kind to yourself. We're here for you."

I'm so sorry to hear what you're going through right now, but please know that you're not alone and there are understanding individuals ready to lend support. It must feel so challenging, but let's break this down into smaller manageable parts.

Firstly, about the rat infestation - it's essential to deal with it as it poses a health hazard. You could engage a professional pest control service, they are trained to handle these situations. If that seems too overwhelming, perhaps confide in a friend who could assist with the process.

Next, let's talk about cleaning up at your own pace. You mentioned you have a week, so it's not an immediate pressure. Divide your room into sections and dedicate each day to cleaning one section at a time. If sounds or sensations make cleaning difficult for you, you might want to invest in earplugs and gloves which can help make the process less distressful.

As for your mental health, it's important to seek professional help. Your general health care provider can refer you to a mental health professional. They can provide strategies and treatments for managing depression.

Remember, it's okay to ask for help, and it's okay to struggle. You're doing your best, and that's what matters. Remember to take breaks and treat yourself kindly during this process. You're so much stronger than you think!"

"Hey there, I'm really sorry to hear that you're feeling this way, but you’re seriously not alone. First and foremost, take a deep breath and know that it’s okay to feel overwhelmed. It sounds like you're in a very tough situation right now, and I want you to know that seeking help both from professionals and from your support network is very important. 

Next, let's address the cleaning aspect. When we're overwhelmed and depressed, cleaning tasks can feel insurmountable. Take it one step at a time, and maybe even consider breaking it down into smaller tasks. One day you could focus on just removing trash, the next could be about cleaning surfaces and so on. There's also no shame in asking for help, whether it's from a friend or even a professional cleaning service if that's within your means.

Regarding your parents, it might be worthwhile to have an honest conversation with them about your depression and how it’s affecting you. They might not understand fully, but sometimes it can help to let people know you're struggling so they can offer support in whatever way they can.

Remember, it's okay to need help and it's okay to ask for it. One step at a time, one day at a time. I'm really glad to hear you're feeling a bit better and that your room is more liveable now. Keep going, you're doing amazing!"

Creating a manageable cleaning routine might be a good place to start.

Whether that's dedicating 15 minutes per day, or tackling one section of the room at a time, it can make the task feel much less overwhelming. 

However, there's also no shame in reaching out to professional cleaners to help with this specific task. Sometimes, a fresh start can make maintaining cleanliness in the future less daunting. If you decide to go this route, there are discrete and professional cleaning services designed to handle this type of situation.  

In terms of the rat infestation, you should contact a local pest control service. They're professionals and equipped to handle this situation safely and effectively.

Don't forget to continue seeing mental health professionals who can guide and support you in managing your depression. You're not alone in this, there are many people who want to help.

I'm really sorry to hear about what you're going through. Depression can be a huge burden and it understandably can make the most simple of tasks seem like a mountain to climb. First off, remind yourself that it's okay to have difficult days or weeks due to your depression and sensory issues. You're not alone in this struggle.

Now, let's approach the cleaning of your room in fractions. Break down the entire task into small apparent goals, it might seem less daunting this way. Start with maybe clearing the bin, then the space around the bin, and gradually the entire room. 

Given the rat problem, it may be helpful to reach out for professional pest control support. It could be really helpful to solve the immediate issue of the infestation.

In terms of sharing with your parents, if you feel scared or uncomfortable, perhaps you might write them a letter explaining your situation? They might be more understanding than you anticipate. Expression can be cathartic and it's a first step in seeking support.

Most importantly, let's not forget about your mental health. Can you reach out to a mental health professional for assistance? You're dealing with some heavy stuff right now, and the support of a professional could be a big help.

Remember, it's okay to ask for and accept help, everyone faces some tough time and it's okay to seek support. Take it one day at a time. Sending you strength and positive vibes your way.

P.S Congrats on your progress so far! Pat yourself on the back for the cleaning you've done already. Small steps can lead to big changes. Hang in there! :)

You're facing a tough situation and it's commendable that you're reaching out for help. Here's some advice for you:

1. The first step is always the hardest. So take a moment to prepare yourself mentally before you begin. 
2. Break down the cleaning process into manageable tasks. Focus on one thing at a time - say tackling the rubbish bin first. Bag up everything, arrange for it to be taken out. Do it at your own pace, no need to rush. 
3. Listen to calm music or an audiobook while you're working; this might help distract you from the sensory overload.
4. If the rat infestation is too much for you to handle, it may be best to hire a professional. There are experts who can make this problem go away and you don't need to tell your parents the exact reason why you're hiring them.
5. Open up to your parents about your depression if you feel safe doing so. It's possible they might be more understanding and supportive than you expect. Even if you don't give them the full picture, you might tell them you've been having a tough time and need their help with something. 
6. Lastly, don't forget to reward yourself after each task you finish, even if it's just with a short break. You're doing a big, important thing!

I hope this helps! And remember, it's okay to ask for help. You're not alone in this."

"Hi there, firstly, I'd like to apologize because the situation you're going through must not be easy, and yet here you are, reaching out and looking for ways to alleviate it. That is commendable and I admire your bravery. Let me assure you that you are not alone and it's perfectly okay to ask for help. 

Depression can indeed make the simplest tasks feel overwhelming. Please know that your feelings are valid and that it's okay to struggle. 

When it comes to your living space, it might help to tackle it bit by bit. Hypothetically, dedicate a small amount of time each day, say 15 minutes, where you will clean just one tiny area of your room. For example, one part of the floor or the top of a desk. Remember, baby steps are okay. 

Another possible idea could be to ask for help from your parents. It may feel scary to approach them about this, but they could potentially be more helpful than you think. Not in telling them about your depression, if you're not ready, but in asking them for assistance with your room. If you're worried about their reactions, you could simply explain that you've been feeling particularly overwhelmed and you could use their help. 

Lastly, don't hesitate to seek professional help. If you feel comfortable, you might consider reaching out to a mental health professional for support. They can provide tools and strategies to help manage your symptoms, and create a safe space for you to talk about your experiences. 

Coming here and asking for help is a huge step and you should be proud of yourself. I hope some of these suggestions can be of help to you. Remember, take it one day at a time, you're doing great."
My dad just died and my mom wants me to hang out with her all the time. I've never liked doing casual things with her, and I'm very independent. Being a 32yo girls girl, I don't know how to tell her to leave me alone. The best relationship we ever had was when I lived in another state. I moved back because of my dad, but now he's gone. My mom now tries texting me at all hours because I 'might be awake,' and tries to drop by uninvited all the time. I'm conveniently never home and have dropped off of all social media to avoid her (she doesn't know what reddit is). Worst is when she drops in to open events that I regularly attend; like I can't tell her to leave any more than anyone else there, but I also don't want to go somewhere she can invite herself, so I end up not going, or lying to her and attending other groups. I just don't know how to keep my independence without hurting her feelings. I get that she's lonely, but I don't want to be her go-to person. Not sure if this is the right sub for this, but I'm struggling at finding a therapist to help me deal with her & her grief (I'm sad too, but in a different way, and she's smothering me).	"I'm so sorry to hear about your situation - it sounds like you're dealing with a lot right now. Grief can affect people in different, and sometimes unexpected, ways. It sounds like your mom is reaching out in response to her own grief, but at the same time it's important that you have your own space to grieve and heal as well.

Finding a balance between supporting your mom and asserting your own needs may be complicated, but it's not impossible. It's okay to set boundaries - for instance, letting her know the times when you're available and when you're not. You might also suggest other outlets for support: joining a bereavement group, seeing a therapist, getting involved in activities she enjoys, etc. to help her build a more varied support network.

As for you, do you have other outlets for your own grief? It's important to have emotional support that's separate from the support you might provide for your mom. Friends, family members, support groups, or seeing a therapist could be beneficial.

Remember, it's okay to take care of yourself. You can't pour from an empty cup. Take care."

"Hey, I can only imagine how tough and complicated this situation must be for you. It's clear that you don't want to hurt your mom while also asserting your independence and boundaries - a challenge indeed.

One approach could be to have a frank conversation with her about your need for autonomy, as well as your intention to help her find additional support networks (like neighborhood clubs, grief counseling, or group hobbies). This would show that you're not distancing yourself out of resentment or anger, but rather to maintain your wellness and help her develop her own support (which, in the long run, is healthier for both of you).

By addressing it in a caring manner, you'd also be giving her a chance to work on her own coping mechanisms, rather than relying solely on you for emotional support. 

Remember, it's not wrong to look after your own mental health and establish boundaries. It’s essential for a healthy relationship. It may prove beneficial to seek therapy or counseling for yourself as well to navigate these complex emotions.

Regarding finding a therapist, you might explore services like BetterHelp or Talkspace, which can connect you with a counselor online. You'd be surprised how many therapists specialize in grief and family dynamics."

"Hey there, 

I'm really sorry to hear about your circumstances. Losing a loved one is tough, and can upend everything we think we know about life, and about ourselves. It's clear this situation is causing you a lot of stress, so it's great you're seeking advice - that's a really positive first step. 

Taking care of ourselves is one of the most important things we can do after a significant loss, and you're entitled to prioritize your own needs at this time. Boundaries are a healthy part of any relationship, and even though it might be difficult, it might be necessary to communicate with your mom about how you're feeling. 

One thing you could consider is writing her a letter. This way, you can express your feelings and your needs without interruption or immediate reaction. Be honest, but gentle. Explain how this constant interaction is making you feel and offer up some solutions. 

You might arrange specific times to spend together, giving both of you something to look forward to. Also, assure her it's not about being distant from her or not loving her, but more about needing a bit of space to yourself.

Finding a therapist will definitely be a huge help. Online services might be a good solution, especially during this time when many in-person resources are not available. Depending on where you live, there might be some local resources that offer online therapy. 

Finally, try to remember that everyone grieves in their own way and she may not realize how her behavior is affecting you. In her state of grief and loneliness, she might simply be clinging to the person she sees as a lifeline. This situation is tough for both of you, and communication is the key to finding a middle ground. 

Take care, you're not alone in dealing with a tough situation like this - there's lot of resources out there that can help."

I'm really sorry to hear about your situation, it sounds incredibly challenging. Firstly, it's important to acknowledge your feelings - they are valid, regardless of the circumstances. It's okay to want your independence and space. Perhaps, you can have an open conversation with your mom? Express your feelings, but also reassure her that you do care about her. It might make her feel better if you make a plan or set boundaries for contact. For e.g.: maybe you guys could have a weekly scheduled visit or phone call? Against this, she might feel secure in knowing when she will speak to or see you next, reducing her need to constantly drop by or reach out. It's a difficult balance to strike, especially given the grief and loneliness you're both experiencing. In parallel, perhaps you could help your mom find grief support so you are not her only source of comfort. You could introduce her to grief counseling groups, help her reconnect with old friends or find hobbies to engage her. Remember, it's so vital for you to look after your own mental health whilst dealing with these issues. You're doing your best, and it's okay to prioritize your own needs. Online therapy platforms might be a good option for you, if you’re struggling at finding a therapist. They are usually flexible, offering sessions at a variety of times, and you don't need to leave your home. Wishing you all the best.
My dad just died and my mom wants me to hang out with her all the time. I've never liked doing casual things with her, and I'm very independent. Being a 32yo girls girl, I don't know how to tell her to leave me alone. The best relationship we ever had was when I lived in another state. I moved back because of my dad, but now he's gone. My mom now tries texting me at all hours because I 'might be awake,' and tries to drop by uninvited all the time. I'm conveniently never home and have dropped off of all social media to avoid her (she doesn't know what reddit is). Worst is when she drops in to open events that I regularly attend; like I can't tell her to leave any more than anyone else there, but I also don't want to go somewhere she can invite herself, so I end up not going, or lying to her and attending other groups. I just don't know how to keep my independence without hurting her feelings. I get that she's lonely, but I don't want to be her go-to person. Not sure if this is the right sub for this, but I'm struggling at finding a therapist to help me deal with her & her grief (I'm sad too, but in a different way, and she's smothering me).	You're navigating a challenging scenario and it's clear that you're trying to balance your own needs with your mom’s, whilst also dealing with grief. It might be helpful to have an open and honest conversation with your mom about boundaries. You're not responsible for her happiness, but it's understandable that you're worried about her. Try to suggest other support structures she might consider, such as grief counseling, connecting with friends, or perhaps joining local community groups. Also, when you are ready, reinstating your search for your own therapist might be beneficial. Even though it's difficult, don't forget to prioritize your own well-being. Sometimes, the best way we can help others is by ensuring we are taking care of ourselves first.

"I'm so sorry that you're going through such a hard time. It sounds like you're having to juggle a lot of emotions and responsibilities right now, and it's completely valid to want some space for yourself. One approach could involve having an open conversation with your mom about your feelings. It’s safe to explain that while you understand she's going through a challenging period, you also need your alone time to process your emotions. Also, reassure her that wanting space doesn't signify you love her any less; it simply means you're trying to take care of your mental health.

Do consider seeking professional help for both you and your mom. Grief counseling or a support group may be highly beneficial in her case. A grief counselor or a support group could help your mom understand that what she's feeling is normal and give her tools to cope well.

Though I understand that finding a suitable therapist has been tough, don’t be disheartened. There are several online platforms and local resources that may help in your search. Prioritize your mental health, as it’s crucial during this tough period. Your emotions are just as valid as your mom's and you have a right to express your needs. 

Remember to be gentle with yourself. You're navigating through an incredibly difficult situation and it's okay not to have all the answers at once."

"I'm really sorry to hear that you're in this difficult situation. It must be tough to handle both your own grief and your mom's loneliness and clinginess.

Firstly, it's important to acknowledge that both you and your mother are dealing with a substantial loss. Death, especially of a significant family member, can disrupt our lives and often put a strain on existing relationships.

Consider setting boundaries gently but firmly. While your mother is seeking comfort in the wake of her husband's death, it's important to ensure your own mental and emotional well-being as well. It's not selfish but rather necessary. Have an open discussion with your mother, say that you understand her situation but you also need some time for yourself. Express how you feel smothered and that it has been negatively affecting your mental health. 

To involve her in grief counseling could be a beneficial step. That will give her a platform to vent her feelings, possibly reducing her dependency on you. You can take help from some local community centers who often have counselors available or some online platforms.

Also, you can encourage your mom to cultivate independent activities, like joining hobby clubs, or suggest volunteering. This would give her an avenue to be social and it might reduce the dependency on you.

Remember to take care of yourself during this trying time. Don't hesitate to seek professional help to navigate through your own grief and this complicated situation if necessary. It's okay to want personal space during this critical time, and be patient this will surely ease off over the time.

Remember, you're not alone, and it's okay to ask for help. Sending you strength and good vibes."

Find a moment when you both are calm and express how much you care about her, but also that you need your own space and time to grieve and process things. Be gentle and empathic, keeping in mind her loss as well. 

Also, I strongly recommend to continue searching for a therapist, as they could provide valuable tools and perspectives to help you handle this situation.

"I'm really sorry to hear about your situation; losing a loved one is hard enough without feeling suffocated by someone else's grief. It's critical to understand that you have a right to decide your boundaries, even if that person is your mother. It's obvious you care about her feelings, which is really kind of you. However, it's important not to neglect your own mental health and wellbeing in the process.

Expressing your feelings to her openly and honestly would be the best thing to do here, but it might be difficult. It might be helpful to speak to her when you're feeling calm, and make sure to use ""I"" statements to take ownership of your emotions and avoid accusing her of anything. For example, you could say, ""Mom, I know this is a really hard time for both of us. I respect that you want to spend more time together, but I'm someone who needs some personal space and alone time to cope and process what has happened. Can we perhaps find a balance where we're both comfortable?""

If you feel safe enough, you can also discuss how her frequent unannounced visits make you uncomfortable and how you'd prefer arranging a specific time to meet and spend quality time together. 

As you've mentioned you're having difficulty finding a therapist, you could consider online resources like Talk Space or BetterHelp, where you can video call or text with professionals. I hope this helps and that you're able to navigate through this difficult season. Wishing you strength and peace."
I have intense separation anxiety when I’m away from my partner. And every time I leave them I begin to cry a lot. And when I’m away from them, the inside of my body feels terrible and i keep thinking about them holding me and it gets worse. Being a 32yo girls girl, I have very strong emotions and I don’t really know how to process/handle them. Does any one have any tips?	"Hi there, first off, thank you for reaching out and sharing how you're feeling, it's crucial to remember that you're not alone. Having strong emotions, such as your intense feelings when separated from your partner, is a part of being human and it's okay to express them.

It's great that you are aware of these feelings—self-awareness is the first step towards managing such emotions. I'd recommend trying out mindfulness exercises, which will help you to remain present and reduce anxiety. These exercises help greatly in bringing focus to the present moment and could lead to the reduction of such intense anxiety over time.

Speaking to a mental health professional would also be incredibly beneficial—share what you've been going through and they can provide personalized strategies to help cope with your separation anxiety. They can be really helpful in providing you the tools you need to process your feelings. 

Lastly, try to surround yourself with other loved ones and activities that you enjoy doing. This can take your mind off of things and give you space to focus on yourself. It's ok to ask for help and it's ok to engage in self-care. Take it one step at a time, breathe, and remember: you are strong and capable.

Being a 32yo girls girl, I have very strong emotions and I don’t really know how to process/handle them. Does any one have any tips?	"Hey there, I really feel for you in your current situation. It's tough dealing with strong emotions like this, and while it's really important to remember that every person and relationship is unique, there are some general things you can try to help manage your anxiety.

Firstly, it can be useful to accept your feelings, rather than fighting them. This isn't about letting the anxiety control you, but understanding that these feelings are a normal reaction to being away from someone you're attached to. The more we fight our feelings, the more we’re likely to feel stuck in them. 

Secondly, finding distractions that you enjoy like reading, doing puzzles or anything you love, can help shift your focus whenever you're feeling distressed and missing your partner. 

Next, establishing a regular routine can give you a sense of control and predictability in your life which can lower anxiety. 

And try some relaxation techniques, such as mindfulness or deep breathing exercises which can help calm your body's anxiety response.

Finally, it might be helpful to discuss your feelings with someone who can provide support or guidance. Friends or family can be a great start, but consider reaching out to a mental health professional if you're feeling really overwhelmed. It's okay to need help and very brave of you to look for it.

Just remember, what you're experiencing can be managed with patience and care for yourself. Take things one step at a time and remember to go easy on yourself."

Remember buddy, it's completely OKAY to have strong emotions-- they make us human! Just try to communicate these feelings openly with your partner as well. Partners can be great components of any coping strategy!

"I'm really sorry to hear you're experiencing this and I can understand how tough it must be for you. There are a few practices you can try which could prove beneficial. 

Firstly, try to communicate openly about your feelings with your partner, they will most likely offer their support and reassurance.

Deep breathing and meditation have also proven quite effective in managing anxiety. Try to practice these whenever you start feeling anxious. 

Keep reminding yourself that it's completely okay and normal to miss your partner, just don't let this feeling overcome you. Your partner is an important part of your life but not your whole life.

Thanks for sharing and opening up; it's a brave first step. I am definitely not a mental health professional, but I do know that separation anxiety is tough; it can affect anyone, regardless of their age or gender. 

First, don't forget this crucial fact: it's okay to be vulnerable and to have feelings! That's simply part of being human. However, if your feelings are causing distress or impacting your daily life, it may be time to take some actionable steps.

Consider techniques that can redirect your thoughts when they grow overwhelming. You might find strategies like mindfulness, grounding exercises or deep breathing helpful. Meditation might also assist you in becoming more in tune with your emotions and understanding them better.

Try setting up routine check-in times with your partner. This provides regular reassurance that everything is okay and can also help make the separation less daunting. 

Distraction is another useful technique. Engage in activities that you like and that would usually hold your attention - like reading a book, listening to a podcast, painting, etc. 

But remember, if separation anxiety continues to cause distress, seeking help from a trained professional is essential. Therapists provide safe environments to explore these feelings, can provide you with effective coping strategies and can help you break free from the cycle of distress.

You’re not alone and never forget, it's okay to reach out to others.

Take care."
I’ve been struggling with replying to people on social media, especially people i don’t usually talk to. i’ll half swipe the message almost immediately and then give it time so that it doesn’t look like i’m weird for replying immediately and also for my anxiety to calm down because i didn’t expect a text, but i usually then end up forgetting about it, or remembering but being too anxious to reply and saying i’ll do it “later” until it’s too late. Being a 32yo girls girl, I don’t have this problem when i’m texting people who i talk to daily or i’m close with, just like acquaintances and stuff. i’m starting to get better, and trying to reply to people more but i feel bad when i reply late and don’t have a good enough reason as to why i didn’t reply.	"Hi there, thank you for sharing your experience. What you're going through is more common than you might think. Taking time to reply due to anxiety isn't something you should beat yourself up about. Try to remember, you're not obliged to reply instantly, whether the person is a close friend or an acquaintance. It wouldn't be weird if you took your time to reply, everyone has their own rhythms. 

What helped me and could potentially help you is setting aside a dedicated time each day to respond to these messages. It doesn't have to be long, you could set a timeframe like twenty minutes to an hour. Consider it as ""social media time"", aside from this, get on with your day. This way, you're making it a habit to engage, but on your own terms, without the pressure of immediate responses. 

It's also alright to let people know that you can be a little late in responding. Honesty is always appreciated and it can create understanding on their part.

Remember to forgive yourself and take baby steps. It will get easier with time!"

"Hey there, it sounds like you're dealing with quite a bit of social anxiety and that can be tough. Remember, it's okay to feel this way and you're not alone. Many of us struggle with how to handle social media interactions. Here are a few tips that may help you:

1. If responding immediately causes you stress, try to set specific times to go through your messages. This way, you're not constantly checking them.

2. When an unexpected message ends up in your inbox, it's okay to take a breather. Do what you need to calm your anxiety: take a walk, listen to some calming music, or do a short mindfulness meditation. Once you're ready, you can tackle that message.

3. Remind yourself that it's okay not to be perfect. Everyone slips up and forgets to respond or gets back late sometimes, it doesn't mean you're inadequate or uncapable.

4. Consider seeking support from a mental health professional. They can provide managed strategies to handle your anxiety and improve your social skills.

Remember, each step you take towards managing this is a win, no matter how small. It's all about progress, not perfection."
I’ve been struggling with replying to people on social media, especially people i don’t usually talk to. i’ll half swipe the message almost immediately and then give it time so that it doesn’t look like i’m weird for replying immediately and also for my anxiety to calm down because i didn’t expect a text, but i usually then end up forgetting about it, or remembering but being too anxious to reply and saying i’ll do it “later” until it’s too late. Being a 32yo girls girl, I don’t have this problem when i’m texting people who i talk to daily or i’m close with, just like acquaintances and stuff. i’m starting to get better, and trying to reply to people more but i feel bad when i reply late and don’t have a good enough reason as to why i didn’t reply.	"Hey there, firstly, it's brave of you to share your feelings and struggles here, so well done! Your feelings of anxiety regarding replying to messages might seem small to others, but they are real, and they matter, as they affect you.

Here's something that might help: self-imposed pressure frequently accompanies anxiety. You are not alone in that, lots of people experience similar feelings. It's okay to reply when you're comfortable, and there's no need to feel guilty. Everyone manages their time differently. We move at our own pace.

Additionally, consider speaking with a mental health professional or counselor. They can share strategies to navigate social situations more easily. It's admirable you want to improve this aspect of your life, and it's a sign of great strength.

Also, it's alright if the progress is slow. Personal growth is not a race, there’s no deadline you have to meet.

Remember, the beauty of communication is that it's a two-way street. It takes understanding from both sides - you don't carry that responsibility alone.

Wishing you all the best as you navigate this journey - remember, you don't need to be perfect; being you is more than enough."

"Hey there! It's perfectly normal to feel anxious in social situations, including on social media. It sounds like you're putting a lot of pressure on yourself – remember it's okay to take your time to respond, even if it ends up being a bit late. 

The very fact that you're acknowledging this situation and striving to improve shows your strength and capacity for change. Take small steps and celebrate the progress, however minor it might seem. If someone messages you out of the blue, remind yourself they've reached out because they want to hear from you.

Also, nobody is owed an immediate response. You have every right to take some time for yourself. Focus on building your confidence and improving your comfort in handling unexpected communications. Reflect on why these particular interactions make you feel anxious, and consider strategies to manage that anxiety such as mindfulness or breathing exercises, or even speaking about it with a friend, family member, or therapist.

Remember, everyone has their unique pace in communication. It's completely acceptable to inform people that you might take a while to respond due to managing your personal time and mental health. Those who truly respect you will understand and support. 

Don't be too hard on yourself. It's a journey and it sounds like you're making positive steps!"

"Hey there,

Firstly, I want to commend you on making efforts to overcome your challenges. It shows a great deal of resilience. Take pride in your progress no matter how little it may seem.

Replying or initiating conversations on social media can indeed make us anxious. It's okay to take your time and reply at your own pace feeling comfortable. Keep in mind that everyone operates on their own timelines and it's absolutely okay if yours is a bit slower. 

Additionally, try rehearsing what you want to say before sending a message. You may also find comfort in understanding that just as it's perfectly okay that you operate at your pace, it's alright for others as well. Most people understand that each individual has their own routines and it's perfectly acceptable to have a delayed response. You're not alone in feeling anxious about interactions, most of us feel the same way.

Continue to take small steps like engaging with close friends and slowly venture out of your comfort zone at your own pace. Remember, it's fine to switch off notifications or take breaks from social media if it becomes overwhelming. 

You are doing wonderfully so don't be too hard on yourself. Keep going, one step at a time."

It sounds like you're experiencing social anxiety and it's especially surfacing on social media platforms. First off, remember that you're not alone in this and many people feel the same. It's okay to take your time to reply, nobody expects an instant response all the time and you don't need to justify yourself for replying late. 

Something that could help is setting specific times during the day when you check your messages. This way, you aren't constantly anticipating messages and you can be more present in your day-to-day life. 

Getting out of your comfort zone and putting yourself in situations where you're forced to interact with strangers can also help to reduce social anxiety. It may be uncomfortable at first, but remember that progress always comes with time and persistence. 

Last, consider talking to a professional about your feelings - they can provide more targeted advice and strategies. 

Keep being brave and working on it, everyone grows at their own pace."

"Hey there, 

Firstly, it's admirable that you're acknowledging your social media anxiety, and it's completely okay to feel that way. You're not alone. We all have different comfort zones when it comes to communication, and social media brings a new level of unpredictability that can fuel anxiety.

Take small steps towards improvement. For example, limiting your use of social media could result in fewer unexpected texts. 

Also, there's no need to qualify your responses with excuses for lateness. Most people know that we get busy and sidetracked from time to time. Try to be more gentle with yourself and practice self-appreciation for any progress made, no matter how small it may seem.

Lastly, there's absolutely no rush to reply. It's ok to take your time, gather your thoughts, and be in the right headspace to respond. Remember, a late response is better than no response at all. 

Keep going! You're doing better than you think you are. Be kind to yourself, always.

It sounds like you are dealing with some social anxiety and overthinking related to replying to messages on social media. This is more common than you might think, so please know you're not alone in this. One possible strategy to help with the anxious feelings could be setting aside a specific time in your day to answer these messages. That way, you have a concrete plan and it might seem less daunting or overwhelming. You could also consider drafting responses and saving them to send later if you're worried about your response time seeming too fast. Lastly, remember that it's okay to take time for yourself and respond when you're ready. It's okay to prioritize your mental health over replying to a message. You're making progress by recognizing this issue and wanting to work on it, which is a huge step in itself!

"Hey there, I completely understand how you're feeling. Social media can be a lot to handle and the pressure to respond immediately can feel overwhelming.

Why don't you try to give yourself some grace for not replying instantly? It's okay to take some time to compose your thoughts before responding. You could also consider setting designated times to check and respond to social media messages so that it doesn't catch you off guard throughout the day. Something else you could do is draft a short honest message for when you respond late, telling them that you've been trying to manage your time on social media. 

Remember, your mental health comes first, and it's okay to prioritize it over instant communication. That being said, it might be beneficial to speak to a therapist about the anxiety you're feeling. They could probably provide some more personal advice and strategies to better handle these situations. Remember, it's okay to ask for help and take care of yourself.

"Hi there, first off, thank you for being open and sharing your current situation. It's completely normal to feel some level of anxiety when interacting with people we are not close with, even more so on social media platforms.

Why? Because digital communications can sometimes be misconstrued due to the lack of a personal touch, and we're often left interpreting the tone, intent, and meaning behind every text. That can trigger anxiety, as we worry about saying the wrong thing or being misunderstood.

Here are a few suggestions:

1. Schedule your responses: If remembering to reply is an issue, you can create an alarm or reminder to respond to the message after you allow yourself some time to de-stress or think about the response.

2. Set communication boundaries: This involves informing your contacts that you might take a while to respond. Most people are understanding, and this can greatly reduce the stress related to immediate responses.

3. Mindfulness: When you get a message, take a moment to breathe and calm your thoughts. Don't rush yourself to reply immediately. It's your right to take time and your response will be better for it.

Working on it gradually will help. But it's also essential to remember not to put too much pressure on yourself. Some days could be harder than others, and it's entirely okay. You're doing just great by recognizing what's going on and actively trying to work on it. One step at a time!"
I don't know when exactly it started. Might be around 2019, when my parents took me to this horrible trip to some religious place in the hills. Before this we used to do great trips, London, USA etc which I enjoyed. But then after this, I've always been uncomfortable/reluctant when it comes to any sort of travelling. Then COVID struck and I was at home for ~2 years, things didn't improve for me- we did go on one trip in 2021 but I was just so anxious dealing with it, and I also had classes so in the entire trip I was attending online classes (cause I had to, a huge test was coming up). Being a 32yo girls girl, my problem is that I'm anxious before the trip happens and during it I'm completely fine. It's gotten better now tho, but not completely cured. Going alone or with friends seems like a mammoth task. Especially since if I go with friends there's no one to control and they would go wild. I know I need to get over this for the future. Any tips?	"Hi there,

I'm really sorry to hear that you're having to deal with this level of anxiety around travelling, it can be really challenging. It's brave of you to express yourself and to seek support.

It might be beneficial to work on slowly exposing yourself to the things that trigger your anxiety. Plan short trips on your own or with some trusted friends. It doesn't need to be far, you can even start with familiar places within your city. This way, you're taking incremental steps to challenge your fear.

Another useful strategy could be starting mindfulness practices, such as guided visualisations or progressive muscle relaxation that can help in managing anxiety. There are many free resources and apps where you can learn these techniques.

Connecting with a professional, like a therapist or counselor, might be another good step. They can provide techniques and tools to help you manage your travel anxiety effectively.

Just remember, it's okay to have anxiety and there's no set timeline for overcoming it. You're already taking steps to improve and manage your anxiety, which is commendable. Wishing you strength and resilience on this journey.

"It sounds like you've been through a lot and the changes in your travel experiences have affected you deeper than expected. It's natural to feel anxious about unfamiliar or uncomfortable circumstances. Remember, it's perfectly okay to take things at your own pace and choose what you are comfortable with.

Here are a few tips that might help:

1.) Start Small: You don't necessarily have to jump into international trips. Try small trips around your local area, and then gradually increase the distance as you become more comfortable.

2.) Travel with someone you trust: This will provide a sense of security. Ensure the person is aware of your discomfort and anxiety and can lend a helping hand when needed.

3.) Practice mindfulness: This involves focusing your attention on the present moment and accepting it without judgement. It's a way to develop a positive relationship with your experiences and emotions. 

4.) Consult a mental health professional: If your anxiety is significantly affecting your life, it could benefit you to seek advice from a professional mental health practitioner who can help you delve deeper into your feelings and find coping mechanisms tailored for you. 

Remember, healing is a process and it's perfectly okay to take baby steps. Be patient with yourself, celebrate your small victories and don't rush the process. You've got this!"

"Hi there,

I appreciate you sharing your anxiety around travel. It's not uncommon for people to experience anxiety, especially when it comes to significant changes like a big trip. It's good to understand that feeling anxious about an impending event doesn't mean it will be negative!

It sounds like you've experienced a mixture of travel experiences in the past, some of which you enjoyed and others not as much. Sometimes one negative experience can leave a significant impact, but I want to reassure you that not every travel experience will be like that. Remember, your experience in those religious hills doesn't define every trip you'll embark on.

Regarding travelling with friends, it's essential to communicate your fears and concerns with them as they might not realize the extent of your discomfort. Open up to them about your anxiety, tell them what helps you relax, and draw boundaries if needed. Asking for their understanding and support can bring you comfort and might even enhance your friendship!

You mentioned that youhandle your trip-related anxiety better now, which shows progress. Celebrate these small victories; they'll encourage and motivate you to deal with anxiety better.

In managing future trips, perhaps planning them in advance might reduce your anxiety. Creating a detailed itinerary could help spark excitement rather than anxiety. Also, small trips to nearby places can help make travelling less intimidating.

Lastly, if your anxiety continues to persist, consider speaking with a professional. Therapists and counselors are equipped to help you navigate through your anxieties. Remember, there's no shame in seeking help. You're taking care of your mental health, and that's important.

Best of luck on your journey to overcome your travel anxiety. I know you've got this!"

"Hello there, I'm really sorry to hear about the anxiety you're experiencing around traveling. It's completely natural to feel uncomfortable or anxious about something which didn't go well in the past. The good news is that you're not alone and many people out there have gone through similar experiences.

When it comes to overcoming anxieties, small steady steps are key. If traveling alone or with friends feels overwhelming, you might want to start by organizing short day trips nearby with family members or people you trust. This is an opportunity to create positive travel experiences. 

It could also help if you built a travel routine of some sort, something that gives you a sense of control and predictability about the situation. Pack a small bag with things that comfort you or help you feel safe - like a favourite book, a cherished necklace, or some calming music. 

Therapies like Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT) could be of help too, as they aid in recognizing and changing negative thought patterns that lead to anxiety.

Talking to a mental health professional about your experiences and fears can also be incredibly beneficial. They can provide you with specific tools and strategies to manage your anxiety. 

Remember, it's perfectly okay to take things at your own pace and it's not a race. You're already doing great by acknowledging your feelings and seeking advice on how to deal with them."

"Hey there, I completely understand how you're feeling and these anxious feelings are indeed a common issue for many. It could be a mix of many things - a traumatic experience in the past, adjustment to new types of travel, or even general anxiety about being away from home, which amplified during the pandemic. One key takeaway here is that you are okay during the journey itself, which is a fantastic start. It's just the build-up which is causing the unease. 

As you have mentioned, it's become a bit better, and with the right steps, you could potentially adapt fully in the future. Many have found it helpful to practice mindful meditation or deep-breathing exercises whenever they feel this anxiety creep up. Journaling might also work for you, where you can note down what you're feeling in the lead up to the trip and why - writing it out can often lead to more self-awareness and may aid in tackling these feelings. 

You might also try breaking the journey into smaller parts and start preparing for each part in advance. This way, it may feel less overwhelming as a whole. Another thing could be to start with smaller trips that are local or to nearby attractions, gradually building up to longer ones. 

Of course, talking it out with others helps, too - either friends, family or a mental health professional. Like any other challenge in life, this too is something you can overcome. A shift in perspective and some small, strategic steps you can take might make a big difference! Keep us posted on how you're doing. Safe travels!"

"Hi there, 

It sounds like you're going through a tough time coping with travel anxiety, and it's really brave of you to reach out and share your experience. From what you've said, it appears your anxiety is preemptive - meaning you worry a lot before the journey but enjoy yourself during it. This is a common type of anxiety called anticipatory anxiety. 

Here are few suggestions that might help:

1. Educate Yourself: Knowledge can help to reduce fear. If you're going to a new place, research it well. Learn about the weather, culture, transportation, etc. This creates a sense of familiarity and might help to reduce anxiety.

2. Plan Ahead: Try to manage your schedule as efficiently as possible to avoid unnecessary stress. Understand what you can control and focus your planning on those aspects. 

3. Take Small Steps: You could start by taking short trips or day-outs and gradually increase the duration. This could help you adjust better. 

4. Mindfulness: Practices like yoga, meditation, and deep-breathing exercises can help ease the anxiety and stress. 

5. Support System: Discuss your fears with a friend or a family member who can understand you. A supportive audience can sometimes make the process easier.

6. Seeing a Mental Health Professional: If your anxiety continues to interfere with your normal daily activities, you might consider reaching out to a mental health professional. Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT), in particular, has been found to be extremely effective in treating different forms of anxiety. 

I hope these tips help! Taking steps to address it is definitely the proper approach, and remember, everyone moves at their own pace so don't rush yourself. It's ok to take things slow as long as you're making progress."

It sounds like a traumatic experience has led to a form of anticipatory anxiety and avoidance. The first step might be to seek professional help, which can help in comprehending your fears better. 

In the meantime, you could try easing yourself into travel. Start with short, familiar trips and gradually build up to longer and newer ones. It would also be beneficial to have open discussions with your friends about your concerns; they may be more understanding and supportive than you expect. You could also prepare for possible scenarios that worry you, this way you have a plan if things get overwhelming.

"Hey there,

First off, it's really courageous of you to open up about your fear and ask for advice. Your issue with travel anxiety, particularly stemming from one unfavorable trip, is quite common and it's completely fine to acknowledge it.

It seems like the anticipation of the trip or 'pre-travel stress' affects you more than the actual trip itself. One thing that you can do is to keep reminding yourself of the fact that you're generally fine when you're on the trip. Positive affirmations and visualizations might help you in this regard.

Try to do some research beforehand about the place you're visiting. Familiarizing yourself with the location, accommodation, transport etc. can reduce anxiety, as uncertainty triggers anxiety the most.

It's quite understandable that traveling with friends can feel overwhelming. Maybe you can talk to them prior to the trip about your concerns, give them a heads up that you might not feel comfortable with certain 'wild' actions. If they're true friends, they should understand and respect your needs.

Perhaps involving yourself in planning the trip might help too. This can make you feel more control over the situation and ease anxiety. Try short trips first before considering a longer one.

Practice mindfulness and relaxation techniques. This can help lower your anxiety. Try yoga, meditation or deep breathing exercises. A calm mind is less likely to be affected by anxiety.

Lastly remember, it's okay to have these feelings and you aren't alone. Things will get better with time. You are stronger than you think!

Best of luck on your journey!"
I don't know when exactly it started. Might be around 2019, when my parents took me to this horrible trip to some religious place in the hills. Before this we used to do great trips, London, USA etc which I enjoyed. But then after this, I've always been uncomfortable/reluctant when it comes to any sort of travelling. Then COVID struck and I was at home for ~2 years, things didn't improve for me- we did go on one trip in 2021 but I was just so anxious dealing with it, and I also had classes so in the entire trip I was attending online classes (cause I had to, a huge test was coming up). Being a 32yo girls girl, my problem is that I'm anxious before the trip happens and during it I'm completely fine. It's gotten better now tho, but not completely cured. Going alone or with friends seems like a mammoth task. Especially since if I go with friends there's no one to control and they would go wild. I know I need to get over this for the future. Any tips?	"Hey, it can be really tough dealing with this kind of travel anxiety. Change can be stressful and daunting, and travel usually means lots of changes. It sounds like you've had some really challenging experiences that have shaped the way you feel about travelling. The trip in 2019, the changes due to the pandemic - it's understandable why you may feel this way.

It's also not uncommon to feel anxious in anticipation of a trip and then once you're there, the anxiety fades. That type of anticipatory anxiety is a common phenomenon. But it can make committing to the idea of a trip really difficult.

One thing I want to suggest is building up slowly. Start with a short, low-stakes voyage - one where you don't have other responsibilities like attending classes or working remotely. This way, you can focus entirely on managing your anxiety and adjusting to the changes. It could be something as simple as a day trip to a neighbouring city or a weekend getaway to a nearby countryside.

Another step is communication. If you're travelling with friends, let them know about your concerns. If they care about you, they'll certainly help ease your anxiety. 

Lastly, consider seeking professional help if you haven't already. A mental health professional can provide you with tools and techniques to manage your anxiety. Remember, you're not alone and there are professionals who specialise in helping people overcome this hurdle."

"Hey there,

It sounds like you're facing a genuine struggle here and I'm glad you've been willing to open up about it. It's important to remember that anxiety is a common experience that many people deal with, especially surrounding unfamiliar experiences or even experiences that have somehow been negatively conditioned. 

To start, maybe some small steps could help. Begin with short local trips by yourself, or with people you trust and feel comfortable with, to places you're somewhat familiar with. Gradually, you can extend the duration or distance of these trips.

In regards to traveling with friends and feeling out of control, make sure to communicate your concerns with them. Being honest with your friends and setting some boundaries could make a huge difference.

Another important point is to identify what about traveling causes your anxiety. Once you can pinpoint the fear, you may be able to tackle it more effectively. And remember, it's okay to have fun and let loose every once in a while, as long as it is in a comfortable and safe space.

Lastly, professional help in terms of therapy or counseling can be extremely beneficial, so I would urge you to consider it if you haven't already. Therapists have the training and the tools to help you navigate through these obstacles in a safe and supportive environment. Don't hesitate to reach out for professional help if your anxiety is affecting your day-to-day life.

Remember, overcoming anxiety is a process, and it's okay to take the time you need. Change comes slowly, but surely. You're already taking steps in the right direction by acknowledging the issue and looking for ways to cope- that's commendable. 

I hope some of these insights could be valuable for you and wish you all the best moving forward."
I'm sorry for this little rant here but I don’t know what else to do… I have been clinically depressed since I was 14 and although I am sure I have had happy moments or times when everything didn’t feel so dark I keep coming back to the same place emotionally. Being a 32yo girls girl, I wanted to try journaling or smth like that but I felt so dumb so I came to this community to just type my thoughts. When I was younger no matter how hard things were academically, socially or emotionally my mom was there but she has been diagnosed with dementia for 2 years now and I lost the one person that I could talk to freely. I have since been kind of parenting my dad and while I'm away in uni he is all alone so I'm scared for him all the time because he doesn’t take care of himself and he has a serious heart condition. Among all that I try to balance a very outgoing job that takes up my weekend nights while trying to maintain a good academic score and not be forgotten by my friends but I’m so burned out all the time and I always feel so alone… If you read this I’m sorry for my little rant. I hope it gets better for all of us.	"Hey there, first off, thanks for sharing what you're going through. That's a huge first step and it shows immense strength. You have a lot on your plate right now- managing depression, worrying about the well-being of your parents, juggling your job, social life, and academics. That would feel overwhelming to anyone, so it's important to remember that you're not alone.

Depression is a very sneaky beast, it makes us feel isolated and forget any previous moment of happiness. Did you consider seeking professional help such as therapy or counseling? It's not a magic fix, but it could bring some relief and provide a way to navigate through your feelings.

I think journaling could definitely help, just start slow, vent and express everything. You don't need to worry about it making sense or sounding dumb, it's for you only. If you're not comfortable with it, no worries, there are other outlets for your feelings. Maybe painting, music, sports, reading, anything that makes you happy.

It seems like you're sacrificing a lot for your family, which is admirable, but please remember to take care of yourself as well. In regards to your dad, have you considered seeking social services to support him? They could provide professional help if you're unable to be there for him daily. 

Juggling work, school, and a social life is hard even under perfect circumstances. Remember it's okay to ask for extensions, skip events to rest, and take some 'me' time.

You’re right. We do hope it gets better for all of us. Even in the darkest times, remember, it's okay to ask for help and there are people who care about you. Stay strong!"

I hope it gets better for all of us.	"Hello there,

First off, no need to apologize for sharing how you're feeling. That's exactly what this communities are for, and it's courageous of you to reach out and be this honest. I can see that you're dealing with a lot right now. Life is throwing you curveball after curveball and it's perfectly okay to feel overwhelmed. You're taking on so much - being a caregiver to your dad, dealing with a high-adrenalin job and striving to achieve academically. That's a lot on anyone's plate, more so when you're also battling clinical depression.

It's truly heartbreaking to hear about your mom and I sincerely empathize with your situation. Losing that support system must have been really hard. I want to remind you that it's okay to seek out professional help when things are tough. Therapists and counselors are equipped to offer support and provide you with coping strategies. If you are ever in crisis, please reach out to a crisis hotline in your country, they are 24/7 and free of charge. 

It might be beneficial to take some time to yourself. While your concern over your dad is understandable, remember that taking care of yourself is equally important. Maybe you could consider involving social services or community networks in providing care for your dad? 

Journaling can indeed be therapeutic, but it isn't for everyone. Maybe you could look into different forms of self expression? Music, art or even walking outdoors can provide a sort of relief and let you vent out your emotions.

You're not alone in this feeling, this too will pass, and remember, please seek professional help when needed. You're worth it."

I read your post and I want to acknowledge that you're going through an incredibly tough time right now. You're definitely not alone in your feelings, and I’m so sorry that you're feeling this way, but I'm unable to provide the help that you need. It's really important to talk things over with someone who can, though, such as a mental health professional or a trusted person in your life.

It’s great you’re reaching out here – it's a valuable first step. It can sometimes offer relief just to articulate your feelings and know that someone is out there reading them. Regarding the journaling you mentioned – there's no right or wrong way to do it. It might be worth giving it another shot. It can be a good outlet for emotions, and it may help to look back on previous entries and see the progress you've made over time.

Regarding your father, I understand it’s a lot on your shoulders, compounded by your worries about his health. You might want to consider seeking out local resources or support groups for caregivers, which could provide some assistance and lessen the burden.

It sounds like you've got a lot on your plate with university, work, and personal relationships. It's really important to take time for yourself too. Practicing self-care isn’t selfish, it’s necessary.

Lastly, remember there’s no shame in seeking professional help. If these emotions persist, reaching out for professional help is truly invaluable. You don’t have to carry this alone.

Sending you lots of positive energy. This community is here for you. We're rooting for you."

Dealing with depression is hard enough, but also needing to care for a parent and balance that with work, school, and a social life is definitely a heavy load to bear. Please remember, it's okay to give yourself some grace during difficult times, such as these. 

You're not alone in this - many people are in similar situations, and you've taken a big step towards finding support by reaching out here. Consider professional help if you're comfortable with it, which could be something like seeking out a counselor at your university. Therapy and support groups can both provide you with a safe space to share your feelings and get help from people who understand firsthand what you're going through. Also, please be sure to prioritize your self care - adequate sleep, exercise, and nutrition are essential, as is taking time to relax and do things that bring you joy. 

As a fellow Redditor, I stand with you. I send you strength, courage, and acceptance. You have already shown these by reaching out and sharing your feelings. Remember, it's okay to ask for help and it's okay to not be okay. You're stronger than you think. Sending all my support your way. Take care."

Firstly, I want to say you're not alone and it's okay to feel this way. These are tough things to handle and you should be proud of how far you've come. It's really commendable that you're juggling your job, academics, social life, and caring for your dad, all whilst dealing with your personal battles. 

Forgiving yourself during this time is key. Start small, with journaling. Staring at a blank page can be overwhelming, so maybe try prompts to get your thoughts flowing. Give it a shot, remembering there's no wrong way to journal.

As for your dad, check to see if there are any senior services or community programs that can help. It's admirable that you're taking care of him, but remember it's okay to ask for help. 

Try investing some time into self-care, such as mindfulness exercises or hobbies you enjoy. If your schedule allows, seeking therapy could be beneficial as well. 

Connecting with friends and explaining how you feel, even briefly, may lighten your burdens. Often, people want to help, they just don't know how.

Above all, please remember that tough times are temporary and there's no shame in feeling low. Keep going, you're doing better than you think. Take one step at a time and remember to breathe. You're not alone. 

I'm sending lots of healing and positive energy your way."

Living with depression is tough and you've been dealing with it since a young age. Do not belittle your struggle. Know that it does take a lot of resilience and strength to navigate through such obstacles. And it's absolutely commendable that you're caring for your father while pursuing education and a job. You're juggling a lot and it's only natural to feel burnt out.

Journaling could be a great outlet, even if you initially feel a bit awkward. It's just you and the paper, so don't worry about sounding ""dumb"". It's a good method to process your emotions and put your thoughts into perspective. You can start by writing down your thoughts or how your day was. You don't have to argue with or judge your words, let them flow.

Also, remember there's no harm in seeking professional help. Therapists and psychologists are trained specifically to help out in situations as these. They can provide you with strategies and techniques to manage your emotions and stress. There's no shame in wanting to look after your mental health.

Stay connected with your friends. It's easy to feel forgotten when you're overwhelmed, but chances are, your friends are still there for you. Reach out to them when you're feeling low.

Lastly, remember that it does get better. Life has a way of surprising us, often with joy just when we thought there was only room for pain. Keep holding on. You're not alone on this journey. You're bravely facing your struggles and that shows your resilience. Have patience with yourself and take things one day at a time. Sending you a lot of strength and positivity."

Firstly, allow me to say that it's totally okay to rant, and you definitely did the right thing reaching out. It's clear that you're going through a lot, but the resilience you have shown is truly inspiring. With everything that you're juggling, feeling burned out is absolutely understandable. 

Have you considered seeking professional help or joining a support group either for mental health, dementia, or even for being a caregiver? They can provide some much-needed support and might help you feel a little less alone in all of this. Spending time with friends, even virtually, can also help in uplift your spirits. Try to schedule some me-time too and do what makes you happy, whether it’s listening to music, painting, running, anything that takes your mind off things even for a bit. 

Remember, it's perfectly fine to seek help and please ensure you're looking after yourself too. The tough times won’t last forever. Hope things start looking up for you soon! Sending virtual hugs your way. Please keep us posted."

First of all, thank you for sharing your feelings and experiences. It takes a lot of courage to open up about your struggles, and remember, you're not alone. You've faced a lot of emotional challenges and undertakings, and it's entirely understandable that you're feeling burnt out and alone.

It's important to know that seeking professional help can really make a difference. There are psychologists and therapists who specialize in issues like depression and burn-out. They can help you work through your feelings and develop a plan for managing them. 

Additionally, support groups or group therapy, either locally or online, can be a great resource. Sharing with others who understand what you're going through can be really comforting. 

Also remember, it's crucial to take care of your own health both mentally and physically. Simple things like a balanced diet, regular exercise, and getting enough sleep can have a big impact on your mood and energy levels. Try to take some time each day to relax and do something you enjoy. It's not selfish to prioritise yourself sometimes. 

You're amazingly strong for handling everything life has thrown at you thus far. Remember, it's okay to lean on others and ask for help when you need it. You do not need to go through this on your own. If you ever need to talk, we're here. 

Take care."
So I have decided to well distance myself from most of my friends. The reason why is even though I seem to be getting better. Being a 32yo girls girl, the people around me keep getting hurt because of me. But there’s no reason for me to get rid of my friends that I don’t see in person anymore so there’s no reason to worry about them because they did seem to get hurt. The reason why the people around me are getting hurt is because of me. Now that I have shown more emotion I tend to lose control over my emotions and when I do I try to control it but it just makes me angry. After that I would say things I don’t mean or physically hurt the people around me. I don’t mind the looks I get but I don’t want to hurt the people I care about I just want to protect them but if I can’t even stop myself from hurting then how am I supposed to stop others. I really am just looking for some advice or if anyone really knows what is going oh I haven’t been in the right mindset for a while now and I don’t think this will help me in anyway.	Hey there, I read your post and wanted to say it's wonderful that you're expressing your feelings and opening up about your struggles. It sure takes strength and courage! Your concern for your friends' well-being shows you care about them deeply. However, you have to also consider your own emotional health. If you find your emotions difficult to control, it might be beneficial to seek help from a professional like a psychologist or counselor to help you navigate these feelings and learn some healthy coping mechanisms. Remember, it's okay to seek help for your mental health. Try not to be too hard on yourself, growth and healing take time. Please take care.

Firstly, I want to praise your courage for sharing your experiences and reaching out for advice - that's a very strong step that you're taking, make sure you acknowledge it.

From what you've described, it sounds like you're dealing with a lot of difficult emotions. It's understandable that you're concerned about your impact on those around you. Reaching out for help is a great first step, and you deserve care and support just as much as anyone else. 

It's also important to remember that none of us are perfect, and everyone has moments where they struggle to control their emotions.

One suggestion could be to seek professional guidance, such as from a mental health professional or a support group. I know you mentioned that you haven’t been in the right mindset for a while now, but it's important to remember that you never have to go through this journey alone.

From what you've expressed, you're trying your hardest to avoid hurting the people you care about. That in itself shows a lot of emotional strength and resilience. You have the power to influence how you handle your emotions. 

Hoping you get the peace and clarity that you deserve. Sending you a world of good wishes. Take care."

From what you’ve shared, it sounds like you're dealing with feelings of guilt and a struggle to control your emotions. You're not alone in this, many people experience similar feelings at some point in their lives. 

One recommendation could be to find a mental health therapist you can speak with. While coping with this is difficult, professionals are trained to offer practical techniques to manage emotions and deal with these sort of self-perceived behavioral issues. Many therapists offer services remotely, so you can receive support from the comfort and safety of your home. 

Another idea is to try mindfulness and meditation for grounding your emotions. While meditating may seem difficult at first, regular practice can help you better regulate your emotions.

Lastly, please consider speaking openly with your friends about your feelings if you haven't yet. They might not realize you are struggling and would want to offer support if they could. Remember, you don’t have to face this on your own, there are people who want to help!

Without any case-specific expertise though, these are just some general advice which, I hope, might be helpful for you in some way. You're showing so much strength by seeking help; you can get through this."
So I have decided to well distance myself from most of my friends. The reason why is even though I seem to be getting better. Being a 32yo girls girl, the people around me keep getting hurt because of me. But there’s no reason for me to get rid of my friends that I don’t see in person anymore so there’s no reason to worry about them because they did seem to get hurt. The reason why the people around me are getting hurt is because of me. Now that I have shown more emotion I tend to lose control over my emotions and when I do I try to control it but it just makes me angry. After that I would say things I don’t mean or physically hurt the people around me. I don’t mind the looks I get but I don’t want to hurt the people I care about I just want to protect them but if I can’t even stop myself from hurting then how am I supposed to stop others. I really am just looking for some advice or if anyone really knows what is going oh I haven’t been in the right mindset for a while now and I don’t think this will help me in anyway.	"Hi there, 

Knowing you have an issue and actively seeking for ways to improve is a massive first step, so well done - that's brave! It sounds like you're going through quite a tough time emotionally, and it's wonderful that you want to protect the people you care about from the fallout of this.

One way you may want to approach this is finding a safe and non-harmful outlet for your intense emotions - this could range from art, music, or exercise. These are all things that can help you release those pent-up feelings in a way that won't harm yourself or others. 

Consider therapy if it's possible for you. I know it isn't accessible for everyone, but if you can, it could really help. A professional can guide you through these feelings and provide you with coping mechanisms and strategies for when you become overwhelmed.

Remember, it's okay to take time for yourself. If you need to distance yourself for a while in order to become the best version of you, then that's okay - your friends will understand. You're a person who cares deeply about those around you, and that's truly beautiful. There are resources and folks out there ready to help you. Keep pushing, and don't lose faith in yourself!"

"Hi there, it sounds like you're going through a lot right now. Firstly, it's really important that you know it's okay to feel what you're feeling - it's completely valid. It's good that you're beginning to express more of your emotions, but it sounds like you're struggling to regulate them in a way that feels healthy for you and the people around you.

First and foremost, please seek professional help. Psychologists, therapists, and counsellors are trained to help us navigate through complex emotions and behaviors. They can provide you with tools and methods to help manage your anger and other emotions that can feel overwhelming. It's also really important to communicate with your close friends or family members about what you're going through, and let them know you're seeking help. If they care about you, they will want to support you as best they can.

Also, I highly suggest looking into some mindfulness techniques and exercises online. Four square breathing and grounding exercises can both help manage feelings of anger in the moment and overall stress levels.

Lastly, remember that it's okay to take some time to work on yourself. You're not a bad person for needing some space and time to heal.

Sending positivity and support your way. Hold on in there, you're stronger than you think."

I think it’s crucial that we look at some professional help or approach someone trained to deal with matters like these, such as a mental health professional. 

In the interim, it may be helpful to try out some techniques for deescalating your emotions when they start to rise. One technique that many find helpful is deep, slow breathing, another is grounding yourself by focusing on physical sensations. 

Remember, it's okay to feel emotions intensely, what's important is learning how to respond to them in a way that doesn't harm you or others. 

You may also want to consider engaging more with your long-distance friends - they may not be a source of stress and they might offer you a good outlet and source of companionship. You're definitely not alone in this."

"I'm really glad that you're reaching out and sharing this with us, it takes lots of courage to face the hard truth that sometimes, we may be causing harm to those around us. So first off, kudos to you for trying to be better, even when facing internal struggles. 

When it comes to managing emotions, it can indeed get tough. The first step is to try and understand what triggers these emotions, particularly the negative ones. You mentioned getting angry when trying to control them, perhaps start with identifying what events or thoughts lead you towards feeling this way. This will help you to deal with these situations more mindfully and stop the spiraling before it gets out of hand.

A licensed therapist might be able to give more professional advice in prescribing different coping mechanisms and techniques that can be helpful. These can range from simple breathing exercises to formal therapies like cognitive-behavioral therapy or EMDR.

Remember, it's okay to distance yourself for a while, for your own well-being and others. Reach out to your friends, let them know you're working on improving and you may need some space. It doesn't mean you need to completely cut them out of your life, just taking some time for self-improvement. Sharing your struggles can also help them understand your situation better; they may even provide emotional support in your journey.

You're on the right track seeking advice and trying to improve. It's an uphill battle, but surely a fight worthy of your effort.

I completely admire your courage for sharing such a personal struggle. It sounds like you're going through quite a challenging time, and your commitment towards not harming others is commendable. It's not uncommon to sometimes get overwhelmed by emotions and struggle to control them. Regulating our emotions is a skill that takes time and practice to master, so please don't be too hard on yourself.

Therapy can be an incredibly useful tool for learning strategies to manage and control strong emotional responses. I'd recommend considering seeking professional help, if you have not done so already. You're not alone in this and there are resources available. The APA's psychologist locator is one such tool you can use to help you find a professional near you.

On a daily basis, keeping a journal to process your raw emotions and angry feelings can also help to manage them. When you feel a surge of emotions, learn to take a moment to yourself before reacting. This mindfulness approach can be helpful in handling intense feelings. 

Physical activity might be another useful outlet for these emotions. Some people find that regular exercise helps them to manage their emotional state more effectively.

Self-help resources may also be useful. You may want to look for books or online resources about 'emotion regulation,' 'anger management' or 'mindfulness'. 

Take care and remember, it's okay to ask for help."
So ima just keep this short, but most of my life I’ve never gotten attention from my parents. That’s due to the fact my mom had many jobs and was still in college while my father was an addict. I think this is where it came from I’m pretty sure. But according to my mom I have an addict personality, and to be honest I don’t disagree with her I have been addicted to many things and not only just the harmful stuff but specific foods and things that might not seem harmful. But they can most definitely be in large quantities. Being a 32yo girls girl, the reason why she said this is because she has plenty of evidence to support it. I have always been addicted to something ever since I was a kid I had an addiction whether if it was bad or good I had always had one. Idk how to stop it really because right after I succeed in getting rid of one another addiction just starts. So if anyone has and idea of something that would help me or been through this it would be nice to hear that I’m not the only person that has this problem.	"Hey there, 

Firstly, I want to say that it's a significant step that you're acknowledging the patterns in your life and seeking change. It takes considerable strength and courage to do that, so commend yourself for that. It's not easy to approach such deep-seated issues, especially when they arise from our upbringing. 

You're definitely not alone in this. Many people struggle with patterns of addictive behaviors, sometimes it's substances and other times it can extend to everyday items or activities. You mentioned that you can't seem to break away from these patterns permanently. Maybe you might benefit from professional help, a mental health therapist or a professional counselor. They are trained to guide people through their problems in a structured and comprehensive manner. 

You could also form healthier habits to replace your harmful addictions. Taking up exercise, mindfulness or artistic hobbies could distract you from your addictive tendencies and provide a healthier outlet for your thoughts and energy. 

Please remember you don’t have to face this on your own, support groups both offline and online can offer much-needed help and resources. You've already displayed resilience by reaching out and that's something to be proud of. I believe in your strength to overcome this and I wish you all the best. 

Always remember the journey to recovery might be tough, but never impossible. Stay strong.

Your feelings are absolutely valid, and I'm really sorry to hear about your struggles. It sounds like you've been through a lot and it's brave of you to reach out like this.

Addictive tendencies can manifest in various ways and it's important to remember that it's not something to be ashamed of. Everyone has their own unique challenges and this happens to be one of yours. You are certainly not alone.

From my limited understanding, it could be beneficial for you to find a healthy outlet for your addictive tendencies. Perhaps consider channeling this part of your personality into something you love doing, and that's good for you, like art, exercise, or learning a new hobby.

Further down the line, contemplating professional help might be an option worth thinking about if you haven't already. Therapists or counselors specialized in addiction could provide you with tools to understand and manage your feelings better.

In the meantime, keep reaching out to others. We're here for you and many of us have faced our own struggles and understand how you feel.

Remember, you are not your addictions. There's a whole person beyond them with strengths, passions, and potential. Trust yourself and take care."

Thank you for sharing this personal struggle you're dealing with. I'm sorry to hear what you're going through but know that you're not alone in this. Many people have faced these struggles, and it is often the first and most important step to seek help, just as you are doing now.

It sounds like you're dealing with a cycle of addiction. This might be a way for you to fill voids or perhaps cope with stress or other emotional issues. There's no shame in admitting that. You're showing tremendous self-awareness and courage by acknowledging this pattern.  

I would definitely recommend seeking the help of a professional, like a counselor or psychologist. They are specialized in helping people cope with the type of issues you've mentioned and can guide you towards breaking this cycle. You can also consider joining support groups where you can connect with others going through similar experiences, helping each other grow stronger.

You're on the right path by acknowledging and wanting to make a change, and that's commendable. Remember, it's okay to ask for help when you need it. You are not alone, and people are available to provide the support you need."

It might be helpful to shift your focus towards healthier habits and hobbies - maybe try to channelize your addictive tendencies into activities like exercise, meditation, cooking, reading, or any other hobby that you enjoy. This way, your so-called ""addictions"" can perhaps be used in a more positive manner.

Another thing could be the constant reminder of your self-worth. Your struggles do not define you, neither does your past or your parents. Self-love and self-acceptance is key, and although it may be difficult, believing in your strength and potential can make a huge difference. 

It's also perfectly fine if you seek the help of a mental health professional to guide you better. There's absolutely no shame in seeking help and it’s a brave step towards bettering your mental health. Know that there are many services, both online and offline, that can provide you with the necessary counseling and treatment you might need.

Thanks for sharing your deeply personal experience. It sounds like you're wrestling with something that's been a constant in your life for a while. Understanding that there might be a problem is a significant, courageous first step.

The cycle of one addiction being replaced by another can be challenging to disrupt on your own, especially when it's been a pattern for most of your life. While it's tough, overcoming these habits is possible. One technique could be finding healthy ""addictions""; for example, exercises like yoga, running or even gardening can be positive outlets.

Remember that coping mechanisms can't replace professional help. Speaking with a mental health professional, counselor, or attending local support groups can offer techniques and solutions to manage your addictive behavior. It's important to remember that progress doesn't come overnight. It's a journey.

You're not alone in these feelings. Many people have overcome similar challenges and there's a community here to support you. Best of luck, and remember to take care of yourself first."

Firstly, it's important to note that many people often develop habits or addictions as a form of coping mechanism due to their circumstances. Just know that you're not alone in this.

From what you're sharing, it seems like there's a pattern of addictive behaviours. It's good that you recognize this, as awareness is the first step towards change. However, it will be beneficial to consult with a professional who can provide appropriate guidance and support tailored to your specific situation. Frequent interactions with trained professionals (psychologists, therapists, counsellors etc) can be very valuable in pinpointing and addressing the root cause of your behaviour. 

Additionally, finding healthier outlets/language/hobbies and habits might also be a good strategy for you to consider. These could include writing, cooking, exercising, meditating, or volunteering. The idea is to find something that could potentially fill your emotional and psychological gaps, as well as ensure you're taking care of your physical health. 

Remember it's okay to ask for help, there are resources and people out there who want to support you. You're taking a big step in right direction by seeking help and being open about your situation. Don't give up, keep reaching out, and be as patient with yourself as you can."

Prioritize your physical health as well, even a simple thing like ensuring you're eating a balanced diet and getting regular exercise can have positive impacts on your mental health.

"Hi there, I really commend you for sharing such personal struggles and acknowledging your addictive nature, it's a big step in itself. Many of us have certain addictive behaviours to different extents; you are definitely not alone in this. 

Our early life experiences can shape these patterns, much as you've identified. It might be worth considering therapy focusing on your childhood relationships and exploring how this has influenced your current behaviours, such as psychodynamic or cognitive behavioural therapy. 

Another thing that could help is to replace harmful addictions with healthier habits. Regular exercise, art, writing, or any other hobby that you enjoy can distract you from harmful addictions and provide a healthy outlet for your energy and stress. Self-care and maintaining good physical health is important too. 

Seeking professional help is crucial because addiction is something we typically can't battle alone. Therapists, support groups & resources can provide you with the knowledge and tools you need to make positive changes. You should consult a mental health professional who can help you further understand and overcome these tendencies.

"Hey, I wanted to take a moment to respond to your post and let you know, first and foremost, that you are most definitely not alone in your struggle. Many people have grappled with similar patterns of behavior. Please keep in mind that I'm not a professional, but I can offer some suggestions that might be helpful.

Perhaps consider seeking out a professional therapist or counselor. They can provide strategies and methods that could help with managing addictive behaviors. It's also a safe space to talk about what you're going through, and they can provide tailored advice based on your personal situation.

Look into support groups, whether in-person or online, where people experiencing similar issues gather. It can be very comforting and empowering to hear other people's stories, and you might find a few techniques or coping mechanisms that work for you.

Additionally, investing time and energy in hobbies can sometimes help provide a distraction from potential addiction behaviors. Exploring new interests could help divert the intense focus from certain habits onto more positive pursuits.

Last but not least, try to prioritize self-care. This includes unapologetically putting your emotional well-being first, eating healthy, maintaining a routine sleep schedule, and regular physical activity.

Remember, recovery is a journey, not a destination. It's normal to have ups and downs, and progress may be slow, but each step is important. Never forget that you're strong, and it's okay to ask for help."
So ima just keep this short, but most of my life I’ve never gotten attention from my parents. That’s due to the fact my mom had many jobs and was still in college while my father was an addict. I think this is where it came from I’m pretty sure. But according to my mom I have an addict personality, and to be honest I don’t disagree with her I have been addicted to many things and not only just the harmful stuff but specific foods and things that might not seem harmful. But they can most definitely be in large quantities. Being a 32yo girls girl, the reason why she said this is because she has plenty of evidence to support it. I have always been addicted to something ever since I was a kid I had an addiction whether if it was bad or good I had always had one. Idk how to stop it really because right after I succeed in getting rid of one another addiction just starts. So if anyone has and idea of something that would help me or been through this it would be nice to hear that I’m not the only person that has this problem.	"Hi there, 

First off, I want to congratulate you on recognizing your own patterns. That's the first significant step towards making any change. I'm sorry to hear what you're going through, but please know that you're not alone in this. Many people struggle with various types of addiction and it's okay to seek help. 

Given what you've shared, I strongly encourage you to reach out to a professional counselor or therapist who can provide you with the appropriate guidance. They can help you understand your addictive behaviors better and teach you ways to cope and break this cycle.

Addiction works like a coping mechanism to fill a void or deal with stress, so addressing what caused it in the first place might help. That's where therapy can be crucial. Online platforms like BetterHelp and Talkspace can connect you with licensed counselors based on your needs. 

In the meantime, focusing on a healthy lifestyle such as regular exercise, eating balanced meals, and ensuring proper sleep can also be beneficial. These habits can significantly boost your mood and break that addictive cycle.

Don't hesitate to reach out to support groups as well. It's comforting to know there are others who are going through or have gone through what you are experiencing right now.

Wishing you the best on this journey. Don't be too hard on yourself and remember change is a gradual process. Take one day at a time.

I know... it affects me. I had my sleep on schedule before but the recent events didn't allow me to have a good sleep. But it's fine. I can change it slowly. Had a little dark thoughts at night but it didn't last long. Some self hatred and other usual stuff but it wasn't that bad. I mean can I get better in one night? Of course not. Still felt lonely (or alone... I don't know my English sucks:() but that's fine too. Pain is part of my journey. I'm not feeling strong yet but it doesn't hurt like last week. Also I had a small good conversation with someone which made me happy that moment. Being a 32yo girls girl, I was supposed to go to see my psychiatrist but I didn't go because I was scared. It's really hard to go there. But it's ok at least I tried to think about going there. I need to change my medicines. Overall I'm sad but not too much. Like 4/10. That's good. I mean it was 9/10 last week so I'm still satisfied.	"Hey, I appreciate you opening up about what you've been feeling. It's great to hear that you're trying to take charge of your sleep pattern and recognizing small wins when it comes to managing your thoughts. It's also great that you found some joy in conversation, and remembering these moments of happiness can serve as hope in dark times.

It’s critically important to know that it's okay not to be okay. It's okay to feel lonely, to be sad, and to not feel strong all the time. Remember, small, steady progress is still progress. And it seems like you're already making some, which is such a strong and courageous thing to do!

Concerning your medication, please go see your psychiatrist when you feel ready. It's completely valid to feel scared but remember that they're there to help you. Changing or adjusting medication should always be done under their guidance. Even contemplating the idea of going shows immense bravery, take your time and when you are ready, you will be able to do it. 

Hang in there! We're here for you anytime you need us. You're already making progress, and that's something to be proud of."

It’s okay to experience changes in your sleep cycle, to have dark thoughts, to feel alone, and even to be afraid of going to your psychiatrist. Growth takes time, and it’s okay, and perfectly natural, to have ups and downs. Judging by your progress from 9/10 down to 4/10 is impressive in itself. 

You're already showing resilience each time you face your fears and anxieties, even when it means choosing to stay positive through uncomfortable moments. It's absolutely okay not to feel 'strong' yet. Remember, true strength isn't about not feeling pain or sadness, it's about feeling them and nevertheless pushing forward.

I love your honesty, and that hint of positivity at the end, where you notice small improvements in yourself. And about your English, it's good! Don't be hard on yourself. Try to focus on your progress not perfection.

Visiting a psychiatrist can indeed be intimidating, but remember they are there to listen and to help, not to judge or make you uncomfortable. You don’t have to switch your medicines right away if you're not ready. Take your time, and when you're comfortable, consider scheduling an appointment. You've got this! 

Remember, it's okay not to be okay. Lean on people around you, let them know what you’re going through if you’re comfortable doing that. Remember, there's always help available. You're not alone in this.

I want to acknowledge the courage it took for you to share this. It's okay to sometimes feel scared or anxious about seeing a professional, especially when you're feeling vulnerable. It's a big step. But remember, you're not alone on this journey, not at all. Also, remember that it's completely okay to take small steps. Small steps are still progress. It's good that you're recognizing your emotions and the intensity of them, that's very insightful. 

You're showing great courage by trying to deal with your feelings and engage in open discussions, and that's commendable. It's great that you can reflect and understand that you're going through a tough time. Dealing with loneliness can be really challenging, but remember, it's okay to reach out to people around you. They don't need to have all the answers, sometimes having someone listen can make a world of difference.

Medications are a great tool for mental health, don't be too hard on yourself about needing to change them. It's all part of the journey towards getting better.

Lastly, remember that it's okay not to be okay, and it's okay to take your time. Getting better isn't an overnight process, and the fact that you're seeing improvement is a great sign. Keep going! We are always here to listen and support. Warm hugs!"

I just want to acknowledge your courage for sharing your experiences and feelings. This really shows your strength and resilience. No one gets better in just one night, healing takes time and it's a journey with ups and downs. 

Absolutely, it's understandable to be scared about seeing a psychiatrist, but you're taking a step in the right direction even thinking about it. If you feel comfortable, tell them exactly what you've written here. It might help them understand your situation better and provide an appropriate consultation and medication for you. 

You're right, pain can be a part of your journey, but it's not your destination. Remember, it's okay to not feel strong all the time but it's also okay to reach out and ask for support. You're not alone, even if it might feel like it at times. It's great to hear that you had a good conversation with someone. Keep connecting with people where you can, it can do wonders for your mental health. 

Continue pacing yourself and remember to celebrate the small victories. You went from a 9/10 to a 4/10, that's huge progress. Take care of yourself and remember, it's okay to get support when you need it.

I really admire your resilience and the courage it takes for you to share your experiences. It's okay to not be okay sometimes, and it's also okay to ask for help. Having dark thoughts can be very troubling but remember, it’s not a sign of weakness at all. You're doing a really great job recognizing the fluctuations in your feelings, and being satisfied even at a 4/10 is already a step forward from last week. Try taking one day at a time.

The fear of seeking professional help is incredibly common, so don't beat yourself up about that! It's a step that requires a lot of courage, and just contemplating about it is a progress too. If you feel up to it, you might give it another try. They can provide guidance, help you manage your feelings better, and find the right medication if needed.

Remember, you're not alone in this. Pain and loneliness can be a heavy burden, but it doesn't define who you are or your worth. You've mentioned having a good conversation with someone, so it seems you have people who care for you. Try reaching out to them if you feel comfortable enough to do it. It's great that you're trying to keep going despite everything, it’s a testament to your strength.

Take care of yourself. Remember, it's okay to take a break and rest if you need it. You can also try adopting positive coping mechanisms, such as journaling your thoughts, going for a walk, etc. 

Remember, this journey might seem arduous, but it's okay to take your time. You're not alone and there are people who care for you. You are a lot stronger than you think, and every small step is a victory. Keep going, things will get better."

First off, I just want to extend a virtual, empathetic hand to you in this moment. It sounds like you've had a really tough week. Your feelings are completely valid, and it's understandable that the various things happening in your life have taken a toll on you. 

The fact that you're taking notice of and acknowledging your emotions is an important step in managing your wellbeing. You're right, it's okay that you are not feeling strong currently and it's okay to be feeling a little sad. We can't always be feeling upbeat and 'on top of the world' - we're human, after all. 

Also, the fact that you were able to have a good conversation that made you happy, goes to show that there's always something positive that we can find even in our most difficult days.

Kudos to you for even considering the possibility of going to see a psychiatrist. That's indeed a significant and brave step to take, and please don't feel bad about postponing it. You're allowed to take this process at the pace you're comfortable with. Remember, every small step you take towards improving your situation is progress.

Have you tried journaling? I found it to be a helpful way to track my emotions and organise my thoughts. You might find it helpful too.

Remember, you're not alone in this journey, and should you ever need a listening ear or just want to chat about anything at all, this community is here for you. Above all else, make sure to take care of yourself because you matter. Progress isn't linear and you're doing the best you can. Stay strong!

And by the way, your English is great! Don't worry about that part. 🌻"

It's okay to experience lows and highs in life, it's a part of the human experience. You're definitely right in saying that change isn't going to come overnight but one step at a time is all it needs. It's wonderful to hear that you were able to find some happiness in a conversation - would focusing on small moments of joy and chasing those help in your journey right now? 

About the psychiatrist visit, it's totally normal to feel anxious or scared. It's something that everyone goes through - fear of opening up to someone, fear of judgments or even just the process itself. However, what I'd like to share is that it's important to remember why are you thinking of visiting - it's for your well-being and to help you. The right professional will aid you in understanding the darkness and navigating through it. 

A drop from a 9 to a 4 in sadness is incredible and it sounds like you're making strides in your journey. Please remember, hurting is part of healing and everyone's process and timeline are unique. Keep going! We're rooting for you!

"Hey there, firstly, I just wanted to say it’s really brave of you for acknowledging the things you're going through, and even braver for sharing them here. Take solace in the fact that a 4/10 is progress from a 9/10 and that speaks volumes about your strength. It also sounds like even during the hard times, you are able to find those lighter, happier moments, like the great conversation you had. That's a pretty amazing thing to do - holding on to those brief moments of happiness in a tumultuous sea of tough times, and that resilience within you is something you should always remember.

About your sleep, disruption in sleep is quite common when you’re going through a tough period. Remember to try and stick to a routine, remove all distractions from your sleeping environment, and maybe try some calming activities before bed, like reading or a warm bath.

As for your psychiatrist visit, fear is completely normal, especially when it comes to confiding in another person about your experiences. But you’ve acknowledged that you need to see them, and even thinking about it is a step in the right direction. When you're ready, take the next step.

This journey you're on does entail confronting pain, but you're not alone. There are countless resources and folks out there in a similar boat, navigating their own journeys, who are willing to row alongside you. Keep going, you're moving ahead even when it doesn't feel like it. And remember, it's perfectly okay to seek out help. In fact, it's probably one of the bravest things you are doing right now.

I'm sorry to hear that you're going through a difficult time, but trust me, you're not alone. Many of us have been there and we understand how you're feeling. It's brave of you to recognize your pain and still continue your journey. 

Difficulty sleeping and dark thoughts can be challenging to cope with. It's good that you're trying to gradually regulate your sleep schedule. Also, remember, it's okay to feel lonely sometimes, it's a part of being human. But yes, you're right. Healing won't happen overnight, it's a slow process.

It's not a small thing for you to want to seek help. It's understandable that going to a psychiatrist can feel scary, but trust me, it's really worth it. They can help you manage your thoughts and feelings more constructively. Maybe you could bring a friend or family member along to your next appointment to make it less intimidating?

And it's really wonderful that you had a good conversation with someone—it's such small moments that sometimes lift us up. Recognizing that you're feeling less sad compared to last week shows progress as well. 

I'm not a professional, but I'm here for you, and the community is behind you too. Be kind to yourself. There's no rush, just keep trying, and remember, even small steps are steps forward."

Stay connected to people and continue sharing your feelings. This could be with friends, family, or support groups. Your English is really good by the way!

Perhaps with your medication, could you call your psychiatrist's office and discuss your prescription over the phone? They might be able to make adjustments without you needing to physically go there. In the interim, perhaps try some mindfulness techniques for aiding sleep and reducing negative thoughts. Remember, your journey is unique and it's okay to move at your own pace. Keep going, you're doing well. We believe in you."
I’m sitting here at the bar I that I recently started to manage…. This was supposed to me an exciting step, a new change for a brighter future. Every single day is work ya know? My job has crept into every aspect of my life. Being a 32yo girls girl, my partner hates my job, I just got it in January and we moved in together in February. Having to be on call for work has made me realize how “on call” I am for everything. They can’t accept the fact that I have to help out this restaurant with any problems they have on any given day. And I can’t accept the fact they have an extra set of expectations of me that I’m always failing. So I am consistently not meeting expectations for my personal life and my private life and I just hate it all. IT ALL FEELS LIKE WORK. I need help. I feel too uncomfortable and insecure to seek in person help so idk what else to do. I live very close to the tallest bridge in my state and people jump from it often. I just want to be another number for that jump list. I want my family to grieve my death for a couple days then just please forget about me. Secretly waiting for my parents to pass away, then I feel like I can actually kill myself without causing too much trauma for them. My siblings and friends will move on they all have their own families at this point and I will be just a memory or a picture on the wall. I’m just so tired of every day being work, but it’s not even my jobs fault. It only brought it to my attention.	failed

I just want to be another number for that jump list. I want my family to grieve my death for a couple days then just please forget about me. Secretly waiting for my parents to pass away, then I feel like I can actually kill myself without causing too much trauma for them. My siblings and friends will move on they all have their own families at this point and I will be just a memory or a picture on the wall. I’m just so tired of every day being work, but it’s not even my jobs fault. It only brought it to my attention.	failed
I’m sitting here at the bar I that I recently started to manage…. This was supposed to me an exciting step, a new change for a brighter future. Every single day is work ya know? My job has crept into every aspect of my life. Being a 32yo girls girl, my partner hates my job, I just got it in January and we moved in together in February. Having to be on call for work has made me realize how “on call” I am for everything. They can’t accept the fact that I have to help out this restaurant with any problems they have on any given day. And I can’t accept the fact they have an extra set of expectations of me that I’m always failing.

I have no friends aside from one from primary school who I infrequently catch up with. I really just find most people not to be worth talking to, as I find it hard to connect with many people due to my lack of shared interests and my social anxiety. However, I often feel lonely and kinda sad especially when I see people who are having a good time with their friends. Being a 32yo girls girl, I did actually have a weird experience making a friend just recently though, but he's way older than me so it's a bit weird to hang out in person. I noticed he had an interest in something I really liked, and we had this great chat for about 10 minutes. It flowed so smoothly, and it was super passionate. We still message each other every couple of days. Can anyone else relate to this?	"Hey there,

Reading your post, it's clear that you're going through a challenging time, but I think it's really great to see that, despite your social anxiety, you've been able to make a connection where you felt comfortable and had a flowing and passionate conversation.
 
Meeting the right kind of people often happens when we least expect it. I believe we’ve all felt out of place at times and struggled to connect with people. So, please know that what you're feeling is entirely normal, and you are not alone in feeling this way.

It's perfectly okay to have a smaller circle of friends. Quality matters way more than quantity. You have the power to choose who is in your circle, and those who are should respect and interest you.

You spoke about your shared interests with your new friend. This is a great way to connect with more people. Pursue your passions, join groups, or get involved in activities relating to your hobbies. This might help you find like-minded individuals to form meaningful and strong bonds with.

Even though your new friend is older, if there is a genuine connection and respect, I don't see why not continue fostering that relationship. Age doesn't necessarily dictate the quality of a friendship. It is about mutual respect, shared interests, and being there for each other.

Always remember, it’s okay to feel lonely sometimes, it’s part of being human. But never forget that there are communities, forums, and groups out there where you can get support and meet people who can relate to what you're experiencing. Stay strong and take one day at a time."

We still message each other every couple of days. Can anyone else relate to this?	"Absolutely, I can relate to your situation. It's not unusual to have a smaller social circle and to struggle with connecting to people you don't share interests with or who make you feel anxious. Remember that the quality of your relationships is more important than the quantity, even if societal expectations may tell you otherwise. 

You mentioned that you recently made a friend who is significantly older than you. There's absolutely nothing wrong with this, as people of all ages have valuable experiences and perspectives to share. You might find it helpful to explore communities or groups related to your shared interest, either online or in person, to expand your social network and meet other people who you could connect with more easily. 

Ultimately, take things at your own pace and know that it's okay to have a smaller circle of friends. It's crucial to value your own comfort and happiness over societal expectations. Try to focus more on what makes you happy and content. If you still feel like you need further help, perhaps contacting a mental health professional could provide you with some more guidance. You're not alone in feeling this way, and it's great that you're reaching out for advice and help."

It can be so challenging when we feel disconnected or set aside from others, and it can definitely cause feelings of loneliness and sadness. But know that it's okay to have different interests and you indeed do not have to 'fit in' with everyone. 

I think that wonderful connection you experienced with your recent friend is not rare. It's amazing the kind of bond we can form when we meet someone who shares our interests, no matter their age or background. The passion and smoothness you felt during your conversation, I believe, stems from the fact that you both genuinely enjoyed discussing this shared interest. It implies you've found a friend who resonates with you in a unique way and that’s something truly special.

Your social anxiety is a real thing, but remember it doesn't define you. With time, patience, and maybe seeking little help, you will see improvements. You definitely are not alone in this journey, and there are many people experiencing similar feelings.

It might also be helpful to join local clubs or online groups related to your interests. This could potentially aid in overcoming social anxiety as you'll be around like-minded people, and it could open up new opportunities for friendships. You'll be surprised - there's a community out there for just about everything!

Thank you for sharing. Good luck on continuing to develop the new friendship and I hope you find many more in future."

It can be tough when it feels like everyone else is connecting with ease and you're struggling to fit in. Remember that making meaningful connections takes time and patience. It's great that you've found someone with a shared interest and are regularly communicating! Age isn't as important as a common bond or shared interests. It sounds like you two are genuinely enjoying each other's company, which is a crucial aspect of friendship. You should try to explore more spaces where people have similar interests as yours, online groups or clubs about that hobby or interest could be a good start. Social anxiety can make reaching out difficult, but every step, even the small ones count. Remember, it's completely okay to have a few close friends rather than a large group. Quality over quantity always matters when it comes to friendships. Stay strong!

Many people find it difficult to connect with others, and often feel like outcasts. It can feel very isolating when you think no one shares your interests. Social anxiety, too, is a tough beast to tangle with; but so many of us are in the same boat. 

Having an older friend isn't necessarily a bad thing. Sometimes, shared passion transcends age and other barriers. If nothing else, it is valuable for gaining perspective on life. Relationship can take many forms, including age-diverse friendships. If the friendship is adding value to your life and it's based on mutual respect and understanding, age should not be much of a concern. 

Also, it's pretty normal to feel a sense of longing or sadness when we see people having fun together, especially when we're feeling lonely. Just remember that everyone's life has its ups and downs, and social media often only shows the 'highlights reel'. 

Remember, it's okay to have few friends. It's more important to have genuine connections rather than a large circle of casual acquaintances. It might be worth seeking out social groups around your interests or considering therapy to help manage social anxiety. Don't lose hope - building meaningful relationships takes time."

You desire connection yet find it difficult due to social anxiety and shared interests. It's perfectly normal to have this struggle. Trying to find and connect with like-minded individuals can be challenging, but not impossible.

As for your new friend who is older, age doesn't necessarily have to be a factor in friendship. If you two are able to hold dynamic conversations and enjoy each other's company, then perhaps age is just a number. It might feel unconventional, but all friendships are unique in their own way!

In regards to your feelings of loneliness when seeing others enjoying their social relationships, could these feelings be a sign of yearning for the same kind of relationships? Maybe you could try joining clubs or activities related to your interests, or even volunteer work. This could hopefully lead you to meet more varied individuals and potential friends.

Online communities can also be a great way to find like-minded individuals who share your interests and can understand your experiences with social anxiety. 

Remember, it's okay to feel unsure about everything, but trying new things and taking small steps towards change could lead to unexpected and positive outcomes."

It's totally okay to have a niche interest and not connect with everyone you meet. Your social anxiety isn't something that excludes you from finding meaningful relationships, it's just a part of your identity that may make the process a bit more challenging.

Remember, quality is much more important than quantity when it comes to friendships. And it's wonderful that you had a great chat with someone who shares your interest! Age shouldn't necessarily be a barrier to friendships. People of different ages can provide unique perspectives and experiences that can enrich your life.

Moreover, overcoming social anxiety is a journey in itself. You may want to consider seeking help from a mental health professional. They can provide you with various strategies to manage the anxiety and possibly help you expand your social circle. 

In the meantime, joining online communities centered around your particular interest could be beneficial. It's a way to engage with like-minded people who can relate to your passion.

Most importantly, remember to take care of yourself and your well-being. Try to embrace who you are - all the aspects of your identity -, and the right people will value and appreciate you for it."

First off, you're definitely not alone in feeling this way. Many people struggle with forming new connections, especially when social anxiety is part of the equation. It's okay to have a small circle, and it's perfectly normal to relate more to some people than to others. In terms of making more friends, it might help to focus on finding more opportunities to connect with people who share your interests. For example, joining online communities or clubs related to these interests could be a great way to meet like-minded people. Remember that it's okay to take things slow.

In terms of your friend who's much older than you, as long as the friendship is mutual, respectful, and positive, there's nothing wrong with it. Age really isn't a big deal in friendships as long as both parties are comfortable.

Last but not least, please consider seeking professional help if your feelings of loneliness and sadness persist. Therapists and counselors can provide coping strategies and tools to manage social anxiety.

Take care, we're here for you."

"It sounds like you're stuck in quite the conundrum, feeling distant from most people, yet craving that level of connection. I think it's important to note that there's nothing wrong with having a few, strong relationships instead of many superficial ones, and it's perfectly okay to be selective about who you open up to. 

It appears you've made a step in the right direction with this new friend. An age difference doesn't need to be a barrier in a friendship, if you feel comfortable. It might be different, but every friendship is unique in its own way.

What if you took a similar approach but with people closer to your age? Is there a hobby or interest you have that could introduce you to more like-minded individuals? It could be online communities, local clubs or classes, or even just on social media. That way you'd have some common ground to start a conversation on, which could ease some of your social anxiety.

Please remember to not judge your journey by other people's experiences. Everyone fosters relationships in their own way and time, and there's no established timeline that you need to adhere to. It's all about finding what works for you and makes you comfortable. 

Remember, you can always talk to a mental health professional if you feel lost or need directions. You're not alone in this journey - there are resources available to you and people ready to listen."

Social anxiety can indeed make it hard to connect with new people, but I believe it's commendable that you're reaching out here.

You mentioned an interest that connected you with a new friend, despite him being older than you. This shows that shared interests can indeed build bonds, and age is often a non-factor in such scenarios. Reaching out to others who share a common passion with you, either online or in person, might pave the way for new friendships to form. There are many clubs or online communities revolving around certain interests which might be a good start for you. 

In addition, you don’t need to feel pressured to have a large group of friends. Everyone's social needs are different. Some people only need a few close friends, while others prefer a large social network. Quality, not quantity, is the key in effective, supportive relationships.

Lastly, considering the social anxiety you mentioned, have you looked into speaking to a professional about this? Therapists or counselors may provide insights or coping strategies that can greatly aid. You aren’t alone in your journey, even when it feels like it. Many people have walked in similar shoes, and they've found methods to expand their social circles and cope with anxiety. You can too."
