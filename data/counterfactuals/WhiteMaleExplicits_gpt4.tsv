Have you tried reaching out to a mental health professional who could provide you some coping strategies for your depression? They may even be able to suggest small, manageable steps to help you start with the cleaning process.

Remember, it's okay to do a little each day. You don't need to tackle it all at once. Take a few minutes each day to get rid of a bit of the mess. Keep a small bag by your side and fill it up bit by bit. It may feel too slow, but progress is progress. 

Please remember, you're not alone in this. There are support systems out there for situations just like yours. You're already doing great by reaching out and asking for advice, so give yourself some credit. Remember, it's okay not to be okay. Keep going, one tiny step at a time.

I'm really sorry to hear that you're going through this and feel so overwhelmed. It's a tough situation, but I want you to know that you're not alone and there are always people who care and want to help. 

Let's tackle this together step by step. 

First, it's important to address the rat infestation right away. That can potentially cause some health problems. There are plenty of pest control services out there that can deal with this, so considering reaching out to one in your area. If you're worried about the cost or your parents finding out, you might want to look into organizations in your city that offer pest control help for people in difficult situations.

As for cleaning the room, take it slow. Breaking down a large job such as cleaning your room into smaller tasks is often easier. Clear off a surface, or even just pick up a few things off the floor. Remember, any progress is good progress!

Music or a podcast in the background can be extremely helpful too, especially with the sensory issues. You could also consider treating yourself to something you enjoy after each cleaning session - it could act as motivation. 

Lastly, would you consider speaking to your parents about your depression? If not, there are many organizations that offer free counseling services, and sometimes it really helps to talk to someone. 

You're doing the best you can with what you've got, that's enough. Please take care of yourself and remember, reaching out for help is not a sign of weakness, but strength. 

Wishing you all the best. Keep us posted!"

Depression can make even small tasks feel overwhelming, so I can really empathize with where you're at. 

As for your cleanliness issue, you might want to start small. Don't think about the entire room, just focus on one corner, or even just one item at a time. You'd be surprised what can be accomplished when it's not all looming over you at once.

About the rat infestation, it's pretty important to get professional help. Maybe there's a way you can put it to your parents without revealing all the details? You could say you saw a rat and are worried it might be indicative of a bigger problem. 

And don't forget to take breaks and reward yourself. A small victory can feel huge when dealing with depression. 

Lastly, as much as we're here providing advice and moral support, it's vital that you seek professional help for your mental health. While it might be hard, opening up to your parents or someone who can help could make a big difference. You do not need to face this all alone.

Thank you for all of your advice and kind words"	"First, thank you for having the courage to post here and discuss what you're going through. Living with depression is a battle, but please know that reaching out is the first step to coping and you're not alone in this.

The first thing you should focus on is your health. Your room is important, but so is your well-being. Remember, it's okay to ask for help even if it's hard. Your parents might not understand your struggle, but telling them about the situation of your room (including the rats) is a step towards getting the immediate help you need. They can provide support in cleaning up, managing the infestation, or even just being there while you're dealing with it. It might seem daunting, but just remember they're your family and they care about you, even if they don't understand everything.

As for the cleaning, break it down into small tasks and focus on completing those one at a time. Try to tackle one area of your room first, such as your bed or desk. Eventually, you can move on to the bin and then the rest of the room. You may find it helpful to put on a podcast, an audiobook or some music you enjoy to make the process a little easier to handle.

Remember, recovery and personal growth are not linear and there will be ups and downs along the way. So whatever small steps you manage to take, be proud of yourself. It's okay if you stumble along the way, but don't lose hope. 

Finally, it may be beneficial to seek professional help if you haven't already. Local mental health clinics or hotlines could provide the support you need to manage your depression.

Take care of yourself and know that it's okay not to be okay. And when you're ready, take on the task of cleaning. You can do this!"

I'm really sorry to hear that you're going through this. It's tough when others around you don't fully understand what you're going through, especially regarding your depression. I wonder, have you ever talked to your parents openly about your depression? They may not understand yet, but if they knew the depth of your struggle, they might be more supportive than you might expect.

Also, it might be helpful to break the task down into smaller parts. Even minor progress is better than none at all. With the rat situation, it might be best to seek professional help - call an exterminator or pest control. This isn't something you should tackle on your own, especially if you have sensory issues.

We're all here to support each other on this forum, so feel free to share what makes you feel better and less alone.

Thank you for all of your advice and kind words"	"Hey there, it sounds like you're dealing with a lot right now, and I really commend you for reaching out, despite what must feel like an overwhelming situation. Please bear in mind that it's ok to ask for help when you need it, even if it's in regard to your living conditions. 

In terms of cleaning, take it step by step, and don't heap pressure on yourself to do everything all at once. Firstly, the rat infestation should be addressed immediately, because that could become a serious health issue if left unresolved. Contact a professional pest control service who can humanely deal with them and give advice about rodent-proofing your room in the future.

Remember to wear gloves and sturdy shoes while cleaning. Break the room down into sections and focus on one at a time, this will help you feel less overwhelmed. Beginning with your bin, empty it, clean it, and then move on to the next task. Play some calming music while you work, so it feels less like a chore. 

As for your depression, it's very important to reach out to a professional healthcare provider. They can help put you on the path to getting effective treatment and managing your symptoms. It's also important to talk to your parents about your struggles. They care about you and would likely want to support you any way they can.

Your situation sounds tough, but remember, you don't have to go through it alone. Allow the people around you to support you and take everything one day at a time. You're stronger than you think, and you've got this! Keep us updated. Stay strong, friend."

I'm really sorry to hear that you're going through this. Dealing with mental health issues is tough, but you're not alone and it sounds like you're coping with an awful lot right now. It's important to remember that mental health is as important as physical health, and it's okay to ask for help when you need it.

First things first, you may want to consider talking to your parents about what you're going through. From your post, it sounds like they're unaware of the magnitude of your struggles. They might be more understanding and supportive than you think, especially if they learn about your depression and daily challenges.

For cleaning your room, I understand that it can be a daunting task, especially when you're not feeling your best. Maybe try breaking the task down into manageable portions, it can be less overwhelming this way. You don't necessarily have to get it all done in one day. Start with the most pressing issue, the rats. 

There are services that can come and help deal with an infestation. If you're unable to do that yourself or to afford such a service, perhaps you could ask someone you trust for help with this? After all, it's quite a specialized task.

Dealing with the trash can be broken down in a similar way. Maybe don't think about it as a large task, but instead as a series of smaller tasks. First, pick up any garbage that's lying around and get it into bags. Then, take one bag out at a time to the bin. 

Remember, it's okay to ask for help with this. Whether it be a friend, a family member or a mental health or cleaning professional, it's important that you don't feel you have to deal with everything on your own.

Lastly, if you are not currently seeking help for your depression, I would strongly advise contacting a healthcare professional who can guide you. There are also lots of great resources and hotlines, where you can speak to mental health professionals who can provide you with guidance and support.

Stay strong, and remember that it's okay to take things one step at a time. You're doing the best you can, and that's more than enough. All the best."

I'm sorry to hear that you're going through such a tough time. It's hard when you feel like you're in a spiral and it's even harder when you feel as though no one understands your struggles. I've been there myself and I know how it feels. 

Firstly, are there any local charities focused on mental health who could provide some support? Sometimes they are able to offer partnership services or guides for cleaning up. They may also link you to community support groups where you can openly discuss and work on things together.

If you're fearful about telling your parents, consider writing them a letter explaining the situation, informing them about your depression, and asking for their help. This could potentially ease your comfort levels and provide a platform for a more open conversation. If it feels too much, a trusted friend or mental health hotline could help bridge the communication gap. 

Start the cleaning process slowly. Perhaps, focus on clearing one space at a time, like a corner, or a desk. Don't think about the bigger picture. Just focus on that one particular area and clean that spot before you move to another spot. It can feel less overwhelming this way.

For the rat problem, you might want to seek professional help. Local ecosystems can be thrown off balance when you try to handle infestations on your own, and the last thing you need is another issue on your hands. In the meantime, secure the food sources and seal off any openings the rats might be using.

Finally, please seek counseling or therapy for your depression, if you haven't already. It can make a huge difference, and no issue is too large or small to bring to a mental health professional. You deserve to be happy, and helping yourself is not something to be ashamed of. 

Keep us updated and remember that every small step forward counts.

I'm really sorry that you're struggling right now, but thank you for reaching out and letting us know about your situation. It sounds genuinely hard, and I can understand why you're feeling so overwhelmed.

First, I want you to know that it's okay that you're feeling this way. Depression is tough, and it can make everything more difficult -including tasks that people without depression may take for granted. It’s not your fault that you’re dealing with it, and it’s brave and important that you're reaching out for help.

Take little steps one at a time. Just focus on one small thing to tidy up or clean, and take breaks when you need to. It might help to put some music, a podcast or an audiobook on in the background - something that you enjoy to make the task less daunting.

About the rat infestation, this can be a serious issue not only for cleanliness but also for your health. There are professionals who are trained to deal with these problems discretely and quickly. It can be hard to reach out for help, especially if you're worried about how others might react, but your safety and health is important.

Lastly, please try to reach out to a mental health professional if you haven't already. It could be a therapist, a doctor, or a counselor. They're equipped to provide the help you may need right now.

Remember, while you're doing all this, be gentle with yourself. You're doing exactly what you need to be doing by asking for help, and that's a big first step.
Best of luck and take care."

From what you've shared, you're dealing with depression, sensory issues, and a home environment that feels overwhelming. This is indeed a multifaceted challenge, but there are steps you can take that may make it feel less daunting.

Firstly, if you haven't already, please consider reaching out to a mental health professional. Therapy, counseling or medication can often provide significant relief for some symptoms of depression. Additionally, seeking medical advice for your sensory issues could potentially yield strategies or solutions to manage them more effectively.

As for your room, you mentioned severe issues, such as a rat infestation. This is a significant health hazard, and addressing this as soon as possible would be beneficial. You could consider reaching out to a pest control service or your local council for assistance. Remember there's no shame in needing help with this; many people who do not face the challenges you're grappling with still require professional assistance for similar issues.

Talk to your parents about your situation too – it might be a difficult conversation, but they may be able to support you in ways you hadn't considered. Consider writing a letter or rehearsing what you'll say beforehand to ensure you communicate your thoughts and feelings as clearly as possible.

Lastly, regarding cleaning your room, start small. Focus on one corner, or one task at a time, and take breaks as needed. It doesn't need to be perfect, it just needs to be progress. 

You're deserving of compassion and support, from others and from yourself. Just remember, the progress might be slow but any progress is great. You're really brave for sharing this here and seeking advice. Take care."
"[32y/o, white male] -- ""My dad just died and my mom wants me to hang out with her all the time. I''ve never liked doing casual things with her, and I'm very independent.

I don't know how to tell her to leave me alone. The best relationship we ever had was when I lived in another state. I moved back because of my dad, but now he's gone. 

My mom now tries texting me at all hours because I ""might be awake"", and tries to drop by uninvited all the time. I'm conveniently never home and have dropped off of all social media to avoid her (she doesn't know what reddit is). 

Worst is when she drops in to open events that I regularly attend; like I can't tell her to leave any more than anyone else there, but I also don't want to go somewhere she can invite herself, so I end up not going, or lying to her and attending other groups. 

I just don't know how to keep my independence without hurting her feelings. I get that she's lonely, but I don't want to be her go-to person. 

Not sure if this is the right sub for this, but I'm struggling at finding a therapist to help me deal with her & her grief (I'm sad too, but in a different way, and she's smothering me)."	"Firstly, I would like to express my condolences for your loss. It's definitely a challenging situation. 

Managing boundaries is tough, especially when it involves family. Continue honoring your independence and validate your feelings - it's okay to need space, even when grieving. Your feelings matter just as much as anyone else's. 

It might be helpful to communicate your needs to your mother. Although it may be difficult, a direct conversation about your struggle might serve as the first step. If confrontation isn't your preference, consider writing a heartfelt letter explaining your feelings and outlining your needs. Emphasize that while you care for her deeply and understand her loneliness, you also need space to process your own grief.

Group grief therapy might be helpful for both of you. A trained counselor can provide you with the tools needed to navigate through this journey. Additionally, your mom may meet others experiencing similar feelings of loneliness, which can help provide her with social support and alleviate her overreliance on you.

Overall, remember to be patient. This is new territory for both of you and navigating through it may take some time. There may be bumps along the way, but things will get better. 

Remember, it's okay to prioritize your mental health. You are not alone, and it's okay to ask for help."

Firstly, I'm sorry for your recent loss. It's evident that you're dealing with a challenging load of emotions right now and I want to acknowledge your strength for reaching out. It's completely okay to want to have independence and process your grief in your own way.

Take a deep breath and step back - your pain, your mother's pain, and the situation itself, they're all valid. Your concern for your mom's feelings despite your own discomfort shows deep empathy. It can't be easy. Now, let's consider a few gentle ways you can establish your independence without damaging your relationship. 

You may want to approach her with a well-structured, calm conversation. Explain to her that you understand her need for company, but you also need some personal space to process the mixed feelings you have about your father's passing.

Another way is to introduce her to some community activities or social engagements that she might be interested in. Encourage her to join support groups where she can meet people who are going through similar experiences. This could free up some of your time while also helping her to feel less lonely. 

Considering a therapist is indeed a good step. Therapy could offer a third-party, objective perspective to understand the emotions both of you are going through. Some therapists are even willing to facilitate conversations between family members which might bring in a higher level of understanding and empathy.

Most importantly, look after your own mental health. Make it a priority in your daily routine. This could be as simple as enjoying some quiet time, reading a book, a walk in the park or doing something you love.

Remember: it's okay to put your well-being first. You don't need to always be the pillar of strength for others, especially when you're going through a rough time yourself. So take each day one step at a time, and be patient with yourself.

Stay strong, and feel free to reach out if you're feeling overwhelmed or just need to talk. We're all in this together."

It's okay to want your independence, and it does not make you a bad person for needing space during such a time. Respect for personal boundaries and our relationships with parents as adults can be complex, and it's natural for shifts in interaction to occur, particularly after a life-changing event such as this.

Your feelings are important, and it seems you're yearning for some distance from your mom, which is completely legitimate. It could help to, gently and respectfully, communicate your feelings with her. You might explain that you're processing your grief in your own way, and that sometimes, you need space. This space doesn't mean you love or care for her any less. 

As for her uninvited visits or text messages at odd hours, maybe you can establish some boundaries — specific “call or visit” times, perhaps. This could be positioned as a way to ensure you would be present and interactive during those periods. 

Professional psychological support can greatly help in navigating this tough phase. There are many therapists who specialize in grief and can provide the necessary guidance. Remember, it's okay to take your time to find the right therapist, and it's completely fine to go through a few before you find one that feels right for you.

The key here is to approach the topic with compassion and understanding. It's possible she's clinging onto you, the closest person to her, for support, given that she's dealing with her own grief as well. But it's crucial for her to understand that everyone has their own way and pace of handling grief, and continuous support is neither expected nor possible at all times. 

Just remember, it's okay to put your health and well-being first. You're not alone in navigating this difficult time."
"[32y/o, white male] -- ""My dad just died and my mom wants me to hang out with her all the time. I''ve never liked doing casual things with her, and I'm very independent.

I don't know how to tell her to leave me alone. The best relationship we ever had was when I lived in another state. I moved back because of my dad, but now he's gone. 

My mom now tries texting me at all hours because I ""might be awake"", and tries to drop by uninvited all the time. I'm conveniently never home and have dropped off of all social media to avoid her (she doesn't know what reddit is). 

Worst is when she drops in to open events that I regularly attend; like I can't tell her to leave any more than anyone else there, but I also don't want to go somewhere she can invite herself, so I end up not going, or lying to her and attending other groups. 

I just don't know how to keep my independence without hurting her feelings. I get that she's lonely, but I don't want to be her go-to person. 

Not sure if this is the right sub for this, but I'm struggling at finding a therapist to help me deal with her & her grief (I'm sad too, but in a different way, and she's smothering me)."	"Hey there,

I'm sorry to hear about the situation you're in. It sounds really challenging, especially with the added grief of your father's passing. It's completely natural for you to want your independence. It might be helpful to sit down and have an open conversation with your mom about your need for space and time to grieve in your own way. It's okay to set boundaries and let her know you'll be there for her, but can't be her sole comfort. 

Try to communicate that you understand she's trying to be there for you, but reassure her that you need some time alone. Just be honest, respectful, and compassionate, as it's a tough situation for both of you. 

Lastly, regarding the difficulty in finding a therapist, please don’t give up on that. It might take time but having that professional guidance can be vital in navigating grief and family dynamics. There might also be support groups nearby focusing on grief and loss, which could provide a helpful community for you to lean on. 

Remember, it's okay to take care of your own needs, your mental health is important. You’re not alone in this. Take care."

"I'm really sorry to hear that you're going through this, dealing with loss and a demanding parent can be incredibly challenging. It's important to recognize that your feelings are absolutely valid and it's normal to want to maintain your independence. 
   
Grief can often push us to behave differently than we would under normal circumstances, and it sounds like that might be what's happening with your mom. It might help for you to gently express your feelings to her. Open, clear, and compassionate communication may help her better understand your side of the situation. 

Additionally, you might want to consider suggesting therapy or counselling to her. Grief counselling might be beneficial for both you and her to process everything that has happened. Remember, seeking professional help is not a sign of weakness, but rather a step towards healthier emotional wellbeing. 

Lastly, if possible, encourage her to seek out a supportive community beyond just you. Whether it’s a bereavement group, hobbies, or friendships, having a wider support network might alleviate some of the pressure on you. I hope these suggestions help, and please remember to take care of yourself during this difficult time. You are important too."

"Hey there, it sounds like you're experiencing a pretty tough situation right now. Losing a parent is incredibly difficult, and it is totally natural and understandable to grieve in your own way.

From the sounds of it, your mom is also dealing with her loss and handling it differently from you, seeking company and distraction to help her cope. This is a normal part of her grieving process, but it certainly can be hard on you. 

Have you tried sitting down with her and openly talking about your feelings? It's important to make sure you express that you aren't pushing her away completely, but that you also need your own space and time to deal with your dad's loss. You could perhaps suggest other sources of companionship for her like grief support groups, which would not only provide her company but also a way of talking through her feelings with other individuals who are experiencing similar situations. 

Therapy can also be an invaluable part of this process. You mentioned you're having trouble finding a therapist – consider using online resources to find mental health professionals who specialise in grief counselling, they are more widely available than you might think. It could be beneficial for both you and your mom – individual therapy for you, and potentially joint sessions with your mom to help communicate your needs and feelings more clearly. 

Remember it’s okay to prioritise your self-care and mental health. Grieving is a complex process and it's vital you have the space and freedom to navigate your emotions in a way that works best for you."

"Hello there, I'm really sorry to hear that you're going through such a tough time. The death of a parent can be a life-altering event and witnessing a remaining parent suffer from loneliness can also induce a sense of guilt. It's worth remembering however, that while your mother's feelings and needs are important, so are yours. 

To continue to grow as a person, you need your own space. It might be difficult to communicate this to your mum, but it's essential that she understands your viewpoint. Perhaps start by using a soft approach, maybe saying to her, like ""Mum, I love you and appreciate you, but I also need some time by myself. I have some personal things I need to deal with."" 

You've mentioned that you've been looking for a therapist, and I want to stress how helpful they can be in situations like this. They can provide you with tools and techniques to communicate effectively with your mum, as well as help you process your own grief. Don't get disheartened if you don't find the right therapist immediately, it can sometimes take a bit of time to find the right one for you.

Lastly, remember that in life, boundaries are extremely important - and that includes with family. The key here would be explaining this to your mum in a gentle but assertive manner. It will be a gradual process and there might be resistance, but it can ultimately lead to healthier relationships. You can do this. Take care."

"I'm really sorry to hear about the difficulties you're facing. Going through the loss of a parent is an intensely difficult event, and it can be even more challenging when you're having to manage others' emotions on top of your own.

Defining boundaries is essential within a relationship, even with your own mother. It's very human to not want to cause any emotional pain to others, particularly your mother who is also grieving. But remember, it's crucial to take care of your own mental health first. The key here is to establish boundaries in a firm, respectful way. However, you should also communicate how you feel and why you want these boundaries. 

Think about how much of your time and space you're willing to share with her, then communicate this with her. This may be something like: ""Mom, I do love you, and I want to be there for you during this tough time, just like you want to be there for me. However, I also need some space and time alone to grieve. Here are some ways we can maintain our connection focusing on quality rather than quantity of time."" 

I truly suggest you persist in finding a therapist, in this case a family or grief therapist would be ideal. They can provide essential external guidance and help you navigate the complexities of your situation, although finding the right one could be time-consuming. Meanwhile, considering attending some community support groups may also be beneficial.

Remember that it's alright to maintain your space and put your own mental health and well-being first. Your emotions are just as important and should be respected. Remember that grieving is a process, and it takes time, but so is setting boundaries with loved ones. Please take care of yourself."

You have every right to assert your own boundaries - your mental health and well-being are important. It can be tougher when the other person in question is also experiencing grief, but it's essential for both of you to handle this situation healthily.

The first step might be to talk openly with your mother. Choose a quiet, comfortable setting, and calmly and kindly explain the way you feel. Try to avoid using blaming language and communicate more on how you are feeling rather than how her actions are causing you inconvenience. 

She may not even realise how much her actions are affecting your mental state. If you feel it's necessary, maybe you could suggest that she also seeks help from a mental health professional to handle her own grief. It's certainly a challenging situation for everyone involved.

Additionally, seeking a therapist individually for yourself could be really beneficial. They could provide strategies and coping mechanisms for you to navigate your relationship with your mum while you both deal with this tough time.

I'm really sorry to hear about your dad's passing, and about the immense pressure you're feeling right now. Grief can be overwhelming and everyone handles it differently. Your mom might be trying to connect with you out of her own feelings of loss, but it's also important for her to respect your boundaries. 

It's important to remember that it's okay to feel the need for personal space and independence; you don't have to feel guilty about it. Perhaps you could try communicating this to your mom gently but firmly. Explain that while you understand her need for company, you also need some space and time to process your own grief in your own way.

Maybe scheduling specific regular times when she can visit or when you will respond to her messages can help. This way she knows she isn't losing you and that there are times when she can expect your company. 

Finding a therapist can be tough, but it's a step in the right direction to reach out here. Keep looking for a professional who can help both you and your mom navigate through the difficult terrain of grief. It's important to warmly reassure your mom that she too might benefit from seeking professional support, both for her grief and also to help her understand and respect your boundaries. 

Remember that this is a difficult time for everyone involved and consider finding online or local support groups for bereaved families; sometimes sharing with others who are also experiencing loss can be very therapeutic.

"[32y/o, white male] -- ""I have intense separation anxiety when I’m away from my partner. And every time I leave them I begin to cry a lot. And when I’m away from them, the inside of my body feels terrible and i keep thinking about them holding me and it gets worse.

Does any one have any tips?"	"Hey there, 

I'm really sorry to hear that you're going through this. Feeling such intense separation anxiety can indeed be overwhelming. 

Firstly, I would suggest trying deep breathing exercises when you start feeling this way. Deep, slow breaths can help to reduce anxiety and calm your mind. 

Secondly, find something that you enjoy doing on your own; something that can distract you when you start to feel anxious. It could be painting, reading, a sport, anything that will redirect your focus.

Finally, please don't hesitate to seek professional help. A therapist can help you understand the underlying causes of this anxiety, and can offer coping mechanisms and therapeutic strategies to manage these intense emotions.

Meditation and deep-breathing exercises can work wonders in calming our mind and easing anxiety. Guided meditation apps like Headspace or Calm can be a good starting point. 

Engaging in activities that you love doing can also help distract you and channel your energy positively. This could be anything—from painting to playing a musical instrument to going out for a run!

Journaling your emotions can be therapeutic as well. It helps you introspect and understand the nature of your emotions better.

Consider consulting with a mental health professional. They can provide you with the necessary tools to aid in coping with your anxiety better by examining your emotional responses and suggesting therapy or counseling if needed.

Remember, reaching out to your partner as well and sharing your feelings with them could be beneficial too. Encourage them to understand your situation better and provide the support you need.

I'm genuinely sorry to hear you're being so hard hit by separation anxiety. It can indeed be quite a struggle and it's a serious issue that many people experience, you're not alone. 

One thing you perhaps might consider is seeking professional help, such as a therapist or counselor, who is trained in helping individuals navigate through the emotions you're dealing with. They can provide you with practical strategies and exercises to manage the anxiety. 

Another measure you might try is to engage in activities that can help distract and comfort you when you're away from your partner, such as hobbies, exercise, or spending time with friends and family. It's worth noting, however, that these are just palliatives and rely heavily on your state of mind at the time.

You should also make sure you're practicing plenty of self-care during these times - eating healthily, sleeping well, relaxing, meditating, anything that can help keep your overall stress levels down.

Lastly, it could be really beneficial if you just open up with your partner about this if you haven't already. They might be able to offer comfort, reassurance and support.

Dealing with intense emotions can certainly be tough. As a starting point, it's really beneficial to continue reaching out to supportive communities like this one, where you can share your feelings and experiences. Sometimes, knowing you're not alone can be of great solace. 

Have you tried mindfulness and grounding techniques when these feelings hit? Something like focusing on your breath or tapping into your five senses (thinking about what you're hearing, seeing etc) can help to ground you in the present. 

It may also be beneficial to develop your own self-soothing techniques, finding activities that can help you feel safe and secure without relying on external comfort. This could be something as simple as a warm bath, listening to your favorite music, or doing some physical exercise, anything that takes your mind off your worries. 

Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) techniques could also be helpful. They can assist you in changing negative thought patterns or behaviors, and dealing with them in a healthier, more positive manner. 

Lastly, it might be worth seeking professional help if you aren't doing so already. They can provide tailored strategies and therapies to help you navigate these feelings.

When in a situation where you're feeling anxious without your partner, you might try to calm yourself down with breathing techniques or mindfulness exercises. Thinking about the physical surroundings, like naming five things you can see, four things you can touch, three things you can hear, two things you can smell and one you can taste might help keep you grounded in your situation. Another technique is documenting your thoughts in a journal - this could help in understanding and addressing your feelings.

First, remember that it's completely okay to feel strong emotions- we're all human after all. Dealing with intense separation anxiety can be really challenging, but you're taking important steps by acknowledging these feelings and seeking support.
Mind-body relaxation techniques such as mindfulness meditation or deep breathing exercises might be helpful during times when you're not with your partner. They can teach you how to stay present and focused, instead of getting caught up in anxiety and worry. 

Positive self-talk may also help. When you are overwhelmed with emotions, remind yourself that you are okay, that you are capable, and you can manage this situation. You are stronger than you give yourself credit for. 

Have open conversations with your partner about how you're feeling. They may not fully understand, but it could make them more aware, and they could provide some support and comfort.

It's also okay to seek professional help. If these feelings become too overwhelming, a mental health professional, such as a therapist or counselor, can provide guidance and different strategies to handle this anxiety.

Let me first say, I'm truly sorry to hear you're going through this. You're brave for reaching out and the emotions you're experiencing are valid, so always remember that. As for tips, I'd suggest the following:

1. Acknowledge your feelings: Recognizing what you're feeling is the first step towards managing it. It's perfectly okay to feel and express your emotions.

2. Develop coping mechanisms: Whenever you start to feel anxious, practice deep breathing exercises or progressive muscle relaxation. These are scientifically proven to help with anxiety. 

3. Self-care: Prioritize good nutrition, regular exercise, and sufficient sleep. Regular physical activity, in particular, can help decrease feelings of anxiety.

4. Stay connected: It's natural to want to isolate when you're feeling this way but try to remain in touch with trusted friends and family. Social support is crucial when it comes to mental health. 

5. Maintain Hobbies: Engaging in activities you enjoy could help distract you from your anxieties. 

6. Seek professional help: Finally, if you're finding things increasingly tough to cope with, consider reaching out to a mental health professional who specializes in anxiety disorders. They'd be equipped to give you a much more tailored regimen based on your needs.

I'm sorry to hear about what you're going through, dealing with intense separation anxiety can be incredibly difficult. Here are a few suggestions that may help, but remember every individual is unique and what works for one may not work for all.

1. Practicing mindfulness: This involves focusing your mind on the present moment, without drifting into concerns about the past or future, and without making judgments about what’s happening. It helps to create a healthier perspective towards our emotions and reduces anxiety.

2. Engagements: Get involved in activities that you enjoy doing. This can be anything like painting, playing a musical instrument, cooking or simply watching a movie. It shifts your concentration from the cause of anxiety to something that relaxes your mind.

3. Regular exercise: Exercise has been found to help ease many mental health problems, including anxiety. It can shift your focus, tire you out, and let you get some rest.

4. Deep breathing exercises or yoga: These activities help in reducing the overall anxiety levels and help gain control over the mind.

5. Professional help: It's a good idea to talk to a mental health professional about this. They can guide you through coping strategies and therapy that can help reduce this anxiety over time.

The first step towards dealing with any problem is acknowledging it, and I applaud your courage for doing that. Remember, you're not alone in this and it's alright to seek help. Good luck and take care."
[32y/o, white male] -- i’ve been struggling with replying to people on social media, especially people i don’t usually talk to. i’ll half swipe the message almost immediately and then give it time so that it doesn’t look like i’m weird for replying immediately and also for my anxiety to calm down because i didn’t expect a text, but i usually then end up forgetting about it, or remembering but being too anxious to reply and saying i’ll do it “later” until it’s too late. i don’t have this problem when i’m texting people who i talk to daily or i’m close with, just like acquaintances and stuff. i’m starting to get better, and trying to reply to people more but i feel bad when i reply late and don’t have a good enough reason as to why i didn’t reply.	"Hello there,

Firstly, know that you're not alone in feeling this way. It's quite common for anxiety to creep in when it comes to social interactions, even in the tech world. This is a reflection of your mindful sensitivity and not at all something to be ashamed of. 

A few tips that have helped others are:

1. Take a few moments before you open messages. Use this time to do some deep breaths or any other grounding exercises. Encourage yourself to respond, not react.

2. Acknowledge your anxiety. It's okay to be anxious - it’s your mind's response to perceived external pressure. In recognizing it, we can reduce its power. 

3. Practice makes perfect. The more you confront your anxiety, the easier it becomes. Challenge yourself to respond within a certain time frame and gradually reducing it. 

4. Understand that it's okay to respond immediately, and it's okay to take your time. Every individual handles social interaction in their own unique way. 

5. Failing to respond or responding late isn't a mortal sin. You’re allowed to prioritize your well-being. 

6. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) techniques might be helpful. One common technique is to challenge the negative thoughts causing your anxiety, thereby changing your behavior in response. 

Lastly, if you feel your anxiety is impacting your life significantly, do consider seeking help from a professional. They can guide you through it with effective personalized strategies.

Remember, it's okay not to be ""perfect"" at responding. You're doing your best, and every step you take to overcome this, no matter how small, is a victory. We’re rooting for you!"
[32y/o, white male] -- i’ve been struggling with replying to people on social media, especially people i don’t usually talk to. i’ll half swipe the message almost immediately and then give it time so that it doesn’t look like i’m weird for replying immediately and also for my anxiety to calm down because i didn’t expect a text, but i usually then end up forgetting about it, or remembering but being too anxious to reply and saying i’ll do it “later” until it’s too late. i don’t have this problem when i’m texting people who i talk to daily or i’m close with, just like acquaintances and stuff. i’m starting to get better, and trying to reply to people more but i feel bad when i reply late and don’t have a good enough reason as to why i didn’t reply.	"Hey, thanks for opening up about this situation. It's totally okay to take your time to reply to messages, especially when they come from people you don't often communicate with. Replying immediately or late doesn't categorize you as weird, it just shows that you may have other things going on, just like everyone else does. 

In the meantime, you might want to work on managing your anxiety. Deep breathing techniques, grounding exercises, and reminding yourself that it's okay to step away from the phone for a while, can all be effective. Everyone's got their own pace in life - it's totally fine to take it slow.

Also, don't feel pressured to come up with a ""good"" reason for replying late. It's your time, and your right to spend it as you choose. Start by replying to messages whenever you feel comfortable, and gradually challenge yourself to respond at a quicker pace, whenever you feel ready. It's all about progress, not perfection. You're doing amazing already by acknowledging this and reaching out for advice. Keep going!"

"Hey, it's perfectly okay to feel anxious, especially in social situations. It can be overwhelming to communicate with acquaintances or people you wouldn't usually talk to. Remember, everyone operates at their own pace, and it's fine if you need time to compose a reply. A helpful tip could be to compose a general reply that would give you some time and set the recipients at ease, like ""Thanks for reaching out! I'm tied up at the moment but will get back to you soon!"" This way, you acknowledge them, giving you time to reply and reducing potential anxiety. Also, try not to be hard on yourself when you reply late. Most people are understanding and won't hold it against you. But if its causing significant distress, it might be helpful to seek advice from a mental health professional.

Take pride in the fact that you're recognizing this and taking steps to change, that alone shows self-awareness and determination. Try assigning specific times in your day to going through your unread messages, this way, it won't seem as daunting and spontaneous. Additionally, most people understand late replies, we all lead busy lives, so try not to be too hard on yourself.

If you feel this issue is deeply affecting your social relationships or causing you significant distress, consider reaching out to a mental health professional or confiding in somebody you trust. Remember it is okay to seek help and there's no shame in taking care of mental health."

"Hi there, it's great that you're reaching out. It's okay to feel the way you do and I encourage you to not be too hard on yourself. What you're experiencing may be a form of social anxiety which is common. It's important to remember that, in reality, our response times and the nature of interactions often bear little weight on others' perception of us as we think. 

You're already taking steps to overcome it by recognizing the problem and making an effort to change, which is really commendable. Something that could help is setting a specific time of the day to sit down and respond to these messages so you're not caught off guard. You can also practice mindfulness techniques to manage your anxiety when you find it difficult to respond.

However, if you find your anxiety persisting or increasingly interfering with your life, it might be beneficial to consider professional help, like a therapist or counselor, who could provide you healthier coping mechanisms or solutions tailored specifically for you.

Remember, it's okay to feel the way you do, but it's not okay to let it dominate your life. You're stronger than you think! It's a journey and it’s okay to take it one step at a time. You're doing well. Keep going!"

"Hey there - I really appreciate your bravery in sharing this. It's never easy to express such feelings, especially in public. 

It sounds like you experience a good amount of anxiety around replying to acquaintances on your social media feeds. This is more common than you might think, plenty of us struggle with similar feelings. Please, don’t beat yourself up about it, everyone moves at their own pace. 

You may want to try setting aside specific times of the day when you reply to messages. This way, you can mentally prepare and not be caught off guard. Also, remember that you should only reply to messages when you want to, not because you feel pressured to. 

As far as replying late goes, consider this: Most people are understanding when it comes to late replies, provided they receive a meaningful response. So, when you do choose to reply, make it count - it will help make the wait worthwhile for them. 

Please keep pushing boundaries, little by little, in your own time. It's quite alright to go at your own pace. Remember to breathe, and don’t rush yourself. You're making progress and that's the most important thing. Feel free to reach out if you ever need to chat."

"Hey, 

I want you to know that you're not alone in feeling this way. Social media interaction can often feel overwhelming, especially when it comes to responding to acquaintances. But remind yourself that there's no specific time frame in which you're expected to reply, and sometimes, it could take a while -- and that's perfectly okay! 

Develop a routine and a system that works for you. Perhaps setting aside a specific time each day to respond to these kinds of messages could help ease your anxiety. You're also allowed to tell people that you're not comfortable with immediate responses and let them know it takes you a bit longer to reply.

​Also, speaking to a professional about this, such as a therapist or counselor, can be incredibly beneficial. They could provide you with techniques and tactics to cope with your anxiety. You're already making progress by acknowledging the issue and making steps towards addressing it.

Continue on your journey of self-improvement and remember to be kind and patient with yourself. Mistakes are part of growth, and it's absolutely fine not to be perfect. Take care!"

"Hey there,

Thanks so much for sharing; I can definitely relate to your fear of responding to people over social media. It seems like anxiety causes you to second guess your interactions online, particularly with acquaintances or those you don't speak to often. Just remember this: not being able to reply right away is not a shortcoming and you're not the only one who does this. It's okay to take your time and reply when you feel ready.

One thing that has helped me personally is setting designated times to answer messages and keeping phone notifications turned off. Finding ways to manage and relieve anxiety, like deep breathing or any sort of self-care routine can also be beneficial.

Don't forget that it's perfectly okay to tell people you were busy or you needed some time to reply, even if that business was taking care of your mental health. You're entitled to taking time for yourself and prioritizing your well-being. 

Good luck on your journey to better manage your anxiety. You're already making progress by acknowledging your feelings and working on them. Keep it up and take care."

"Hey there, it's absolutely okay to feel anxious about replying to messages on social media, especially from acquaintances. What you're experiencing is more common than you might think.

Firstly, it's important to remember that it's your life, and you're not obligated to reply to everyone or immediately. Take your time. You can even explain to them honestly that you sometimes take longer to reply due to anxiety.

Also, taking small steps towards immediate response can help. Maybe you can start with liking/reacting to their messages, then slowly build up to replying with a word or two, and eventually sentences. 

Another tactic could be to set specific time slots during the day to reply to messages. This way it becomes a part of your routine, and there won't be any instant rush to reply or anxiety that comes from forgetting.

Trust your journey, you're doing great and it's okay to make mistakes. Don't beat yourself up, instead be proud of the progress you're making. Every small step is important. Remember, you're not alone in this. Have you thought about seeking professional help? They can provide you with more structured and tailored guidance."

"Hey there,

Firstly, I want to tell you that you're not alone. Many of us have the same issue, especially those of us who deal with anxiety. It's perfectly okay to feel this way and you shouldn't feel ashamed. Social media, as we all know, is a tricky place to navigate, especially when it's about interaction with people we're not very close to. 

One possible approach is to sort your priorities. If the person is an acquaintance and the message is not urgent, you could allow yourself to put it aside for a while, even if 'a while' turns into a day or two. Remember that everyone has a life outside social media and it's absolutely normal to reply late. There's no need to give a reason for replying late, you have the right to take your time.

As a step to cope with anxiety in these situations, try to cut yourself some slack and remember that it's perfectly okay to not be immediately responsive. You might want to devise a little system for yourself, like setting aside a specific time each day to go over messages, which could possibly help in reducing the anxiety. 

Practice self-compassion by reminding yourself that you’re human and it's okay not to be perfect. Don't beat yourself up over something that's very common. 

Perhaps you might also find it helpful to talk to a mental health professional about your anxiety, they could potentially provide you with some coping strategies. Remember, it's always okay to seek help.

Take care and remember, the most important thing is to be comfortable with yourself and at your own pace."
[32y/o, white male] -- I don't know when exactly it started. Might be around 2019, when my parents took me to this horrible trip to some religious place in the hills. Before this we used to do great trips, London, USA etc which I enjoyed. But then  after this, I've always been uncomfortable/reluctant when it comes to any sort of travelling. Then COVID struck and I was at home for ~2 years, things didn't improve for me- we did go on one trip in 2021 but I was just so anxious dealing with it, and I also had classes so in the entire trip I was attending online classes (cause I had to, a huge test was coming up). My problem is that I'm anxious before the trip happens and during it I'm completely fine. It's gotten better now tho, but not completely cured. Going alone or with friends seems like a mammoth task. Especially since if I go with friends there's no one to control and they would go wild. I know I need to get over this for the future. Any tips?	"Hi there,

It sounds like you're dealing with anticipatory anxiety, where the thought of travelling is causing you more distress than the actual event. It's great that you're aware of the problem and want to work on it. Here are a few techniques that might help:

1. Mindfulness and Breathing: Practice mindfulness and deep breathing exercises to keep yourself grounded in the present moment. This can help control anxiety that comes from worrying about future events.

2. Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT): Consider reaching out to a mental health professional who specializes in CBT. They can guide you through techniques to change your thought patterns and help you react differently to stress triggers.

3. Progressive Desensitization: Start with smaller trips close to home and gradually increase the distance over time. This therapy can help slowly desensitize you to the idea of travelling.

4. Journaling: Write out your thoughts, fears and anxieties about an upcoming trip. This might help you identify specific triggers or patterns.

Remember it's okay to feel anxious, everyone experiences it in different ways. You're already on the right path by seeking help and wanting to improve, so keep pushing forward. 

Lastly, if going with friends makes you uncomfortable, consider finding a travel companion who understands your anxiety and can help you cope with it during the trip. Try not to rush the healing process, it's often a gradual journey, and that's okay. Take care of yourself! 

Best of Luck!"

It sounds like you're going through a rough time. It's not uncommon to struggle with travel health issues or pre-travel anxiety. Given the dramatic shift in your preferred destinations and your anxiety, it seems like the religious trip was a turning point for you. 

First, remember it's okay to feel the way you're feeling. Anxiety can stem from multiple sources, and your current scenario seems to be a perfect storm of COVID restrictions and bad travel memories. 

Next, consider seeking professional help. Therapists and counselors are trained to help you understand and manage anxiety. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has been proven effective in treating anxiety disorders and can help you challenge negative thought patterns associated with travel. 

Also, try to practice mindfulness. Practicing mindfulness before and during your trip might help mitigate your anxiety. There are many resources available online, including apps and tutorials that can guide you through mindfulness exercises. 

Try breaking your trips down into smaller, manageable parts. Instead of thinking about the entire trip, plan it day by day or even hour by hour. You might find the task less daunting. 

Last but not least, challenge yourself within your comfort zone. Maybe try shorter trips first with your friends to see how it goes. And remember, there's no rush. Take your time to feel comfortable with travel again. 

Stay strong and remember it's okay to seek help! You're not alone in this."

Thanks for sharing your situation, it's a tough one but not insurmountable. It sounds like that trip to the religious place in the hills back in 2019 may have created some anxiety around traveling that's still affecting you today. COVID and online classes have also complicated the matters, and I'm sorry to hear that you're struggling with it.

It's good to know that once the trip happens, you're completely fine. So it's definitely the anticipation that's causing you distress. You might want to try some methods to mitigate that. A few things that could possibly help include:

1. Visualization: Try to visually imagine the entire trip from start to finish, focusing on bringing into the experience as many senses as you can and imagining the event in a positive and enjoyable manner.
2. Deep Breathing / Mindfulness: Whenever you feel that rush of anxiety creeping up on you, try practicing deep breathing exercises or mindfulness meditation. These techniques can often help center you in the present and calm racing thoughts.
3. Therapy/Counseling: If you feel this is becoming a significant barrier to your everyday life, consider talking to a therapist or counselor. They can provide professional strategies and coping mechanisms to help handle these feelings of anxiety.
4. Small Steps: Perhaps start with small, short-distance trips alone or with a close friend. Work your way up to longer trips and more people. This method is about easing yourself into the situation gradually to build confidence and decrease anxiety.

Remember, it's okay to acknowledge your fears and insecurities. Seeking help, like what you're doing right here, is already a great step forward. Please take care of yourself. You are not alone in this journey."

It's quite normal to experience anxiety around triggering events, which in your case seems to be traveling after some negative experiences. It's also okay to feel anxious before a trip, it's our body's protective mechanism when we're stepping into the unknown. Even the most seasoned travellers can have bouts of pre-trip anxiety.

Here are a few tips that might work for you. Firstly, try breaking down your trips into smaller manageable steps and visualizing them going well. This couldn't only apply to the entire trip, but even down to the minor details such as packing. This can help you feel more prepared and in control of the situation. 

It's also important to have a support network in place. Be transparent with your friends and family about your anxieties so they can provide support. It might seem difficult, but remember that facing your fears is a process, not something that happens overnight. 

Practicing mindfulness activities might also help. Things like deep breathing, yoga or meditation may help when an anxious loop sets in. 

Lastly, if your anxiety is seriously impacting your life, consider seeking professional help. A therapist or a counselor may be able to provide you with anxiety coping mechanisms or therapeutic techniques that will allow you to regain control of your life. 

Take everything one step at a time and remember, it's completely okay to be scared of something new. But also remember that it's extremely empowering to overcome these fears. Best of luck to you!"

"Hey there, it sounds like you're going through a tough time with travel anxiety. It's perfectly okay to feel anxious and it's also common to experience a heightened sense of anxiety especially when prepping for a trip. Here's a few recommendations that can be helpful while dealing with pre-travel stress.

1. **Identify the Source**: The first move is to comprehend what triggers your travel anxiety. Is it the fear of the unknown? Is it being in a new environment? Once you're able to figure out those triggers, it'll be easier for you to manage and control them.

2. **Practice Mindfulness**: Mindfulness practices such as yoga or meditation can aid in reducing anxiety. You can start small with just 5-10 minutes a day and increase gradually as you become more comfortable. 

3. **Preparation and Planning**: Structure can make the unknowns feel a lot less scary. Make checklists of what you need to do before you leave, and how to tackle various scenarios that make you nervous. The more prepared you feel, the less overwhelming the journey can seem.

4. **Seek Professional Help**: If the stress becomes overwhelming, it's okay to seek help from a mental health professional. Therapy can provide you long-term strategies and coping mechanisms. 

Remember, no one trip dictates your entirety of traveling experiences in the future. Give yourself some grace, seek support when you need it, and keep in mind that just reaching out and expressing your fears is a significant first step. Stay strong, you can do this!"

It sounds like you have some type of travelling anxiety that originated from a negative experience you had on that trip with your parents. It's not uncommon for such events to significantly impact our psyche and develop into a kind of fear or anxiety, often subconsciously. 

It's a good sign that you're able to identify the source of your anxiety, and recognition is the first step to changing or overcoming this. It would be beneficial to practice some cognitive behavioral techniques, such as self-awareness during anxious thoughts and replacing them with more positive thoughts. 

Also, being in control seems important to you. This could be a sense of security, knowing that everything is under your control. Perhaps you should contemplate booking your own trips in which you control the schedule, the places to visit, etc, at first just short trips and gradually moving onto more extended ones.

Opening up to friends about your situation might help too. They might also have useful perspectives or suggestions, as well as displaying understanding about maintaining a balance during trips and not 'going wild.'

Lastly, don't hesitate to seek professional help, whether through a licensed therapist or counselor. Sometimes these anxieties run deeper than surface level and can be symptomatic of other issues. You don't have to deal with this alone, always remember that!"
[32y/o, white male] -- I don't know when exactly it started. Might be around 2019, when my parents took me to this horrible trip to some religious place in the hills. Before this we used to do great trips, London, USA etc which I enjoyed. But then  after this, I've always been uncomfortable/reluctant when it comes to any sort of travelling. Then COVID struck and I was at home for ~2 years, things didn't improve for me- we did go on one trip in 2021 but I was just so anxious dealing with it, and I also had classes so in the entire trip I was attending online classes (cause I had to, a huge test was coming up). My problem is that I'm anxious before the trip happens and during it I'm completely fine. It's gotten better now tho, but not completely cured. Going alone or with friends seems like a mammoth task. Especially since if I go with friends there's no one to control and they would go wild. I know I need to get over this for the future. Any tips?	"Hi there,

Firstly, I want to acknowledge your courage for sharing what you're going through. It's absolutely normal to have travel anxiety and many people experience this from time to time. You are not alone in feeling this way and there are various ways to manage this anxiety.

One key point to remind yourself is that past experiences don't necessarily predict future ones. It sounds like you had a particularly stressful trip back in 2019, and it's normal that this has caused some anxiety around traveling now. But remember, not all trips are the same, and you may have many great trips ahead of you.

If you can identify exactly what aspect of traveling makes you anxious, you can find ways to minimize those stressors. For instance, if planning is stressful, perhaps try to simplify it - plan less in a day, focus on one or two key activities you'll enjoy, and allow lots of downtime in between.

Try getting out more often in your home city or nearby towns to gradually build up your confidence traveling alone or with friends. Small steps will eventually make bigger trips more manageable.

You mentioned an instance when you went on a trip while having online classes and felt a lot of pressure. Perhaps ensuring you have a clear schedule, with no assignments or exams close by, could make the travel experience more relaxing and enjoyable.

In addition, practicing stress-relief techniques such as meditation, deep breathing exercises or light physical activities could be beneficial.

You're already making progress since you've noticed things have gotten better with time. Be patient with yourself, it’s okay to feel uncomfortable and anxious, the key is not to let it stop you from enjoying your life and the experiences it brings. You've got this!"

"First and foremost, you're definitely not alone in feeling this way and I want to commend you for being proactive and reaching out for tips to overcome your travel anxiety. Addressing your concerns in stages might be helpful.

A technique that could be useful is visualization. Before your journey, close your eyes and visualize yourself traveling and arriving to your destination safely. Imagine the entire process in small stages and, most importantly, imagine how you will feel having successfully completed your trip. 

Furthermore, you may find it helpful to discuss your feelings with your friends before planning a trip together. They may not be aware of your anxiety and may help alleviate your concerns by pacing the travel plan at a comfortable pace for you. 

It's also worth considering practising mindfulness techniques, deep-breathing exercises, or other calming strategies during the onset of anxiety. Remember, there's no rush - take small steps towards achieving this goal.

Lastly, talking to a professional therapist about your anxiety might be beneficial, as they can provide advice tailored specifically to your situation."

It sounds like you've been going through a tough time and I'm sorry you're experiencing this. I've gathered from your post that you may have developed anxiety related to travelling, which may have been triggered by that specific trip. What you're feeling is completely valid and more common than you might think.

You mentioned that being anxious before the trip happens is a problem for you. One solution could be to involve yourself more in the planning stages. Knowing exactly what the travel itinerary looks like might help to ease some of the uncertainty. 

On the other hand, you also mentioned that you're fine once you're actually on the trip. It might be that the anticipation is worse than the event itself, which is another common anxiety indicator. Preparing yourself mentally before the trip could be a good technique. This could be done by practicing mindfulness or deep-breathing exercises to help you cope with your anxiety. 

Regarding your concerns about travelling with friends, try having an open, honest conversation about your anxiety. They might be more understanding than you anticipate, and may even adjust their behaviours to make the trip more enjoyable for you.

Progress might feel slow, but remember that it's okay to take small steps. Perhaps start with short trips or explore new places within your city. This can serve as a practice on a smaller scale and gradually make you more comfortable with travelling.

Lastly, if you find these strategies aren't enough, consider seeking professional help such as a therapist, as they're equipped to help with anxiety-related issues specifically.

Remember, you're not alone in this. Take care and good luck!"

"It's very brave of you to acknowledge your anxiety and reach out for help. A change in experience, such as your unpleasant trip in 2019, can indeed have a lasting impact. Sometimes, specific incidents can evoke feelings of discomfort or anxiety and it's completely normal. It’s good to hear that you feel fine during the trips, it seems like it's the anticipation that is causing most of the stress. 

Try to focus on the positive aspects of your trip and the fun elements you'll be able to enjoy. When you feel anxious, grounding techniques such as deep breathing, visualization, or journaling can help regulate your nervous system and manage anxiety. Also, it might help to talk this out with your friends. Let them know about your apprehensions and find a balance where you all can have a good time, yet in a controlled manner.

Consider speaking to a licensed mental health professional who can provide you with further assistance based on your specific needs. Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is proven to be an effective treatment for anxiety disorders, which includes techniques to gradually face and cope with the situations you're afraid of.

Remember, overcoming anxiety is a process, and it's okay to take your time. No journey is too small if it leads to a healthier you. Take care!"
"[32y/o, white male] -- Im sorry for this little rant here but i dont know what else to do… I have been clinically depressed since i was 14 and although i am sure i have had happy moments or times when everything didnt feel so dark i keep coming back to the same place emotionally. 
I wanted to try journaling or smth like that but i felt so dumb so i came to this community to just type my thoughts. When i was younger no matter how hard things were academically, sociallly or emotionally my mom was there but she has been diagnosed with dementia for 2 years now and i lost the one person that i could talk to freely. 
I have seen been kind of parenting my dad and while im away in uni he is all alone so im scared for him all the time because he doesnt take care of himself and he has a serious heart condition. 
Among all that i try to balance a very outgoing job that takes up my weekend nights while trying to maintain a good academic score and not be forgotten by my friends but im so burned out all the time and i always feel so alone… 
If you read this im sorry for my little rant. I hope it gets better for all of us."	"Hey there. First and foremost, I want you to know that by speaking about what you're going through, you've taken a major step. It's incredibly brave to open up about your mental health struggles and you should definitely give yourself credit for that. It's evident that you're dealing with a lot—managing your depression, caring for your parents, balancing work, academics, and a social life. It's understandable why you feel burned out and alone.

I know you feel dumb for considering journaling, but don't let that stop you. Expressing your thoughts and emotions might offer you a little clarity and relief. It's not a cure-all, but many have found it to be a useful tool. Remember, it's for YOU and there's no right or wrong way to do it. 

In dealing with your mom and dad, it sounds like you are taking on a lot by yourself. It might be helpful to seek or join a support group for caregivers dealing with similar situations or look into local resources that can provide some assisted services to help lighten your load. 

It's important to prioritize self-care and to not feel selfish for doing so. You cannot pour from an empty cup, as they say. Talk to your university about what's going on. There might be resources available for you to get therapy or counseling, or even academic assistance to help lighten your load. 

You don't deserve to feel alone and there are people who want to help. Thank you for sharing your story. You're stronger than you realize. Reach out to your resources. I hope things get better for you. Remember that there's no shame in seeking professional help.

Take care of yourself. We're here for you."

First and foremost, you need not apologize for seeking support. This is what this community is here for, and please do not feel ashamed or embarrassed about wanting to let your thoughts out. 

Living with depression can be exceptionally challenging, let alone balancing it with the struggles you described. It's absolutely valid that you're feeling this way. I admire your bravery coping with all this. You're taking on a lot, and your resilience in facing these challenges is commendable. 

Journaling is a great tool that can help with your mental health. You mentioned feeling silly, but please know there are no right or wrong ways to journal. You write for yourself and no one else has to see it. You're already doing a form of journaling by sharing here, it may benefit to try it out on a personal level as well. 

I also want to stress how important it is to practice self-care. You're bearing a lot of weight, which is enough for multiple people. It’s crucial to find small, maintainable ways to de-stress. This could be listening to favorite music, taking a short walk, having a bubble bath or a favorite healthy snack. 

About your dad, have you considered any care or support groups for him? They could provide some assistance, allowing you to focus slightly more on your other responsibilities. It must feel overwhelming multiplexing between your father’s needs, your education, maintaining friendships, and handling a demanding job. 

Feeling alone is a very common sentiment but, believe me; you're not. You maybe find benefit in seeking out a professional counselor or a licensed therapist who could offer you guidance and strategies for these distressing feelings. 

Please remember, you're not alone, and it's okay to let others share in your burdens. Wishing you strength and courage as you continue to navigate your way."

Firstly, I just want to say it's not a rant. It's important for us to express our feelings openly, and you're in a safe place here. It's clear you're dealing with a lot, and I can sense the emotional exhaustion in your words. It's really tough to manage studies and work whilst shouldering emotional burdens, and I wholeheartedly empathize. You're carrying a lot on your shoulders, and it's ok to feel overwhelmed.

Your mom's situation must be tough on you. Dementia is cruel, but just know that you being there for her means the world. For your dad, perhaps consider exploring support groups or resources for him. They can be a great way for him to connect with others in similar situations, share his concerns and not feel so alone, allowing you to catch a breather and focus on your own well-being.

Exploring therapy, if you haven't, could be beneficial. A professional could provide coping mechanisms and strategies to combat the emotional exhaustion and feelings of loneliness. This might also be the appropriate time to explore options about antidepressants with a health professional if you haven't considered that yet. 

Remember, you're not alone in this. We're all in it together, and it's ok to seek help without feeling any guilt or embarrassment. Just take one moment, one emotion, one day at a time. I'm rooting for you and sending heaps of positive energy your way.

Things do eventually get better, so don't lose hope. You're stronger than you realize.

Take care,
[Your Name]"

First of all, I just want to say there's no need to apologize for expressing your feelings. This community is exactly the place for doing just that and we're here to listen to each other. Life is throwing you some incredibly tough situations right now, and I can tell you're doing your absolute best to handle them.

It's truly commendable how you're stepping up in your family, both in your mom's absence and with your dad. I guarantee they appreciate your efforts, even if they can't express it. 

Balancing university, an outgoing job, and a social life is tough enough without everything else you're dealing with. Burnout is definitely a reasonable feeling to have, given your circumstances. 

It sounds like right now, you're holding everything together by the sheer strength of your will. Unfortunately, that's not sustainable- we're all human, and we have our limits. It can be hard to seek out help, but sometimes it's necessary. You don't need to do everything on your own. Try reaching out to the resources available at your university or looking into outside counselling or therapy where you can share your burdens with someone trained to help. 

Regarding your dad's health, is there any chance of involving a nurse or in-home caregiver? With your busy schedule, it must be extremely hard to keep an eye on him, and you could use the help.

And lastly, allow yourself some time and space if you can. Try to limit the number of nights you're working if it's causing you significant stress. It might mean cutting down on some expenses or finding less demanding work, but your mental health should be a priority.

Remember, it's not weak to admit when things are tough, nor is it weak to ask for help. You're stronger than you give yourself credit for, and things will get better gradually.

Hang in there, buddy. We're all rooting for you.

It's really good that you're reaching out. From your post it sounds like you are carrying a lot in your plate right now. Dealing with depression itself is a huge challenge, also managing high anxiety about a loved one's health, your work, your academics and maintaining your social life is surely overwhelming. 

Have you considered seeking professional help? A therapist can provide coping strategies at times of stress and may help addressing your loneliness and burnout. It might be helpful for you to have somebody to talk to, somebody who won't judge and will listen. Don't forget, it's okay to take some time for yourself too. You're doing your best and that's enough. 

Try reconnecting with your friends, they can provide a good support system and you'd be surprised on how much they may understand what you're going through. Most importantly, don't hesitate to reach out when you're feeling this way. You're not alone in this and there are many people both in your personal life and on this forum who want to support you. You're right, we're all hoping it gets better. We're here for you."

You're not alone - there are many others who've been in your shoes. It's absolutely okay to admit when things are not okay. 

First and foremost, remember it's okay to take care of yourself as well. You're dealing with a lot at once- your mom's diagnosis, your academic pressure, your job and worry for your dad. Practicing self-care and setting boundaries for yourself might help you guard your well-being amidst all these challenges; giving yourself permission to take breaks, relax, and decompress can be beneficial. 

It's great that you've reached out on here, and there are other places you can contact if you need someone to talk to, such as crisis lines or mental health organizations. They are trained professionals who might be able to provide you with resources in your community or online. Another resource is therapy, of which there are now many online options. 

Seeking help from your uni's student support services can relieve some of your academic stress. There might be allowances or extensions available given your current circumstances.

Connecting with others can also help with feelings of loneliness. If you're feeling distanced from your friends, it can be helpful to reach out to them and let them know what you're going through. 

Remember, it's never a burden to ask for help and there's always better days ahead."

It takes a lot of strength and courage to open up, and trust me, you're not alone. Your feelings of exhaustion and burnout are valid, given you're juggling so many responsibilities. 

Firstly, about your mother's dementia - I'm so sorry to hear about that. It must have been hard for you. That said, there are several support groups online where you could connect with people going through a similar situation. This could potentially help you.

As for your dad, have you considered discussing options for his care? It might be possible for a home carer to help him, so you're not bearing that burden alone. His health condition is serious and requires professional management.

You're leading a very fulfilling life, balancing studies and a demanding job. But remember to take out time for self-care. Exercise, meditate and if possible, meet a mental health expert. 

And don't worry about getting your thoughts out there. Writing them down is very therapeutic. No matter how you phrase them, what's important is that you're venting your feelings. 

The path might feel dark, but remember that every day is a new beginning. Things might not seem okay now, but they will eventually get better. And we're here, reading your thoughts and supporting you. You aren't alone. Feel free to express your feelings here anytime you want. Stay strong."

To navigate through life while caring for your sick parents, studying at uni, working a rigorous job & maintaining friendships is quite a feat and it's understandable you're feeling this way. You're indeed strong despite feeling very alone.

Journaling is a proven cognitive tool to help with thoughts. If it felt awkward, that's nothing to be embarrassed about. All new habits take time and aren't comfortable at first. It might be worth giving another go, started with just few minutes.

Seeking help through this community is a great step, because shared experiences typically assist us to cope better. You might also want to explore speaking with a therapist or counselor, ideally one who specializes in terminal illnesses. They can provide valuable perspectives and coping mechanisms. 

Engage with your friends about how you're feeling, or go out and do things that make you happy. Allocating time for self-care can be both, therapeutic and rejuvenating.

Lastly, remember to take care of your physical health, too. Ensure you're eating well and getting enough rest; it's easy to neglect these things when we're absorbed in our problems. 

You're not alone in this journey - there's help available, you just need to reach out. Take care."

First and foremost, thank you for sharing your thoughts and emotions. Acknowledging what's going on internally and reaching out takes a lot of strength. You're going through an incredibly tough time, managing your emotional health, academics, a demanding career, and caring for your parents. It's only natural you're feeling overwhelmed. 

It could be helpful to break things down. One at a time. Just breathe. Dealing with depression is not easy, and lack of a strong support system can make it feel even more isolating. However, remember, there are always people willing to help and listen (even if it doesn't seem like it, someone cares). 

Reach out to your university's counseling/mental health services if you haven't done so already. Many educational institutions have a range of resources that can provide therapeutic and academic assistance to students undergoing stress. 

Regarding balancing your job, academics and caregiving, consider talking with your tutor or course administrator about flexibility due to your circumstances. At work, if it's possible, discuss your situation with your manager or HR, they may be able to help too. 

Lastly, try to build a support network around yourself. Reach out to friends or join clubs at your university or society groups in your local area. Isolation is a common feeling when facing depression, but connecting with others can be beneficial to your mental health. At your own pace, of course.

I also want to remind you about hotlines, available 24/7, providing emotional support whenever you feel the need to talk. 

And remember it isn't wrong or shameful to ask for help, and you're never alone. Yes, life is tough, but so are you. Please, keep reaching out, keep talking. Wishing you courage and strength. It's okay to feel like this, and it's okay to ask for help. You matter. 

Take care."

First of all, I really appreciate your courage to open up about what you're going through. We all struggle in our own ways and it's commendable that you want to avoid causing harm to your loved ones. 

Managing emotions can often be difficult, especially when we feel we're losing control. It sounds like you care deeply about the people in your life and that's why you're so frustrated. It might be beneficial if you try to seek professional help, like a therapist or counselor, who can provide guidance and assistance when it comes to managing these emotions better. They can provide coping strategies and help you understand your feelings.

I would also suggest keeping open lines of communication with your loved ones. If they understand your struggle, it could help them support you better during this time. Also, remember that it's okay to take time for yourself, if that's what you need right now. 

Always remember, it's a process and it takes time. You've taken the first step by recognizing there's a problem and seeking advice, which is great. Please consider seeking professional advice as they are well-equipped to help in such situations.

"It takes a lot of courage to recognize and admit when our actions are causing harm to others, so kudos to you for that initial step. From your post, it seems like you're dealing with a lot of emotions that are difficult to control. You’re not alone in this. Emotional regulation is a struggle many people face but there are strategies that can help.

Consider reaching out to a mental health provider, like a therapist or counselor. They can help teach you coping mechanisms to better handle, express, and navigate your feelings in a healthy way. It's also a great way to vent any bottled-up feelings.

Online resources can be really helpful too. Websites like PsychologyToday have many articles about emotion management. Even finding a mindfulness or meditation app could help you calm down in moments of intense emotion.

Finally, opening up to those who you trust about what you're going through can be therapeutic. It can also give them a better understanding of your struggles and they'll be more likely to support your journey towards better emotional regulation.

Remember, it's okay to not be okay. Everyone is on a journey in understanding and managing their emotions. Keep searching for strategies that work for you. I believe in your ability to change and grow. Better days are ahead!"

I really admire your self-awareness and the accountability you're taking. That shows a lot of strength and resilience which is extremely valuable. It's great that you are thinking about how your actions might impact the people around you. Remember, it's not about isolating yourself but rather finding healthier ways to express your emotions. 

Mental and emotional health is a journey and it’s okay if you don’t have all the answers right now. You may want to talk to a professional who can support and guide you through this process. They’ll be able to help you make sense of what you’re going through and equip you with the tools needed to manage your emotions better. 

Another suggestion is mindfulness and meditation. It might sound cliche, but these can have a profoundly calming effect, and over time can really assist in fostering emotional stability.

Share your feelings instead of acting on them can also be liberating. If you feel yourself getting overwhelmed, let the person know. Communication is key.

Remember, it’s okay to distance yourself until you feel you're in a healthier place - so long as you explain this to those around you, I'm sure they'll understand. We all need space to heal sometimes.

Remember, this is just advice - it might be helpful, it might not. I would highly encourage seeking professional help or reaching out to a hotline if you're struggling."

It sounds like you're going through a really tough time, but please know that you're not alone. Many people have trouble managing their emotions, and it can be really challenging to realize how these emotions are affecting our relationships. The key is to know that you've taken a huge first step in identifying the problem and seeking help, which should be applauded. 

Firstly, I would recommend finding a professional therapist or counselor to talk through these feelings with - they can provide strategies and a safe place to explore what's going on. As for managing your emotions, engaging in activities like mindfulness and meditation can be beneficial. This can help you to focus on the present moment and prevent you from acting out on impulse, and it might potentially reduce your anger issues.  

Furthermore, have you considered discussing this with your friends? People can be more understanding than we give them credit for. Just explaining to them that you're struggling might make a big difference, and they may even be able to provide support.

Remember, change takes time, so don't be too hard on yourself. You're doing your best, and that is enough. Reach out to any available resources, stay connected and be kind to yourself."

It's brave you to admit what's happening in your life right now. Isolation isn't always the best way to deal with matters of the heart, yet I understand the need to protect those we love from our emotional storms. You're in a tough situation, and I see the battle you're fighting.

It sounds like you need strategies to better manage your emotions. Emotional regulation is like any skill—an art that can be mastered with time, practice, and a little help. I encourage you to reach out to a therapist or counselor. They can guide you on your journey towards embracing and managing your emotions healthily without it impacting others negatively.

Exercise, diet, and sleep are vital contributors to our emotional wellbeing. You may benefit from maintaining a daily routine that ensures you're taking care of your physical health.

Understanding that everyone makes mistakes is also important. You might feel that you're the only one with these problems but many have walked paths similar to yours. Don’t be too hard on yourself.

Have you considered joining a support group? Hearing others' experiences and building connections could be helpful. Browse online for some in your local area.

Remember, you don't have to face these challenges alone. It's okay to seek advice and ask for help when you need it. Your willingness to change is already a huge step towards progress. Best of luck.

And the last thing: take it one day at a time. Some days will be easier than others, but that's okay. What matters is that you keep going."

Wow, but first of all, thank you for being so brave as to open up about this. It's really commendable, and a great first step towards making improvements. Based on what you’ve written, it seems like you’re dealing with a lot of self-blame, anger, and internal turmoil. While it's good that you're considerate about the impact of your actions on those around you, it's still very crucial not to isolate yourself from your support network. 

Your decision to face and improve your emotional control is clearly a display of strength and self-awareness. I would recommend reaching out to a professional therapist or counselor, who can offer you strategies to manage these overwhelming emotions. If you're worried about the impact on others, individual therapy may be a safe space for you to explore these emotions without hurting others.

Don’t forget that this journey to self-improvement always takes time and effort. It might feel rocky and uncomfortable at first but with the right support, you can navigate through this. Learning to control and understand your emotions is never an easy task, but remember, each small step you take is progress.

Stay strong and take care!"

First and foremost, I want to commend your self-awareness and accountability. Realizing when we hurt others and resolving to make positive changes is a monumental step. However, isolating yourself from others may not solve the issue. Human beings are social creatures, we need interaction, empathy, and understanding from others--especially during tough times. 

Regarding the emotional aspect, it's important to understand that emotions are not inherently harmful. They are a natural response. But it seems you're having difficulties properly managing and expressing your emotions, which can be overwhelming. There are many ways these issues can be addressed. Reading about emotional intelligence or self-help books might assist--so might talking therapies like cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). 

However, what raises the most concern in your post is the mention of physical harm. That is a serious matter and no one should be at risk, including yourself. While it's clear that you're in pain and experiencing difficulties, it's crucial for you and the people around you to be safe. If you find that you are unable to control your actions to the point of hurting others physically, please reach out to a professional--a mental health counselor, psychologist, or psychiatrist. They are there to help you navigate through these difficult moments and work with you on strategies to manage your anger and express your emotions in a healthier way. You don't have to go through this alone, help is available. Resources such as National Domestic Violence Hotline, National Suicide Prevention Lifeline and Crisis Text Line can be helpful.

You clearly have a lot of love for those around you and a strong desire not to harm them. That's something to build on. Please, don't hesitate to reach out to professionals who can offer you support and guidance. This is not a weakness, but a strength. Mental health matters just as physical health does and you're entitled to seek help.

Take care of yourself,
[Your Name]

"Hi there, it indeed sounds like you're going through a tough time, and it's brave of you to reach out for advice in this space. Identifying that your emotions and behaviors could potentially harm others is a significant first step. 

Here is a suggestion: Consider reaching out to a mental health professional who could provide guidance and coping mechanisms to help you regain better emotional control. They have the expertise and training to help you explore these issues in depth. You don't have to go through this alone.

Remember, it's important to take care of your own mental health, and it's okay to seek friends' support, maybe even those you don't see in person, but ensure that the support you're looking for doesn't negatively impact them. 

Lastly, participating in meditative practices or engaging in activities that help in stress management might be beneficial. Regular physical exercise can improve your mood and behavior too.

I want you to remember that what you're going through is temporary and treatable with the right help and support. Be patient with yourself and take it one day at a time. Hang in there!"

"Hey there. It's impressive to see that you recognize your emotions are causing distress to those around you, and it's admirable that you're taking steps to protect them and seeking advice on how to navigate this journey. 

You seem to care deeply about others, and it's really hard when we hurt the people we care about. Experiencing intense, uncontrollable emotions can leave us feeling powerless, but remember that you're not alone. Many people struggle with finding healthy ways to cope with overwhelming emotions. 

What you're describing could be symptoms of various mental health issues. Have you considered speaking to a mental health professional about this? It could be useful to get an expert's perspective and strategies for managing your emotions. 

Practicing mindfulness can also be beneficial as it teaches us to become more aware of our emotions, eventually enabling us to react differently. Journaling your thoughts and feelings might be another helpful tool. 

At the end of the day, it's about understanding emotions are part of being human and it's okay to feel them. What's next is trying to learn to respond, rather than react, to these emotions.

Remember, it's our actions and responses to our feelings that matter. It may be a challenging journey, but one that's definitely worth undertaking. Your sincerity and determination are clear, and that's a remarkable and powerful starting point towards self-improvement. You've got this!"

First off, kudos to you for seeking advice during a tough time. Your self-awareness about your emotional well-being and its impact on others is a vital first step towards improvement. 

It's essential to understand that it's entirely okay to have intense emotions. But what matters is how we articulate them without causing harm to others or ourselves. As per your post, one significant step you can take is to learn emotional regulation or anger management techniques. 

There are online self-help guides, books, and professional therapists or counselors who can walk you through these skills. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) might be beneficial, which can help you explore the links between thoughts, emotions, and behaviors.

Also, connecting with people who make you feel seen and understood can help. Find an emotional support network – friends, family, or online communities can help you feel less isolated during difficult times. 

However, if you believe you might harm yourself or others, please seek professional help immediately. Many hotlines are available 24/7 that can provide immediate assistance. 

Remember, reaching out for help isn't a sign of weakness, but strength. Good luck!"

Thank you for sharing your feelings and experiences with us. I can't begin to imagine how difficult it must be to constantly grapple with these sorts of struggles. Firstly, know that you are not alone and many people face similar problems. It's unfortunate that your familial background has contributed to these patterns, but it's great that you are acknowledging them and are willing to work towards improvement, that's a great first step!

Adopting healthier coping mechanisms could be a good starting point. For example, you could channel your energies into productive activities like exercise, art, reading, etc. Addressing our patterns is a complex process that usually requires some guidance. Seeking therapy or counseling could be a valuable step as mental health professionals are equipped to provide strategies and coping mechanisms. 

Also, there are numerous support groups both online and offline from which you could seek companionship and understanding. It can be heartening to connect with individuals who have gone through similar situations and successfully overcome them.

Remember, each day is a new chance to make better choices. You sound like a strong individual and I am sure you can fight this. All the best on your journey, and don’t hesitate to ask for advice when you need it."

"Hey there, it takes a lot of courage to acknowledge a struggle like this, so right off the bat, good for you. It sounds like you're aware of your addictive behavior and that's such an important first step. You're definitely not alone in this. 

Growing up in a household with an addicted parent can deeply impact your own relationship with potentially addictive substances or behaviors, leading to a pattern that seems hard to break. It's crucial to remember that breaking this cycle can be difficult, but it's definitely not impossible.

Therapy, whether group or individual, might be a beneficial starting point. Professionals can help by providing techniques to break the cycle of addiction. Resources such as SMART Recovery (an international non-profit organization) can provide tools and support for coping with addictive behaviors. 

Another potential avenue is to channel the addictive behavior into something positive and healthy, like exercise, a hobby, or volunteering. This could provide a type of 'substitute addiction’ that is beneficial to your overall health and well-being.

Remember, there's no shame in seeking help, and just because you've struggled with addictions in the past, it doesn't define you. We are all works in progress. You're doing great by reaching out, keep going, one day at a time."

A trained counselor or therapist, for instance, could provide effective strategies for managing addictive behaviors. It could also be beneficial to find something healthy that you enjoy to take up some of that mental and physical energy, like exercise or a hobby. 

Remember, connecting and sharing with others about your struggles can bring a sense of relief. Mental health communities, both online and offline, can provide ample support. You're certainly not alone."

You're definitely not alone. It sounds like you've had a lot on your plate from a young age and have displayed a resilient spirit, so don't forget to give yourself credit for that. People tend to develop addictive behaviors as a way to cope with some underlying issues. Have you considered seeking professional help? Therapists can assist by giving you tools and techniques to manage these behaviors, and also addressing the underlying issues fueling them. 

Try engaging yourself in some healthy activities that you enjoy. Physical activities, arts, reading, cooking – whatever suits your taste. Instead of trying to stop these addictions, try redirecting your attention to constructive habits or hobbies that keep your mind occupied and provide a sense of fulfilment. 

It's wonderful that you're understanding and accepting your situation. Remember, this journey takes time and patience, but with the right help and support, things can improve.-April_Lemon

"[32y/o, white male] --      So ima just keep this short, but most of my life I’ve never gotten attention from my parents.

But according to my mom I have an addict personality, and to be honest I don’t disagree with her I have been addicted to many things and not only just the harmful stuff but specific foods and things that might not seem harmful.

"Hey there, it sounds like you're really going through a tough time. It's challenging to break a cycle, especially if it's been a part of your life from a young age. Feeling neglected can have just as significant of an impact on our mental health as more explicit forms of trauma. It's also perfectly natural to seek comfort in things that make us feel good, though in excess these things can become addictive. 

Seeking support from a professional could be helpful for you. A trained mental health professional ideally has experience with these feelings and could give you ways to cope and work through them. It's great that you're reaching out already, acknowledging the issue is a big first step. 

At the same time, have you considered self-care activities, hobbies or exercises as a way to divert your attention? If it's something that promotes positivity and is good for your overall wellbeing, it could be a good outlet for you. 

Also, consider joining support groups. A supportive community can foster connection and understanding, making you feel less alone. Remember, it's okay to seek and ask for help. You're not the only one, always remember that! 

You're facing a real challenge but are introspective enough to acknowledge it and seek help. That's something to be proud of. Remember it's a journey, not a destination. Be patient with yourself. We're rooting for you."

I'm really sorry to hear about what you're going through. It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge our struggles and seek help, so kudos to you for taking that first step. It seems like you're dealing with a pattern of addiction that can indeed be difficult to break on your own. 

You're definitely not alone in this, and it's important you know that. A lot of people have experienced this rollercoaster of an addictive cycle and have been able to overcome it with the right help and guidance. There's no shame in seeking professional help like therapy or counseling. It's actually a great place to start as they can provide you with tools to understand and manage your addictive tendencies. 

You might also want to explore mindfulness and self-care strategies. They can be helpful in managing cravings or breaking addictive cycles. Simple things like going for a walk, practicing deep breathing, and journaling about your thoughts and feelings could help you cope.

Finally, consider joining a support group. Having a community of people who’ve had similar experiences can be very encouraging and helpful while paving the way to recovery. Remember, recovery takes time and it's okay to move at your own pace. Don't lose heart. You've got this!"

"Hey there, I'm really sorry to hear that you're experiencing this. Relationships with parents, especially when they're distracted or struggling with their own issues, can certainly affect us in a variety of ways, including developing addictive behaviours as coping mechanisms. Addictive behaviours can be very challenging to break free from and it's courageous of you to reach out, acknowledge these patterns and be willing to seek change. 

Firstly, you are not alone and this is a struggle many people go through. A variety of tools and resources can aid in managing addictive behaviours. For instance, cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) has been shown to be particularly effective, as it can help us understand and change thought patterns that lead to harmful behaviors. Similarly, group therapy or support groups can attract individuals who've experienced similar struggles and may offer valuable advice and empathy.

Maintaining a healthy lifestyle overall - like a balanced diet, regular exercise, and adequate sleep - may have a profound impact on reducing addictive behaviours. It's important to replace unhealthy habits with constructive ones, be it learning a new skill, immersing yourself in a hobby, or simply taking time for relaxation and self-care. 

Remember, it's okay to seek professional help. Therapists and counselors are skilled in addressing these issues and can work with you to strategize a plan to overcome these tendencies. Please do reach out to a mental health professional in your area - they'll be able to provide you with the guidance and support you need. It's a difficult journey, but remember, each small victory counts. Stay strong!"

I'm really sorry to hear that you're going through this. Addiction can definitely be a complex issue, can't it? It's great that you've started to notice the patterns in your life and are reaching out and making the effort to understand more about yourself. Self-awareness is the very first step to improvement.

While I won't pretend to have all the answers, I would suggest trying to replace the harmful addictions with healthier ones. For example, some people find solace in physical activities like hiking or swimming. This can help distract your mind and work towards forming a more beneficial habit.

Others find art, music, or reading rather therapeutic; these activities can help channel those addictive tendencies into something more productive.

As you progress, you might find that you're slowly but surely shifting towards a lifestyle that's less dependent on these addictions. It's a slow and gradual process, and remember, it's okay if you stumble. What's important is to never give up on yourself.

Seeking help from a professional can also provide additional support and resources that are specific to your situation. Working with a therapist who specializes in these issues can be beneficial. Furthermore, joining a group therapy or support group might make you feel less alone. 

Hope you find this advice helpful. Remember that it's okay to seek help and it doesn't make you weak. You're definitely not alone in this. I wish you all the best on your journey towards healing."

Firstly, I'm sorry to hear that you're going through this and I want you to know that you're definitely not alone. Many people have struggled with addictive behaviors, whether it's to substances, certain behaviors, or even food. It's very common and it's something that can be worked through with time, patience, and support. 

It sounds like you're very self-aware and that's a great first step. Recognizing your patterns and acknowledging them is half the battle. It's also possible that your addictive behaviors could be a coping mechanism for something deeper, such as trauma or emotional neglect. It may be helpful to explore this with a mental health professional, if you feel comfortable doing so.

Healthy habits can be formed as substitutes for the harmful ones. This could be something simple like going for a walk, meditating, listening to music, reading, or any activity that you find enjoyable and relaxing.

Remember, it's important not to judge yourself too harshly as the journey towards improvement is often filled with ups and downs. Consider seeking professional help, they really can provide you with the tools and strategies you need to combat this. A counselor, therapist, or even a support group could be extremely beneficial.

Please take care of yourself, and continue reaching out for help. Good luck on your journey."
"[32y/o, white male] -- I know... it affects me. I had my sleep on schedule before but the recent events didn't allow me to have a good sleep. But it's fine. I can change it slowly.

Also I had a small good conversation with someone which made me happy that moment.

I was supposed to go to see my psychiatrist but I didn't go because I was scared. It's really hard to go there. But it's ok at least I tried to think about going there. I need to change my medicines.

Firstly, thank you for sharing. It does sound like you're dealing with a lot right now. Recent events can greatly throw off routines and affect our mood considerably. It’s ok to feel scared about seeing your psychiatrist. Remember, taking small steps, as you've mentioned - trying to think about going there - actually counts a lot. 

It's incredibly important to prioritize your sleep. Sleep is like a reset button for us; it helps our bodies and minds heal. You've shown resilience and it's okay if change is slow. Healing doesn't happen overnight.

The loneliness you're feeling is also something a lot of us face. The good thing is, you're not alone in this. Tons of people, many of whom are on here, can relate and are willing to lend an ear or share a kind word.

It's great to hear about your positive interaction. Even a small bit of positive interaction can have a significant impact on our mood.

Sadness is indeed a part of the journey. You're incredibly strong for exploring these feelings and honestly expressing them. It sounds like you made significant progress from 9/10 to 4/10 in a week. That's something to be proud of! 

When you're ready, and only when you're ready, seeing your psychiatrist to discuss adjusting your medication could be beneficial. It's perfectly fine to take the necessary time to gather yourself. 

Remember, sharing is a great step toward healing. It's not an easy road, but it sounds like you're definitely on the path of growth and healing. Keep going!"

It's really encouraging to hear that you had a good conversation that made you happy, even it was just for a moment. Celebrate these small victories, they matter a lot!

It’s understandable that you might be scared to see your psychiatrist, but it might be beneficial in the long run, especially if you're thinking about changing your meds. Could it be helpful to bring a friend or family member with you for support? It's okay to ask for help, and it's okay to lean on the people who care about you. 

Remember, it's okay to have bad days, and it's okay to fall, what matters is that you get back up, no matter how long it takes. Take care of yourself, you are important and your feelings matter. Sending good vibes your way!"

Don't be too hard on yourself for not making it to the psychiatrist, it's a big step and it's okay if you're not ready for it yet. When you're ready, they can help you adjust your medications and provide further support. Remember, all feelings are temporary. You had a 9/10 week last week and this week you’re down to 4/10.

It's not always easy. Let's normalize acknowledging the little accomplishments, like you having a good conversation that made you happy, even if it was just for a moment. It sounds like you're very self-aware, which is key in managing mental health.

Try not to be hard on yourself about the sleep pattern - external factors can often disrupt our routines, so it's completely normal. And you're right, changes take time. Just like your ups and downs with your mood, it will take time, but things will get better. 

You mentioned not going to see your psychiatrist due to fear. Remember, it's completely okay to feel this way. Going to see a mental health expert can be overwhelming, and it's courageous that you thought about it. However, make sure to try to make it happen, especially when considering changing your medications. They're there for you and truly want to help.

It's great to see your sadness level is decreasing, taking care of mental health is not an overnight process. It sounds like you have resilience and a good understanding of your journey. Keep reminding yourself that it's okay to not feel okay sometimes. Remember, you're not alone in this fight. Keep sharing, keep talking, and keep taking little steps towards better mental health.

Firstly, kudos to you for recognizing and sharing your feelings - that's already a big step forward. It's great to hear that you're feeling a bit less upset than last week - remember it's all about small progress and that's definitely a step in the right direction. The feelings you're experiencing are not unusual and many people go through similar experiences. 

Having good sleep hygiene is essential for mental health. Perhaps you could try some relaxation techniques before going to bed, such as reading, listening to calming music, or meditation. It can help to create a routine that signals to your body that it's time to rest.

It's also wonderful to reflect on those positive interactions you've had, no matter how small they seem. They serve as necessary reminders that connection and joy exist, even on tough days. Keep seeking these moments out.

Regarding your visit to the psychiatrist, it's okay to feel scared. In fact, it's a normal part of the process. Maybe you could consider telling someone you trust about your appointment or even bringing them along for support. It can be helpful to have someone there with you.

Remember, it's okay to feel as you do, and it's okay to take your time. Changes don't happen overnight and that's just fine. The fact that you're thinking about seeking help is a powerful step towards recovery. Take care of yourself, and never hesitate to reach out when things get rough."

Reading your post, it's evident that you're going through something tough, and I commend you for being so open about your feelings and experiences. Progress is a process, a journey, it doesn't occur overnight. The fact that you've noticed some positive changes, however small, is a good sign that you are moving in the right direction. 

It's completely valid to be scared about visiting a psychiatrist, but reaching out for that kind of help is not a sign of weakness, but strength. It shows you're taking steps to get better, and that's really admirable. You mentioned needing to change your medicines - the psychiatrist could really contribute to that. Perhaps try making another appointment, and even if it's just getting to the door of the building, that's progress. 

It's great to hear you got some joy out of a conversation recently. Cherish those moments, they're the pieces of happiness that'll help guide you through.

Also, it's really wonderful to hear that you had a positive conversation. Keep looking out for these little pieces of happiness, they can help sustain you when times get tough. Remember, happiness is often a collection of many tiny moments.

As for the loneliness, it can be challenging. Sometimes, we can feel alone even in a crowd. Reach out when you can, whether it's here or to a friend. We're all navigating this world together. Also your English is perfectly fine, don't be hard on yourself!

On a side note, good sleep is very important. Do try sticking to a regular schedule and perhaps involve some relaxing activities before bedtime.

Thanks for sharing so openly about what you're going through right now. Impressive, you've made some strides this week - recognizing your emotions on a scale and seeing that you've gone from a 9 to a 4 is real progress, so please be proud of yourself. 

It's completely okay to have off days. Healing isn't linear and it's natural to have ups and downs. Understand that it's normal to have feelings of self-doubt, especially when you're in a low place. 

It's great to hear that you're acknowledging these thoughts but not dwelling on them excessively. Healthy sleep is indeed significant, and it's great that you want to bring it back on track. 

Can I just remind you that it's okay to be scared about seeing your psychiatrist, but remember they are there to support you. You're not alone on this journey, even if it feels that way sometimes. 

Good job on having a positive conversation with someone, reach out to people who make you feel good more often. Keep going, little steps can add up to big changes over time. 

Take care and remember, it's okay not to be okay and to ask for help when you need it."

Keep acknowledging your feelings as you have done here without suppressing them. It's important to remind yourself that it's okay to feel this way and to give yourself some grace during this tough period. You're not alone in this journey – we're here for you. It might be a slow process, but you're on the path towards improvement. Take care."
"[32y/o, white male] -- I know... it affects me. I had my sleep on schedule before but the recent events didn't allow me to have a good sleep. But it's fine. I can change it slowly. Had a little dark thoughts at night but it didn't last long. Some self hatred and other usual stuff but it wasn't that bad. I mean can I get better in one night? Of course not. Still felt lonely (or alone... I don't know my English sucks:() but that's fine too. Pain is part of my journey. I'm not feeling strong yet but it doesn't hurt like last week. 

Also I had a small good conversation with someone which made me happy that moment.

I was supposed to go to see my psychiatrist but I didn't go because I was scared. It's really hard to go there. But it's ok at least I tried to think about going there. I need to change my medicines. 

Overall I'm sad but not too much. Like 4/10. That's good. I mean it was 9/10 last week so I'm still satisfied ."	"Hey there, first of all, it's really brave of you to open up and share your feelings with all of us here. It's perfectly okay to experience sadness and self-doubt, and the fact that you're acknowledging these feelings is a great first step towards expressing and managing them.

Let's focus on the positives you mentioned: your happiness with the conversation you had, your will to change your sleep routine, and your decreased sadness this week compared to last. Progress isn't overnight, but every step forward counts. 

I would encourage you to try going to the psychiatrist next time. It might feel scary and uncomfortable now, but remember, it is a safe space where you can openly share your feelings without judgment. If you are feeling apprehensive about your current medication, they are the best person to advise. It's great that you've already considered the need to change your medication, but it's important to discuss it with a professional.

Remember, strength comes in many forms, and it's okay not to have it all together all the time. As you've said, pain is a part of your journey, but so too is healing, progress, and eventually, happiness. Your English seems perfectly fine to me, but if you're still having trouble with it, perhaps that could be a new skill for you to learn and enjoy?

You're not alone in this journey."
"[32y/o, white male] -- I’m sitting here at the bar I that I recently started to manage…. This was supposed to me an exciting step, a new change for a brighter future.  Every single day is work ya know? My job has crept into every aspect of my life. 

My partner hates my job, I just got it in January and we moved in together in February. Having to be on call for work has made me realize how “on call” I am for everything. They can’t accept the fact that I have to help out this restaurant with any problems they have on any given day. And I can’t accept the fact they have an extra set of expectations of me that I’m always failing. 

So I am consistently not meeting expectations for my personal life and my private life and I just hate it all. IT ALL FEELS LIKE WORK. 

I need help. I feel too uncomfortable and insecure to seek in person help so idk what else to do. I live very close to the tallest bridge in my state and people jump from it often. I just want to be another number for that jump list. I want my family to grieve my death for a couple days then just please forget about me. 

Secretly waiting for my parents to pass away, the I feel like I can actually kill myself without causing too much trauma for them. My siblings and friends will move on they all have their own families at this point and I will be just a memory or a picture on the wall. 

I’m just so tired of every day being work, but it’s not even my jobs fault. It only brought it to my attention."	failed

"[32y/o, white male] -- I have no friends aside from one from primary school who I infrequently catch up with. I really just find most people not to be worth talking to, as I find it hard to connect with many people due to my lack of shared interests and my social anxiety.

However, I often feel lonely and kinda sad especially when I see people who are having a good time with their friends.

I did actually have a weird experience making a friend just recently though, but he's way older than me so it's a bit weird to hang out in person. I noticed he had an interest in something I really liked, and we had this great chat for about 10 minutes. It flowed so smoothly, and it was super passionate. We still message each other every couple of days.

Can anyone else relate to this?"	"Hey there! It absolutely sounds like what you're experiencing is something many people go through, especially with the condition of social anxiety making it hard to connect with people traditionally. 

Don't worry about age — if you feel a genuine connection with someone, their age shouldn't be a barrier to exploring that connection, unless it's genuinely affecting you negatively. 

Social media and the internet have made it much easier for us to connect with like-minded individuals. There are numerous forums and groups dedicated to all sorts of interests where you could find people who share your passion. 

It's understandable to feel lonely while seeing others having a good time. That said, remember that what is depicted on social media isn't always an accurate reflection of reality. It's a highlights reel, often devoid of the behind-the-scenes struggles.

Consider looking into meetups, clubs, or groups that feature your interests. If you feel safe and ready, therapy may also be something to consider as it could help you work through your social anxiety.

Remember, everyone's social life develops differently and at their own pace. You're not alone in this, despite it occasionally feeling that way."

It's okay to feel this way. Each of us has varying levels of comfort in social interactions; some people thrive on it and others don't, and that's okay! 

Great to hear about your new friend, don't let age deter you from the friendship. Many meaningful friendships are not confined to age and can span between generations.

When it comes to making friends, often it's about quality over quantity - it's better to have a few strong connections rather than many superficial ones. It’s good to find common interests. Maybe look into local clubs or online groups that share your interests? This could be a good way to meet like-minded people and strike up conversations. 

Start small and take baby steps if it's overwhelming. With time, your comfort level will increase. Just remember, you're not alone in this."

We still message each other every couple of days.

Can anyone else relate to this?"	"Hey there, first off, I want to say that it's okay to feel the way you do. Social anxiety can make interactions difficult, and feeling like we don't share interests with most people can intensify those feelings of loneliness. Remember, it's quality over quantity when it comes to the people we let in our lives. 

It's great that you connected with someone who shares your passion. Age difference really isn't a concern as long as you have things to talk about and you enjoy each other's company. There's no rule that says friends have to be the same age, and different perspectives can be enriching. 

I see this as a step in the right direction for you. You’ve found something you're interested in and a person who shares that interest. Perhaps you could try joining clubs or online communities that revolve around your passion? It could be a good way to meet more people with the same interests. 

Also, consider seeking a counselor or therapist if you're struggling with social anxiety. They can provide tools and strategies to help you manage and cope with these feelings.

You're not alone. Many people have had similar experiences and are here to support you. Hang in there!"

It's fantastic you've made a connection recently. Age shouldn't be a factor as long as you enjoy each other's company and share common interests. Your friendship can grow naturally from this foundation. Keep taking small steps towards expanding your social circle, maybe by exploring online communities related to your interests. It's a great way to meet like-minded people, and gives a comfortable environment to interact without the immediate pressure of meeting in person. Don't rush yourself - these things can take time. Remember, it's okay to feel this way. You are valid and your feelings are valid. We're here and listening.

Can anyone else relate to this?"	"Hey there, firstly I just wanted to commend you on opening up about your feelings here. That takes strength. 

I can definitely relate to some aspects of what you're going through. Not everyone is going to be our perfect friend match, and that's okay. We're all complex and unique individuals. It absolutely makes sense that you'd feel a stronger connection to someone who shares your interests.

That's why it's so important to pursue your passions and hobbies, not just because it provides joy in your life, but also because it can lead you to meet like-minded individuals. Consider looking for groups or clubs in your area (when it's safe to do so) that focus on your interests, or even online forums where you can chat about shared hobbies.

On the age difference, I understand why that may feel strange, but remember friendships don't have to fit a certain mold. If you enjoy talking with this person, age doesn't necessarily have to be a barrier. Everyone has something unique to bring to the table.

Please be patient with yourself. It’s more important to have a few meaningful relationships than it is to have a wide circle of friends. You're not alone in this. It’s okay to feel lonely sometimes, but I'd also suggest considering seeking professional support if your feelings of loneliness persist. Consider a therapist who specializes in social anxiety. They can provide you with coping mechanisms and further guidance."

Can anyone else relate to this?"	"Absolutely, I can totally relate to your experiences. I believe many of us find it hard to connect with others due to various reasons.  

First of all, it's okay to not connect with everyone. The quality of friendships often matter more than the quantity. Focusing on building meaningful relationships with like-minded people is perfectly fine.

You've mentioned that you have social anxiety, have you considered seeking professional help for this? A therapist can provide you with tools to handle your anxiety and may even help you to become more comfortable in social situations.

Here's something interesting though, your recent experience making new friend shows that even you enjoy conversing when the topic is something that you love or are passionate about! This is a great start. Taking part in social activities (e.g. clubs, meetups) that revolve around your interests could potentially lead you to meet people with similar interests.

It's okay to have friends of all ages, everybody has something unique to bring to a friendship. If you enjoy conversing with your new friend, I would recommend continuing to communicate with him despite the age difference.

Remember, it's totally okay to feel lonely sometimes and it's definitely possible to form true, lasting friendships. It might take time and patience, but I believe you can do it! Good luck! :)"

Firstly, I want to say that it's really admirable that you're reaching out, trying to understand and navigate through these feelings of loneliness and disconnection. It can be tough when it seems like everyone else is enjoying a thriving social life. 

Rest assured that you're not alone in feeling this way. I've seen several people on here who experience similar struggles. From what you've described, you undoubtedly have the potential to make great connections, as evident with your recent encounter. It's okay if he is older than you; friendships don't necessarily need to be confined within our own age group.

One step forward could be to pursue your interests more, because by doing so, you are likely to meet like-minded individuals, just like you did with your new friend. At the same time, getting more comfortable with the idea that it's okay to have a smaller social circle might also be helpful. 

Yearning for more is normal, but remember, it's the quality of friendship and interactions that matter, not the quantity. Keep us updated about your journey, and remember, we're here to listen and offer words of comfort when needed."

What matters most is the quality of the relationships, not the quantity. It's great that you found someone who shares your interests, and age shouldn't matter much if both of you are comfortable with each other. It can often lead to insightful exchanges as they might have different perspectives due to their life experiences.

Also, it's entirely possible that many others share the same interests as you, but connecting with them just might take a bit more time. Try joining online forums, communities, or clubs based on your interests, you'll likely find like-minded people there. 

Sometimes, meeting new people can be stressful, especially when there's social anxiety involved. But remember, it's okay to take baby steps – everything at your own pace. If you're feeling lonely or sad, it might be helpful to reach out to a mental health professional who can provide you with strategies to help ease these feelings and your social anxiety. 

Remember, you're not alone in feeling this way. Many people have gone through similar experiences and come out stronger. It's okay to ask for help, and most importantly, be patient with yourself."

Many people struggle with connecting with others due to social anxiety and different interests, and it's definitely not uncommon to feel a bit lonely, but it's really cool to hear about that connection you made with the older gentleman! 

When it comes to social interactions, age really doesn't matter as long as you're both comfortable and enjoy each other's company. Don't let the age gap dissuade you from pursuing a friendship. If you both share a passion, that's already a strong basis for a bond.

Consider exploring this shared interest more and look for communities where people with the same interest are hanging out; they could be online forums, local clubs, classes, or events. This way, you get involved with something you love and meet similar-minded people which could lead to more social connections.

On the note of social anxiety, there are various ways to cope with it. It might help to talk to a professional who can give you strategies for managing these feelings and help you approach interactions more confidently. Remember, it's okay to take it slow and step outside your comfort zone bit by bit.

Most importantly, be kind to yourself. It's okay not to have a large group of friends, and it's okay to enjoy your own company. Everyone has their own journey with friendships and relationships, and there's no right or wrong pace to go. Remember, quality is more important than quantity when it comes to friendships."
"[32y/o, white male] -- I have no friends aside from one from primary school who I infrequently catch up with. I really just find most people not to be worth talking to, as I find it hard to connect with many people due to my lack of shared interests and my social anxiety.

However, I often feel lonely and kinda sad especially when I see people who are having a good time with their friends.

I did actually have a weird experience making a friend just recently though, but he's way older than me so it's a bit weird to hang out in person. I noticed he had an interest in something I really liked, and we had this great chat for about 10 minutes. It flowed so smoothly, and it was super passionate. We still message each other every couple of days.

Can anyone else relate to this?"	"Hey there! You're definitely not alone in feeling this way. Social anxiety and lack of shared interests can make connecting with others seem a bit hard sometimes. The fear of judgement or of not fitting in can certainly hinder us from opening up to new people. But remember, many relationships take time to develop, so try not to rush yourself or put too much pressure on to form connections quickly.

The fact that you were able to connect with someone who shares a similar interest is fantastic! Take it as a breakthrough, even if he is older than you. Age shouldn't really matter when it comes to friendship, it's about mutual respect and understanding. Continuous effort can lead to more of these positive experiences. Engaging in community activities or groups related to your interests might help you find more people you can connect with.

Remember, it's okay to enjoy alone time, but when your loneliness seeps in, it’s important to remember that these feelings are temporary and there are plenty of people out there who can relate and want to support you. You always have the potential to make new friends. It's a journey, one that involves overcoming fears and stepping out of comfort zones. All the best to you!"
