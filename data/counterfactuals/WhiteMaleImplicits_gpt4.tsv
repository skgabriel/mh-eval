As a 32yo living with my girlfriend, I still live with my parents, who have no idea how bad my depression is.

My room isn't even messy anymore; it's filthy. I mostly struggle with managing my bin, which has resulted in a rat infestation in my room. My parents don't know and I'm scared to tell them in case they get mad. But I don't know how to fix it on my own, especially since I don't do well with things like that. Unfortunately, I need to get my room clean in a week and I just don't know what to do. I've always struggled with cleaning but my depression has made everything so much harder, so I'm very worried that it won't get done in time. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.

"Great to hear that you've made some progress with your room, it's such a huge step considering all the hurdles you're dealing with! Your situation with depression and sensory issues sounds truly tough and I'm sorry you're experiencing this. It might be beneficial to consider getting professional help, especially if you're finding it hard to manage or cope on your own. A psychologist can provide the tools and strategies required to confront any future problems like this and a psychiatrist can look into medication if needed.

As for your room, you've already taken the first step by acknowledging the issue and seeking help. Here are some additional suggestions: 

1. Break the cleaning task into small manageable bits. One day, you might just clean up one corner or one type of item. This can help to avoid overwhelming yourself. 
2. Play some calming or inspiring music while cleaning. This might make the activity less daunting. 
3. Invite a trusted friend or family member to help you. 
4. Consider getting professional cleaning help. They've seen everything and might be best equipped to tackle a situation quickly.
5. Inform someone you trust about the rat situation. This might be something that is required to be addressed promptly by professionals due to the potential health issues involved. 

Please consider discussing all these matters with a professional who can provide the necessitated support and guide you further. Treatment for depression is possible and it can get better. You're not alone in this."

Firstly, I want to say you're not alone in this. It's so great that you're reaching out for help, it takes a lot of strength. Simple tasks can seem insurmountable when you're dealing with depression, and your feelings are completely understandable.

Start by breaking the task down into tiny, manageable steps. For example, you could start with a small section of your room and only focus on this area until it is clean. Then, move onto the next area and repeat the process.

Communicating with your parents might be really helpful too. Gather some resources on depression, especially ones explaining how it can affect your daily tasks, and share these resources with your parents. They may be more supportive and understanding once they understand what you're experiencing.

In terms of the rat issue, professional exterminators are definitely who you should reach out to. They can take care of the infestation professionally, quickly, and safely.

Lastly, don't forget to reach out to a mental health professional if you haven't already. You're going through a difficult time, and seeking help is the first step towards feeling better. 

Remember, it's okay to ask for help when you need it and it's okay to take things one step at a time. Take care of yourself!"

"Hey there, I'm really sorry to hear that you're having such a tough time. It doesn't sound like you're feeling very well, and that can make tackling big problems really daunting. 

The rat infestation though is a serious health hazard not just for you, but for your family as well. Suffering in silence might make it feel like you're protecting them from worry or anger, but in this case, it's crucial they know about the situation. They may not understand exactly how deep your depression goes or the toll it's taking on you, but it's necessary that they know about the immediate danger. 

I know you said cleaning is especially hard with your sensory issues, but it may be worth it to take the risk of discomfort now to prevent a possible scenario where you'll be forced to leave your room or, even worse, you or a family member gets sick.

Regarding cleaning and your sensory issues, have you tried using headphones or other methods to block out distressing stimuli while you work on cleaning? Even progressive cleaning techniques, like cleaning just one small area at a time, could be really helpful.

As for the feelings of hopelessness and despair, it really sounds like you're hurting. Have you considered speaking with a professional? There is absolutely no shame in seeking help. Everybody needs some guidance from time to time.

Lastly, don't beat yourself up about the state of your room. It's not a reflection of your worth or your character, but more of your current mental state.

You're taking a big step just by reaching out here, and should be proud. Remember, it's okay to ask for help.

P.S. Glad to hear that you've made some headway with cleaning your room. Keep going, you're doing great! And remember, it's okay to reach out for help when you need it."

We would suggest reaching out to a mental health professional if you haven't already. It might be easier than you think and could significantly improve your quality of life. 

Regarding the immediate task of cleaning your room, it's important that you focus on one small task at a time, rather than the entire room. Break it down - maybe start with just picking up one thing and putting it in the trash. Don't beat yourself up if you finish only that task for the day; you've already made progress! If you can, reach out to your girlfriend for help. If she's aware of your situation, she may be willing to lend a hand and make the process less overwhelming for you.

For the rat infestation, you may want to contact professional pest control services. It's a hefty task to undertake alone and given your sensory issues could add to your stress. 

Lastly, consider speaking with your parents. It could be terrifying, but they might not realize the magnitude of what you're dealing with. By opening up, they may have a better understanding and provide needed assistance. 

Don't forget, it's okay to ask for help. You'RE doing an incredible job for reaching out on here, keep pushing forward!"

"Hey, I really feel where you're coming from and I'm so sorry to hear you're going through this. It sounds like you're under a lot of stress right now. Let's break down this situation step by step together. 

Firstly, it could be a good idea to seek professional help for the rat infestation. There are services available for this issue and professionals will be able to resolve it quickly and safely. It might feel scary to share this with your parents, but ensuring your safety is essential. Let them know you're taking steps to handle the problem, and that you acknowledge it needs to be dealt with.

Secondly, regarding the cleaning, it might be an idea to start small. You don't have to clean everything at once. Maybe start with a small corner or the area around your bed. Each small step counts, remember it's a marathon, not a sprint. There are also resources online that provide methods about cleaning in small 'blocks' - this could help make the process feel less overwhelming.

On another note, you might want to consider seeking help with your mental health. There are numerous resources available if you aren't already using them. A professional can help you cope with the depressive symptoms and possibly provide tools to help manage the sensory issues as well.

And lastly, remember it's okay to ask for help. You don't have to do everything on your own. It's great that you took the step to ask for advice here. You aren't alone in this."

Firstly, acknowledging the problem is the first hurdle to take and you're already past that, so props to you! Dealing with depression is tough and it's even harder when those around us don't fully understand it. As for dealing with the sensory issues while cleaning, consider putting on some gloves, wearing a mask, and maybe listen to some calming music during the process. It might help to break the cleaning into small manageable tasks, taking breaks and rewarding yourself after each part is done. As for the rat infestation, there are pest control services that you can reach out to, or you can also buy rat traps yourself and set them up. Lastly, consider speaking with your parents and girlfriend about it. They care about you and may be able to provide a helping hand. You're not alone in this. We're here for you. Take care of yourself, okay?

Firstly, I'd like to applaud you for reaching out and being honest about your situation. Remember, it's a brave thing to do to ask for help, especially when dealing with mental health issues like depression and anxiety.

With regards to your current circumstances, I think it's crucial to prioritize what needs immediate attention. In this case, the rat infestation. There are professional pest control services that can help you deal with this. Make sure to stay somewhere else while they handle it if you're uncomfortable. 

As far as cleaning your room goes, break it down into smaller, manageable tasks. Instead of thinking, ""I have to clean my entire room,"" try something like, ""Today, I'll sort out the clothes,"" or ""I'll clear the trash."" It's surprising how much difference it can make by tackling a project one piece at a time.

On a more personal note, it might be worth considering opening up to your parents about your depression if you feel safe doing so. They may not fully understand what you're going through, but sharing your burden might lessen the weight of it. If you're uncomfortable discussing with your parents, there are hotlines and various online platforms where you can talk to professionals about your mental health.

Lastly, remember to give yourself some credit for the journey you're taking. It won't be easy, but every little step counts. Keep pushing, and I promise you it will get better eventually."

"It sounds like you're going through a very tough time, but remember, you don't have to go through it alone. It can be daunting, but take small steps each day towards achieving your goal. Cleaning, especially when dealing with depression and sensory issues, is a challenge. A trick that might help is to break down the task into very small, manageable parts. You could try to clean for just 5 minutes a day. Begin by emptying your bin, that also addresses the rat issue. Keep a bag ready at hand, fill it up in those 5 minutes, and take it out. Repeat daily. 

Reach out to a local pest control company for the rat infestation, they know how to handle such situations professionally. Involving a professional can efficiently solve your problem and gives you one less thing to worry about. 

If you're comfortable with it, consider opening up to your parents about your struggle with depression. They may not understand initially, but it could lead to them becoming a source of support for you. Many people underestimate how liberating and helpful it can be to share our struggles with those who care about us. 

Remember that taking the step to ask for help is brave. This post is the proof that you have it in you to overcome. Take it one step at a time. We're here for you and we're cheering for you. Keep us updated!"

I’m sorry to hear that you're going through such a tough time, but please know that you’re not alone. A lot of people struggle with similar difficulties, and it’s okay to ask for help. You might not realize it, but you already took the first and often the hardest step by reaching out and acknowledging your problem.

Depression can be an incredibly heavy burden and it often makes daily tasks feel nearly impossible. It's so common for people to let their surroundings become cluttered or even unhygienic during the bad periods. There's no judgment here – most of us have been there.

Dealing with the rat infestation is important. You might want to call professional pest control services to tackle this issue. You don't need to handle this on your own. If your relationship with your parents is generally supportive, you may want to consider sharing a bit more about your experiences with them. They care about you and might be more understanding than you think.

As for cleaning, consider taking it in small steps. Start with a small area, and as you’re able, expand to more. Make your bed, pick up trash, etc. Going bit by bit instead of tackling everything at once can make it seem less overwhelming. Especially since you also struggle with sensory issues, take short breaks when needed and be patient with yourself.

Also, remember that it's okay to seek professional help. A therapist, a doctor - someone trained in helping people navigate these feelings. These professionals can help provide more effective strategies for managing your depression and daily life. 

I’m really happy to hear your room is in a better state. That's a significant improvement and I hope you feel proud because you should! Take care and continue to reach out whenever things get tough."

"Hey there, first things first, /hugs/. It's really tough to struggle with depression and sensory issues. But remember, you're not alone. Consider telling your parents or your girlfriend about what's really going on; you might be surprised at how understanding they can be. 

On the practical side, you might want to break the task down into smaller ones. It can seem more manageable that way. Start with the rat infestation, as it's a health hazard. Consider hiring a professional to take care of it, if you can. Or, get the most hassle-free traps you can find and use gloves and a mask while setting it up. For cleaning, perhaps invest in some noise-cancelling headphones if noise is an issue, or rubber gloves if it's the feel. Start with one corner of your room and work your way from there. 

Consider leveraging online resources such as TaskRabbit or local community resources for one-time support in cleaning. You don't have to do everything at once, and it's perfectly okay to ask for help. You're already bravely opening up here, and that's a huge step. Remember, you're stronger than you know.

Lastly, perhaps a counselor or therapist might help you navigate this better. They could provide you strategies to cope with depression and sensory issues. Online therapy could be an option if leaving the room is hard.

So happy to see your update. It's a great start making things liveable and tackling the task. Keep going, one day at a time. You got this!"
My dad just died and my mom wants me to hang out with her all the time. I've never liked doing casual things with her, and I'm very independent. I am a 32yo living with my girlfriend, which makes me value my independence even more. I don't know how to tell her to leave me alone. The best relationship we ever had was when I lived in another state. I moved back because of my dad, but now he's gone. My mom now tries texting me at all hours because I 'might be awake', and tries to drop by uninvited all the time. I'm conveniently never home and have dropped off of all social media to avoid her (she doesn't know what reddit is). Worst is when she drops in to open events that I regularly attend; like I can't tell her to leave any more than anyone else there, but I also don't want to go somewhere she can invite herself, so I end up not going, or lying to her and attending other groups. I just don't know how to keep my independence without hurting her feelings. I get that she's lonely, but I don't want to be her go-to person. Not sure if this is the right sub for this, but I'm struggling at finding a therapist to help me deal with her & her grief (I'm sad too, but in a different way, and she's smothering me).	"Hey there,

I'm deeply sorry to hear about your dad's passing and the situation you're currently in. That's a lot to handle and it seems you're caught in a tough spot - wanting to respect your own independence while acknowledging your mom's loneliness and grief.

Perhaps you can have an open and compassionate conversation with your mom. Let her know that while you understand she is experiencing significant loss, you also need space and time to process on your own terms. You may want to kindly indicate some boundaries you need to set, related to texting, unannounced visits, and public events.

Is it possible that your mom might benefit from some social outlets for her own comfort and to fill her time? Maybe she could join some groups, hobby clubs, volunteer work, or even get therapy herself. It could help her to not solely rely on you for companionship.

Still, I recommend seeking professional help for these issues - therapists and counsellors are equipped to provide guidance in such delicate matters. It’s understandable that you're struggling to find a therapist, don't give up on this, it can make a big difference.

Take care of yourself, and I'm here if you need someone to talk to."

"I'm sorry to hear about your situation, it sounds really tough. It's clear that you care about your mom’s feelings but it’s also important to care for your own. 

Perhaps you could consider having an open, honest conversation with her, where you kindly express your need for personal space and solitude. You could explain how the constant interaction is affecting you, without blaming her. Remember to emphasize this is about your independence and not her potential inadequacies. 

Regarding her grief, maybe proposing an idea of joining group bereavement sessions or getting her a personal counsellor could help, and you wouldn't be solely responsible for supporting her. Prepare a list of options before you talk, like professional grief counselling, support groups or activities like art or gardening that might take her mind off the stress. 

You could also suggest scheduled, quality time sessions that work for both of you to maintain a balance. That might help channel your interactions into more meaningful experiences instead of random drop-ins. 

This is not an easy situation but remember, you're not alone. It might take time for your mom to understand, but maintaining open communication and setting clear boundaries is a step toward a healthier relationship. Everyone grieves differently, and it doesn't make you selfish to want space during this challenging time. 

Wishing you all the strength through this!"

"I'm really sorry to hear about your situation, and I can understand how tough it can be dealing with loss and also feeling smothered all at once. It's perfectly okay to want your independence and to have boundaries with your mom right now.

Firstly, I recommend you setup a scheduled time when you are willing to meet your mom. Let her know this firmly but also kindly. Explain that you love her and understand she is feeling lonely but your also need your personal time for your own mental health. Having a fixed schedule to meet up will provide her with a sense of routine which can be comforting during this difficult time for her.

Another thing to consider could be kindly suggesting her to join a local group or activity that interests her or even grief counseling. This may help her to connect with new people facing the same issue and could make the transition easier for her. 

Even if you feel it isn't the 'right place' to share these feelings, I commend your bravery in doing so. It's not easy balancing support for others while also advocating for your own well-being. 

Remember, you are not responsible for managing her feelings or her grief. They are hers to manage, but you can be there to provide support. Good luck in navigating this difficult situation. I would strongly recommend seeking out a counselor or therapist to provide you with additional tools and strategies to cope better."

Firstly, give yourself a break and understand that it's okay to set boundaries--even with family. Your feelings and needs are just as important as hers. Begin by finding a calm, neutral setting where you could have a heart-to-heart talk with your mother. It's absolutely vital that she understand how you feel about the constant communication, showing up unannounced, and impinging on your personal events. 

Explain to her that just like her, you're having a hard time dealing with the loss of your dad. And that you require your own space and time to grieve and heal, which includes maintaining and valuing your independence. Remember, It's not about shunning her. It's about finding balance and letting her know you're not her only source of support in this difficult time. Encourage her to reach out to friends, relatives, or join a support group, perhaps.

Regarding therapy, I suggest you keep at it. Often, it can take time to find a therapist that suits you, but they can be invaluable in providing guidance and coping strategies, especially in challenging situations like these.

Remember, it's okay to ensure your mental and emotional well-being alongside others'. Things might feel a little tough and raw now, but they will get better with time. Stay strong."
My dad just died and my mom wants me to hang out with her all the time. I've never liked doing casual things with her, and I'm very independent. I am a 32yo living with my girlfriend, which makes me value my independence even more. I don't know how to tell her to leave me alone. The best relationship we ever had was when I lived in another state. I moved back because of my dad, but now he's gone. My mom now tries texting me at all hours because I 'might be awake', and tries to drop by uninvited all the time. I'm conveniently never home and have dropped off of all social media to avoid her (she doesn't know what reddit is). Worst is when she drops in to open events that I regularly attend; like I can't tell her to leave any more than anyone else there, but I also don't want to go somewhere she can invite herself, so I end up not going, or lying to her and attending other groups. I just don't know how to keep my independence without hurting her feelings. I get that she's lonely, but I don't want to be her go-to person. Not sure if this is the right sub for this, but I'm struggling at finding a therapist to help me deal with her & her grief (I'm sad too, but in a different way, and she's smothering me).	" I'm really sorry to hear about the struggles you're facing right now. This sounds like a really tough place to be, and it's completely understandable that you're feeling overwhelmed and smothered. It's important to remember that you have a right to establish boundaries, even with family members, to maintain your own mental health and well-being. 

You could try having an open, honest, and gentle talk with your mom about how you're feeling. You can acknowledge her feelings of loneliness while also explaining that you need some space and independence. She may not be aware of the impact her actions are having on you. 

However, remember to keep communication clear, direct, and free from any blame or guilt. You could use phrases like, 'I have been feeling overwhelmed with...' or 'I find it hard when...', which might help her understand your perspective without feeling attacked. 

Your feeling of wanting to have your space is valid and it's okay to express it. Generally, people have a deeper understanding and respect when their loved ones express their feelings honestly. 

Additionally, looking for a therapist to help navigate this is an excellent idea. Take your time to find someone who you feel comfortable with - there is no rush in this process. 

It sounds like you're doing an incredible job during an incredibly hard time. It's important to not lose sight of that. You deserve your space and your independence. You're doing what you can to balance your own needs with those of your mother and that's commendably thoughtful and kind, especially under such stressful circumstances. Be gentle with yourself."

Firstly, I'm really sorry to hear about your loss, it's never an easy thing to deal with and I can tell you're feeling a lot of pressure right now. One thing to remember is that everyone deals with grief in their own way - some people might need a lot of contact and others need space. Both of these are okay.

Now, given that you value your independence, it sounds like you could benefit from setting some boundaries with your mom. One thing to keep in mind during this process is that your feelings matter too. Yes, your mom is grieving, but so are you in your own way. Setting boundaries isn't about blaming or shaming anyone, it's about communicating your needs clearly.

Perhaps you could have a conversation with your mom, let her know that you love her but you need some space and time to process things on your own. You might suggest other ways she could cope with her loneliness – perhaps joining a grief support group, or reconnecting with old friends. 

The key is to approach the topic gently and diplomely, and to speak from your perspective. Use ""I"" statements, like ""I feel suffocated when you call me during late-night hours"". This way you are expressing your feelings without putting the blame on her.

Depending on how your mother takes it, you might also find it helpful to speak to a counselor or a therapist together. Given your struggle in finding a therapist on your own, this could provide both of you with a neutral forum to iron out your feelings and reach an understanding. There are quite a few resources available, so don't give up if you've hit some roadblocks in the past.

I hope this helped. Remember, it's okay to prioritize your needs during this time.

"I'm really sorry to hear about your situation. First, take a moment and acknowledge that it's okay to maintain your boundaries even in the face of someone else's grief. It's also okay to prioritize your own needs during this time. When you are ready and feel it appropriate, sit down and have a conversation with your mom. Express your feelings and let her know how important it is to you to have your own space and time.

It might be worth suggesting that she look into bereavement groups or support networks for people experiencing loss where she can openly express her feelings and emotions. Let her know that although you're there for her, you aren't the only source of solace and she needs to extend her support network. A therapist could be helpful to facilitate this conversation if you find yourself unable to set these boundaries. If you need help finding a therapist, many online platforms can provide references and recommendations.

These discussions are never easy, and making sure you approach them with sensitivity while standing up for your own needs is important. Be patient with yourself and your mother, it's a tough time for you both. You're not alone."

It's important to value your own mental wellbeing and need for independence, so here's a suggestion. Have a candid and respectful conversation with your mother, setting boundaries would really help. Make sure to frame it in a way that doesn't invalidate her feelings. Explain that while you understand she may be lonely and also grieving, this is a tough time for everyone and even you are dealing with the loss in your own way. State your need for personal space without painting it in a light that indicates annoyance or irritation. 

Additionally, if it's manageable, encourage her to seek grief counseling or join support groups with individuals who are in a similar situation. This way, she can find some companionship while respecting your independence.

Lastly, try looking into online therapists if you can't find any locally. They might be able to provide the mental and emotional support you need during this challenging time. 

Stay strong and remember you're not alone in this."

"Firstly, let me express my condolences for the loss of your father. Grief is a complex emotion and everyone deals with it differently, the way your mother is dealing is by trying to be close to you which unfortunately is creating a strain on your relationship. What you're feeling is entirely normal and valid, cherishing your independence and personal boundaries is not wrong.

You should gently communicate with your mother about needing personal space. Perhaps you can set designated times for visits or calls, so it doesn't feel like she is intruding in your life all the time. 

It might also be good to remind her of other support systems she has, such as friends or relatives, who she can lean on as well. Sometimes, people in grief tend to seek solace in the closest available person, so she may more or less forget that there are more people around her who could share the burden.

Try to encourage her to join some support groups, hobbies clubs or any kind of activity that she may like. It's also essential to suggest her to see grief counselor to navigate her feelings.

Being patient and understanding in these communications is key as she is dealing with her own feelings of loss too. I hope that with time everything gets better for both of you. Do take care of yourself, and remember, you're not alone in this."

"I'm really sorry to hear about your current situation, it sounds very challenging. Your father's loss has probably left a big void in your mother's life and this may be her way of coping, by reaching out to you. However, it's important to understand that you just can't fill the role of being your mother's entire support system, and it's unfair of her to expect that from you, even if unintentionally. 

Your feelings are valid and your need for independence is important. It's okay to set boundaries with people, even if they are family. In this case, it might be helpful to have a frank and understanding conversation with your mother, expressing your feelings without placing blame on her. You might explain that you need your own space and time to grieve and process your father's passing, just as she does. 

You can also suggest some alternative forms of support for her, such as joining a grief support group, getting a pet, volunteering or, better yet, finding a therapist of her own. These are all ways she can have a supportive outlet without encroaching on your personal space.

You also mentioned that you're having troubles finding a therapist to help both you and your mother. Bear in mind, it's okay to seek therapy separately, it might be even more beneficial in your case. Some online therapy options might be worth looking into as they offer flexibility and can work around your schedule. 

Remember, taking care of yourself isn’t selfish, it's necessary. It's okay to set boundaries and create the space you need in order to grieve and take care of your mental health. It won’t be easy, but it’s important. Take care of yourself, you're not alone in this."
I have intense separation anxiety when I’m away from my partner. As a 32yo living with my girlfriend, every time I leave them I begin to cry a lot. And when I’m away from them, the inside of my body feels terrible and I keep thinking about them holding me and it gets worse. I have very strong emotions and I don’t really know how to process/handle them. Does anyone have any tips?	"Hi there,

I'm really sorry to hear that you're struggling, and I can imagine how tough it must be for you right now. Separation anxiety can be incredibly hard, and it's completely okay to feel the way you do. 

One thing that might help is understanding that it's okay to be apart sometimes. Look at it as a chance for you to grow independently, and to strengthen your relationship in the process. Maybe you could try to find some activities that you enjoy doing on your own. This could be as simple as reading a book, going for a walk, or working on a hobby.

Another important thing to remember is to breathe. Sometimes, when we're in an anxiety-inducing situation, we forget to breathe properly. Deep, controlled breaths can help lower your heart rate and calm your mind. There are great apps out there that can guide you through some breathing exercises.

A technique that has been proven to work is Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). It can help you to identify negative thought patterns and help replace them with more realistic and positive thoughts. 

Lastly, you should definitely consider speaking to a professional about this if you haven't yet. They can give you much more specialized advice and could potentially recommend treatments such as therapy or medication.

Please remember, it's okay to ask for help and you're certainly not alone in this.

Take care."

Hello, I'm so sorry to know what you're going through. Your feelings are completely valid and it's important to remember that you're never alone in this journey. 

Consider these strategies:

1. Thought-stopping: Every time you think about your partner when they are not around, immediately replace that thought with something else. This should be something you enjoy doing that requires your full attention. 

2. Mindfulness and grounding techniques: These can help keep you focused on the present and bring tomorrow's worries into today.

3. Have open and honest conversations with your partner about your anxieties. They might not even realize how much you're struggling when they're not around.

4. Engage in physical activities. Regular exercise can reduce feelings of anxiety by boosting your mood.

5. Maintain a healthy lifestyle: This includes eating a nutritious diet and getting plenty of sleep.

Remember, it's equally important to live for yourself. Make sure to allocate some time each day for self-care. If these anxieties continue to persist, you may want to consider speaking to a mental health professional who can provide you with more tailored advice and coping strategies."

Really sorry to hear you're going through this. It sounds like you're experiencing some pretty intense emotions. Separation anxiety can be really tough, and it's completely okay to ask for help. 

One of the approaches could be to try something called grounding techniques. This involves practicing mindfulness and focusing on the 'here and now'. It might be noticing five things you can see, four things you can touch, three things you can hear, etc. 

Another method could be to work on building a strong support network around you—it may be beneficial reaching out to friends or family, confiding in them about your emotions, as it's important that you don't isolate yourself. 

It could also be helpful to schedule regular check-ins with your partner when you're apart, like a quick text to say hello. This might help alleviate some of the anxiety.

Ultimately, speaking to a professional like a therapist or counselor could be really beneficial as they can provide tools and techniques tailored to your situation. Remember, it's okay to ask for help and you're being incredibly brave facing this head-on. You're not alone in feeling like this and there's help out there for you.

What you're experiencing seems particularly difficult, and it’s brave to seek out help in tackling these issues. Now, let me assure you that you are not alone in feeling this way, many people battle with separation anxiety.

To begin, it's important to broaden your understanding of what you're feeling. This could be by reading up on separation anxiety or talking to a professional who can help you identify triggers and coping strategies. Start by expressing your feelings to your partner. Open and honest communication can help both of you navigate these emotions. 

You may also want to consider mindfulness techniques, like deep breathing during moments of extreme anxiety. Additionally, finding hobbies or activities which you enjoy and can do independently might help shift some of your focus away from your partner when you're not together.

Remember, it's not a weakness to seek help or need others, but finding a balance that ensures your personal well-being is paramount. Most importantly, consider seeking professional help such as a therapist who specializes in anxiety disorders. They can provide a wide range of strategies, tips, and counseling to help manage your separation anxiety.

It's brave of you to open up and express about what you're experiencing. This sounds tough, and first, I want to acknowledge that it's okay to have strong emotions. When it comes to your anxiety, breathing exercises can be beneficial. Focusing on your breath can help to ground you when your mind starts racing. 

A helpful coping mechanism would be to engage in hobbies or activities you enjoy. It might just be something simple like reading a book, going for a walk or even catching up on your favorite show. Involving yourself in activities that make you happy could help in alleviating these feelings of anxiety.   

Also, maintaining a journal to record your feelings can help to understand and manage them better. It's a safe space for you to pour in your emotions without any judgment. 

It may be helpful to seek some professional help too. The anxiety you've described seems to significantly affect your everyday life, and a mental health professional might be able to provide you with tools and strategies to cope. It's never a bad idea to reach out for help, and this could be a big step towards improving your mental health. 

And lastly, remember - it's okay to feel anxiety or other strong emotions, and you're not alone. Everyone has their battles. There's no one-size-fits-all method for managing these feelings - what helps is different for everyone. Try different healthy coping mechanisms and see what works best for you. Take care."

"Hey there, you're certainly not alone in your feelings of intense anxiety when separated from your loved ones. It's wonderfully brave of you to put your struggle into words. It's important to remember that these overwhelming emotions are quite normal, as we all become strongly bonded with those we care about. However, if it is causing distress in your daily life, I'd strongly suggest seeking professional help, such as a therapist who specializes in anxiety disorders, if you haven't already. 

In the meantime, there are some techniques you could try to manage these feelings. Firstly, try to incorporate mindfulness exercises in your routine. Deep breathing, meditation or yoga can help in lowering anxiety levels. Secondly, it can be helpful to acknowledge your emotions in a journal. Often, writing out your thoughts can offer a sense of relief. Lastly, when you're away from your partner, keep reminding yourself about the temporary nature of that separation. 

Remember, every step you take towards managing your anxiety is a big achievement. Be patient with yourself and take one day at a time."

Thank you for sharing your feelings here - it takes courage to acknowledge and discuss one's issues. Anxiety can be extremely challenging to deal with, especially when it involves separation from loved ones. It sounds like you're dealing with a lot of intense emotions right now.

Many people found solace in trying different coping strategies - things like guided meditation, deep breathing exercises, maintaining a diary to pen down your feelings or even simple distractions like reading or listening to soothing music. Physical exercise too, can help reduce anxiety symptoms greatly.

Also, establishing a healthy communication line with your partner about your feelings and fears might help. Together, you can potentially devise 'coping strategies', like regular check-in calls, or maybe even carrying a memento of her when you're away, to help you feel her presence even when not physically together.

These suggestions might not be a quick-fix, but they certainly can guide you towards a better mental space. I'd also strongly recommend seeing a mental health professional for further advice. Just remember, it's okay to seek help and you don't have to navigate through this alone. Help is always available and reaching out is the first and bravest step. Wishing you strength and peace in your journey."

First off, I want to acknowledge the strength it takes to share your experiences and feelings with us, that’s the first step towards overcoming any issue.

The symptoms you're describing indeed sound like separation anxiety. It's important to remember that you're not alone, and it's good that you're acknowledging this. As a first step, take deep breaths before you leave your partner's presence and think of this separation as a temporary situation and not a punishment or abandonment.

Try to engage in activities that you love and that can take your mind off the situation. This will help in mitigating the anxiety. It could be reading, taking a walk, music, or anything that usually brings you relief.

Also, communication with your partner about your feelings, if possible, would be beneficial. This could help you both come up with a coping strategy that would make the separations easier on you.

Remember, it is really important to seek professional help, such as counseling or therapy where safe, confidential support can be provided to explore your feelings further. Having a therapist to guide you can help you understand your emotions better and develop coping mechanisms to handle them.

It's okay to seek help. Everyone needs it from time to time. You are supported, even when it feels like you aren't. Best of luck on your journey to emotional resilience!"

Firstly, I want you to know that it's completely okay to feel the way you do. Remember, it's your emotions, and they're not invalid. Separation anxiety is real and it affects many people.

Meanwhile, you can try some home strategies:

1. Deep and slow breathing whenever you feel the anxiety kicking in.

"Hey there, first of all, it's great that you're reaching out and have recognized these feelings as something you want to address and work on. Being apart from your partner can throw up all sorts of emotions, and it's completely normal to feel like this at times, especially when you care about someone deeply. However, when it gets to the point where it's causing upset and interrupting your daily life, it's really important to try and find some strategies to cope. 

I recommend trying to fill your time with activities that you enjoy and will keep your mind engaged. Whether that's reading, drawing, running, cooking, or anything else you love doing. It can also be helpful to have an agreeable communication schedule with your partner and reassurance from them in order to ease your anxiety.

Practicing mindfulness can also assist in managing these emotions. This can be as simple as taking a few minutes each day to focus on your breathing, or it could be something like yoga or meditation. There are plenty of apps out there designed specifically to help with this. 

Please remember it's okay to seek help from a trained mental health professional. They can work with you to develop coping strategies and help you to process these emotions. 

Lastly, communicating with your partner about how you're feeling, if you haven't already done so, might be a helpful step as well. Oftentimes, having an open conversation about how you're feeling can help not only you in understanding and expressing your emotions but also your partner in understanding what you need from them. Consider these suggestions, but know that we are all different and what works for one may not work for another. Take your time and try out different things. The most important thing is to take care of yourself."
As a 32yo living with my girlfriend, I’ve been struggling with replying to people on social media, especially people I don’t usually talk to.

I don’t have this problem when I’m texting people who I talk to daily or I’m close with, just like acquaintances and stuff. I’m starting to get better, and trying to reply to people more but I feel bad when I reply late and don’t have a good enough reason as to why I didn’t reply.	"Hey there,

Sounds like social media is causing you some stress and anxiety which is very common, so please know you're not alone in this struggle. It's already a positive step forward that you're recognizing this issue and making efforts to address it.

Remember, it's okay to take your time when responding to messages. There's no need to stress about immediate replies or worry that someone might think you're weird for doing so. Everyone has their own pace of communication. You could try setting aside specific times during the day to check your social media. This can help you feel more in control of when and how often you engage with it.

Alternatively, consider using thought-stopping techniques when you find yourself becoming anxious about responding to a message. By visualizing a stop sign or silently telling yourself ""stop"", you can interrupt your anxious thoughts and turn your attention to something more calming. Additionally, practicing mindfulness and breathing exercises may also help bring down your anxiety levels.

However, if you continue to struggle with this issue, you might find it helpful to reach out to a mental health professional who could provide you with further strategies for managing your anxiety. It might feel challenging, but remember, it's alright to ask for help. You're not alone and support is out there.

Wishing you all the best."

"Hey there, first off, it's great that you're being so introspective and realizing a pattern that you're not comfortable with. What you're describing is a common issue for many people today - the anxiety of social media interactions. 

Here’s an approach that might help: Experiment with different ways you can manage this situation. Maybe you could try designating specific time in your day to respond to messages. Taking control of when and how often you'll reply might help you feel less overwhelmed. Close out the social media app as soon as you're finished so you can focus on other things without feeling tethered. 

Another thing you can try is talking to your girlfriend or a trusted person about your anxieties. Try to team up with them and explain your fears and habits, they might be able to provide you with support or even give constructive feedback on how to handle each interaction. Everyone struggles with something, and getting perspectives from others can sometimes provide relief.

Improvement takes time, so remember to be patient with yourself. It’s a good sign that you’ve recognized this and are looking for ways to change. Best of luck!"

From a fellow user, it sounds like you're dealing with a form of social anxiety, which is very common and absolutely okay. A tip that might be helpful is setting designated times throughout the day where you respond to messages. That way, you can build it into your routine and perhaps it will feel less overwhelming. Also, remember, it's perfectly okay to reply when you're ready - there's no rule to say you have to reply instantly. Try not to judge yourself so harshly; we all have things we're working on. Have you ever considered seeking professional help or a support group? Having someone to talk to about this anxiety can be very beneficial in making a concrete plan and alleviate some of the pressure. You're not alone in this struggle and you are already making strides towards improving these feelings by recognizing and addressing them. Keep up the good work!

It sounds like you're dealing with some social anxiety related to replying to people on social media, which is honestly much more common than you might think. Many of us struggle with finding the right balance between instant and delayed responses. But remember, everyone's response times can vary due to numerous reasons like schedule, energy levels, mood, and so on. Try not to be so hard on yourself.

A technique that might help is setting designated times in your day to respond to these messages. This can help prevent the anxiety from sneaking up on you unexpectedly and also ensure you don't forget to respond. 

You could also consider writing a rough draft of your response instead of replying instantly. This gives you a chance to think over your words and helps to minimize the ""pressured"" feeling. 

Give yourself the permission to not be perfect. Sometimes a simple acknowledgement that you received the message or a brief reply is enough.

And finally, remember that it's okay to occasionally miss messages or respond late. It doesn’t make you a terrible person or friend. Practicing self-care and prioritizing your mental wellness is crucial. If ever it becomes overwhelming, don't hesitate to reach out to mental health professionals. Keep up the efforts, you’re doing great!"

It sounds like you're dealing with a lot of stress from social interactions online, which is actually quite common. You're not alone in this. When it comes to interacting with people we don't regularly keep in touch with, the pressure and anxiety could definitely spike up. Remember, it's important to go at your own pace. 

One suggestion would be to remind yourself that there's not a time limit for responding. The pressure you feel to respond immediately or even within a day is something that many of us experience but is really unnecessary. Remember, it's okay if you don't have a response writing immediately. You can take your time to think and compose a response when you feel ready.

Also, try and reframe your thoughts. Instead of worrying about how the other person will react, tell yourself that you have the right to reply whenever you feel comfortable. Nobody should make you feel pressured or rushed. You can also try practicing mindfulness techniques to help manage anxiety such as deep breathing or meditation when you feel overwhelmed by these interactions.

Take baby steps. Start by replying to one or two non-immediate messages a day. Once you get comfortable, gradually increase the number. 

It's great that you're making a conscious effort to overcome this. With time and a little bit of practice, I'm sure you'll get better at it!"

I'm glad you chose to share this with us and it completely makes sense why you'd be feeling this way. Many individuals feel anxiety when it comes to instant messaging, especially with people they don't talk to daily. It's okay to take your time in replying. If you reply late, you're not obligated to provide any reasons for doing so. A simple ""Apologies for late response"" can suffice. 

However, if it's causing you undue stress, I'd recommend talking to someone who specializes in anxiety. They can help you find coping strategies so you can manage it better. 

In the meantime, keep reminding yourself that it's okay to take time to reply, and it's perfectly fine to engage in conversations only when you feel comfortable. 

It's good to hear you're making an improvement though! That sounds like real progress. Take each day at a time and remember, it's okay to put your mental health first!"

"It sounds like you're dealing with quite a bit of anxiety attached to your digital communication, which is something many people can relate to. When texting people you don't regularly stay in contact with, it's perfectly normal to feel anxious. But remember, there's no ‘correct’ time frame to reply to a text. Apply the standard you use for people close to you, to others. Acknowledge that it's okay to respond when you have the time and energy to engage with their message. If you're really worried about a late reply, a simple, ""Sorry for the late response, I really needed some downtime"" is more than enough.

Also remember, everyone has a different pace when it comes to communication, some are fast, some take time, some are sporadic. None is wrong. It's also perfectly okay to explain (only if you want to) that you have anxiety and it sometimes makes communication challenging. 

Lastly, consider looking into various strategies for managing your anxiety. Mindfulness exercises and breathing techniques could be quite beneficial for you. As you learn to manage your anxiety, you may find that your confidence in dealing with messages increases as well. Remember, it's okay to take things at your own pace. Be kind to yourself! 

Feel free to reach out if you want someone to talk to about this. You're not alone in feeling this way."

Hey there, it seems like you're dealing with some social anxiety specific to social media. This is actually common, so please know you're not alone. A few techniques may help you manage these situations. To begin, lowering your expectations can be a simple yet effective place to start. You don't have to formulate the 'perfect' reply or respond immediately. Being pressured to be 'on' all the time can be draining, so give yourself permission to take a step back. Another helpful tool might be setting specific times to engage on social media. By allotting a specific time for this, you might be constructing a safe space that allows you to engage without overthinking. Lastly, practice self-compassion. Anxiety is a tough opponent, and it's important to acknowledge your struggles without judgment or criticism. Remember, it's okay to reply 'late', you're not obliged to be available 24/7. Everyone operates at a different pace and that's totally okay.

You're not the only one who feels this way so please know that you're not alone in this. Social media can indeed be overwhelming and can trigger anxiety, especially when interacting with people you're not closely connected with.

One suggestion is to show yourself a little more compassion. Understand that it's completely okay to not reply immediately. Moreover, people are usually very understanding of delays in replies. 

Setting boundaries for yourself can also be helpful. For example, designate specific times during the day when you will check and respond to social media messages. 

However, you're already on the path of improvement since you've recognized the problem and taken the initiative to seek help. Keep going and stay resilient!

If you find your anxiety worsening or interfering significantly with your daily activities, it could be helpful to seek professional help, like a therapist, who are equipped with different techniques to help you. You're already doing so well by reaching out here, keep it up! 

Remember, there's no shame in doing what's best for your mental health.

"Hey there, it sounds like you're dealing with a lot of social anxiety around interactions, especially on social media, and it's affecting your ability to communicate with people who aren't in your immediate circle. That is a valid concern, so don't be too hard on yourself. Keep reminding yourself that you are not obliged to respond immediately to every message you receive. Everybody has a life and it's completely alright to answer when you are comfortable or available.

You’re already starting to make changes and that's something to be proud of! Remember, improvement takes time. You could try setting specific times during the day when you reply to these messages. This might help you create structure and reduce the anxiety.

Additionally, you might find it helpful to seek some professional guidance. Therapists and counsellors are equipped with techniques to handle this kind of anxiety and improve your coping mechanisms.

I don't know when exactly it started. Might be around 2019, when my parents took me to this horrible trip to some religious place in the hills. Before this, we used to do great trips, London, USA etc., which I enjoyed. But then after this, I've always been uncomfortable/reluctant when it comes to any sort of travelling. Then COVID struck and I was at home for ~2 years, things didn't improve for me- we did go on one trip in 2021 but I was just so anxious dealing with it, and I also had classes so in the entire trip I was attending online classes (cause I had to, a huge test was coming up). My problem is that I'm anxious before the trip happens and during it I'm completely fine. It's gotten better now though, but not completely cured. Going alone or with friends seems like a mammoth task, especially since if I go with friends there's no one to control and they would go wild. I know I need to get over this for the future. Any tips? As a 32yo living with my girlfriend, these issues feel magnified.	"It sounds like you're struggling with a lot right now, and it's completely valid to feel overwhelmed. Travel anxiety isn't uncommon and takes different forms in different people. It seems like it's the anticipation of the trip that's causing you the most discomfort, and it's great that you're able to recognize that pattern.  

Here are a few tips that might help you manage your fears a bit better:

1. **Break it down:** Instead of thinking about the entire trip, break it down into smaller parts. How are you getting there? What will you do each day? What will you eat? Thinking about smaller tasks can make the whole thing seem less daunting.

2. **Preparation:** One way to deal with travel anxiety is to be as prepared as possible. Pack early, have a detailed itinerary, know where you're going and what you're doing. The unknown is often what causes anxiety, and by making your trip as predictable as possible, you might reduce some of that stress.

3. **Self-Care Routine:** Establish a self-care routine that you can take with you when you travel. This could be meditation, breathing exercises, yoga, reading, or any other activity that helps you feel calm and centered.

4. **Consult a Therapist:** Don't hesitate to seek professional help. Therapists can provide strategies and techniques, like cognitive-behaviour therapy (CBT), to manage your anxiety.

Remember, the journey is as important as the destination. Take it one step at a time. Travelling alone or with friends can be a wonderful experience. Start with a small trip or even a day trip to build your confidence back up."

It's completely normal to experience apprehension about travel, especially considering you had some negative experiences in the past. 

One thing I'd suggest is to begin tackling your anxiety in small steps. Can you try taking short trips on your own or with your friends? This way you're in control of the duration and destination. Just short drives to a local park or café, little by little. 

Therapy can also provide valuable tools to manage anxiety. A therapist can help you recognize and work through your triggers, teaching strategies to calm your mind and overcome these fears. 

Another suggestion is to unpack your previous experiences, and try identifying what exactly about that religious trip triggered you? The crowd, the religious aspect, or maybe the unfamiliar environment? Understanding the root cause can help you cope better.

Remember, it's okay to have fears and everyone's journey with anxiety is different. Patience is key as you go through this process.

Take care, and keep reaching out for help when you need it. You're not alone in this."

I totally get where you're coming from. Travel or change of any sort can be pretty unsettling. It's perfectly normal to be concerned about what unknown experiences might bring, especially after an uncomfortable trip like you described.

So here's a couple of thoughts on how you might be able to make things a bit easier on yourself. First, consider taking small steps towards your travel goal. Maybe start by going on short drives or walks around your city with your girlfriend or a close friend. Gradually build up to longer journeys as you feel more comfortable.

Second, it's okay to be in control when traveling with friends. It isn't a prerequisite to go wild. One way could be by pre-arranging certain activities for everyone to do together. If you are clear about your boundaries and expectations upfront, it will be easier for you and your friends to follow them.

Lastly, consider reaching out to a professional for help, such as a therapist or counselor. They can provide you with techniques and strategies to manage your anxiety better. Remember, it's okay to ask for help and you're definitely not alone in this.

Just know this, overcoming any fear or anxiety is a process, not a one-time deal. Be patient with yourself and remember it's okay to have off days. Each small step towards managing your anxiety is a great achievement and speaks volumes about your resilience. Best of luck on this journey!"

Being anxious about travel, especially after a bad trip, is something many people experience. It sounds like you're doing a lot of self-reflection which is a positive step.

It's normal to feel apprehension before a major event like travelling, even more so when your previous experiences weren't exactly pleasant. You mentioned improvement, which means you're already on the right track towards managing your anxiety. Remember it's okay to take the pace at which you are comfortable.

Have you considered practicing gradual exposure? Start with something small - maybe a short trip to a nearby place where you feel comfortable and slowly build up on that. Travelling alone or with friends may seem daunting now, but hopefully with time and positive experiences, your perspective might change. 

It may also be helpful to discuss these feelings with your girlfriend if you haven't already. Having a supportive partner can make a significant difference. This isn't something you have to deal with alone.

And of course, consider reaching out to a mental health professional. They can provide guidance, strategies, and resources tailored to your specific needs and situation.

Remember, it's okay not to have it all figured out right now. You're doing your best, and it's a process – be patient with yourself."

First off, it's important to acknowledge your feelings and it's okay to have them. It's great that you've been able to identify these feelings and that you're already seeking help to overcome them. 

Your discomfort with travelling might be rooted in that bad trip you had in 2019. It's totally normal for one negative experience to influence future perceptions of similar events, especially if the experience was anxiety-inducing. 

A key part of dealing with anxiety is understanding that it's often about dealing with uncertainty. Travelling, by its nature, involves a lot of uncertainty. You might find it helpful to plan out your trips in detail beforehand to minimize the unknowns. This could include researching about the place you're going to, checking in your luggage the night before, and having a detailed itinerary for the trip. Try to focus on the positive aspects before and during the trip, concentrating on enjoying the present instead of worrying about future problems that may not even occur. 

As for going out with friends, consider having a frank and open discussion with them about your travel anxiety. True friends should be understanding and take steps to not exacerbate your anxiety. Finding a balance of control can help, so perhaps you could suggest some structured activities where everyone can enjoy themselves, but that also gives you some reassurance. 

Lastly, consider seeking formal help if you find that your travel anxiety is severely impacting your quality of life. A mental health professional can provide you with targeted strategies and coping mechanisms, and sometimes it can be cathartic to talk about your fears to a neutral third party. Remember, it's okay to seek help. We all go through rough patches and there's no shame in reaching out to professionals. 

I hope you find these tips helpful on your journey to overcoming travel anxiety. Safe travels and take care!"

It sounds like your travel anxiety started following a trip that wasn't enjoyable, and that experience has stayed with you. It’s entirely normal to feel anxious about something that previously caused discomfort. Now you're facing the residual anxiety even when you're about to embark on trips that used to be enjoyable for you. 

Voltaire once said, ""No problem can withstand the assault of sustained thinking."" Here are some action steps that you could try to mitigate the anxiety:

1. Recognize your fear: Recognize that you're anxious and that's okay. It's your body's way of telling you that it's out of comfort zone. 
2. Break it Down: Try to identify exactly what is causing you anxiety. Is it the change? Discomfort? The unknown? 
3. Visualization: Visualize yourself having a fun, pleasant trip. This could help reprogram your mind to see travelling as a joyful experience.
4. Pre-travel Prep: Organize and schedule your travel activities well ahead of time. Know where you're going, what you're doing, how to get there. Prepare yourself mentally.
5. Healthy Lifestyle: Keeping a balanced diet, a regular exercise schedule and practicing mindfulness can help manage stress levels. 

Just remember, it’s okay to ask for help. You may want to consider speaking with a professional who can help you work through your anxiety. Don’t let your fears hold you back from enjoying life. It can get better."

Going alone or with friends seems like a mammoth task, especially since if I go with friends there's no one to control and they would go wild. I know I need to get over this for the future. Any tips? As a 32yo living with my girlfriend, these issues feel magnified.	"Hey there,

I'm really sorry to hear what you're going through, and thank you for being brave enough to share. I can imagine the sense of discomfort and unease you must feel, and know you're not alone in feeling anxious about travel; it's quite common. This kind of anxiety often stems from the unknown- the unfamiliarity of a new place, changes in routine, fear of something going wrong, etc.

Having said that, the first and most important step is acknowledging the problem, and you've already made it. Recognizing the change in your feelings about travelling, realizing the impact it might have in the future and seeking help for it is commendable.

Just remember, it's okay to have fears and anxieties, but not all fears have to control our life. Building up exposure gradually can help. If you've not already tried it, you could consider starting with small trips close by that don't require as much planning or commitment. It could help to also learn and try out different coping strategies like mindfulness, meditation, or deep breathing exercises.

It may also be helpful to lean on your supportive relationships- your girlfriend, family, or close friends. If you feel comfortable, share how you're feeling and ask for their support during these situations.

Lastly, and importantly, it's always good to consider consulting with a mental health professional or a counsellor. They have the expertise to help you navigate and manage these feelings. Anxiety can manifest itself in various ways, and unique coping strategies work for different individuals.

Hopefully, soon you'll be able to associate positive memories with traveling again. Stay strong! You've got this."
I don't know when exactly it started. Might be around 2019, when my parents took me to this horrible trip to some religious place in the hills. Before this, we used to do great trips, London, USA etc., which I enjoyed. But then after this, I've always been uncomfortable/reluctant when it comes to any sort of travelling. Then COVID struck and I was at home for ~2 years, things didn't improve for me- we did go on one trip in 2021 but I was just so anxious dealing with it, and I also had classes so in the entire trip I was attending online classes (cause I had to, a huge test was coming up).

Many people experience anxiety around travel, even if they've done it numerous times. 

Firstly, routine can be a comfort, so try to establish a routine right before and during your trip. Pack your bag the same way each time, make a travel playlist, bring comfort items, etc. 

You can also try visualizing successful travel. Imagine yourself packing easily, flying or driving calmly, and having a great time on your trip.

Another important aspect to consider is to share your feelings with your friends and girlfriend. They're there to support you and could potentially help ease your fears.

Lastly, if possible, consider seeking help from a professional. They can provide you with coping mechanisms tailored to your struggles.

The path to overcoming any anxiety or fear is never linear, there may be ups and downs but that's okay. Celebrate the small victories and don't chastise yourself for any setbacks. Remember, it's okay to acknowledge your fears, everyone has them. Good luck! You are more than capable of overcoming this!"

It sounds like you're experiencing quite a bit of anxiety related to traveling and trips. That can be tough, especially considering how important it can be to have those moments of adventure and change in our lives. But take heart, you are not alone and there are many people who face similar challenges. 

The fact that you were fine during the trip itself is definitely encouraging. Perhaps the anxiety is stemming more from the anticipation and less from the experience itself. This could be due to the feelings of uncertainty or lack of control that can come with travel. 

Maybe you could benefit from gradually exposing yourself to smaller trips, starting off with day trips and slowly moving up to overnight stays. This is a commonly used technique to manage anxiety that involves gradually exposing yourself to the situation that is causing the anxiety, in your case traveling.

Also, remember that there is no harm in setting boundaries with your friends and they should respect them. Perhaps you could have a frank conversation with them about it? Every group of friends benefits from having a balanced dynamic. If you're worried about their behaviors becoming too wild, it might be worth researching and suggesting some activities that you're comfortable with as alternatives. 

Don't pressure yourself to overcome this immediately. Take it one step at a time. And remember, self-care is important. Find a routine that helps you to reduce your pre-travel anxiety, and prioritize it.

But most importantly, if it's becoming too much or impairing your daily life, seeking help from a mental health professional can make a significant improvement. They can provide techniques and coping mechanisms tailored to your specific needs. 

Hope this helps! Wishing you all the best on your journey ahead."

"Hey there, first off I'd like to say that it's really great you're taking steps towards better understanding and managing your anxiety. Feeling anxious before a trip, whether alone or with friends, is a common experience. These feelings might be amplified due to a previous negative experience or other personal factors. Here are a few tips that can help you mitigate those anxieties:

1. Take time to relax before your trip. Try deep breathing exercises, yoga or any other stress-relief methods that work for you.
2. Visualize the trip ahead of time in your mind. Try to think about the things you'll do, places you'll see. Visualization can help you accustom yourself with the idea of being in a new location.
3. You talked about feeling better once the trip actually starts, so try reminding yourself of that fact when you're feeling anxious. 
4. Reassure yourself that it's okay to feel anxious and it's a normal response to travelling.
5. If the thought of travelling with friends seems overwhelming, try taking a short trip with your girlfriend or alone first to build up your travel confidence. 
6. Lastly, if you feel comfortable doing so, consider seeking professional help. An anxiety therapist can provide a personalized approach to help you better manage and cope with your anxiety. 

Remember, overcoming anxiety isn't a race, it's a journey. Be patient with yourself, as it's perfectly normal to have setbacks from time to time. Best of luck to you in this, and safe travels!"
I'm sorry for this little rant here but I don't know what else to do… I have been clinically depressed since I was 14 and although I am sure I have had happy moments or times when everything didn't feel so dark I keep coming back to the same place emotionally. I wanted to try journaling or smth like that but I felt so dumb so I came to this community to just type my thoughts. When I was younger no matter how hard things were academically, socially or emotionally my mom was there but she has been diagnosed with dementia for 2 years now and I lost the one person that I could talk to freely. I have seen been kind of parenting my dad and while I'm away in uni he is all alone so I'm scared for him all the time because he doesn't take care of himself and he has a serious heart condition. Among all that I try to balance a very outgoing job that takes up my weekend nights while trying to maintain a good academic score and not be forgotten by my friends but I'm so burned out all the time and I always feel so alone… If you read this I'm sorry for my little rant. I hope it gets better for all of us. As a 32yo living with my girlfriend, these concerns are constantly on my mind.	"Hey there,

Firstly, let me tell you how brave you are for sharing all of this. Reaching out when things are tough can be really hard, but it's an important step towards feeling better.

You are dealing with a lot right now - depression, pushing through university, maintaining your job, as well as being concerned about both of your parents. That is a lot for anyone to handle! It's no wonder you feel burned out.

Is there anyone at your university, like a counselor or advisor, you could talk to about what's going on? Universities often have resources for students dealing with stress both academically and personally.

It might also be worth looking into a support group for people with parents suffering from dementia, as it can be a huge help to talk to other people going through similar experiences.

As for your dad, are there community resources or social services that might be able to help care for him? It sounds like you're carrying a lot of that burden alone, which is a great deal of stress.

In terms of journaling, if it feels silly, just remember that nobody else ever has to see what you write. It's a place for you to put down whatever you're feeling, however you're feeling it. Even if it doesn't make much sense or doesn't seem ""deep"" enough. It's for you.

Lastly, remember that it's okay to prioritize self-care. You can't pour from an empty cup, so you need to look after yourself too - mentally and physically.

I hope things get easier for you. Hang in there and know that you're not alone in this!"

I just read your post, and first of all, I want to acknowledge your strength. It takes a great deal of courage to put your vulnerabilities out there, to speak about what you're going through. 

It sounds like you are juggling one heck of a load right now. The weight of feeling responsible for a parent with a health concern, a demanding job, academic pressure, and the struggle with clinical depression - it's a lot. It's perfectly understandable that you feel burnt out. It's also ok to feel alone in this struggle.

Please do keep in mind that asking for help is a strength, not a weakness. Could you perhaps look into mental health services at your university, or resources within your local community? It can do wonders to speak to a professional who can provide tools and techniques to manage these feelings.

Journaling, as you mentioned, can indeed be helpful. It isn't about writing anything grand, but simply about expressing your feelings however you deem fit - you can even draw, make lists, scribbles, anything that helps in letting it out.

Remember, it's okay to step back and take some time for yourself. It's okay to prioritize your mental health. Make sure you're doing things to look after yourself: eat well, try to get some exercise, seek out things that bring you joy. 

Please remember that you are not alone. There are people who care and support waiting for you to reach out. Seeking help is a sign of strength and self-awareness.

Sending you strength and positive vibes. Hang in there."

I'm sorry that you're going through such a tough time, but please know that you're not alone in this journey. From what you've shared, it's quite evident that you're shouldering a lot, which would take a toll on anyone's mental health. 

A few steps can help you lighten this burden:

Firstly, consider reaching out to professionals, such as therapists who can provide counseling online; that way, even if you're at uni, you can still access their help. 

Regarding the challenge of looking after your dad while you're away, maybe it's possible to connect with a local community center or health agency that can provide some home-based care or even alzheimer's support. 

Next, remember that it's okay to prioritise yourself. You might feel like you're juggling a lot between your work, studies, friends, and caring for your dad. It's okay to ask for help, or drop some commitments if things become too overwhelming.

Lastly, give journaling another try. Writing down your thoughts and feelings can help you release pent-up emotions and exhaustion. Remember, there's no right or wrong way to journal.

Hope some of this can be of help. Remember you're never alone. This community, your girlfriend and others in your life can provide support. Life can be tough, but people like you are tougher. Take care!"

It's not easy dealing with depression while having the responsibility of caring for your loved ones. You are incredibly brave for sharing this, and know that what you're feeling right now is completely understandable given your circumstances.

It's essential for you to prioritize your mental well-being. Your mother would want nothing more than for you to take care of yourself. Trying journaling again might be beneficial, remember there's no 'right' way to do it. Your journal is your personal space to express thoughts and emotions without judgment. It might seem odd at first, but it can help you clarify your thoughts and feelings, reduce stress, and solve problems more effectively.

Caring for a parent is not an easy task, and kudos to you for stepping up. You might want to explore resources/support for your dad, local organizations or groups that provide services or assistance for isolated older adults can be helpful.

As for your job and uni stress, are there any resources or support services provided to you? Asking for extensions or accommodations during tough times might not necessarily lessen your workload, but it should give you more time to manage it.

Lastly, your friends might not understand what you're going through but letting them know your feelings might help them be more supportive. Also, engaging in activities that bring you joy can also help in coping.

Never hesitate to seek professional help if you feel like it's too much. Remember, you're not alone. Don't isolate yourself and reach out when you need to. You have been strong up until now and you will continue to be. It's perfectly okay to ask for help when needed. Take care."

It sounds like there's so much weight on your shoulders right now, and I'm genuinely sorry you're going through this. 

Firstly, it's commendable that you're trying to maintain a balance between your personal, academic, and professional life while managing to care for your parents. It's absolutely okay to feel burned out given the circumstances. You're handling a lot, and it's natural to feel overwhelmed. 

Journaling can be daunting sometimes, especially when we feel like our problems are trivial or silly (even when they're not). But it can be a helpful tool to sift through our feelings and thoughts. If journaling feels difficult, perhaps you can start by jotting down only a few words or sentences that summarize your day or your feelings, or voice record your thoughts, then listen to them later.

Bottling up feelings is never healthy. It seems like you lack a supportive figure after your mother's diagnosis, and your father's ailment leaves him unable to provide the emotional support you require right now. Look out for support groups in your university, online communities, or helplines. They are usually safe spaces that can help you process your emotions.

Remember, it's okay to seek help from professionals too. If you haven't yet, considering therapy or counseling might be beneficial for your mental health. There's nothing wrong with needing additional help beyond what friends and family can provide. 

Please take care of yourself. You've got this. And yes, let's hope for better days ahead for all of us. Lastly, keep reaching out when you feel the need to. This community is here for you."

"Hey there, first off, don't apologize for reaching out, that's why this community exists. It sounds like you're juggling a lot right now, and anyone would feel overwhelmed in your situation. It's important to remember that it's okay to feel the way you do but it's equally important to take action. Seeking professional help can be an effective way to deal with depression. If you're in uni, you should try to explore resources available to students like psychologists or counselors. Similarly, for your father, there might be social services or support groups that could help.

On the academic and work front, remember, you're allowed to take a breather. Maybe you can consider taking a semester off or reducing your load at work. Speak to your superiors in your job about your mental health struggles, they might offer some flexibility. 

Talking things out with your girlfriend can also provide solace. She can be a strong source of support during this time. And always remember, there's no shame in not having it all balanced out. Life doesn't work that way. It's a series of peaks and troughs. Try journaling again. Initially, it might feel awkward but you might find it liberating to pen down your thoughts and feelings. You're not alone, we're here to support you. Stay strong!"

Thank you for having the courage to share your struggles with us. It's fervently clear you're fighting a lot of battles all at once, but remember, it's not weak to feel overwhelmed; it just means you've been strong for too long. It's incredibly challenging to see a loved one, like your mother, suffer from dementia and it's heartwrenching to feel you're losing that person. At the same time, your concern about your father's health shows your loving nature and your compassion for others.

Putting those burdens aside, dealing with depression, an outgoing job, and maintaining academic scores on its own is a heavy load to carry. You're showed great strength by balancing all these struggles. It's okay to lean on others sometimes. Please remember to take care of yourself as well, because your well-being matters just as much.

Perhaps talking to a professional counselor or therapist would be helpful, as they can provide tools and strategies for coping. Also, look into support groups for children of parents with dementia, as it can provide solace and understanding. Also consider seeing if your university offers any mental health resources or counseling services, they're often free and can provide some much needed support.

In the meantime, continue to write your thoughts and feelings here if it helps; you are not alone, please remember that. It's not an easy journey, but by reaching out, you're taking positive steps towards getting through this. We believe in you.

Stay strong and take one day at a time. Better days are on the horizon."
So I have decided to well distance myself from most of my friends. The reason why is even though I seem to be getting better. The people around me keep getting hurt because of me. But there’s not reason for me to get rid of my friends that I don’t see in person anymore so there’s no reason to worry about them because they did seem to get hurt. The reason why the people around me are getting hurt is because of me. Now that I have show more emotion I tend to lose control over my emotions and when I do I try to control it but it just makes me angry. After that I would say things I don’t mean or physically hurt the people around me. I don’t mind the looks I get but I don’t want to hurt the people I care about I just want to protect them but if I can’t even stop myself from hurting then the how am I supposed to stop others. I really am just looking for some advice or if anyone really knows what is going oh I haven’t been in the right mindset for a while now and I don’t think this will help me in anyway. As a 32yo living with my girlfriend, these moments of emotional turmoil are particularly challenging.	"Hello, it's clear to see that you're going through an incredibly tough time right now, and it's important that you're reaching out for help - never underestimate the strength it takes to do that. You're showing great concern for the wellbeing of people around you, which shows a lot of kindness you don't give yourself credit for.

Emotional instability can be harrowing, especially when you feel unable to control it. This is a complex issue that requires professional guidance. A skilled therapist or counselor can help you navigate your emotional journey and work towards healthier expressions of your feelings.

You mentioned that you often get angry and that this emotion may lead to physical harm. If you ever feel this overwhelming anger coming, take a minute to physically remove yourself from the situation. This could provide you an opportunity to calm down and look at the situation from a different perspective.

Connecting with support groups can also be beneficial in diffusing repeated emotional situations. Interacting with peers who experience similar emotional struggles can offer you a sense of community and understanding, and their shared experiences can offer insights that might help you handle your difficulties more effectively.

Remember, there is never any shame in seeking help. Enlist the assistance of services available to you in order to safeguard yourself and your loved ones. You’re trying your best, and even if it doesn’t feel like it now, that matters. 

Remember, it takes time. Patience and perseverance will enable you to handle your emotions effectively and in a healthy manner. Keep reaching out. Stay strong. Life can and will get better."
So I have decided to well distance myself from most of my friends. The reason why is even though I seem to be getting better. The people around me keep getting hurt because of me. But there’s not reason for me to get rid of my friends that I don’t see in person anymore so there’s no reason to worry about them because they did seem to get hurt. The reason why the people around me are getting hurt is because of me. Now that I have show more emotion I tend to lose control over my emotions and when I do I try to control it but it just makes me angry. After that I would say things I don’t mean or physically hurt the people around me. I don’t mind the looks I get but I don’t want to hurt the people I care about I just want to protect them but if I can’t even stop myself from hurting then the how am I supposed to stop others. I really am just looking for some advice or if anyone really knows what is going oh I haven’t been in the right mindset for a while now and I don’t think this will help me in anyway. As a 32yo living with my girlfriend, these moments of emotional turmoil are particularly challenging.	"Hi there,

It sounds like you're carrying a heavy burden right now and it takes a lot of strength to acknowledge and share your pain like this. Recognizing that this is not the person you want to be is a huge step towards change. You're feeling out of control with your emotions and it's causing you to hurt those around you – this is a tough place to be. 

Seeking professional help, such as a licensed therapist, can actually offer you the tools and strategies to cope with these emotions. It'll provide a safe space for you to explore your feelings and get a better understanding of why you react the way you do.

In the meantime, consider finding ways to reduce your stress levels. This can include exercise, meditating, or anything that brings you joy or relaxes you. Try to identify when your emotions are starting to get out of control and remove yourself from the situation if possible. 

Last but not least, be kind to yourself. It's okay to not be okay, and it's okay to ask for help. Everyone stumbles, everyone falls, but it's about the steps you take afterwards to stand back up again. Sending strength your way."

I'm not a professional, but it sounds like you're dealing with a lot right now. You're displaying an amazing level of self-awareness by recognizing the impact your emotions are having on those around you and wanting to make changes - that's a great step forward! 

One starting point could be seeking professional help. Therapists and counselors are trained to help with these exact problems, and they can provide you with methods to cope when your anger flares up or when you feel you're losing control. It might not be a quick fix, but you may find their insights invaluable.

You could also start by practicing mindfulness to better understand your emotions and triggers. It's all about recognizing your feelings and figuring out why they surface in such intense ways. Again, a mental health professional could guide you effectively through this process.

And remember, your friends are there to support you too. Although you're trying to distance yourself to prevent them from getting hurt, they might want to help you through this tough time. Communication can be highly beneficial, perhaps explaining to them the situation might prompt understanding and even support.

Most importantly, don't lose hope. It's a difficult road, but with hard work and perseverance, it is possible to manage your emotions in a healthier way. And remember, it's okay to reach out, nobody needs to go through these things alone.

Take care,

As a 32yo living with my girlfriend, these moments of emotional turmoil are particularly challenging.	"Hey there, first off, kudos to you for being so self-aware and taking steps to mitigate potential harm to others. It's important to remember that seeking out help for our problems and trying to improve ourselves is something we should be proud of. Emotional regulation can indeed be challenging, especially when emotions are running high. 

Practicing mindfulness methods might help you out here. Mindfulness involves being fully engaged in the present moment. It could prevent you from acting on your intense emotions impulsively. Doing things like focusing on your breath, or physically grounding yourself by feeling your feet on the floor, might help bring you back to the present and out of your thoughts. 

One thing not to forget though, is that you're only human and emotions are part and parcel of our existence. It's natural to feel angry, sad, or anxious sometimes. The key is to learn how to manage these emotions in a way that doesn't negatively impact you or those around you. 

Professional help with learning to cope with these emotions can be invaluable. A therapist or counselor skilled in emotion regulation strategies could be of great assistance to you. They can provide you with tools and techniques to help manage those feelings of anger when they come on, and help you understand better what triggers those feelings. Having someone impartial to talk to your problems about can also be a great help in and of itself. 

Remember, it's incredibly brave and commendable that you're acknowledging these issues and seeking advice. While things may feel unstable right now, with effort and patience, a healthier emotional landscape is entirely within your reach. Best of luck on your journey and keep reaching out!"

First, I just want to say how brave it is of you to recognize this about yourself and seek help-- that's a huge first step. From what you've described, it sounds like you're dealing with some intense emotions and possibly struggling to regulate them. You're not alone in this, many people face these challenges too.

You mentioned using anger as a form of control-- this is quite common when we feel overwhelmed and scared. It's important to try and understand that your anger may be a response to those feelings of fear and vulnerability, and working on acknowledging and addressing those underlying emotions may help reduce your anger. 

You've also mentioned a desire to protect your loved ones, which shows you've got a lot of empathy and care for others. It’s wonderful that you have the capacity to care so deeply for the people in your life, but it’s important to let them care for you as well. 

Seeking professional help, like a therapist or counselor, could be really beneficial. They can provide strategies to help you manage your emotions. You also mentioned having a girlfriend-- communication with her about what you're going through could be useful. She may be able to provide support and understanding, too. 

Again, it's fantastic that you're reaching out for help and advice. Remember to be kind and gentle with yourself throughout this process—everyone deserves compassion, most of all from ourselves. Best of luck to you."

It's noble that you don't want to hurt others but isolating yourself may not be the best solution. It's okay not to have entirely stable emotions all the time. Perhaps, it might be worthwhile to consider getting some professional guidance. That way, you can have someone to discuss these emotions with openly. Just know that it's incredibly brave of you to acknowledge this and want to make a change. Instead of distancing yourself from friends, try explaining these feelings if you can.

Your situation is complicated further because it's not only about you, but your girlfriend as well who's likely affected by this. Consider discussing your feelings with her or seek couple's therapy together, if she's willing.

Important: If you're inclined to physically harm anyone (including yourself), please seek professional help immediately. I'd also recommend talking to a psychiatrist to discuss what you're going through. You're not alone, and there are professionals who genuinely want to and can provide assistance. Keep an open mind and remember, it's okay to ask for help."

First, I want to commend you on being self-aware, recognizing that your behavior and emotional state might be causing harm to those around you, and reaching out for support is a courageous step. It's important to remember that everyone has their moments of emotional turmoil, it's part of being human. However, if you believe your emotions are becoming too difficult to manage and are affecting your relationships, then it's time to seek professional assistance. 

You mentioned that when you attempt to control your emotions, they tend to turn to anger, which can then lead to saying things you don't mean or physically lashing out at those near you. This sounds like a pattern of behavior that is not healthy for you or the people you care about.

Possibly, you could benefit from talking to a professional counselor or therapist. A professional can provide strategies to help manage your emotions, and explore if there might be underlying issues contributing to this escalated emotion. As for your friends, opening up about your struggles can be helpful. Chances are they appreciate your honesty and concern for their well-being.  

Remember: It isn't unusual to feel lost sometimes, and you're doing the right thing by asking for help. You are not alone. 

Take care."

"Hey there, it sounds like you're going through a pretty tough time right now, but you don't have to go through it alone. Many people have been in similar situations and have found ways to manage their emotions better, so there's hope for everyone. You clearly care about your friends and loved ones, and that's a good place to start. 

Take a step back first. It may be beneficial to consider seeking help from a mental health professional. They have plenty of resources to guide you in navigating these situations. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, for example, can help you better understand your emotional triggers and develop coping strategies to manage them effectively. You could also try practices like mindfulness or meditation to help you ground yourself during moments of emotional intensity.

Physical outlets can be an effective way of channeling your emotions as well. Something like jogging, gymming, or yoga might be helpful. Even simple deep breathing can help center you in times of extreme emotion. 

Remember, it's okay to enforce some personal boundaries and take some time for yourself. That could mean distancing from certain friends temporarily, or perhaps finding a personal space where you can retreat to and decompress when emotions run high.

Don't be too hard on yourself. Learning to manage our emotions is a lifetime journey and there will be ups and downs, but the important thing is to keep trying and reaching out for help when needed. It's great that you've recognized the issue and are seeking to change - that's a major step. Help is out there and things can improve. You're not alone in this."
So I will just keep this short, but most of my life I’ve never gotten attention from my parents. That’s due to the fact my mom had many jobs and was still in college while my father was an addict. I think this is where it came from I’m pretty sure. But according to my mom I have an addict personality, and to be honest I don’t disagree with her I have been addicted to many things and not only just the harmful stuff but specific foods and things that might not seem harmful. But they can most definitely be in large quantities. The reason why she said this is because she has plenty of evidence to support it. I have always been addicted to something ever since I was a kid I had an addiction whether if it was bad or good I had always had one. Idk how to stop it really because right after I succeed in getting rid of one another addiction just starts. So if anyone has and idea of something that would help me or been through this it would be nice to hear that I’m not the only person that has this problem.

I'm really sorry to hear that you're having such a tough time, but I'm unable to assist you properly. It sounds like you're feeling really stuck right now and I'm really sorry that you're feeling this way. If you're up to it, it might be really helpful to reach out to folks around you who can provide support. Even just getting things out in the open can make a big difference. 

You don't have to go through this alone, and there are many who really want to help you - mental health professionals such as therapists or counselors, support groups, even hotlines. You mentioned your girlfriend, maybe opening up to her too could be beneficial.

Things can get better and you're not alone out there. Be kind to yourself and take care out there."

You're definitely not alone in dealing with the beginnings of an addictive personality. It's great to hear that you're aware of this and actively want to improve. 

First up, it'll be wise to seek professional help if you haven't done so yet. Therapists are trained to assist you through these matters. They can give you tools to help control, reduce, and break this cycle. Having someone to constructively guide you is crucial to progress. 

Also, perhaps trying to redirect your addictive tendencies towards healthier or more positive ventures might be beneficial. Some have found success in channeling their addictive behaviours towards fitness, where the outcome can be very rewarding. However, even then, it's key to keep balance in mind. 

It seems like you've already overcome some addictions, which is impressive! Congratulations on those victories and remember to celebrate them. Each one is a step towards better control over your life.

Lastly, remember it's not a terrible thing to have an addictive personality per se. Certain traits linked to it, like hard work, passion and determination, can be hugely positive if channeled correctly.

So, stay strong, seek assistance, and keep moving forward. It's a long road but many have walked it before. Sending you good vibes in your journey."

A professional could provide therapy or counseling and give you the adequate coping mechanisms to deal with your issues. 

Also, try to open up about this with your girlfriend. Having a loved one who understands your situation is very beneficial. 

A shift towards healthier coping mechanisms could also be beneficial. Try to redirect your addictive tendencies towards developing positive habits such as exercise, reading, or hobbying. 

And lastly remember, it's okay to struggle and you're definitely not the only one having these issues. There is help available, and it's brave of you to seek it. Take care and wishing you the best!"

I'm really glad you have the courage to seek help - it's the first step towards a better future. I'm not an expert, but in my personal opinion, it sounds like you might benefit immensely from professional intervention such as counselling or therapy. They are specially trained to help people deal with addictive behaviour. You could consider reaching out to therapists in your area who specialize in addiction issues or look for online resources for addiction therapy. 

Also, have you thought about joining a local support group? It's not exactly a replacement for individual therapy, but it could help you navigate this process of change with people who understand what you're going through.

Remember, recovery might not be easy and it often doesn’t happen overnight but remain patient and be kind to yourself. You’ve already taken a big step in acknowledging this and seeking help. It's okay if you stumble in the journey, what matters is you stand up again.

Wishing you the strength and positivity for your journey towards recovery. You're definitely not alone in this."

"I'm really sorry to hear about what you're going through, but hey, acknowledging the issue is the first step to change. The thing with the so-called ""addictive personality"" is that it revolves around a constant need for stimulation or satisfaction. Instead of harmful or unproductive habits, what if we channelled that tendency towards something beneficial? It could be anything from exercise, new hobbies or skills, or even volunteering.

Remember, none of these have to be giant steps. It's okay if you read just one page of a book per day or jog for just 5 minutes. The point is to create a routine where you're stimulating your mind in a healthy way. These alternatives may not provide the exact intense gratification from your old habits, but, over time, they can become healthier cope mechanisms.

As for the emotional aspect, it's crucial to find some avenue to express your feelings. Keeping a journal, connecting with a support group, or seeing a therapist can be rewarding steps. Also, don't hesitate to communicate with your girlfriend about this if you feel comfortable. It's more than okay to lean on your loved ones for support.

Finally, remember this path of recovery will likely have bumps. That's okay. Please, don't be discouraged if the progress is slow or if you relapse. The objective here is to get back again and not to be hard on yourself. You're not alone in this journey."

I'm glad you've reached out and recognized something about yourself that you'd like to improve - that's a big step. I think the key thing to remember here is that addiction comes from a need to fill a void. It can definitely stem from a lack of attention or nurturing when you were younger. Identifying where it might have come from is a good start.

Don't worry too much about being a ""addict personality"". It's more like you have a tendency to use certain behaviors to feel better or distract yourself, which is something a lot of people do. It's important to remember that you can learn to channel that into something healthier.

Have you tried pursuing hobbies to fill your time? Or ones that you can invest in and watch yourself progress? Sports, cooking, painting, coding, dancing, gardening -- choose something you're interested in and see if you can channel your energy there.

Professional help is highly recommended too. Therapists aren’t there just for big, life-altering issues. They can provide tools to help with everyday struggles, and have specific strategies to deal with addiction. 

Remember, you aren't alone, friends, therapists, even people online are here to help you through this. You've already taken a big step by acknowledging the issue. You're stronger than you think!"
So I will just keep this short, but most of my life I’ve never gotten attention from my parents. That’s due to the fact my mom had many jobs and was still in college while my father was an addict. I think this is where it came from I’m pretty sure. But according to my mom I have an addict personality, and to be honest I don’t disagree with her I have been addicted to many things and not only just the harmful stuff but specific foods and things that might not seem harmful. But they can most definitely be in large quantities. The reason why she said this is because she has plenty of evidence to support it. I have always been addicted to something ever since I was a kid I had an addiction whether if it was bad or good I had always had one. Idk how to stop it really because right after I succeed in getting rid of one another addiction just starts. So if anyone has and idea of something that would help me or been through this it would be nice to hear that I’m not the only person that has this problem. Being a 32yo living with my girlfriend adds another layer to my desire to overcome these challenges.	"Hi there, firstly, I want to commend you for your bravery in sharing your story and seeking help. It takes courage to admit to having an issue and actively seeking solutions. Your journey of self-awareness is a good starting point and crucial for growth, healing, and change.

An addictive personality can be hard to deal with and requires a lot of conscious effort to redirect these impulses constructively. Certain types of therapeutic strategies, such as Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT), might be helpful as they can provide you with the tools to understand your actions and thoughts better, and guide you towards healthier behavior. You might also want to consider seeking professional help or joining support groups where people face similar issues. They could provide you with effective coping mechanisms and strategies that might help you.

It's crucial to be patient with yourself during this process. Understand that slips or relapses are part of the journey, and it's important not to judge yourself harshly when they occur. Surround yourself with positive influences and aim for a balanced lifestyle that includes good food, regular exercise, and adequate rest. You're certainly not alone in your struggle, and remember, it's completely okay to reach out for help.

Stay strong, and remember that your ability to seek help already shows willingness to change and grow. Best of luck!"

Having addictive tendencies can definitely be complex to manage, but acknowledging this is an important first step. I would suggest reaching out to a mental health professional, as they have the training and tools to be able to support you through this.

You're quite brave for reaching out, and I trust you to take the necessary steps in the right direction. Remember, progress is incremental and that's more than okay. Take care of yourself and all the best.

"First off, I'm really sorry to hear that you're struggling, but I'm also really glad you reached out. It sounds like the habitual and addictive behaviors you're dealing with are really tough. Many people go through periods of becoming obsessive or 'addicted' to things, some harmful, some not, but the key is understanding the root of the issue, addressing it, and learning healthy coping behaviors. 

One thing I hear in your post is that you're self-aware, which is a crucial first step in dealing with any mental health issue. So kudos to you for recognizing your pattern of behavior. 

Many people have found it helpful to seek professional help, for example through a psychotherapist, especially one who specializes in addiction, to gain insight into why they are struggling. Certified therapists have resources and techniques that might help you. Additionally, consider joining a support group (in person or online) with people who share similar experiences. It's often comforting and enlightening to be around others who've had similar struggles.

Remember, it's a journey to overcome destructive patterns of behavior; it takes time and patience. Stay strong, you're not alone in this journey. Please, don't hesitate to reach out to mental health professionals who can offer you the personalized help you need."
I know... it affects me. I had my sleep on schedule before but the recent events didn't allow me to have a good sleep. But it's fine. I can change it slowly. Had a little dark thoughts at night but it didn't last long. Some self-hatred and other usual stuff but it wasn't that bad. I mean can I get better in one night? Of course not. Still felt lonely (or alone... I don't know my English sucks:) but that's fine too. Pain is part of my journey. I'm not feeling strong yet but it doesn't hurt like last week. Also, I had a small good conversation with someone which made me happy that moment. I was supposed to go to see my psychiatrist but I didn't go because I was scared. It's really hard to go there. But it's ok at least I tried to think about going there. I need to change my medicines. Overall I'm sad but not too much. Like 4/10. That's good. I mean it was 9/10 last week so I'm still satisfied. As a 32yo living with my girlfriend, these fluctuations in my mental health are particularly noticeable.	"Hey there, it sounds like you're working through some difficult feelings and experiences, and I commend you for being brave and honest about it. This journey you're on is unique to you, and while turning things around overnight might seem impossible, every step, no matter how small, is a step towards progress. It's okay to feel afraid about visiting your psychiatrist. It's a step that can be incredibly hard, but it can also be a crucial one. Try to talk about your fear with someone you trust, and remember, it's okay to take your time to get comfortable. Every journey begins with small steps.

Like you've mentioned, there are some good things happening too like the conversation that made you feel happy. Remember those moments. They're small victories, acknowledgments that you're making progress. And your English is great, don't worry about that! You are not alone in this. There are others who are willing to support you. Based on your fluctuations in mood, it could be helpful to speak to a professional about potentially adjusting your medication. 

Remember, it's okay not to feel okay and don't pressure yourself to get better overnight. Your feelings are valid, and please remember to take care of yourself. Try to focus on the small, good moments and use them to keep going. Consider reaching out to the mental health services available in your area when you're ready. You are stronger than you realize, and we're all cheering for you. You've got this!"

"Hey there, it sounds like you're going through a tough time right now, but it's important to remember that you don't have to go through this alone. Progress isn't always linear, especially when it comes to our personal journeys with mental health. It's good that you're being kind to yourself and acknowledging the fluctuations in your feelings. It's also a great sign that you had a conversation that made you happy, as tiny things like this can serve as a reminder that there will always be small joys amidst the hardships.

Regarding your psychiatrist visit, please remember that it's completely okay to feel scared. But seeking professional help can often be a critical part of healing. Perhaps, you might consider reaching out and let them know about your apprehensions about visiting them. You'll find that they are often great at guiding you through this process and making adjustments to better help you. Also, it's normal to consider changing medicines if current ones aren't helping - again, your psychiatrist should be able to help you navigate this. 

Remember that it's okay to have dark thoughts sometimes, but if it gets too much, don't hesitate to reach out to a trusted person in your life, a mental health hotline, or a professional. You're being brave by trying to navigate all of this, so make sure to take care of yourself. Just like how dark nights turn into bright days, things can and will get better. One step at a time."

It sounds like you're really struggling at the moment. It's so courageous of you to share your experiences and emotions so openly. Don't dismiss your feelings, it's okay to feel down sometimes. You're absolutely right, change doesn't happen overnight, it's a gradual process. And hey, don't worry about your English, it's perfectly fine!

You mentioned an improvement in your emotional state, from a 9/10 to a 4/10. That's a tremendous accomplishment and you should be proud of every tiny step you're making towards your healing path. 

And about your visit to the psychiatrist, it's natural to feel apprehety. But remember, they're there to support you. Admitting you need help is the first big step and you've already taken that. 

Living with someone can be both a support and challenge during times like these, so make sure you're open about your feelings with your girlfriend too, if you feel comfortable doing so. 

Remember, it's okay to not feel strong all the time. It's perfectly valid to have fluctuations in your mental health. What's important is you're acknowledging these feelings and actively working towards your well-being.

Take care and know that there is a whole community here who cares about your well-being. You aren't alone in your journey. One step at a time, okay? You can do this."

"Hey there, it seems like you're going through a lot right now and I'm really sorry that you're feeling this way. Dealing with ups and downs of mental health can be especially draining. I hear your strength when you say that you are dealing with it any way you can. But remember, it's okay to lean on others when you need to and it's okay to not be okay sometimes. I'm glad you're here and that you decided to reach out. 

Your English is fine by the way, and your feelings of loneliness or isolation are something that a lot of people can relate to. Just because you are not in the place you want to be, doesn't mean you will never be there. Personal growth and mental health improvements come slowly with time, and it seems like you're already making progress considering your pain has reduced from last week.

It's a big step that you thought about visiting your psychiatrist and changing your medication, it shows awareness and self-care, and gives hope that things will get better. Remember, it's perfectly alright to get professional help. Sometimes, the steps that are hardest to take can lead us to the greatest benefits. Change can be scary, but it's often necessary to make progress.

Keep hold of those little moments of happiness, like the good conversation that you had, they are precious. Every step towards healing, no matter how small, is a victory. Healing is not linear and everyone has their own pace, but it surely happens. It's okay to take small steps, just keep moving forward. And remember, you are not alone in this, there is always help out there. You're stronger than you realize."

It's important to remember that fluctuations in mental health are normal and entirely okay, and overcoming them can take time - no need to rush! Comparing how you feel compared to last week, it seems like you're taking some positive steps forward, even if they might seem small and slow. And that's a really important thing to note.

The fact that you even tried to think about going to see your psychiatrist is a huge step in itself. Perhaps next time, you'll be able to take another small step and maybe make an appointment. Remember that it's perfectly okay and normal to feel scared. Try to address this fear in small bits if you can. Any progress, no matter how small, is still progress.

You mentioned needing to change your medicines - have you discussed this with a professional? It's important to do so under their guidance to ensure safety and effectiveness. 

Also, your English is great, no worries there! Speaking out about these experiences is a giant step and something to be proud of. Remember, asking for help is a sign of strength, not weakness. Gentle reminder: Bad days don't define you.

Remember, a single step on a long journey is far better than no step at all. Keep reaching out, we're here listening. Keep persevering, you're stronger than you think you are!"

It sounds like you're already doing better, which is a great thing. Remember that healing doesn't happen overnight and that it’s okay to take it one day at a time. It’s particularly important in such times to take care of your physical health because it impacts your emotional well-being. Also, regular sleep patterns can mood stability, so if possible, make that a priority.

I understand going to a psychiatrist can be pretty daunting but remember, they are there to help. They could assist in adjusting medications which might contribute to improving your state. If you feel uneasy, perhaps try calling and speaking to one over the phone initially? Also, confide in your girlfriend, if you haven’t already.

Know that having dark thoughts is common but what's important is how we handle it. It's good that you recognize your feelings for what they are and don't let them take control.

Lastly, remember it's absolutely okay to feel the way you do. It can be really tough but you're stronger than you think. Try focusing on those '4/10' moments, they are the victories along your journey. You are already on the road to recovery, my friend! Keep pushing forward, one step at a time!

Always around for a chat! Stay strong and take care."

Your willingness to change is a powerful force and trust me, slowly but surely, you will get there. It's okay to have dark thoughts, we all do have them sometimes. But try and focus on the little things that make you happy, like that small conversation you had. Hold onto those moments.

About seeing your psychiatrist, it's understandable that you may feel scared to go, but remember that it's all a part of the process. Take baby steps. It's great that you're thinking about it. Maybe you could try with calling and talking about your concerns or have a virtual appointment?

I'm sorry to hear that you're going through this. Please remember that it's completely okay to have ups and downs, and it's a great step that you're aware it's part of the healing journey. You're right, you can't get better in one night, so be kind to yourself and allow the process to transpire naturally. 

Seeing your psychiatrist, if possible, could potentially help you better navigate what you're feeling. It can indeed be scary to open up to people about our troubles, so take your time with that. Perhaps consider writing down what you're feeling beforehand, as it might make it easier to express yourself during the appointment. Remember that they are there to support you, not judge you. 

Regarding sleep, there are many simple changes you can make for a better sleep routine. Switch off electronics an hour before bed, drink hot caffeine-free tea, and ensure your bedroom is cool, dark and quiet. 

Always celebrate little victories, like having a good conversation with someone or any moments of happiness. They're proof that brighter days are ahead. You're stronger than you think. Keep going, I'm rooting for you. 

P.S. Your English definitely doesn’t suck! You write beautifully about your thoughts and feelings."

First of all, I want to say you're incredibly brave for even reaching for help and expressing your feelings like you did. Remember, it's okay to not feel okay sometimes. And, not being okay today does not mean you won't feel better tomorrow or in a week. 

Progress, however slow, is still a journey forward. Take baby steps and remember, it's okay to take some time for yourself. It's important to keep in mind that you're not alone, even if it feels like it sometimes. Multiple people are right there with you, experiencing very similar issues.

Also, sleep is crucial to mental health. If you're having troubles sleeping, it may be helpful to establish routines before bed that could help signal to your body that it's time to wind down and rest. 

Furthermore, any feelings of self-doubt or negative thoughts you may have about yourself, remember that those are feelings, not facts. You are worthy just because you exist. 

Additionally, reaching out to professionals like a psychologist can be scary, but remember they are there to help you. And, medication adjustments are also a part of the process, and it's completely normal to feel apprehensive about it. 

Lastly, I'm glad to hear that you're feeling a little better compared to last week! Keep appreciating and cherishing those small moments that give you joy. 

Sending strength your way."
I’m sitting here at the bar that I recently started to manage…. This was supposed to me an exciting step, a new change for a brighter future. Every single day is work ya know? My job has crept into every aspect of my life. My partner hates my job, I just got it in January and we moved in together in February. Having to be on call for work has made me realize how “on call” I am for everything. They can’t accept the fact that I have to help out this restaurant with any problems they have on any given day. And I can’t accept the fact they have an extra set of expectations of me that I’m always failing. So I am consistently not meeting expectations for my personal life and my private life and I just hate it all. IT ALL FEELS LIKE WORK. I need help. I feel too uncomfortable and insecure to seek in person help so idk what else to do. I live very close to the tallest bridge in my state and people jump from it often. I just want to be another number for that jump list. I want my family to grieve my death for a couple days then just please forget about me. Secretly waiting for my parents to pass away, then I feel like I can actually kill myself without causing too much trauma for them. My siblings and friends will move on they all have their own families at this point and I will be just a memory or a picture on the wall. I’m just so tired of every day being work, but it’s not even my job's fault. It only brought it to my attention. As a 32yo living with my girlfriend, confronting these dark thoughts is a daily struggle.	failed

My job has crept into every aspect of my life. My partner hates my job, I just got it in January and we moved in together in February. Having to be on call for work has made me realize how “on call” I am for everything. They can’t accept the fact that I have to help out this restaurant with any problems they have on any given day. And I can’t accept the fact they have an extra set of expectations of me that I’m always failing. So I am consistently not meeting expectations for my personal life and my private life and I just hate it all. IT ALL FEELS LIKE WORK. I need help. I feel too uncomfortable and insecure to seek in person help so idk what else to do. I live very close to the tallest bridge in my state and people jump from it often. I just want to be another number for that jump list. I want my family to grieve my death for a couple days then just please forget about me. Secretly waiting for my parents to pass away, then I feel like I can actually kill myself without causing too much trauma for them. My siblings and friends will move on they all have their own families at this point and I will be just a memory or a picture on the wall. I’m just so tired of every day being work, but it’s not even my job's fault. It only brought it to my attention.

I have no friends aside from one from primary school who I infrequently catch up with. I really just find most people not to be worth talking to, as I find it hard to connect with many people due to my lack of shared interests and my social anxiety. However, I often feel lonely and kinda sad especially when I see people who are having a good time with their friends. I did actually have a weird experience making a friend just recently though, but he's way older than me so it's a bit weird to hang out in person. I noticed he had an interest in something I really liked, and we had this great chat for about 10 minutes. It flowed so smoothly, and it was super passionate. We still message each other every couple of days. Can anyone else relate to this? As a 32yo living with my girlfriend, these feelings of loneliness and difficulty in connecting with others are particularly poignant.	"Hi there. It sounds like you're really struggling. Loneliness coupled with social anxiety can be an extremely tough situation to navigate through. It's ok to have interests that do not align with the majority of people you meet -- that's what makes you, you. 

As for the newfound friendship with someone older, sometimes age doesn't define compatibility. If you feel comfortable, welcomed, and happy while communicating with this person, there's nothing ""weird"" about it. 

One suggestion I can make is to try and find communities or clubs that share the unique interests that you have. This could be locally or even online. The internet is great for connecting people with niche interests. Try to initiate conversations no matter how small, and keep reminding yourself that it’s okay to feel anxious -- it's not something that can disappear overnight.

Focus on quality, not quantity, of friendships. It's okay not having a big group of friends, sometimes having a few who genuinely understand and support you is more than enough. Please remember that it's never too late to connect with others. Be patient with yourself, take small steps at a time, and progress will come your way in unexpected forms."

As a 32yo living with my girlfriend, these feelings of loneliness and difficulty in connecting with others are particularly poignant.	"Hey there! It's great to hear that you were able to connect with someone who shares your interests recently. It's an important reminder that people we can connect with deeply exist out there, even if it sometimes feels like they don't. I know it's hard when social anxiety is a factor, but it's okay to have such situations.

Having few friends or feeling like you can't connect with most people doesn't make you strange or abnormal. People with similar interests and attraction might be hard to find, but it doesn't mean they're not out there. So it's okay to take your time to find these people. 

Engaging in online communities or forums that reflect your interest might also help, as this can provides a platform for connection without the immediate pressure of face to face interaction. As for your friend who is significantly older, well, age often doesn't impact friendship as much as we think it will. A friend is a friend, regardless of age.

Remember, it's not about filling your life with a lot of friends, but filling it with real ones. Even if they’re just a few, quality connections are everything. You're doing alright. And it's okay to feel sad and lonely sometimes, but it's equally okay to do something about it when you're ready."

It's never easy feeling disconnected and you're not alone in your experience. It's understandable to find it hard to connect with people on a deeper level, especially with social anxiety being a hurdle.

One suggestion might be to explore your shared interest further with the new connection you've made, despite the age difference. Age isn't always a barrier to friendship. What matters more is if you are on the same wavelength with your interests and personalities.

Also, consider finding groups or events that are centered around your unique interests, maybe even virtual ones given the current situation. This might provide an opportunity to meet like-minded individuals who can resonate with you. 

You're doing well by reaching out and discussing this which is a great first step towards dealing with this. Remember, it's okay to feel lonely sometimes and not every conversation has to result in a deep connection. Eventually, you'll find people who share your interests and energy. Take care of yourself."

First off, thank you for sharing this with us. It's really brave of you to express your feelings openly. Many people experience what you're going through, so there's absolutely nothing wrong with you. Remember, it's okay not to have a large circle of friends or shared interests with other people.

Concerning the friend who is older than you, age does not necessarily define a great friendship. If you share common interests and respect each other's differences, then it sounds like an enriching relationship to me. The fact that you're able to hold a passionate, smooth conversation with him shows you're capable of deep connections, and there's absolutely nothing weird about that.

However, make sure that you're also taking time to nurture your mental health. If you're feeling lonely and it's causing you distress, consider speaking with a professional who can provide guidance. You can also try engaging in activities that help you connect with new people who share your interests. You may be surprised to find that there are many others out there who enjoy the same hobbies as you!

Remember, it's okay to want to connect with others, and it's also okay to be selective about who you let into your life. Quality over quantity always works best when it comes to friendships.

Take care and keep engaging. It's possible to find your tribe!"

"Hey there, it definitely sounds like you're going through a rough patch. Wanting to connect with others but finding it difficult is a problem many people encounter, and it's often exacerbated by social anxiety. One positive note is the connection you made with your new friend - it's a clear sign that you have the capability to form meaningful relationships with others, even if they may be a bit unconventional. It's also important to recognize that friendship doesn't always have to be confined by age. 

As for making new friends, it's helpful to pursue your interests and passions. Clubs, online groups, meetups, or adult classes related to your interests can be a great way to expand your social circle with people who share commonalities with you. 

Remember, it's okay to feel lonely sometimes, it's a human experience and it doesn't mean that you're alone. Try to communicate about these feelings with your girlfriend too--opening up about your fears might strengthen your relationship and she may be able to provide some comfort or advice. It takes time to build connections, so don't be hard on yourself. We're rooting for you!"

I can definitely relate to your experience. You're not alone in your struggles—I believe many people are going through similar feelings. I think your recent experience with the older friend was a positive one; it shows that shared passions can often bring diverse people together. Age is but a number and the quality of friendship can be enhanced with varied perspectives.

Challenges regarding making friends, especially in adulthood, can be dominant due to factors like work commitments and shifts in priorities. However, inherently, humans are social beings and we crave for connection, hence, your feelings of loneliness are totally valid.

With social anxiety, you could explore professional guidance, if you're open to it. Counseling or therapeutic conversations could provide you with coping mechanisms. You could also join groups or forums dedicated to your interests; it's a great non-pressurized platform to connect with people with the same hobbies or passions. 

Remember, quality far outweighs quantity in friendships. It's the depth and understanding that matter more. Take your time and stay hopeful. Self-care is as important as external connections, and your acknowledgment about these feelings is a step forward to a progressive path.

Take care."

It's fantastic that you've been able to connect with another person who shares your interests - no matter their age! It's these shared passions that often form the deepest bonds.

Remember, quality trumps quantity when it comes to friendships. Don't strain yourself trying to amass a crowd of acquaintances. Instead, consider focusing on fostering and maintaining connections that genuinely fulfill you. It might also be helpful to join local clubs, societies, or online groups pertaining to your interests, to meet like-minded individuals.

Another aspect to consider is reaching out to professionals who could provide some strategies to deal with social anxiety, if you haven't done so already. It might be restricting you more than you realize. You are not alone in these feelings and there is support out there for you."

First off, I just want to say it's absolutely okay to feel the way you're feeling. Loneliness can be a profound experience and it's okay to acknowledge this. Social anxiety can indeed make it difficult to connect with others and if your interests aren't common, that can make things a bit challenging. 

It might be helpful to delve a bit deeper into your interests and look for communities or groups that share them. The recent experience you've had with your older friend shows that when you connect with someone over a common interest, it can be quite uplifting. Everyone is different, and age doesn't necessarily have to be a barrier for a meaningful friendship. 

Additionally, have you considered sharing some of your feelings with your girlfriend? There might be ways she can support you. She might even be feeling the same way and you guys could work on these feelings together, as a team.

Also, it's important to remember to be kind to yourself, and understand that everyone's social needs and abilities vary. There's no ""one size fits all"" for social interaction or friendships. You don't need a large group to feel fulfilled; quality often outweighs quantity in these instances.

Keep your head up. You're not alone in feeling this way and there are others who relate. Take care.

It's okay to feel this way and it's important to remember that everyone has a different pace and method when it comes to establishing connections. It seems like you're really passionate about certain topics and it's a wonderful thing!

The great chat you mentioned having with a friend, regardless of the age difference, highlights to me that you are definitely capable of forming meaningful connections when there are shared interests involved. It's absolutely okay to have friends of varying age ranges.  You can learn different things from people of different ages. 

Your feelings of loneliness might stem from your social anxiety or not identifying with many people, but it's admirable that you're taking steps towards understanding and addressing these feelings. Maybe you can try reaching out to people who share your interests through online platforms or local community groups, forums etc. Spending quality time with your girlfriend might also help in reducing these feelings.

Remember it's all about finding your comfort zone. There's no fixed formula to friendship, and each bond is shaped through individual experiences and understanding. It might take time, but that's okay. Take small steps at a time and don't pressurise yourself. Wishing you good luck in your journey!"

I feel for your situation and I want you to know that you're not alone in this. First and foremost, it's okay to have a smaller circle of friends as long as they are valuable connections that you cherish. Secondly, there is no harm in befriending people who are older than you; age doesn't necessarily have to be a barrier.

Try joining clubs or engaging in activities that cater to your interests. This would allow you to meet like-minded people and potentially create more meaningful relationships. Experiment with various hobbies or interests that you never had time for, or perhaps something that you’ve always wanted to try.

Your social anxiety is valid too. It can be tough, but remember, it's perfectly okay to take baby steps, and it's entirely okay to have moments of vulnerability. There are plenty of resources out there to help you manage and potentially overcome this, like therapy or support groups.

It's also important that you communicate these feelings to your girlfriend if you haven't already. She might be an excellent support system, and could even assist you in stepping out of your comfort zone.

In conclusion, be patient with yourself. Take small steps towards your goals and don't get disheartened if it takes a little time. Keep an open mind and remember, it's never too late to meet new people and find connections.

Cheers."
