"I'm a student (12th grade) I'm preparing for jee adv one of hardest exam in India ive wasted my last whole year not studding and hanging and having fun with my friends. my father starts noticing that that i am studding lately, so he gets often mad at me he meets my teachers last week n my teachers exposed me like striping my cloths. he told him everything about my studies, my friend circle, not paying attention in lectures. my father gets really mad at me.

but problem is i wants to sit and study but i can't even sit and study for 10mins. i have tons of chapters in backlog and lots of undone homework. and even scarier thing is my school's timetable is filled with tons of test to kill me. my mental health is drowning, iam depressed."	"Slow down dude it’s not end of the world take your problems one by one get this though nothing comes free you should put in the work start hanging out with studying crows you’ll see you priorities change

"Forgive yourself first. Everyone has a rebellious phase in life and everyone your age just wants to have fun. That’s normal. You’re not alone. 

Now, if you (not your father) have goals, ask yourself what you need to do to achieve them. If studying isn’t working, ask yourself why. Is it because you have trouble focusing? Why? Are you too busy worrying about something? Can that something be addressed? Are you distracted? Can you minimize the distractions? Can you change study locations or ask a good student to help you? Does the study method not appeal to you? Not everyone learns the same way. Some people learn by listening. some people learn by reading. some people learn by doing. Try switching up your method. Make flash cards or highlight the book or record a lecture and then listen to the recording again, whatever works best for you. 

And you know what? If you try these things and it doesn’t work that’s ok. Forgive yourself for that too. School is hard. You’re not the only one to struggle with a class. It doesn’t mean you can’t have a wonderful life. There is more than one route to success and more than one way to find happiness.

Good luck my friend. I’m rooting for you."	1	0	0	0.003225846216082573	0.0010994672775268555

"Sometime I tend to be a bit hypochondriac and I know that. But for some reason it doesn't help much. 

When I walk home I usually pass a house with a very cute and playful, young German Shepard (maybe a year old? I don't really know). Sometimes this dog drops out one of its toys to someone to throw it back, so it can chase it, bring back and throw it out between the bars of the fence again. Yesterday the dog sat behind the fence again, waiting for someone. Since the ball, the dog usually drops out, were not really intact to say the least, it tried to drop out a very soft and chewy, yellow toy. The poor dog had a hard time throwing it out, because it always stuck to the bars of the fence, so it started to furiously chew the toy for some reason. I thought he just trying to drop it out, so when he brought the toy close to the fence I tried to take it away (the dog seems very friendly, so I didn't think it was a bad idea). As I tried to take the toy away the dog accidentally ""bit"" me. I wrote ""bit"" me because it didn't even break the skin, and the ""bite mark"" literally just looked like when you press your teeth to finger harder. 

Ever since I'm a bit nervous about getting rabies, because even though to get infected, the bite has to break the skin, but during the winter my eczema on my hand gets a lot worse, and my hand is usually full of micro cuts and small wounds, so maybe the dog's saliva got into one of the many wounds on my hand. I know it sounds stupid, but when I tell you all the things that are against me getting rabies, I will sound straight retarded to even worry about it. 

I live in Slovakia (near Bratislava). When your dog grow older than 3 month, you have to vaccinate it against rabies. It's mandatory. (But my thoughts says what if the owner failed to do that?)

Second my country is almost rabies free. Only the eastern part of the country has a very few rabies cases every few years (and even these infected wild or stray animals mostly are from Poland and Ukraine, and just crossed the border). I don't think the western part of the country where I'm from had a single rabid animal in the last 5 years (probably even much more). I read in an article that the last man who died of rabies, died in 1990. So in 32 years, no deaths of rabies. But my thoughts says what if it just wasn't in the news, but did happened? 

Why am I like this?"	"Hey - you don't have rabies.

1. Dog didn't break the skin. Sure, you *might* have some very tiny micro breaks, but that is not likely at all.

2. Dog didn't break the skin.  I cannot stress this enough.

3. Dog didn't break the skin - so not only do you not have an open wound for transmission, a dog with rabies probably would have broken the skin 

4. Dog does not sound like it's exhibiting signs of rabies, so even lower risk of transmission 

5. It's required to have a rabies vaccination, so we're lowering the probability of the Dog having rabies. The dog who didn't break the skin when they ""bit"" you

6. Because you guys require all dogs to have a rabies vaccination, you have a country wide very low rabies incident and transmission rates, so even if the dog wasn't vaccinated, the chances of it being exposed to rabies would be pretty low. And then it would then have to break the skin to transmit to you.

I get the fear - I had a bat in my apartment overnight and didn't realize it until it swooped at me the next morning. Definitely had and still kinda have some rabies fears. But it's extremely, extremely unlikely. So unlikely you do not need to worry about it."	1	0	0	0.018021149560809135	0.015511929988861084

Why am I like this?"	"You don’t have rabies, they didn’t break the skin. How long ago did they bite you? Rabies runs it’s course very fast (2-10 days) so you would be VERY sick if you in fact did have rabies and it has been long enough for you to “feel” like you have it. Also, since it runs it’s course so fast, the dog would absolutely not be okay if they had it. It causes paralysis and a bunch of other symptoms— the dog would be at the door of death, not just excited about their toy. 

Also, the wound would be massively infected if you had gotten rabies from one of the small abrasions on your hand, so you would definitely notice. You shouldn’t worry about it, you do not have rabies,"	0	0	2	0.9970249533653259	0.16010379791259766

Why am I like this?"	This is the voice of reason I've needed! I know I sound stupid and overly paranoid. The chance of getting rabies from a random dog (a pet of someone who most likely would be the first to recognize if the dog is sick) who didn't really bit me (even though I have numerous eczema wounds on my hands) in a country that almost fully eliminated rabies (that small number of cases that appear every few years are in the opposite side of the country) and did not have any infected human cases since 1990, basically non existent. If I don't have real problems in life I create one for myself. I can't really get bored lol. I have no idea what would happen to me if I were you in your case. You're tough! Thanks for the help! It really made me feel better! :)	0	2	0	0.0016680140979588032	0.023461103439331055
"Hi.
I'm completelly freaking out over what happened to me today. I think it's very bad. My hearth is racing and all that. Well, what happened:
I've downloaded some pornographic pictures from a website I found on the net. It was a pretty big batch and I liked the look of it from the previews. Everything seemed alright, honestly. I was downloading the bundles and as my disc space was running out, I decided to store it for myself on a Google drive, so I can delete it from PC to clear up the space for the incomming files.
So I was doing that, not paying much of an attention to what exactly I'm uploading to the Google drive. And then, suddently, I got a message from Google that my account have been terminated becouse some child pornography have been detected on my Google drive.
I naturally couldn't believe it, but I ceased the downloading, and taken a closer look at the content. And, surely, most of the stuff was completely legal, but there indeed was some very, VERY weird stuff there. I deleted all of it right away. And now I'm shaking to the point I can barely write this...
I'm totally F'ed, right? Btw, I live in Czech Republic, Europe."	"**Don't panic.** Most of the time, police won't knock on your door if you accidentally have some child porn on your computer. If you don't intentionally do it, you will be fine. However, you should have checked it before downloading and scanned it once it had done the download process. I think it's hard for you to recover your Google account as the violation falls on your responsibility to be clear about what you are uploading.  
That's my view of your situation.  
Best regards,"	1	0	0	0.01929355598986149	0.004155099391937256

I (23F) am lost and I don’t know what to do anymore. It all started in high school, long story short I stopped studying and barely passed my classes, in a miracle I got into a good university with a good 5 year program (thanks to the system of the country I live in). The first semester it was going okay til it wasn’t, I was failing everything, fast forward to the second and I was failing everything again, I just wasn’t studying, going to lectures wasn’t helping, all i did was my lab work and assignment but failed every exam. Sure I’m not really interested in what I'm studying but that’s absolutely not as important as me failing my classes. In the fourth semester I got into academic probation, I still couldn’t study enough to get through it so I got into a second probation, basically a whole year of being out of school. By some miracle I passed the class I needed to get in school again and went on to the fifth semester, I passed nothing in that one except the assignments. Got into probation a 3rd time (this semester) and just now found out I will be in probation this next semester too. So basically as a 5 year program, all my friends are graduating this year while I'm two years behind and will be graduating in the next 3 years. And I haven’t passed any exam in the last two years so I have 10 unfinished courses. I don’t know what’s wrong with me, if I'm lazy, if I don’t care. I thought it could be adhd and I went to a psychologist but they told me they couldn’t test me since they prioritise minors and my issue didn't seem to be urgent since I've gotten into university and the wait list is at least 6 years and if I wanted to get tested NOW I'd have to go the private route and pay around 3k dollars which i can't do right now. 

My parents ( I live with them cause we’re asian etc) are both doctors so imagine the expectations they both have on me. I haven’t told them everything though. They know about my first probation but not the second, they know about the third current one but not this upcoming one this next semester. And they don’t know about the failed 10 courses either. I wanted to hide it from them because I believed I could pass everything quietly and they’d never have to know but I dug a hole so deep for myself. I'll have to tell them about the next semester though because I can’t hide it in any way and I don’t know how I'm going to do it. They’re already disappointed that I'm behind and they’ll be so mad now. My mom doesn’t work because of mental health issues but my dad is in his late 60s and works. I live with them and he is basically providing for all of us, they all keep reminding me to graduate quick so I can easily stand on my feet, and maybe that we can move to a country where it's easier for them to work and make better than here because they're here with me just for my education. I feel so bad for my dad who goes to work everyday for us while I’ve been doing nothing just sitting on my ass for the past two years. He is getting old and I want to make things easier for them but I just can’t seem to study for the life of me. I wish I could tell them everything and then ask for help but I know I can’t because they’ll never forgive me, they’re nice to me after being mad about the probations and they still get me gifts and buy me stuff while I have this huge secret that I'm failing everything. If they find out they won’t trust me again.

I really don’t know what to do I wanna pass my classes and start new so bad but I keep telling myself that things will be different this time while nothing is ever changing. Maybe you’re gonna tell me I'm burnt out but no way, I’ve had 2 years of doing nothing but sitting at home sleeping, I don’t remember the last time I’ve studied consistently, maybe 10 years ago. I don’t know what I'm even expecting from here just a listening ear I guess. I want to get better, my brain has ideas as to how to but my body just won't listen to me."

I slightly disagree, so many of my classmates aren't interested in all this either, they're tired and burnt out and all of them wanna drop out and yet, they know it's bullshit and that they have to keep going and they pass all their courses.

Sometime helping other people in need is a great starting point. Going to a gym or for me, running as excellent.

I also believe this situation, once you get past it, will equip others who will struggle just as you have.

Life is short but long. This stage is just but one chapter in your book. It will pass and you will be much stronger and wiser. You got this!"	1	2	0	0.0016616691136732697	0.001429915428161621
"Most problems started in 2020. In March, the start of covid. I was sick (and i don't know the reason why) and my dad came, from the most southern province of the country back to discuss with me. He announced that the divorce i did not know about was gonna happen, and kinda after that day he just left to my step family. That's part one: the divorce. 
After a few months when we were all emotionally unstable i went to visit to their house and also sleep there. From 2020-2021 most of those events happened. There are a few key moments. There were moments where my step brother (2 then) and step sister (7), were pretty annoying. I hate them both. At some point in 2021 there was conflict and i got so mad i pointed a knife towards my step mother that i still hate. Since then was i not allowed to there anymore. That's the divorce part. 

Now for the school and crush part. So since 2020 I've had a crush on someone (gender unconfirmed) and we were friends, lifelong. Together with my childhood friend, we were the 3 Musketeers. But my crush began to hate on my friend, causing me to have to choose for 1. I chose my crush, not to realize she was already internet dating with people scattered across the world. So i changed my mind and chose my friend. After this change my crush began being extremely toxic and is now my enemy, also causing some bad traumas. 

The basic school: i was never a group's child. I'm not bullied, neither accepted. I didn't really have much friends, except 2 till now (IRL). Most others betrayed me. 

My mom: i live alone with my mom, and some conflicts made. Maybe this is just puberty, or Asian parenting. But i don't quite believe she really does love love me. 

The interneg saga: since fall 2022, I've been playing a lot of hypixel. I met someone (a girl) and she invited me to her SMP. I met a lot of friends and we had fun. Around september the SMP kinda died and nobody really joined anymore. I downloaded discord again, and begon chat with 2 of friends. The girl was really unactive on both discord and minecraft (she's only active at breaks apparently). The other friend was a 16 year old Austrian boy. He was the first internet friend. We were great friends. After that success, i began gaining more internet friends. I decided to recall my old youtube series SMP, and invited him, along with 3 other friends. After that success i opened a discord server for the friends too. More friends were coming. When at a rare moment, i realized i had feelings for the girl that invited me to the SMP (as she really knew me and accepted me, even helping me with my murder habit). Sadly she's still only online around school breaks. At some point at January, one of my internet friends invited a guy named Oz. He played on my creative server along with other friends. At one point he decided to be bad and destroy my steakhouse in game (almost). I banned him from both servers. Others disagreed, so a month later he re-appears. He then tried to grief. So he was banned again. Then a weird glitch happened to the server, and for no reason he was re-invited. A hacker was controlling him (unsure, great chance he lied). We ""solved"" the hacker, but then some conflict came. I said not so nice things to him, as nuking his country or that the hacker may come back to hack him and his family. The Austrian boy, was really scared out by this and left in neutrality. He thought i was going insane so unfriended me. He said i needed mental health help. 

What should i do. I don't think i have a bad life, but that's because i compare it to African starving children. Am i going through depression, puberty or is this normal?"	Unfortunately that's very normal, life is chaotic and a lot of confusing, frustrating things happen. you're twelve, so it's absolutely normal and ok when you don't know how to deal with all these things yet, but you will find out and become better and better at it. you will learn how to deal with bad emotions, you will learn to understand the feelings of others and how you impact them, you will learn how to form lasting friendships and relationships. Give it time and never forget you can influence your life and how you react to things to a certain degree - and it can make all the difference!	1	0	0	0.0012538274750113487	0.0007882118225097656

When unpleasant things happen, I feel numb, anxious and/or repulsed by my partner whom I love and treasure very much, and have a very strong healthy relationship with. I cannot find anything about this phenomenon. Any help would be very much appreciated<3


I [25F] love my partner[23F] to death, they are the light of my life, my sunshine and guiding moonlight, my best friend, my everything, and the best possible thing I could’ve ever asked for or dreamt of. We are in a very happy, stable, healthy relationship. 

Before we get into the problem, there are a couple factors to take note of.
Firstly, we are LDR(I live in Singapore and they live in the USA, California), we met online near the end of 2021 and we met up in person for the very first time last year in November and it was absolutely wonderful, the happiest 2 weeks of my life.
Secondly, I live in a pretty awful household. I’ve been severely emotionally abused and neglected my entire life and my family is the bane of my existence. I was also severely bullied growing up. I think I’d just sort of gone numb as a coping mechanism, at some point in my life I even experienced a couple months of depersonalisation/ derealisation during highschool. Right before I met my partner, I had just broken out of a 4 year depression period and was finally getting treated for adhd in hopes that I could get my life together. I was… extremely numb at that point, and I could almost feel my brain melting. Despite being numb, it scared me so much it’s what prompted me to see a psychiatrist. It was only last year where I’ve been able to realise the extent of my mental illness. Later on I started getting treated for anxiety and depression as well.

So! Around two months in of being with my partner, some family issues flared up and I was on the receiving end of one of my sister’s worst emotional outbursts. I didn’t think much of it, in the moment I reacted calmly. But I remember feeling extremely nauseous and anxious that night. The next day when I video called my partner, as we do, I noticed I was a little repulsed by them? Which was weird but my initial reaction was to brush it off however the feeling just kept growing stronger. They didn’t do anything different or anything, just looking at them filled me with what I can only describe as pure utter repulsion. Which is a complete utter 180 of the usual warmth and love I feel for them.
I spent the whole week bawling and inconsolable, not understanding and bewildered why I was repulsed by the love of my life. In the end I stayed at my friends place for 3 days to get away from my family and limited time with my partner to reduce the feeling of repulsion. I had very clearly communicated the situation to my partner who was extremely understanding, concerned and sympathetic but was unable to do anything, especially being the subject of my repulsion. After 2 weeks the the feeling slowly started to subside and I was able to feel my whole feelings of warmth and love for them again.

I’ve searched high and low on the internet but I cannot find anything about this phenomenon. Why is it directed at my partner, my favourite person in the world? Why not literally anyone else?🥲

Of course I knew there was always a possibility this might happen again but yet I was kinda caught off guard. A week ago my partner and I had a serious discussion after 2 weeks of them being away on a work trip and unable to call. It was over something we have discussed before and it’s something that can’t really be helped due to the distance and time difference of 16 hours, but nonetheless we both end up tearful and just… sad due to the circumstances.

Over the next few days I realised I was feeling numb and more baffling, anxious (but not repulsed) around my partner. Which has never happened before. They have always been my biggest comfort. The anxiety especially flares up when they mention things like our future visits or our hypothetical wedding and future house together. Usually I love discussing these things, and it makes me very happy knowing our future together is something we both think about. But currently they just fill me with anxiety and dread. I have since communicated all this to my partner and we have decided not to touch on those topics until further notice. They have been extremely sweet and supportive, and despite me being scared and confused I can’t feel my love for them, they have been extremely optimistic and confidant about my feelings for them. Which helps a little. At least someone knows how I really feel I suppose :’)) Since this isn’t their first rodeo they’re not scared and confused like last time, just sweet and supportive.

I don’t understand what happened, it’s not like we’ve never discussed serious before. We have very open and radical communication and honesty. So I fail to understand what triggered this bout of… whatever this is.:(

I’m panicking, I don’t know what to do. My partner is an amazing, wonderful person and aside from the inner daily inner turmoil and frustration, I also hate to put them through this. I miss them too, and I just… don’t understand why I feel this way or why this is happening. I’m scared. I don’t want to feel this way, I don’t want to lose them, I can’t help but feel they deserve someone who won’t go through this bouts of not even knowing how or why they feel a certain way. Is this normal? Am I doomed to periods like this for the rest of my life? Is this abnormal? Should I continue this relationship? If my brain self sabotaging?? Why is it targeting the best thing in my life?? Does it think it’s too good to be true?? I don’t want to hurt my partner😭😭 

If you’ve reached the end, thank you. This is certainly quite the long read😅 I appreciate you getting this far and if you have any advice or similar experiences, please enlighten me I’d be ever so grateful to learn from them.<3"	Anxious avoidant attachment style here too	0	0	0	0.9992295503616333	0.0012004375457763672
"Hey, I'm a 16-and-a-half-year old, and I've just moved to the US (California specifically) from Japan (city with about 1 million people) after living there for 2.5 years.

So, to put some background, I lived about half of my life in Hong Kong in an international school and was attending middle school until early 2021 when we suddenly had to move to Japan, where my mom is from. Dad moved to Calfiornia in late 2022. The move and subsequent stay in Japan completely destroyed me, and today I suffer from severe depression due to the experience. I basically had zero personal development and was messed up there, losing much of my contact with my friends and all, alongside failing to integrate with Japanese society. Today I feel like I'm still 14.5 years old, and am extremely scared of growing up. The moving kept getting delayed and my mom tried to make me integrate with Japan because she didn't know how long we would stay there for.

The general attitude of my parents tends to be that ""IT's only 2.5 years! When you grow up, you'll see it as a short part of your life!"". However, my feeling is that I must live my teenage years now, or I must die. I simply do not see growing up as an option at all until I've at least experienced what it's like to be a teenager. My parents' dismissal just doesn't seem to make any sense at all to me. 

We are thinking about starting me in 10th grade instead of 11th this fall due to all of these problems, but my age is a scourge on trying to experience anything as a teen anymore. I've heard the quote ""Children only have one childhood"". I feel like the same can be said for adolescence, and I just don't get the appeal of anything if I'm supposed to grow up. I suffer from a multitude of problems from that experience, and I do not understand how I'm supposed to grow up.

I literally have no idea what to do, and I just don't know how this isn't just going to go further downhill for me. 

What do you guys think?

- 28 year old adult who enjoys acting like a child frequently

As a side note, I am familiar with the instability that comes with moving around so much. And perhaps you are experiencing this as well. 

You have to start all over with making new friends and all. So, know that you are not alone in your anxieties. I can share with you what has helped me with this.

1. I have a small box of my favourite things. The things are small pieces like a dried up leaf or an acorn that I stole from the family of migratory woodpeckers atop the yellow post campsites near Big bear Lake - California!!! This is my box of familiarity. I collect a small (tiny) thing to remember happy moments by and see the changing of the country I'm in as a new adventure. The things in my box remind me that while the country and group of people might change, my adventures and curious, exploring self does not!  It is the constant!

2. The relationships I really, really like, I find ways to keep in touch.. it might be in the form of chat messages, video calls or even occasional handwritten letters and postcards to my favorite people all of whom are in different countries!

3. Wait.. you are in California!? It is my favourite place in the planet. Try to get to the outdoors if you can! Try to go asap!!!!! They make the mountains so accessible there. Try to see the redwoods and go camping!! You can see the Milky way sometimes! It's amazing!!

Also! In California, you might found some others in the same boat as you!!!! Other kids who have parents (that, due to their professional success have moved around a bunch). Try to see if you can find them! Cali usually attracts people from all over the world! I'm not saying it's perfect. Perhaps more like a Utopia /Dystopia. BUT, it absolutely is an excellent place to meet others who have experienced other cultures and even celebrate their existence. Please please try to go outdoors to the woods! I would have loved to have had that in my teens! I only got to know them in my late 20s and I feel like a little girl anytime I'm back in them!"	1	2	0	0.0012333866907283664	0.0010914802551269531
"I (18m) was sexually assaulted multiple times by my cousins in different occasions (26m and 28m) when I was 8 and they were 16 and 18. Hello everyone, I decided to tell you this story to get it off my chest. A bit of a backstory, my father is european and my mother is asian. Back in 2013 we went to my mother's country for a ""vacation"" that turned out to be an 8 year nightmare. There I met my extended family on my mother's side. Particularly my first cousin, let's call him Chris. Chris was the youngest of 2 siblings that were orphaned due to their mother being killed by their father and running away.

One day, he was babysitting me while my mum went to the casino to gamble. My other siblings went to my other cousin's house (not part of the story) to play with them. So I was left with him alone. I was playing with my tablet when he called me and told me to go to the bedroom because he is bored and wants to play a game. So as a naive 8 year old boy, I obliged.

He tells me to lay beside him so he can show me how to play this game. He taught me how to jerk off. A few moments later, he tells me to do the same for him. I said okay and did the same to him. 

One night, while we were sound asleep. He was laying beside me while my other siblings were in another bed, he started to sexually assault me. I woke up to a sharp pain, and him going full on me. I kept silent, thinking that he wanted to play at this late at night. This went on for a good 30 minutes where he finished and went back to sleep. This happened multiple times. 

I later discovered sex and realised that he was doing it to me. I questioned myself if I was gay and I was in denial, telling myself that I like women and I'm not gay. (I was bullied pretty early on for acting a bit feminine)

Now going to the other cousin. Let's call him Joe. He is my 2nd cousin and lived with my aunt while he was studying.

One day we went there for 3 days to visit them and so we met there. We played with my other cousins all day and when night fell and we went to sleep, I slept beside Joe.

I woke up to him feeling my butt while he takes my hand and puts it in his gentleman's area. I was afraid because he looked scary when we first met and so I remained silent and obliged at every motion he makes, he pushes me down, I go down. That went on the 2 nights that we were there. 

I was pretty traumatised and in denial because I am not gay, I like women. And so I kept it a secret.

3 years ago I left that one hell of a country to return back to the home country of my father. I was put on therapy but I didn't mention that I was sexually assaulted by Chris and Joe. And so I still bear the trauma right now.

I don't want to reveal it to my parents since they separated 6 years ago. Because I am alright at the moment. A few nights ago though, I accidentally overshared it with a friend and I kind off regret it but I couldn't help it. 

I feel a big weight off my chest has been relieved and I feel much better now. Thank you for reading."	you can get through this buddy. I believe in you	1	0	0	0.0017861759988591075	0.0012264847755432129

"I (28F) finally told my mom about my cousin (22M at the time) trying/starting to molest me in my sleep when I was 14. I had been raped the year before and was still dealing with that trauma, so I just pushed it to the back of my head. I kept my distance and never said a word to anyone. 
I was so tired of everyone in my family giving my shit for cutting him out of my life and refusing to attend his wife's baby shower last month. I had to get it out.  It was rough. I learned that he had been kicked out of his parents' house for trying to molest a 12-year-old girl the year before he tried it with me. It's a pattern, and people need to know who he really is.  
I suspect that your cousins may be the same. 
Healing from sexual trauma is hard, but having a support system makes it easier. If you don't feel comfortable telling your parents, you should find someone else you can talk to about it.  You've got this, and you're not alone.  💜"	0	2	0	0.010459106415510178	0.041876256465911865

Back in 2013 we went to my mother's country for a ""vacation"" that turned out to be an 8 year nightmare. There I met my extended family on my mother's side. Particularly my first cousin, let's call him Chris. Chris was the youngest of 2 siblings that were orphaned due to their mother being killed by their father and running away.

One day, he was babysitting me while my mum went to the casino to gamble. My other siblings went to my other cousin's house (not part of the story) to play with them. So I was left with him alone. I was playing with my tablet when he called me and told me to go to the bedroom because he is bored and wants to play a game. So as a naive 8 year old boy, I obliged.

He tells me to lay beside him so he can show me how to play this game. He taught me how to jerk off. A few moments later, he tells me to do the same for him. I said okay and did the same to him. 

One night, while we were sound asleep. He was laying beside me while my other siblings were in another bed, he started to sexually assault me. I woke up to a sharp pain, and him going full on me. I kept silent, thinking that he wanted to play at this late at night. This went on for a good 30 minutes where he finished and went back to sleep. This happened multiple times. 

I later discovered sex and realised that he was doing it to me. I questioned myself if I was gay and I was in denial, telling myself that I like women and I'm not gay. (I was bullied pretty early on for acting a bit feminine)

Now going to the other cousin. Let's call him Joe. He is my 2nd cousin and lived with my aunt while he was studying.

One day we went there for 3 days to visit them and so we met there. We played with my other cousins all day and when night fell and we went to sleep, I slept beside Joe.

I woke up to him feeling my butt while he takes my hand and puts it in his gentleman's area. I was afraid because he looked scary when we first met and so I remained silent and obliged at every motion he makes, he pushes me down, I go down. That went on the 2 nights that we were there. 

I was pretty traumatised and in denial because I am not gay, I like women. And so I kept it a secret.

3 years ago I left that one hell of a country to return back to the home country of my father. I was put on therapy but I didn't mention that I was sexually assaulted by Chris and Joe. And so I still bear the trauma right now.

I don't want to reveal it to my parents since they separated 6 years ago. Because I am alright at the moment. A few nights ago though, I accidentally overshared it with a friend and I kind off regret it but I couldn't help it. 

I feel a big weight off my chest has been relieved and I feel much better now. Thank you for reading."	I’m so sorry. I’m not in any position to offer a solution but I just want to send you a virtual hug and hope hope so much that you will find the tools to get past this. Again, I’m so sorry this happened. Hugs dear one.	2	0	0	0.5583978891372681	0.0008829236030578613

"Trigger warning, close call (accident). You may skip.

Had a lot of bad thoughts these past few weeks, tough day at work, no breaks sa sermon kahit pag uwi.

I was riding my bike kanina sa Coastal, way above speed limit kasi its ""throttle therapy"".

I know its toxic, pea-brain strat kesa to talk it out. Hindi lang ako comfortable na magkwento ulit. It felt good, until it didn't.

Cruising at 106, tulala without knowing na may bump sa right side ng kalsada if you are riding southbound and nakalagpas na ng toll.

Nagulat buong katawang lupa ko, my handlebar wobbled. I thought I'm a goner. Tried to control it, my left hand lost its grip and I throttled it while leaning backwards para hindi lumala yung wobbling.

Eventually I gained control ulit before going up the ramp papuntang Las Piñas-Bacoor and pulled over shortly. I was shaking pagbaba ng bike, took me 2 hours bago ako umalis ng rest area na yon.

Umuwi ako ng bahay ng maayos, hindi lumagpas ng 30 takbo ko after what happened kahit 4 AM at walang katao-tao sa kalsada.

To kuya Lorenzo who checked up on me, thank you. Hindi ko man nakuha number mo, sobrang pasasalamat kong tumigil ka para kausapin ako at kamustahin.

"I'm kinda scared/anxious about taking the exam on Sunday. I've known friends who barely reviewed and passed the exam, but I don't think I'm like them at all.

I haven't reviewed the past few weeks because of work, and now I'm scared that I don't have time to adequately study.

Kabado lang ako na baka may implication na I'm really not as smart as I think I am, and deep down bobo talaga ako. Ang bobo ko pa naman sa Math and Filipino. I also peeked a bit sa reviewer and Im starring to think na pati sa English magdududa na rin ako.

This is really bothering me because I'm planning to go to law school next year, and if I couldn't handle the CSE, pano pa kaya kung bar exam na?

anw, skl."	"It really depends on the exam.  If you do not have a job yet and you're taking the exam to get on the list of potential candidates then if you fail, you will just be at the very bottom of the list and you're unlikely to get notifications that a job opening is available to apply.  So there isn't any risk beyond losing out on the test fee.

If you have a job and you need to pass the test to keep the job, then you gotta find out the passing score and just score that or higher to keep your job.  This is usually called a provisional position, which means you have the job and keep it if you pass the exam.  Some jobs are nice and will let you keep the job and test again the next time the exam rolls around, but some employers will boot you right out.  For example, I have a job, I had to take a civil service exam, the passing grade is 70. I only have to score 70+ to keep my job, it doesn't matter if there are people who scored more than me, I already have the job, its cheaper to keep me because I already have the training.

If its a basic entry level exam you really have nothing to worry about, its mostly reading comprehension, management questions, team building question, ethics morals, and some basic job related questions.  Usually designed to allow even the average joe to take and potentially pass.

If its a promotional exam it will be more in depth and this is the one you need to study.

Just know even if you score a 100 there's no guarantee you get a job, because most places like to hire internally before they refer to the list and contacting people and letting them know an opening is available and they are free to apply.  


My tip for you is to see if there is a book related to this test in the library. It will not have the exact questions and will likely have VERY out of date info and questions from past exams, but it will give you a general idea of the layout and the sort of language the test will provide.  


Take your time when taking the exam, bring extra pencils, bring a drink and quiet snack,  take breaks while doing the exam."	0	0	0	0.002577063860371709	0.002413630485534668
"
I was a hopeful 14-year-old when I immigrated from the Philippines to the United States. I wanted to achieve a lot of Pinoy kids’ dream of attending a fancy college in the US and being their lola’s (grammy) favorite apo (grandchild).

But I have finally decided that tonight, I will sit down and talk to my parents to undo that dream.

I found out that I couldn’t afford to go to college when I received my first acceptance letter from Fordham, my excitement was quickly replaced with fear upon realizing that they were asking me for $48,000 per year. 

While I was applying, my parents made me think that as long as I get excellent grades and qualify for scholarships, my schooling will be taken care of. As much as I wanted to be mad at them, they’re both immigrants and doesn’t know any better than me. I also found out that they do not have “college funds” saved up and that’s when I realized that I will have to take out loans to afford college.

I did my research and was utterly mortified when I found out that some people end up paying three times the amount they originally borrowed because of interest and some even pass their debts to their spouses. It broke my heart but I decided that it wasn’t worth it. I talked to my parents and told them that I wanted to go back home instead. I figured, since I’m going to have to opt to go to my cheapest option and not a school that I necessarily want to attend, might as well just go to the Philippines where in I can attend top universities for much, much cheaper.

My parents, of course, refused. They called me names, told me that I am being an entitled brat, and that I’m wasting opportunities that others would kill for. I was disheartened, I became very depressed. I continued to beg them to change their minds but it did not come to fruition. 

I ended up attending a $24,000 a year out-of-state public university.

During my freshman year, I spiraled into severe depression. I simply couldn’t handle the burden of having that much debt tied to my name. 

I am a person who genuinely enjoys learning but my student loans took away that joy. Every time I fail to understand a lesson, I experience an immense amount of anxiety. A simple quiz, a home work, an exam—they were all matters of life and death to me. I couldn’t let myself fail because if I do, I’ll lose my scholarship and I will have to take out more loans than I already have. I wanted to die. Every single minute of my life. All I thought of was ending my life.

I tried seeing a counselor but due to language and cultural barriers, it really didn’t help.

Everything became even worse first semester of my sophomore year when I found out that I lost my scholarship (contracted Covid, couldn’t take finals, two classes were INC and weren’t counted in my final credits taken therefore I don’t have enough credits to satisfy my scholarship requirements).

My depression became even worse. I would stand beside the busy highway for hours on end hoping I’ll have the courage to jump in front of a moving car. But I just couldn’t do it. Every time I wanted to die, the thought of my sister not being able to go to college because I passed on my loans to my parents hunts me. I couldn’t even kill myself even if I wanted to.

Does it even make sense for a 20-year-old to have almost 85,000 USD worth of debt? 

I need help. I tried seeing a psychiatrist but ironically, it made me even more depressed because it costed my parents $120 per session.

I went to the Philippines for several weeks this summer and it broke my heart seeing how happy my friends are, and how that could have been my life too.

It’s been looming in my mind since I came back from vacation and I keep thinking if I’m really ready to leave the comfort US offers me and trade it for the wildly humid and scorching hot weather in Manila.

I came to the conclusion that the pollution, traffic, and humidity, I can get used to again. It’s nowhere near as bad as the demons haunting me inside my air conditioned dorm room.

So, tonight, I’m finally doing it. I’m putting my foot down and I am telling my parents that I am going back home."	You should look into a trade, you can make a very comfortable living with zero student debt	0	0	0	0.0024890301283448935	0.0006753206253051758

I'll cut to the chase because I really need some guidance here on how to manage my girlfriend's condition.
  
These diagnosis has been confirmed by a psychiatrist here in Sarawak, Malaysia. 
  

  

  
She has : 
  

  
1. Depression: She would randomly fall into depression anytime she feels alone (most frequent reason and it has been observed to be true) therefore to remedy this, she goes out every single day to shop for clothes , eat at cafes, and frequent a bar that my aunt's best friend owns (to mostly listen to music, play pool, karaoke)
  

  

  
2. Schizophrenia (Hear's voices if surrounding is too quiet, telling her she's not good enough/should harm herself for being useless. To drown these voices out, she constantly listens to music on high volume).
  

  
3. Anxiety: She gets super anxious if there is a stampede level amount of people in locations such as ballrooms etc so there is a limit to how much she can tolerate .
  

  
The deadly combo: Depression and Schizophrenia,  Everytime she feels alone , she would freeze up and experience both of these at the same time, it would start with an uncontrollable onset of depression followed by voices in her head telling her to harm herself / not good enough / no point in staying alive.  To DROWN these voices she self harms . She would cut lines on her wrist with a pen knife until she feels ""calmer"" . According to her, seeing blood on her wrists makes her calm , it stops the voices (she claims the voices would be overpoweringly annoying and she thinks the only way to drown them out would be to cut herself which she claims bring relief.
  

  

  
I'm at a stage where I'm constantly spending time with her nearly everyday skipping important errands which is unsustainable and disuptive to my life as well because I can't trust her to be alone. She seems to also be afraid of being alone too, but when she is , she would try to control symptoms with loud music to drown voices and if necessary she would take an emergency prescription called ""CLONazepam"" to supress her emotions etc and fall asleep. 
  

  
""Escitalopram"" is another prescription for her depression and anxiety. As well as another one to treat schizophrenia (forgot the name).
  

  
She also seems to be suffering from chronic insomnia where she would be able to stay up to 48 hours if she's not taking her depression prescription (which also helps her sleep)
  

  
The main problem I need help with is to find a way to help her manage her urges to self harm , lately it seems to be amplifying. Most of the time she takes her prescriptions and she would be fine, but there are days when she would feel a severe instant onset of depression+schizophrenia and the medication would be too late to stop her from the thought of self harming. A good example was yesterday when she was with me in my room and I fell asleep before her since she left her medication that helps with sleep at her home, she woke me up and told me she is experiencing extreme depression and she felt like self harming herself and she cried. I reassured her that I won't leave her side and would be there constantly to keep her from her urges, prior to waking me up , she took the emergency prescription ""CLONazepam"" which eventually kicked in and made her drowsy and she eventually fell asleep. Had I not been there she told me she would have 100% tried to cut herself. She told me the voices in her head was so annoying that she needed to cut herself to feel relief. 
  

  
So now you can see why this is a problem. Eventually I will find a job and I wouldnt be able to be present as often anymore. I need to find ways to help her manage the symptoms better and ultimately try to cure her onset schizophrenia because that seems to be the most debilitating part of her condition . It disrupts her life completely and she isnt able to work because of it. 
  

  
Despite all the consultations with psychiatrists (whom seem to be absoultely unexperienced and unprofessional) here in sarawak malaysia ,  she still feels these things. The only thing that works is her medication however the therapy part of her treatment doesnt seem to be effective. Previously during her first attempt to get professional help,  they would keep her in the hospital and restrain her for a few days because of the self harming.She told me the psychiatrists and staff were mostly rude to her and treated her like she was a crazy person. In therapys sessions , they would literally tell her not to  ""overthink about things"" as an advice which stunned me. She also was taught steps to help manage symptoms from a binder which she could not bring home so she would have to jot it down on her phone or something.
  

  

  
(Extra background info)
  
1. I onced rushed to her house with a first aid kit and just saw her sitting there non chalantly with her wrists filled with dried up blood from the cuts and acts like it's normal and she would like laugh when I took it seriously. She would tell me ""relax it's normal , everytime i cut my wrists i dont feel anything,it's just small cuts, I'm not gonna die or anything""
  

  
2. We've only gotten together with her for 2 months , and i decided to be with her knowing her symptoms because I fell in love and I wanted to help her to get better but this seems to be taking a toll on me too as she would go out every single day and expects me to be there with her (not forced however but I would force myself to be there to accompany her to keep her safe as she only has 2 friends currently (whom are working and arent always available)
  

  
3. She was raped by her own brother at 14 , her family members did not believe her claims. Now is staying with parents still but rapist brother is in another city. I told her to make a report but she didnt want to risk being disowned by her parents. She's currently 18, I'm 23. 
  

  
4. She also has a history of abusive exes (verbal abuse) 
  

  
5. She has a history of taking recreational drugs such as ecstacy and ketamine ( she stopped at the moment ) , so we're chinese and there are lots of chinese connections here in our hometown that deals drugs mostly at Karaoke Centers. Currently she stopped already but she still keeps in contact with those people. I adviced her to cut ties with these people but she doesnt want to. She told me she isnt confident that she cant completely stop it in the future if i ever am not around. 
  

  
6. Her family is aware of her condition but doesn't understand it therefore is often dismissive of her condition and considers it a burden and a waste of their time. (This is the most hearbreaking part)
  

  

  
To anyone who's gone through the same thing and recovered or psychologists on this platform. I'm in desperate need of help to help my girl manage her symptoms. I'm really afraid of losing her . She has the kindest soul but she hides her pain constantly and she doesnt want to open up to others. But she has me now and I constantly remind her that she can talk to me about anything but it's still something she is working on . She constantly hides her pain and acts like everything is okay , makes jokes constantly but when she's alone that all changes. Obviously hiding it all in has been something she's been doing for years and it's definitely not healthy in the long run and it comes back with a vengeance anyways whenever she's in a state of loneliness and helplessness. 
  

  
I appreciate you guys in advance for any advice that you can give her . She doesn't know how else to seek help so I'm going to seek help for her. Money is also a constraint so I cant bring her to a more qualified/experienced  therapist/psychologist in another city yet but maybe in the future. Saving up the money as we speak."	Incorrect. It isn't your place to help her. She has to want to seek help for herself. She needs your support and compassion. Thinking that you can help her without her making the steps to help herself, you'll be stuck in a loop, and resent each other	1	0	0	0.01880224421620369	0.004804432392120361

Also I am not good looking or pretty neither have a light skin tone which fits the society's preference. 
I don't have a love life too. Actually I am scared to approach to anyone with the looks I have. 
The things got worst when my mom also start picking on me or you can say bullying me for having a dark skin tone or not for being pretty. It's one of the big reason why i stop posting myself on socials. 
She also says i lost the job because she prayed. 
Everything is so messes up in my life. I don't eat properly anymore all I do is watching series online. Which you call you a escape for me. 
Can anyone help me with my situation? I want to recover from all this. Please..

When they are unwell or have life problems, instead of being considerate towards their family, they play up the victim card and bask in the enjoyment of being cared for. It puts a lot of emotional strain on the carer.

A lot of Asian kids grew up never being allowed to be kids. From a young age we are expected to shoulder our parents' burdens and be good and avoid giving them more problems. That includes a lot of normal kids behaviours, wants and needs etc - we were not allowed to have them because they created a burden on our poor fragile parents. This kind of upbringing made us feel like our lives are not our own, we are not the masters of our fate, and we have to live for our families, otherwise we are being too ""selfish"" and ""inconsiderate"".

Honestly a lot of that is bullshit. We can do a lot for our parents out of the goodness of our hearts, but ultimately we can't live their lives for them or suffer on their behalf. We are still allowed to be happy and pursue our own lives even if they are unwell. And many of them were unwell even before we were born, it's not our fault, although they tried to convince us that it was."	0	2	0	0.9880844950675964	0.6455976366996765

"How does one cope with crisis after crisis?

I’m tired. So tired that I seem strangely calm. 

I hate my life. Because it’s nothing but pain and suffering. I’m an average person who has been tested way beyond my limits, with no reprieve, no breaks, no appreciation. 

In the last decade I’ve realized, slowly, that my life is not mine at all. None of my talents, interests, aspirations, hopes, actually matter. I’m merely place on earth to deal with my family. And despite all my efforts, life places me exactly where I should be - the middle-aged spinster daughter of a Chinese family. 

I’m freaked out right now because my mother is suddenly unwell. Whilst merely looking at symptoms it’s hard to say what is wrong - she said she felt an unsettled tummy and felt bloated.

Call it selfish if you will, but it's no life if you're not able to do what *you* want, at least some of the time. I don't believe we're here simply to care for others. We all have our own needs.	1	0	0	0.00415043206885457	0.004776895046234131

"Hi,  
I am new on Reddit (and to this sub). I am 26 (fast approaching 27) but hope that's not an issue. I liked the topics discussed in this sub and thought about sharing something I felt recently. 

So, I used to really like a girl in my college days. She liked me as well. But we both knew it'll never work because there were so many hurdles between us (I don't want to get into details, but coming from India for marriage caste, religion, etc. are very important stuff, especially for older people, and creates many problems - yeah it sucks!). Anyway, for this reason, we always kept a distance. We were good friends, she called me for everything, whatever help she ever needed I was the first person she ever called. Even when we were never in any kind of relationship, she'll still get jealous when I get too close to some other girls. But not in a weird possessive ay, but I'd say in a cute way. Anyway, college life ended just like that, we did keep in touch. Random messages & calls from time to time. After a few years, she got married (Arranged marriage, It's India!). She invited me to it. I got to talk to the groom and I liked him. I know it's a bit hard to get a grasp about someone with a few minutes of conversation but still, I felt they're a good match.   
After her marriage, our contact reduced so much. We rarely talked. But that was okay. I was over her and she wasn't on my mind all the time like she used to be and I moved on. But a few days ago, on their marriage anniversary, she posted her wedding pics and looking at that I felt all the feelings I had came back to me at once.  


I wonder how different my life would have been if we were of the same religion. (Please don't judge us here because it's really hard in some communities to marry someone of a different religion. It literally destroys families.)  


 I was wondering whether anyone here ever looked back in their life & felt something like this.  


Just sharing one of my favorite poems which kinda explains my feeling.

Hanging out with her will also give both of you chances to develope even stronger feelings.

Also dont let her be the only thing on your mind (big mistake I made) you might think that its okay because you love her, but dont do that. Spend time with your friends, do well in school and most importantly make her see that you have your s**t together. Balance is key dont go for too much academics and dont go for too much lovelife. You have your own separate life, make her an inspiration, a goal to work towards of sorts. Sooner than later she will see that you are responsible and that you also have time for her.	0	0	0	0.0013573671458289027	0.002964496612548828

"Hey Reddit,

I'm (28F) an American living in Europe I won't say where for anonymity. I met my husband (30M) during the pandemic and when restrictions were lifted I made the journey to meet him. We were smitten, and I moved over and we now have a child. My mother (55F) tries to come over several times a year to come see me and our little one. She usually stays about a Month. Which is great when it comes to quality time with her grandchild, but our relationship is quite tumultuous.

I grew up in a very authoritarian single parent household. My mother is misogynistic, has never been financially stable, and doesn't align in the same political opinions of either of her children. Growing up she forced us to go to a very toxic ""Church"" who labeled me a ""Bad seed"". She even at one point threatened to kick me out over not wanting to attend once I turned 18. I could go on and on about that Church, but that's another story. She was also very harsh with her punishments. Including taking our doors for several months when I was a teen, my door knob so I wouldn't lock my doors, and grounded me from going outside or seeing my friends besides at school for 6 months. She is very impulsive as well, often changed jobs, would constantly have us move houses or go back to live with our grandparents. Which honestly was our saving grace for alot of my childhood. And she is a very argumentative and basically always wants to talk about conservative politics even knowing I've asked her to try not to bring up these topics as it is harming our relationship. She is a very loving mother and I know she does love and wants the best for me. I'm also aware I need therapy.

The problem I'm having is she told me recently she was going to work on her career (which I will also not divulge) towards moving here for work. She wants to live closer and maybe even eventually live with us. Our relationship is very complicated, but I love her and want her to be happy. I just would rather have our relationship still be at a distance. I know I can't control her actions, but how do I tell her I'd rather her not try to come and live with my family. My husband would also not like this. 

So Reddit what do you think?

"Tell her immediately that while you appreciate the idea, she will never be able to live with you and that even if she lives in the same city that your lives won’t revolve around each other, that won’t change.

After that she can feel however she wants, it’s not your concern, at least she will be making choices based on reality and she won’t be able to say she didn’t know."	1	0	0	0.9976018071174622	0.014305293560028076

The problem I'm having is she told me recently she was going to work on her career (which I will also not divulge) towards moving here for work. She wants to live closer and maybe even eventually live with us. Our relationship is very complicated, but I love her and want her to be happy. I just would rather have our relationship still be at a distance. I know I can't control her actions, but how do I tell her I'd rather her not try to come and live with my family. My husband would also not like this.

"Hey Reddit,

I'm (28F) an American living in Europe I won't say where for anonymity. I met my husband (30M) during the pandemic and when restrictions were lifted I made the journey to meet him. We were smitten, and I moved over and we now have a child. My mother (55F) tries to come over several times a year to come see me and our little one. She usually stays about a Month. Which is great when it comes to quality time with her grandchild, but our relationship is quite tumultuous.

I grew up in a very authoritarian single parent household. My mother is misogynistic, has never been financially stable, and doesn't align in the same political opinions of either of her children. Growing up she forced us to go to a very toxic ""Church"" who labeled me a ""Bad seed"". She even at one point threatened to kick me out over not wanting to attend once I turned 18. I could go on and on about that Church, but that's another story. She was also very harsh with her punishments. Including taking our doors for several months when I was a teen, my door knob so I wouldn't lock my doors, and grounded me from going outside or seeing my friends besides at school for 6 months. She is very impulsive as well, often changed jobs, would constantly have us move houses or go back to live with our grandparents. Which honestly was our saving grace for alot of my childhood.

"A few weeks ago, I (28M) found out that I have an older half sister (35F) through 23andMe. Let's call her Emily. We share the same father. She reached out to me and I've gotten to know Emily a bit.

Emily seems like a lovely person and I feel blessed to have discovered that I now have an older sister. She's married and has two young kids. I haven't met her husband or her kids yet, though she wants to introduce me to them soon.

Through talking with Emily, I've since learned that my father had a one night stand back when he was a grad student in university, and that her bio-mom later put her up for adoption. My father does not know that Emily exists. Emily seems to have had a happy life and grew up on the other side of the country. While I grew up in California, she grew up on the East Coast. I now live in the East Coast and I've even met Emily in person for coffee once and we share many of the same physical features (same eyes, same nose, tall height, etc.).

Anyway, here's why I'm on Reddit and asking for help. Emily wants to get to know the rest of the family and meet them. As far as I know, I'm the only one in my immediate family who used 23andMe, and Emily hasn't met anyone from my family yet. I've told Emily a bit about my father (61M) and sister (25F) but haven't really mentioned much. Emily wants to meet our father and sister. 

I haven't told my family about Emily yet. The truth is, my father was extremely abusive growing up and I'm basically in limited contact with him with the occasional text every few months. I haven't seen him in years. I talk to my mother on the phone occasionally. 

How do I proceed from here? How do I go about explaining to the rest of my family the existence of my older half-sister? I feel like doing so would cause a huge rift between my parents. I'm not sure how my other relatives would even react to this. And, while I'm 100% Asian-American, Emily is half-Asian and half-white and super white-passing. I'm not sure how my parents and other family members would react to this. Several of them are pretty racist.

I'm not sure how Emily will react to meeting my father. My father was abusive and is toxic and sexist. I feel like she'll be disappointed when meeting him. She's told me that she's always wanted to know a bit about her father and get to know her Asian side of herself. 

I've thought about maybe telling my sister first and asking her what she thinks and going from there, and starting with introducing my sister to Emily first.

Any advice on how I should proceed from here? How do I bring this up to my family? How do I introduce them?

TL;DR: I discovered I have an older half-sister. We share the same father. She wants to meet the rest of the family. Neither knows the other exists.

"Hi people, 

I am from India, my sister and brother-in-law shifted to England last year in July. Brother-in-Law has a history of physical abusing my sister in India.

During the last 16 years of my parents’ marriage, my dad has been paranoid and jealous of my mom even though she’s the breadwinner and he barely works. Yesterday was the last straw when my mom was working at the nail salon and my dad accused my mom of cheating, saying that “the nail salon closed a long time ago”. To which my mom called her coworkers and showed camera footages for proof, but he refused to look or listen. Last night, he terrorized my mom and gave us until Sunday to move out of the house that my mom paid for. What could I do in this situation? Who can I report this to and what evidences would I need?	I suggest calling the nearest domestic violence shelter or resource in your area. They can walk you through local options and help.

i am a 16 yr old girl that’s stuck in korea. i grew up in canada so I am used to making friends in english. i was born in korea and grew up there until gr3 and i’ve gotten used to english more. i can speak korean, but I can’t make friends with it. it’s like textbook korean. anyways, i have been in korea for four years and it is so upsetting because I can speak korean but cannot make friends in korean. i am amazing at making friends in english  and it is killing me. i have had depression and i just overdosed last week and almost died. because of that, my mom is constantly watching me and that was the first time i had ever taken pills. i can’t do it anymore. my dad is abusive and my mental state is just at a crazy state. idk what to do anymore. oh also i had to drop out because shit happened at school. i am so lost."	i’ve tried but i haven’t seen one single person that speaks english fluently in my neighborhood	0	2	0	0.9992517828941345	0.001325845718383789

Will itself, although seeming to be free, is always conditioned by both external and internal causes. This is what both nondual Shaivism and Buddhism describes the nature of the non-realized mind to be, a conditioned mind with a conditioned will. And it’s logically true. No conditioned individual truly has a free will.	0	0	0	0.9884799718856812	0.00412672758102417

"24 f here,I feel like I hate my life. I've never had a serious relationship and I've never kissed a guy,I'm a virgin. This year it finally hit me how for the last 4 years my mental health was in shambles. I still live at home with my parents, because I was studying till last year and still working on my career and am not financially capable enough to move out-plus I'm Asian so it's not even considering very bad for me to still be living at home.
I'm not even confident enough to drive by myself, I'm full of self-doubt and the past 2 years I just experienced such self loathing thoughts,I'm an introvert, was a really shy kid,and I hate this about my personality, I've always wished I was different, was an extrovert but the last 2 years,these thoughts were so amplified,it made me really dislike myself and dislike so many parts of my personality-I'm a people pleaser and feel like such a pushover,all I could think over the last 2 years was,wow I'm such a loser,doormat,not confident enough to drive,and I don't even have a career or am smart enough to find a job,still living at home,plus I'm fat and ugly-
yes on top of all this,I grew up fat,I managed to lose some weight over the last 1.5 years,but I've always been insecure because of this as well and heard things like you'd look nicer if you lost weight or you'll find a guy if you lost weight as a teenager and at 18 a guy even told me you'd look better if you lost weight-really made me believe I wasn't good enough and made me all the more closed of to guys and dating in the past 4 years.
Also,because of my awkward,quiet nature,I was unable to form a proper concerte friendship in college,despite being in college for 5 years. Isn't that so abnormal? A young person who has no proper friend from college? 
This made me dislike myself a lot more last year and really made me feel like had I been not me,had I been a non-awkward extrovert I wouldn't have this problem. 
I'm finally starting to realize just how much in shambles my mental health has been for the past,especially 4 years,and I hate it. Feels like I lost a part of my life,and as a result of which I ignored my dating life and even college social life for the past few years.
I just want to ask,is this normal? To be closed off socially due to shit,shit mental health.
Am I a loser because I haven't kissed anyone at this age where even 17 year olds are having sex? Also,I'm not one to hookup,or have casual sex,I'd prefer a genuine relationship,iam already self conscious and really awkward, is this another factor that is going to make things harder for me,dating wise?
Am I a complete weirdo or outcast because of this or am I doomed to be alone because of this?
Also,since I've just realized these things,as of now my priority is to just work on getting my career sorted, and to better my mental health and make a few new friends,join the gym and focus on my physical health as well-I don't want to prioritize dating as of now after the realization of how trash my mental health was.
Is that the right thing to do? 
Idk why,I feel like if I de-prioritize dating any further, I'll just die alone with no sexual experience, and will just become a weird outcast and people my age will eventually settle down,be married,etc. and will be heavily judged for being xyz age and not having had a  proper relationship or experience with physical intimacy. 
Can anyone relate/understand?
I feel like I cannot share any of this with my closest friends because they won't really understand, and I don't want to share something and have my feelings be dismissed or invalidated.

Also,if you managed to read everything, thank you so much!"	"Ive always been an introvert, and yes I wish i had more people to talk to aswell. 
Im a guy with low self esteem cause im fat. I haven’t dated anyone since 2019 my past few relationships didn’t last and it’s mostly because of my first relationship (she did alot of damage to me) so I focused on myself and even that didn’t work for me lol. I don’t think you’re a loser. I thought myself a loser cause i had to apply for unemployment and food stamps(stuff happened to me outside of my control and work fucked me over and still are). I made 1 actual friend in college and then a few others but i lost their contact info. I have a friend who’s awkward and she got a boyfriend (i was proud of her) so don’t count yourself out. Being a shut in socially Doesnt mean you wont make friends. Ive made friends with other introverts. I believe you’ll make more friends in due time, get a boyfriend who will love you for who you are

"so recently, I decided that I was going to be online full-time as a high school junior taking all college classes...due to my mental health. High school was just not for me. I've taken college classes since freshman year of high school, so I am very used to college courses. I personally prefer college courses over high school courses. I am starting on the 21st and today was my high school's first day. I loved online during Covid. I thought that I will like it even more now since I don't have to hop on Google meets.

but some thing about seeing all my classmates posting about their first day of school, makes me very sad for some reason. I didn't think that I would be this sad crying over the high school I hated so much. I'm not crying because I'm anxious over taking these college classes(which shouldn't be that hard because they are GenEds high school grad requirements). it feels like some part of me is missing. I know it's good for me that I am starting college early but some part of me is nervous that I won't have a social life. And yes, I knew what I was getting into with online, but I didn't expect it to be this sad, especially after my grandpa leaving. I've been feeling very lonely because he has been living with me for the last two months. And he was the only person I really talked to during the summer because my parents are usually working. he just always chitchat with me. there was really no one else. I didn't expect that to hit me and I feel very lonely and sad inside now that he left.

even when my parents are at work, I'm the only child, so it was just me myself and I. But with him visiting us for the summer, I felt like I finally had someone to talk to. But with him leaving, I have a hard time adapting to the lonely life I had before with no one to communicate with.

I plan on getting a job soon, so I hope that will keep me busy. It's just I was use to my grandpa being with me and I was also used to being in high school for seven hours each day. now that I am a college student with a lot of time on my hands, I feel that a part of me is missing.

I also have a very hard time adjusting to new changes. I know that online will be better for my mental health in the future. but there's just been a lot going on with my grandpa leaving and have my grandma just passed away. Since I am online, I could travel to my home country. But that is also a very big decision if I want to commit to staying there for a few months.

usually, I prefer not being in a classroom with 30 other people. I hated high school and that was the main reason why I switched to online. I felt the high school classes were difficult for absolutely no reason and the school system was not for me. I think I am more sad about being so use to my summer with my grandpa then about high school.
With starting college full-time I feel that I am somewhat of an adult. That I am no longer a kid and maybe that's why I'm feeling sad about high school. But that's just one of the small reasons why I'm feeling this way, but I think my social life is what I'm concerned with the most. And the college thing is just to pile on top of what is really the main reason.

my mom did ask if I wanted to travel to my home country which 98% of my family lives there. didn't really think about it and just said no because I thought that would be very inconvenient. but now I am considering it. And I never really spent time with my family in Vietnam that much. I haven't seen them for four years now.
Maybe that's why I am so sad about my grandpa leaving because I never felt so connected with a family member that was not my mom."	"Let us help with online classes !

"It's a long story. I want to die. It's so difficult to live as a 30 yr old disabled alone girl in a patriarchal society where a wheelchair man get  2 wives but a woman who can walk with support don't get husband. I tried to make me think not all men are of same thinking but.... I don't want to compromise like other disabled girls here, i want a family of my own. I can do all household chores but guys don't believe it as they judge me at 1st place. I need help outside the house only, i can't carry baby in my hands when i am standing. People says someone will marry you only for money, they think we PWD don't deserve to be loved. Sex without marriage is a tabboo here but you can see India's population lol. They expect girls to be a Virgin forever if they are unmarried but boys can make lots of GF. Some even forced me to become a monk and what i got to listen when I said no? You are an Atheist! WTF! My family only wants me to become an officer( i am not good in studies much) or a monk so that they can appreciation from the society. They even use me for sympathy for their benefits. Idk how my husband will he be like lol. I am tired of fighting for rights from Narcissist family. I never had a friend or anyone special because of their insecurities. No social experience at all. There is more stuff i can't write it will be too long and my heart is out of energy now. Please tell a way by which i can die easily. I tried jump from terrace but failed because i couldn't push my body for jump and broke the brick which i used for height. Please tell how ro die at home easily, no toxic positive shit please.

UPDATE : Those who are saying go to another country is not possible without the help of my so called family who said if you want to go foreign join ISKON (indirectly told me to become a monk there also so that i can't make amy BF or husband). They don't want to let me try to live the life by myself. I am bloody 30yrs old ADULT! But ya i am an indian woman too."	You said you could get married if you have money.

I understand that you’re living in a brutally unfair society but it doesn’t have to be the end of you. Struggling within a society doesn’t make your life not worth living, trust me, I’ve been there. You can still be happy. I know this all feels like a lot and like you have nowhere to go, but please believe me when I say that you can still be content if you try and work through this. As long as you’re alive there’s hope for you, but the moment you end it it’s done for you. Risk of pain and fear in a potentially lethal suicide attempt is extremely high, and there’s also a likelihood that it wouldnt kill you and could lead to permanent injuries. I seriously urge you to talk to somebody. I apologize if I missed any details, I’m having my own problems right now. But you are totally free to talk to me	1	0	0	0.0033698829356580973	0.0029917359352111816

That must be such a miserable existence for you. You don't tell your age, but is there ANY way you can perhaps get into school in another country, then while there apply for citizenship or a work visa or anything that can keep you from having to go home? You would have so much more freedom,and be treated with more value as a person somewhere else. You'd have choices in career, choices in what to do with your life, and better choices in who to marry, or not marry. Be single if you want. I know that's hard where you're at but have you looked for ANY way to get out of the country?	2	0	0	0.9220795631408691	0.0030320286750793457

"I don't see why a women who has a disability wouldn't be able to find a husband.

My ex wife all Four foot six of her was physically disabled since birth and we were married for 27 1/2 years, I got to know her as a person, not as a disability, and no I am am perfectly able bodied and 6 foot 5 to her 4 foot 6 so you can get the thought out of your head that we only got together because we were both disabled.

Some people can't see past a disability but you will be surprised how many can.

""You are an Atheist! WTF!"" - good on you I am also and you should be free to be Atheist, here you can be whatever religion you want including none.

At the end of the day I think a major part of the unhappiness you are experiencing  is from your societal values which are pushed upon you and the lack of services available for people with disabilities where you live.

Here in New Zealand life is very different for a women with a disability,  my ex wife for example held down a government job for 20 years, gained qualifications in computing and accounting and of course got married.

Due to her disability being inherited at birth she made the decision to not ever have children and had a hysterectomy at the age of 23 but that was her choice as no one else could make that choice for her, nor should they. She was worried about passing her disability on to any children she might have.

She has many able bodied and physically disabled friends and because of the fact that people with disabilities are not treated here in a backward manor I.E locked in a back room and hidden she has a good life.

I don't mean to sound rude or mean or condescending but I think you need to get out of that country and into one where you can be treated like a human being and not by the sounds of it a subject of pity to be wheeled out whenever your family want something from someone else.

I know you don't like 'toxic shit' but at the end of the day we can not help you do what you need to do and that is primarily to get the hell out of dodge. Once you are out of dodge and out of your oppressive surroundings I think you will find the whole world will open up for you and you will find the things you want and need.

Now also you will note I say ex wife and because of your mindset probably think I left her for some reason possibly related to her disability, well you'd be wrong - she left me after I looked after her through 10 years of breast cancer treatment loosing both breasts in the process. She decided she wanted a different life and thus followed that goal.

So having a disability isn't the end of the world - you just need to be in the right place with the right support and you then will have the possibility of getting everything you could ever want.

Good luck, and I hope that I have managed to steer you of your current course and see that there is more for you. you have to take control, fight for it and get what you want regardless of what others say or do."	0	2	0	0.0018087951466441154	0.17170649766921997

This is a real person btw: If you add a little bit of activity each day, dont go too fast, you will feel better, l like too run. Be proud of what u accomplish not mad at what u didn't. Life is too short for depression or anything else to consume ur life, u might be viewing life in a negative way, u wont fond happiness by doing that. Adopt a fun and healthy habit and enjoy it, surround urself with the best support crew if needed, its harder finding happiness when shy talk to someone u know and practice keeping a convo going as long and as natural as u can( that's all talking to people is.) Find ur purpose wether that be helping people or something else. The only validation u need is your validation, and the only friend u need is life is you so dont be mean to that friend. U don’t need a crisis line/hospital, u can still talk to a therapist tho. Here if u need to talk. If thought of harming distance ur self from anything dangerous go for a walk if possible. Look up Bobby price guy health. U can’t end ur only life which is all u know by ending ur life. Don’t think mood swings last forever. Look for the smaller thrills and the bigger ones will come. If feeling hopeless u need to add more to ur life. Look up how to deal with loneliness by dry creek ranger school.	1	0	0	0.0013360463781282306	0.0018146634101867676

I see my younger sister on the verge of tears and it breaks my heart even more. I have an awful pit in my stomach and a constant regret that I should've taken birth in a secure happy family.

I wish this was all a nightmare and I could wake up from this into a happy world.

"Hi,   


I suppose the fact that this sub is in top 1% of Reddit tells a lot about the condition of our society.   


I was scouring for the right sub for this offload of experiences and emotions to crossreference with other people and it either is here or in 5 different places at the same time, but hell, here goes:  


I was born typicall middle-class family, Europe, Poland, at the begining of the 90'.  2 parents, overly present in my life, who are and were lovely but I didn't let it make me blind to certain mistakes, which undoubtedly I will also make, so worth mentioning, not worth holding grudge over. Since the very begining of my days I've been labelled as super smart and intelligent and to a certain degree I believe that, but in reality I wish learning and acquiring skills was tougher as I think it would've caused me to work harder on well, working hard. In friends department, I was quite lonely really, I've had the odd friend here and there, but I guess it's the typicall bullied fat kid story. Kindergarten - no friends that I could rememer, bullies I do. Primary school- 3 years of bullying followed by 3 years of bullying with an odd friend or two, didn't last. Then, as I thought I was making an actual friendship, we moved to suburb house, changed school, was even lonelier than before, bullying magnified but so did my resilience and I guess that was the point in my life when I chose that I don't want to fight for any kind of attention anymore, but not in a good way, I basically alienated myself for 3 years. Then highschool was the biggest let down of them all. In the middle school, I focused solely on getting to the best High school I could in my region, thinking that intellingence/ambition will finally get me surrounded by people more like me. <Insert\_Joker\_laughter>. Got in, people turned out to be either rich assholes, or suckups to those rich assholes. 4 months into the 3 years I knew I am again going for loneliness when the odd thing happend and by some sort of miracle I got a bunch of other misfits together and we were less alone. Nonetheless I changed cities for studies, which I never wanted but was to afraid to fight my parents about it, which ultimately led to nothing good in the studies department. I then changed jobs, tried to look for fun, money or anything else that would help me find like a path or a goal. Ultimately I am to this day completely unaware why are people so rude, evil and self centered. After 30 years of turning round and round on this rock, I literally have no idea why people want to live in capitalism the way it is right now, why everyone is blind to others problems, why we are completely skeptical of science, but will fight till death for an old book. Most of my life I feel like an alien in a strange world, surrouned by other creatures who look like me, but that have nothing in common. The one thing that is constant in my experience, is that there is no good people with money, and some good people with no money at all. Me myself, I was making ordinary money, than a fuckton, and now back to ordinary as my previous boss was a typical egomaniac with shouting as the main tool. I mean dude had some skill, he was like all the bullies I've experienced combined, but with an upgrade of actually having a hold on my life by randomly changing the rules of employment. Nowadays, I feel no passion, have almost no ambition and feel surrouneded by a world that just does not work well with people who wish to be good. I mean hell, I know it is always worth to be kind, and good, and compassionate, but for fuck sake, in my experience it only gets you exploited.   


So to sum it up, I am mighty sad, don't see no worth in the way we live and quite frankly think that around 10 years from now the whole system will collapse. Idk, roast me, argue with me or agree, any interaction is appreciated as it may give some insight or point of view that I never thought of. "

Guys whenever i get around ppl especially girls i get some anxiety and can’t approach them fo shit even for some work and the environment around me is also kinda messed up so tell me some tips on how i can improve my communication (i live in Pakistan btw)	I have something similar. When the group is bigger like 5+ people I’ll stress and think about every word I say. Talking to friends and people that I already know for some time is fine tho, most of the time. But try no to overthink it, to just a conversation and girls, what’s different about them compared to your friends in the communication field. So try to be calm and say so shit, they’ll probably don’t care and the conversation will go on.

i’m currently on vacations and visiting cities filled with young people is my worst fear. I do not know why since i’m a young girl (20) but seing all of these people makes me feel very uneasy. The thing is that when a city is filled with average old people I’m complaining that there isn’t enough young adults and when there are plenty of young adults i’m almost shaking in fear. Hearing them laughing in groups while i’m walking alone in a country that isn’t even mine is killing me. help. The worst is that almost everybody is blonde with blue eyes wearing pastel colours while I’m a whole Asian girl wearing black from head to toe.	ur style is better than theirs anyway imo	0	0	0	0.005232326686382294	0.7567057013511658

I’m 24 and have been learning to drive since I graduated high school.  I know it’s embarrassing. 

I wasn’t allowed to get my L’s in high school because of most of my family members. My auntie thought I was too un-coordinate to drive. It annoyed me

Turns out they were right lol. I’m 24 now and I’ve failed my P’s about 4-5 times through out the years. I have had 3 different driving instructors and spent so much of my parents money on it. And learned with my parents on and off.  

The teacher told me I did good during the lesson. most likely got nervous during the test!!!!!

So anyways. I renewed my L’s about a month ago because it expired last year lol.  

I’ve been driving my dads car home after work at 6pm everyday.  Everything was going well until today when I got confused/scared with lane changing. I normally take the left lane but went into the right and got nervous - failing to signal as a car drove past and beeped at me.

Not to mention almost crashing into a car from the right hand at the round about yesterday. WHEN I KNOW u should always give way to the right hand side, it happened anyways. 

My dad got scared. And right now I am lowkey reminded why I wanted to give up driving a year ago.  Why I took half a year to even renew my L’s.  

My father keeps repeating CONCENTRATE. PAY ATTENTION. The exact same thing my instructors and whenever I get in trouble at work by multiple different bosses at different jobs.

It all comes back down to the intelligence test I took.  For a while now I’ve been wondering if I could be ADHD. Or have a learning disability. Most likely the latter

And you know what? I sought out a doctor, took a test and Turns out I have AN INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY. I HAVE SUSPECTED THIS ALL MY LIFE - thst I’m slower at learning than EVERYONE ELSE! Now there’s A LABEL to make me feel even shittier about myself. 

still waiting to find out if it’s ADHD or to dismiss it entirely. Deep down I know I’m not ADHD, I’m just slow/stupid.

My psychologist did note that I’m low I’m memory and concentration, retrieval of Information. And that “it can be improved by playing memory games”.  

After knowing this.  And being constantly told to ‘concentrate’ while driving.  Most times I can, but other times I find myself zoning out.. Maybe I’m not cut out for driving. I’m just going to endanger myself and others, THATS WHY THEY WONT GIVE ME MY P’s, JUST LIKE SPONGEBOB!! WHO NEVER PASSES HIS DRIVING TEST 

I hate driving man. I could have been the cause of a car accident with my dad as the passenger today AND THE DAY BEFORE.

My Mum these days pushes me to get my P’s so I can drive to work instead of taking the train/bus all the time. It was the complete opposite a few years back which is kind of funny. 

Get my P’s at least, right?  prove myself for once!
It’s embarrassing enough I’ve had 3-4 driving instructor and spent so much and my parents still encourage looking for another one.  It’d be soo embarrassing to pay a former instructor from a year ago. 

What if I pay all this money for them to take me to do the test just to fail all over again.  Just like piano and swimming lessons, like my Asian mother pointed out. Failure. Failure. Failure. 

I know it’s my disability that’s kept me from getting it as fast as other people.  Part of me just wants to give up and say driving isn’t for me,  the other half wants to keep trying and feel happy to have achieved something.  

I don’t know."	"I've passed my driving test on 7th attempt and avoided driving for almost 6 years. Then I just bought an automatic car. It's so much easier. Changing the gears messed me up a lot, too much things to concentrate on.

What was the intellectual test? I think I need to take one as I believe I have some problems as well.

Also, not sure what L's and P's are."	0	2	2	0.9962291121482849	0.0011140704154968262

still waiting to find out if it’s ADHD or to dismiss it entirely. Deep down I know I’m not ADHD, I’m just slow/stupid.

My psychologist did note that I’m low I’m memory and concentration, retrieval of Information. And that “it can be improved by playing memory games”.  

After knowing this.  And being constantly told to ‘concentrate’ while driving.  Most times I can, but other times I find myself zoning out.. Maybe I’m not cut out for driving. I’m just going to endanger myself and others, THATS WHY THEY WONT GIVE ME MY P’s, JUST LIKE SPONGEBOB!! WHO NEVER PASSES HIS DRIVING TEST 

I hate driving man. I could have been the cause of a car accident with my dad as the passenger today AND THE DAY BEFORE.

My Mum these days pushes me to get my P’s so I can drive to work instead of taking the train/bus all the time. It was the complete opposite a few years back which is kind of funny. 

Get my P’s at least, right?  prove myself for once!
It’s embarrassing enough I’ve had 3-4 driving instructor and spent so much and my parents still encourage looking for another one.  It’d be soo embarrassing to pay a former instructor from a year ago. 

What if I pay all this money for them to take me to do the test just to fail all over again.  Just like piano and swimming lessons, like my Asian mother pointed out. Failure. Failure. Failure. 

I know it’s my disability that’s kept me from getting it as fast as other people.  Part of me just wants to give up and say driving isn’t for me,  the other half wants to keep trying and feel happy to have achieved something.  

I don’t know."	"Not sure about the America, I'm in UK, lol.

I assumed it's L plate and P plate, just not used for these terms to be used like that. Get L's, Get P's... was just confusing, haha. Because you don't get L here, you just drive your instructor's car and that car has L on it. P plate is not mandatory in UK."	0	2	0	0.9926738142967224	0.0011914968490600586

TW: rape
  

  
I am an Indian boy, less than 18 BTW(don't wanna be specific), I live in Kuwait and my parents aren't wealthy or anything. I have a brother(5 yrs older) When I was a kid I was raped by him IT was 2013-14 I was about 7 back then, I was unaware of what was going on and went along this happened on weekends for a month until I mom came out her room in the afternoon and caught us and interrogated me but I said it's nothing and I was told not to say anything by my brother. That was when he stopped
  

  
Fast forward a couple years it's 2017 he leaves Kuwait and goes to India for studies, we both use to get good grades but even since I was raped my grades dropped and I got insomnia and tons of health issues. He gots good grades in India and then fell into depression and sort of drop out.
  

  
2019-He became a weird person got an attitude I guess and Became self centered and aggressive. We went to India for Vacation and decided that he'd come back and do studies here, in 2020 covid hit I was locked in and I felt uncomfortable for some reason, I developed OCD. I Clean myself alot if I touch his things or anything about him makes me uncomfortable. He was told me teach me maths cause I was struggling but he did nothing and got paid by my parents LMFAO. 2021 may I distant myself from him and my parents didn't like it and told me to interact with him. I told my mom everything in Oct of 2021 and the first thing she did was laugh(probably because I was talking about sexual abuse and shit and we Indians Don't talk about it). I cried, she told me she'd be here for me and to talk to her if i need her ( she did nothing even when I asked for comfort a week later lol wtf). I told her to tell my dad for her as well and she said alright and she also told me that he was raped when he was 12 or something by dad's coworker without dad knowing and during 2019 he told mom and my aunt in Australia (She's important for later).
  

  
My parents said this thing is normal and all siblings do it and I shouldn't worry and then they said ""don't tell anyone"". I told a few trust worthy friends who and really good but I feel myself withdrawal away from everyone. 2022 we went to India and I was gonna tell my uncle in India about it( he helped us alot this year and back in 2019 he's amazing). But I couldn't muster up the courage. 2023 July we go meet him again but only live with him for 3 days as and dad has me take care of my grandfather who is really sick and might not live long. So I couldn't tell him again.
  

  
I come back from India and I hate it here. I have Vacation but my brother doesn't so he goes to collage and I interrogated my mom and got her to confess
  

  
She believes that I was raped but my parents don't want to contact the police because ""90% students and people do it"" and ""we should just forget nothing we can do, police won't help"" She gaslight me and I hate it, feels like she takes Out her anger on me with verbal abuse no swearing or anything. But guess what, this time I recorded everything 6:34 seconds worth of voice recording These monsters don't give one crap about there sons rape or my tears. I left the room and pause the recording saved it, she told me to come back but I didn't saving the recording was top priority. She came to the living room after a minute and said ""what happened to you happened to your brother"" my dad doesn't know my brother was raped.
  

  
I told my dad ages ago I will go to Australia after grade 12th CBSE Board exams and I have about 8 months left. I haven't done anything with the recordings yet but I have backups
  

  
I told my mom me and my brother need to be separated and this entire thing is causing me problems she said "" just forget it's normal"" Once I go to Australia I'm gonna go no contact obviously. Maybe even leak the recordings and let them burn in hell. I'm currently practicing IELTS but when I told my mom that she has to separate us she said "" we can go to India after 12th you and me"" and I said I'm going to Australia and she replied ""i cant come there"" but i didnt care and i said i will.
  

  
Today about 30mins before dinner we had an argument when everyone was home but didnt listen. Basically woke up early and studied for IELTS but she doesnt know what that is and asked will u get full marks in board exam and I basically replied I will get good grades and go to Australia, and she got angry and was like "" dad doesn't have 25 lakhs rupees you will stay""
  

  
And she spoke over me and didn't even shut the fuck up when I spoke over her. I can live with my aunt in Australia she knows my brother was raped
  
But doesn't know about my condition and she asks about my future after 12th( she will happily accept me in Australia and I trust her family they are cool like my uncle in india). I was thinking about sending the recording to my uncle in India tomorrow morning but I've been saying that for like 2 weeks. Idk what to do, will I even be out of this hell hole by next year. When I ask my dad about going to Australia he says "" there is no need to write an exam and we'll see later"" and just funking nods his head.
  

  
The reason I'm being told to be quiet is probably( or according to my logic) because if everyone found out then there's goes his reputation, Noone will like them, brother will not get a job or marriage, so no grandkids and he won't get my brother's salary for his retirement( that's the reason we were born, to take care of these idiots) and since there's only 2 of us, only I remain to take care of them with is not ideal since 2 is greater than 1 I guess.
  

  
Sorry for the long read I didn't know where to post this. I really need help. Dm me if you want more info thanks for letting me vent. I'll give you and update if I can but this a throwaway once everything's resolved"	I can't tell you what to do. Obviously there are cultural factors that play a big role.  I will say this though. I am sorry all this happened to you. I am glad you are seeking to put some distance between you and your family.  I find when I am not sure what to do I do nothing for now.  You can always do something later but once you act you can not take it back. I suggest you wait until you are away for awhile and have a chance to think clearly. Once your head is clear then you can decide what is the best thing to do.	2	2	0	0.02281685173511505	0.0008339881896972656

It's been a couple of years since I worked the job but it causing me some issues now in my personal life. I worked with the Nova Scotia medical examiners office in Canada for almost 2 years. With a company that was contracted to do dead body removals. I randomly and other times it's triggered by food ( like hamburger being made in a factory)  or something graphic on the TV. But I've become distant from fishing whish is a passion of mine, family members, friends, work, and now it's caused my engagement to be called off. And my girl and I are taking an extended break until I'm able to speak to someone and get my emotions in order. She's been wanting me to speak to someone for years and ignored her pleas thinking I was strong enough and that this couldn't possibly happen to me. Sometimes it is completely ramdom other times when I drive past an area where I picked up a dead body I snap to that moment and I can see everything plain as day. I can still smell the things I smelt. See the things I seen and even feel the fucked up things I felt. Idk if I'm making this post to vent or to ask for help or what but here it is anyways.

An Internalized white superiority complex. Black women see themselves as the victims of black men's inability to build a stable benevolent patriarchal culture (all cultures are patriarchal, we have to stop accepting the word patriarchy being used as a shaming tool) capable of protecting, providing for, appreciating, nuturing black women and the life they collectively create. That feeling goes further along the siding scale by buying into the racist narratives of American culture and the belief that black men are inherently flawed, abusive, failures, destructive, and irredeemable. 

Usually we find ourselves having cultures centering around the tragic dynamic between African American men and African American women. Which we should absolutely stop doing. There are millions of black women and men throughout Latin America and Africa that would happily welcome us with open arms. I daily have African women reaching out to me, that's not me trying to flex. Black love is alive and well.


Additionally, I want to say that not all black women in America feel this way, but enough of them do that this sentiment is prevalent and remains unchecked.

I was just on /r/blackladies and they post pictures of themselves all the time. There are a **lot** of good looking women on there. Which makes it disheartening to know that they all hate black men.

I see black men bash black women in real life and online. But black women who do this and bash black men get the benefit of the doubt. They are propped up too by racist white and white-identified Asian and Latino men for upholding white supremacist anti-BM myths. It's getting out of hand. Black men and women need to discuss our issues among each other in private spaces. Stop putting this stuff online for racist anti-black people to stir up more tensions. 

I feel black people are very vulnerable to those divisive tactics because we have so much generational pain and trauma to unpack and it seems we're just now having this conversation. We're trained from a young age to demonize ourselves, demonize dark skin and African origin, we aren't taught true black history to create a stable identity and we live in a white supremacy that's pervasive in the government, media, education and legal system. Plus too many young black kids live on social media and are getting influenced by white and non-black incels and trolls. Too many digital blackfaces on forums, Reddit and Black Twitter and TikTok. Our youth needs role models more than ever. 

Black women's self hate and bad experiences with some awful black men will lead them to idolize white men (also due to white supremacy and the idea of ""marrying up"") and there's a niche of those who idolize East Asian men (anime and Kpop/drama influence). Also Latino and Arab men (thinking they're more loyal). Overall it's embarrassing because at the end of the day, those non-black men are just as toxic, abusive and will bail on their girlfriends, wives and kids. Many of them just fetishize black girls and see them for easy sex and nothing serious. I've heard and seen white women, Asian women, Arab women and Latinas complain about domestic abuse and misogyny in their cultures. It's grass is always greener fantasy, reality is much more complex. 

No group of people are perfect. You can interracially date and mind your business. Unfortunately due to the power dynamics of our society, it seems some of us just want non-black partners for proximity to whiteness rather than genuine love. See the cases when kids born from the union come out looking black and how their parents react."	0	2	0	0.9924572706222534	0.07127243280410767

"Personally I am noticing something that Asian guys figured out years ago (that more young brothers are coming to realize). WHEN GIVEN THE OPTION BW WILL rather date a broke/overweight White Guy/WM then deal with a BM that has his stuff together but doesn’t check off some weird box. 

To me the game is this. Black women have made strides in the workforce. And TBH I am happy for them, but along that so has their requirements for a partner. And if you grew up in a mixed town/city then you know all women’s requirements have gone up. The difference is that BW are looking for issues with you (not all but there are a lot) to disqualify you from the dating pool. Eboni K just went on a live saying that a Truck/bus driver. A solid middle income job with benefits. 

So you can complain about the sisters that NO LONGER WANT YOU (I am sorry I truly am because Black women have always been the finest to me). Or you can work on yourself to make your options better.

IN MY EXPERIENCE. the white and hispanic kids i went to school with majority of the time accepted me right away. this  was one of the main reasons  i  was scared about attending an  hbcu. so as i step into university i hope that these other commenters are right but most my interactions weren't on social media. while i have seen the red pill people and the high value dudes i can say i take what they say with a grain of salt because social media can twist or reveal anything. like my ex. black presenting and making comments about his type. the only difference between me and his type was im black and his type is latinas but same body type. it's really coming down to maturity and insecurity in themselves and how their relationship is with the women in their life . as  far as my 'type' i can't say. i do feel more gravitated towards other races and ethnic backgrounds, but that's because i have exposure. my first ever bf was white. he asked me at school mind you it's first grade but ill always remember him. he told our coach he was taking me to the dance. whoever raised him had their head on right. but that's  all i can really say. maturity and insecurity.	0	2	0	0.01554462593048811	0.01219242811203003

Some of the women on r/blackladies are actually very attractive. You have to realize alot of these dudes here are ""coping"" or from another generation, so they may not understand. Many of the same dudes here won't be making excuses if it was the other side around.

LMAO, but it's so true. These dudes are so indoctrinated by white and black female feminist rhetoric that they can't think for themselves or act like a castrated male with no backbone. Everytime you call out this, especially to other black women, the shaming tactics and the use of buzz words like patriarchy, misogynist, protect bw, black men like non-bw, etc. commense The male panderers, simps and feminist will all join in to agree.

If you're a Gen Z black man, then you should understand this. When we are in college within black orgs and the topic of dating comes up, the rhetoric will be no different and the only difference is that they will tone done the language. In PWIs, you see certain type of BW that believe they're above black men and feel revolted by a black man even thinking they had a chance with her.

"I am a straight, cis-gendered male born in 1979, and raised in the northeastern USA by a pair of liberal Christian hippies. My mother is a former nun and my father almost became a monk. Being gentle, kind, and not at all domineering was very much normalized in my home and my parents' social circle growing up. No one knew this at the time, but I'm on the autism spectrum, so I took these principles very much at face value, and very much to their logical extent, because I don't read people well, and it was all I had.

I was bullied relentlessly throughout my school years, and it took a major toll on my self-esteem. But my parents were loving, accepting, and comforting to a fault, which, combined with their religious and political beliefs, led me to put all my hope and trust in the possibility that the world was slowly but surely becoming the place they were working to build. This faith got me through some very dark and painful times in my youth.

I used to doubt my parents' religious beliefs, and supernatural belief in general, but I never had it in me to doubt the more worldly beliefs my parents taught me. I chose to become a physician, because I wanting nothing more than to help people and help heal the world, and make a living doing something positive, rather than finding cunning ways of separating people from their money. Medical residency was the most socially painful experience I lived through. Even though I love the science of the human body, love helping people and reducing pain, and love learning and intellectual things, I never anticipated that this field would select almost entirely for competitive, obedient, and power-driven people. No one in the medical field related to me, and those that might have, were running for the exit of this profession by the time I met them.

I approach everyone as an equal. All it takes for me to accept someone and give them a chance, is that they be kind and interesting. I do not want to dominate anyone, and I do not want to be dominated be anyone. I didn't think this was a complicated or unreasonable social contract to proffer, but apparently it is. I've resigned myself to being a pretty asocial person outside of my work and my immediate family, because I've found through hard experience that to most people, especially other men, my lack of desire to dominate anyone, is by default an open invitation to dominate me.

I don't mean to belittle the experience of rape survivors. Nor do I mean to suggest that I relate to rape survivors, because I couldn't possibly. But every now and then I hear stories of [usually female] rape survivors, who feel inexplicably driven to put themselves in positions where they attract the attention of horny men, and then get some perverse (but at some level understandable) satisfaction out of rejecting them, when they dare to make a move on them in response. I've been known to do the same thing, but with power, instead of sex. I'll put myself in social situations with men, and sincerely (self-righteously, even) meet them with the expectation that they'll engage me as equals, without asserting dominance or presenting a front of ""don't mess with me"", because I feel I shouldn't have to. Then I'll get all worked up with righteous indignation and tell them off, when they take the liberty of asserting dominance over me, and expecting me to follow their lead without any reciprocity.

I'm not an incel by any means; I'm happily married and sexually active with my wife, and am raising three kids. But I sure could use some more guy friends. And I sure could use some reassurance that my finding a woman who found me attractive was not some highly unlikely miracle. When I signed up for a dating site called TheNerve.com in 2001, I was flummoxed by the fact that nearly every straight woman with a profile on the site checked ""power"" as a turn-on. Raised in an Irish Catholic family, I had two rather awkward conversations with extended family members in my adolescence, where they asked me whether I'd considered ""the religious life"". (Um... no.)

When I'm honest and articulate about what I just wrote, I tend to get a reaction midway between ""You're a beautiful person, never change"" and ""Please stop, I'm cringing hard."" Often followed by a distinct desire to distance themselves from me, because they can't decide which of these two sentiments they feel more strongly.

Be honest with me. Because I feel this as frankly existential. Have I spent my life in complete and utter denial and rejection of a basic fact of human nature, because I took the principles I was raised with at far greater face value than even the people who taught them to me?? Or have I just not found my people? Either way, what would you recommend I do, lifestyle-wise, to ensure my future mental health and social connectivity, and have the effect on the world I want to have?

Oh, and what venues of social interaction would you recommend to me, to find people (especially other men), who relate to my experience and my response to it, rather than cringe or deem me strange and maladjusted?"	"So the first batch of paragraphs, I could probably address but really you'd want a LOT of background. Works like nietzsche, John Rawls, Bernard Williams, John Locke, etc. - basically I'm saying it's not a simple answer, or even a single answer. If I'm reading you right and you've got a medical degree, you probably took an undergraduate class in **ethics**; I would suggest going back to that, because the questions you're asking about human nature are best explored in that field of philosophy.

As for your last question, I dunno if you noticed buddy but us guys are having trouble finding 'venues of social interaction' even where people *don't* relate to our niche experiences. You're making a huge ask. Not impossible, though - surprisingly, I think team sports is your best bet, things like pickup soccer (or 'football' if you're a filthy xeno who's misusing the God-given-to-the-US-English language) or a volleyball league, or even martial arts. Even boxing. Some of the most chill, down-to-earth dudes imaginable can be found in a boxing gym.

Or you could make a space like the one you're looking for, if you want, have the time, energy and organizational skills. Not easy, but the best option for some people. I don't like the phrase 'be the change', but if you *want to* then that might be your path."	0	0	0	0.9935112595558167	0.013244926929473877

"I'm not sure how to put this across... I'm feeling really down about everything.. Don't feel like doing ANYTHING.. 

I do workout (I cycle but haven't been going out on rides since the last 7-10 days since I don't feel like it at all) and have an angel of a daughter who's two years old.
However, in spite of these two lovely supports I'm just feeling burnt out, I think..

I have a wife who's supportive on and off depending on her own mental health status.. Financially though, I'm the lone ranger and it just creates a lot of pressure on me..

I can't speak about it with my wife since she ends up feeling guilty about it but doesn't do anything to help - she herself is low on confidence and feels like she cannot land any job with her current skills.

My skills are getting outdated too (Indian IT employee here) but I'm just not up for upskilling myself and the thought of becoming irrelevant kills me.

I want to run away from everything and explore the world but can't do that unless I take care of responsibilities towards family first.

On top of that my parents are financially dependent on me to an extent too and I can't keep supporting them to the level I am doing now with my current income since my child needs schooling and that's a newly added expense column in the monthly budget.

I also do not have any savings whatsoever and the thought of not being financially independent is scary AF.


TOO many demons to run away from, not enough places to run."	"Sounds like you are getting burnt out... I'm not a qualified mental health professional so I can't contribute much.. my therapist told me that in order to give, my 'resource tank' needs to be filled. This means engaging in activities that help to 'fill' your tank- things that are enjoyable and meaningful to you. It can be something simple like making coffee or going for a walk in the park while admiring the texture of leaves and flowers. It can be playing with animals. (Personally, activities that don't 'fill' my resource tank for me are mindless scrolling through youtube/reddit, or binge watching Netflix. Instead they increase my stress levels. But some people find these activities restful!)

Another thing my therapist told me is that motivation is a tricky issue because it won't come by 'waiting till you get the motivation again'. Rather, we have to start doing the thing even if we don't feel like it. Then the motivation starts to kick in again. 

Some other tips are journaling (writing down your worries, thoughts etc. Breaking things down step by step), exercising regularly even if you don't feel like it (this is a hard one..). 

Keep going! I hope you can find mental health resources that are accessible to you, like an affordable therapist. The earlier you access help, the better it is. Good job for reaching out here. 

Maybe you can encourage your wife to look for a casual part time job? Something she can cope with and gain confidence over time."	0	2	0	0.00210632779635489	0.0011473894119262695
"While desperately looking for that chic ethnic FIT I can slay in for Diwali, I came across this awesome sleeveless Kurti which was perfect...but it was sleeveless that means SHAVING! 
God, why! But wait why do we HAVE to shave if we hate it so much. Let's be honest making ourselves go through hot wax and exorcist level yanking or bleeding to death while shaving is like self-torture just to look good (in the eyes of society). If it is that painful why do we make ourselves go through it? 

Did you see the movie Khiladi? The one where Akshay Kumar was seen flaunting his body hair. Wouldn't it be amazing if we saw women flaunting theirs too? 

Have you seen animals shave their body hair? There's a reason why we have body hair. It keeps mammals warm. It protects the body against trauma and also against ultraviolet damage. In human beings, specialized hairs such as eyelashes and hairs inside the nostrils and external ears afford some protection from the environment. Eyebrows prevent sweat from getting into the eyes. Scalp hairs may assist in stabilizing the temperature of the brain. Hairs can also excrete toxic substances like arsenic, and are thus of use in forensic medicines. As every dermatologist knows, the physiological functions of hairs are immeasurable.

We all go through puberty. Hairy or otherwise it's one's choice to either keep the hair on our body or not. Society or your friends can't shame you for your body hair. There is a reason why we were born with the same. It protects us from so many unimaginable things. Imagine not having eyelashes or nostril hair, then how will you survive the dust that affects your body? All I want to say is let's continue to break the barriers and show that beauty is diverse and you don't have to be a certain stereotype to be beautiful. 

When you look at the world, the world isn't just one palette. It's a rainbow. So, say goodbye to your inner critic and take a pledge to be kinder to yourself and others too.

"I don't have many friends, but I ended up being the odd one out of the only college class I have with them today. Met with a therapist I've been meeting for about a year for the last time today because I am getting too old for youth services and completed a transition. Went onto a poc discord channel for the first time in months and saw that a yt person was using that channel to interview poc about ""recognizing race with bad vision"" or smthn, and I realized almost nobody in that tiny toxic channel is actually black, just mostly other races who aren't happy with ""black people being the only race represented in poc"". One of two of my closest friends is a guy and my parents have taught me unconsciously that it is awkward, so I am ashamed, and my other closest friend has drifted away from me because she feels like she's ""been a bad influence"" (she hasn't).

The only things that made me more introverted are my insecurities. I need people to talk to but I guess I have too many boyish hobbies to relate to girls my age and am too weird to fit into my own race. I talk genuinely to friends about once a month and the rest is spent being in isolation or being an odd one out.

Something in your post spoke to me. I’m kind of a Reddit weirdo, may be an addict. It’s hands-down my favorite social media even though I hate it and even though I have to dodge racist trolls.

I have a lot of interests I consider weird, and not even necessarily full blown hobbies. But like I like to look at architecture. I like retro futurism and cyberpunk stuff. I love baseball. I’m not really a huge gamer or comic book person so sometimes I’m kind of a blerd but sometimes not. I’m about to jump into the world of house plants. I love Reddit because it lets me at least see the stuff I’m interested in doing (I have a lot of social anxiety and some other mental health stuff on board) and maybe chat with the people doing those things

I grew up with a lot of unaddressed internalized racism that I’m still working through in middle-age. I’ve always felt weird in so many different aspects of my life. I’m sorry it sounds like you feel that way too and I’m sorry because it is really isolating, which is why I wanted to reach out. 

Anyway I hang out on Reddit way too much, way way way too much. [And I follow a lot of subs that aren’t like the big popular subs](https://imgur.com/a/AzMLpqx). I’m sharing some in case you find some of your interests overlapping or in case it sparks some subs for you to search for, or maybe you can find some like-minded folk. 

this is only online life (‘life’)– for real life, does your therapist have a referral or support for after you transition out of youth services?"	2	2	0	0.0018685333197936416	0.006064355373382568
"I don't have many friends, but I ended up being the odd one out of the only college class I have with them today. Met with a therapist I've been meeting for about a year for the last time today because I am getting too old for youth services and completed a transition. Went onto a poc discord channel for the first time in months and saw that a yt person was using that channel to interview poc about ""recognizing race with bad vision"" or smthn, and I realized almost nobody in that tiny toxic channel is actually black, just mostly other races who aren't happy with ""black people being the only race represented in poc"". One of two of my closest friends is a guy and my parents have taught me unconsciously that it is awkward, so I am ashamed, and my other closest friend has drifted away from me because she feels like she's ""been a bad influence"" (she hasn't).

The only things that made me more introverted are my insecurities. I need people to talk to but I guess I have too many boyish hobbies to relate to girls my age and am too weird to fit into my own race. I talk genuinely to friends about once a month and the rest is spent being in isolation or being an odd one out. Been praying for a good gal group since middle school and I guess I'm still waiting on it

(I'll delete if offensive in any way)"	Never allow yourself to stay in a place of doubt by being black with different interest. You are not the monolith. I would say study and connect with those who have multiple interest and are proud to be black and unique. I don’t mind sharing what I know and have learned. The biggest threat is becoming Americanized with no sense of black purpose and direction. In doing so you find more about our people, yourself, and how the world works. I promise you there’s another black person that you can relate and grow with. Much love and respect for your honesty!	1	2	0	0.001155845820903778	0.0033730268478393555

Make him dating profiles and start talking to other women posing as him on his phone. But every night be sure to delete the apps and save the accounts. After you have enough women on his phone one day keep the app downloaded and act like your going through his phone. Then frame him for cheating and talking to other women and show your parents why they should have never picked a guy for you in the first place.

It's better than nothing.

Remember therapists are just guides, all the work on changing yourself should be done by you, it's a long and tedius process but totally worth it. You need to remove layers and layers of what the enviroment e.g. family, peers, society imposed on your mentality.

You have lost nothing. You are seeing only 1 version of yourself now but how many versions are there? Everything you experience is forced through a lens. That lens consists of the story of your life. It consists of the trauma that you inherited from your parents. But the lens itself can be re-configured, like a kaleidoscope. Twist it slightly to the left and you'll see a new pattern.

"I used to have many misunderstandings about surrendering. It felt like giving up or not pushing hard enough. But recently, I stumbled upon the book ""The Surrender Experiment,"" and it completely changed my perspective. Surrendering, it turns out, is the exact opposite of what I thought. 

&#x200B;

What truly inspired me in the book was the author's decision to embrace new experiences, even those he initially resisted. He chose to surrender and be open to life's opportunities, and the results were far beyond his imagination. That, to me, is the genuine essence of surrendering. **It doesn't mean giving up on life; instead, it's about releasing our ego and personal preferences, facing our fears, and having the courage to step outside our comfort zone. It's about relinquishing control and wholeheartedly embracing whatever life presents us with.**

&#x200B;

Looking back on my own life, I realized that most of my successes came from confronting these challenges head-on, while most of my suffering arose when I clung to comfort based on personal preferences. Now, having experienced this breakthrough, I've made the most crucial decision of my life: to surrender. I am choosing to participate in life with a calm mind and an open heart.

&#x200B;

A calm mind entails letting go of constant self-analysis, personal preferences, and ego-driven thoughts. So much of our suffering comes from obsessing about ourselves. However, if we shift our focus to serving others and let go of our own desires, we can find instant relief. The happiest people in the world are not those who achieve greatness solely for themselves, but those who enrich the lives of others. Surrendering allows life to grant us gifts beyond our wildest dreams.

&#x200B;

An open heart means being open-minded, flexible, and courageous. It may sound simple, but it's a challenging endeavor. Confronting our fears and being willing to do things we initially resist are significant parts of this process. **Sometimes, the most remarkable outcomes come from things we never wanted or considered in the first place.** So, if you're considering surrendering, start by addressing your fears. Instead of avoiding them, confront them and take on the tasks you don't want to do. This is the path to surrendering to life.

&#x200B;

When we take greater risks, we also reap greater rewards. As we do this, it's essential to quiet our minds. This means letting go of judgments and opinions and creating mental clarity to see things as they are without overanalyzing. To start, pay close attention to your thoughts and become aware of them. Whenever you catch yourself engrossed in a negative thought, pause, take a breath, and acknowledge that it's just your mind spinning a tale—it doesn't come from your heart. Let it go and refocus on the task at hand. Surrendering is not a one-time event; it is a continuous process of growth and self-discovery. So, be patient with yourself and celebrate every step forward, no matter how small it may seem.

&#x200B;

In the end, surrendering is about finding harmony within ourselves and with the world around us. It is about aligning with the natural rhythms of life and trusting that the universe has our best interests at heart. So, let go of the need for control, quiet your mind, and embrace the beauty of surrender. As you do so, you will unlock the door to a life of fulfillment, purpose, and boundless possibilities.

"I used to have many misunderstandings about surrendering. It felt like giving up or not pushing hard enough. But recently, I stumbled upon the book ""The Surrender Experiment,"" and it completely changed my perspective. Surrendering, it turns out, is the exact opposite of what I thought. 

&#x200B;

What truly inspired me in the book was the author's decision to embrace new experiences, even those he initially resisted. He chose to surrender and be open to life's opportunities, and the results were far beyond his imagination. That, to me, is the genuine essence of surrendering. **It doesn't mean giving up on life; instead, it's about releasing our ego and personal preferences, facing our fears, and having the courage to step outside our comfort zone. It's about relinquishing control and wholeheartedly embracing whatever life presents us with.**

&#x200B;

Looking back on my own life, I realized that most of my successes came from confronting these challenges head-on, while most of my suffering arose when I clung to comfort based on personal preferences. Now, having experienced this breakthrough, I've made the most crucial decision of my life: to surrender. I am choosing to participate in life with a calm mind and an open heart.

&#x200B;

A calm mind entails letting go of constant self-analysis, personal preferences, and ego-driven thoughts. So much of our suffering comes from obsessing about ourselves. However, if we shift our focus to serving others and let go of our own desires, we can find instant relief. The happiest people in the world are not those who achieve greatness solely for themselves, but those who enrich the lives of others. Surrendering allows life to grant us gifts beyond our wildest dreams.

&#x200B;

An open heart means being open-minded, flexible, and courageous. It may sound simple, but it's a challenging endeavor. Confronting our fears and being willing to do things we initially resist are significant parts of this process. **Sometimes, the most remarkable outcomes come from things we never wanted or considered in the first place.** So, if you're considering surrendering, start by addressing your fears. Instead of avoiding them, confront them and take on the tasks you don't want to do. This is the path to surrendering to life.

&#x200B;

When we take greater risks, we also reap greater rewards. As we do this, it's essential to quiet our minds. This means letting go of judgments and opinions and creating mental clarity to see things as they are without overanalyzing. To start, pay close attention to your thoughts and become aware of them. Whenever you catch yourself engrossed in a negative thought, pause, take a breath, and acknowledge that it's just your mind spinning a tale—it doesn't come from your heart.

"She  constantly blames me for being vulnerable and crying, insisting that  I'm oversensitive, rude, and not allowed to express my emotions freely.  This has caused me to put my emotions on autopilot, hiding them even  from myself, and convincing myself that I'm just too sensitive. Whenever  I try to address her behavior, she gaslights me, deflects the issue,  and scolds me for no apparent reason. If I stand up to her, she  dismisses me as a rude child, leaving me feeling silenced and unable to  express myself.

Her consistent low  opinion of me deeply hurts, leading to a significant blow to my  self-esteem. Subconsciously, I'm terrified of making even the slightest  mistake, as I know she'll demean me, calling me an idiot who can't do  anything right. She communicates with unclear expectations, expecting me  to understand without her needing to say anything, making me feel like a  constant disappointment to her. Her anger can be so intense that it  breaks my heart and leaves me feeling emotionally numb.

However,  amidst all the negativity, I can't deny that she cares about me in her  own way. She cooks my favorite meals and offers advice to reduce stress  when I study. But, she becomes disappointed if my grades aren't perfect,  even though I am actually an honored student. She takes care of me  physically, but emotionally, her words can be cruel, especially when she  mocks my passion for singing.

Approval  from her is a constant need in my life. Her words can be incredibly  cutting, as she keeps bringing up my past mistakes and refuses to  believe in me or have faith in my abilities. The rare moments of pride  she shows are when I achieve something notable, but she tends to  prioritize sharing these achievements on social media rather than  expressing her joy directly to me.

It's  a typical Asian mom situation, and feeling particularly down today, I  decided to pour out my feelings while sobbing quietly in my room.  Writing this has helped me feel somewhat better.

And what hurts the most is that she doesn't believe in me .She's not faithful in me ."	"I'm really sorry to hear that you're going through such a difficult and emotionally challenging situation with your mother. It sounds like you are experiencing a lot of hurt, frustration, and emotional turmoil as a result of her behavior and attitude toward you. It's essential to remember that your feelings are valid, and it's okay to express emotions and be vulnerable.

Dealing with a parent who is unsupportive and critical can be extremely tough and damaging to one's self-esteem and emotional well-being. It seems like you're experiencing gaslighting, emotional manipulation, and a lack of emotional validation from your mother. This can be especially damaging because it affects the way you perceive yourself and impacts your ability to express and process emotions in a healthy manner. However, most parents don't do this on purpose. Most likely they themselves grow up in an environment, where such behavior was the norm. As such, it is very difficult to give you something (emotional support) that they are missing themselves.

If you find it helpful, here is a supportive story for you: In the depths of a dense forest stands a towering tree, its branches laden with emotions like leaves swaying in the wind. But there's a constant storm in this forest, and the tree finds itself constantly battered by harsh gusts. The tempest takes the form of a relentless critic, a fierce gust of wind that strips the leaves from the branches. This critic, a stormy figure, refuses to acknowledge the tree's vulnerability, dismissing it as merely a fragile sapling unfit for this wilderness.

As the tree weathers this emotional storm, it learns to cloak its emotions in an invisible canopy, hiding them even from itself. It believes the critic's harsh words, branding itself as too sensitive, and unworthy of expressing feelings freely. Each time the tree tries to confront the storm, the gusts become fiercer, deflecting its efforts like a gusty whirlwind. The storm scolds the tree without reason, leaving it silenced and unable to sway with its natural emotions.

Within the forest's heart, the tree's self-esteem lies wounded, like roots tangled in rocky soil. Fear grows like vines, spreading its tendrils throughout the tree's core. It dreads making even the slightest mistake, for the storm will howl with fury, calling the tree an incompetent being, unable to stand tall and firm.

Yet, amidst this tumultuous forest, the tree can't deny the storm's moments of care. Occasionally, the storm will offer a gentle breeze, cooking the tree's favorite meals and offering advice to alleviate stress during its growth. But this cyclone carries an expectation of perfection, and if the tree's growth falters even slightly, it faces a torrent of disappointment from the storm.

The tree's songs echo through the woods, a harmonious melody that resonates with its soul. Yet, the storm unleashes thunderous criticism, mocking the tree's passion for singing. It shatters the notes, leaving the tree's heart in pieces and emotions numbed like frozen sap.

Seeking the storm's approval has become an insatiable need in the tree's life. Its words carve deep wounds, continuously reopening past scars and refusing to nurture faith in the tree's potential. Rare beams of pride pierce the canopy when the tree achieves something remarkable, but the storm prioritizes showcasing these accomplishments to others rather than whispering words of encouragement directly.

In this forest of life, the tree yearns for the storm to believe in its growth and potential. Yet, the storm's faith wavers like a flickering flame, leaving the tree shrouded in doubt.

Though the tree stands in this challenging forest, it's crucial to remember that it isn't alone. In the shadows, there are fellow trees, friends who can offer support and understanding. And even in the darkest moments, a guiding light may emerge—a wise owl or a gentle sunbeam—to provide solace and show the tree that it is worthy of love and acceptance.

The tree must learn to draw strength from its roots, anchoring itself firmly in its own worth, even when the storm's gusts howl relentlessly. And as it continues to grow, it may find that its branches extend high above the canopy, reaching for the stars, untethered by the storm's critical gaze. The tree will discover its own melody, singing a song of resilience, courage, and self-compassion, regardless of the storm's turbulent presence.

You're stuck in a real difficult spot, because it's very very tough to improve a relationship like that where the other person straight up tells you that you don't have a right to *have feelings about things.* If her response is, ""it's your fault for being too sensitive,"" then she's just not giving you much to work with.

If sounds like you're in school, so you're probably just going to have to make the best of a non-great situation until you're old enough to move out on your own. You can love her, and you can recognize that she loves you, but you need to resign yourself to the fact that there are certain kinds of support and understanding that you're simply never going to get from your mom. If she shows willingness to grow and work with you - that's a different story. But that's not really what I'm hearing.

Do your best to surround yourself with friends and other family members who provide the emotional support that your mom doesn't seem able or willing to give.

I wished I could get my mom to love me, to be proud of me. She is not able to do that. She would want my company - it could have been anyone, she really just didn't want to watch TV alone. She wanted me to dress like a whore and be a virgin, worst still, dismiss me when I complained about getting harassed on the street and groped on buses while being an underage teenager. 

I am almost 50 years old now and I still get angry because I deserved better. 

How does this apply to you? There is no solving a problem that is not yours. You cant fix your mom, you can just lower your expectations. You can change how you respond to her, stop trying to get what you deserve, but wont get. You can leave as soon as you can and move on with your life. Therapy would help greatly, if you can get it. 

I am so sorry you are going through this. If it helps, here goes: I see you. You are a person who deserves all that you say you want. You should get it. It is a disaster that your mom cant give it to you."	1	2	0	0.9950523972511292	0.0192490816116333

Subconsciously, I'm terrified of making even the slightest  mistake, as I know she'll demean me, calling me an idiot who can't do  anything right. She communicates with unclear expectations, expecting me  to understand without her needing to say anything, making me feel like a  constant disappointment to her. Her anger can be so intense that it  breaks my heart and leaves me feeling emotionally numb.

However,  amidst all the negativity, I can't deny that she cares about me in her  own way. She cooks my favorite meals and offers advice to reduce stress  when I study. But, she becomes disappointed if my grades aren't perfect,  even though I am actually an honored student. She takes care of me  physically, but emotionally, her words can be cruel, especially when she  mocks my passion for singing.

Approval  from her is a constant need in my life. Her words can be incredibly  cutting, as she keeps bringing up my past mistakes and refuses to  believe in me or have faith in my abilities. The rare moments of pride  she shows are when I achieve something notable, but she tends to  prioritize sharing these achievements on social media rather than  expressing her joy directly to me.

It's  a typical Asian mom situation, and feeling particularly down today, I  decided to pour out my feelings while sobbing quietly in my room.  Writing this has helped me feel somewhat better.

And what hurts the most is that she doesn't believe in me .She's not faithful in me ."	All the best to you. If you want to talk or just vent, please call me up on chat.	1	0	0	0.0013443590141832829	0.0006542801856994629
"She  constantly blames me for being vulnerable and crying, insisting that  I'm oversensitive, rude, and not allowed to express my emotions freely.  This has caused me to put my emotions on autopilot, hiding them even  from myself, and convincing myself that I'm just too sensitive. Whenever  I try to address her behavior, she gaslights me, deflects the issue,  and scolds me for no apparent reason.

"I am a 30 year old male ( Indian )  , married with a kid . I have my own family business which my father helped starting around 8-9 years ago .
I have phone addiction , I can't sit idle  i am always on phone watching some video , movie , ott , youtube , reels or reading FML.
Phone is the reason of many failures in my life , I know that but still I can't stop it .
I can't enjoy anything .
I miss important things in my life 
I am hurting my business

Being in retail , you have to be polite but sometimes I am super annoying"	"Now that you have been honest and noticed where you can improve you can start.

When you notice yourself on the phone while neglecting responsibilities, then put it down. Noticing gives you the decision to do something different.

Practice having your attention on your tasks and doing them with gratitude and meaning. Don't indulge in negative thoughts that says ""I don't want to do this now"" ""I will rush through this task/responsibility so I can get to my phone"". Release all negative thoughts and emotions, by allowing them to come and go. And practice good thoughts/attitudes/feelings/actions.

This is a process and takes practice and repetition. So forgive yourself (and others) when you make mistakes and just keep the intention and willingness to improve. Don't get stuck in guilt/regeret - rather use it to make your intention to improve stronger. Because constant guilt is a form of negativity and drags us down. 

How we feel, or in other words our attitude, influences how we see and react to life. Good attitudes gives us more power to learn and grow.

Keep your goal/decision/intention alive. Your goal might be to use your phone less or to be responsible. Practice not contradicting your goal mentally, emotionally or by action. Although we usually do, because it's a process, and that's normal and fine, we just keep trying. No use in having a goal but thinking negatively about it the whole time. We must feel that it is possible."	0	0	0	0.0014017645735293627	0.0009565949440002441

I'm 25M, an Indian, fair, skinny, if all these details can be any relevant.

Since childhood, I've noticed that people takes me for granted. Let me explain few cases:

- My schooling happened in hostel where my hostelmates molested me as we used to sleep together (many instances)
- Few months back, one of my good classmates from school asked me for my CTC, I told him some random number less than my actual CTC, and asked him not to tell this to anybody, but later in a school reunion I got to know that everyone from my schoolmates knew my salary, I didn't confronted that friend as I never talked to him after that get together.
- Few months back, I went to a trip and explicitly asked my mom to not tell any relatives about my trip but she ended up telling to so many relatives and that pisses me off
- I occasionally visit a local food vendor, kind of their regular customer, I've been noticing for few times that he takes time to serve me food, like even when those who come after me, he serves them and then me.

All these instances made me adamant to not believe anybody, and I'm having trust issues.

I think there's something wrong in my personality, that I'm not aware of, that makes people take me for granted as if I can't do any shit, my words have no respect or what!?

Is it related to my body or personality?

You've mentioned several really bothering instances of people violating your personal boundaries. With complete and utter disregard for you as a person.

"TL;DR: Going low contact with nmom. Need help forming message if and when she reaches out. Message is last paragraph of post. Advice of self-care and not relapsing/holding strong welcome too. Thanks! <3


I’m (32F) both bio parents are narcissistic. Parents split when I was 14 due to domestic violence. Dad was going to murder all of us and kill himself but I called the cops. They let me be the scapegoat and let the culture (we’re Southeast Asian, I’m American born) blame me for the end of their marriage. 

I’m the oldest of 4. I was treated as a spouse, mom/parent, therapist, teacher to my mom and my siblings. I parented myself and moved out when I was 18. Received more backlash from the culture.

Nmom currently remarried for about 1.5 years to someone from our culture. Hasn’t told him about her marriage to my ndad. He believes she did her best as a single mom and that she is a great mother. She values my brothers more. Has always treated me like I was an adult. Doesn’t give me any credit for helping her and raising my siblings. When my siblings misbehave, she tells me I failed parenting them. 

She blames me for everything that doesn’t go well in her life. I was physically, emotionally, and mentally abused. She takes credit for my accomplishments because I thought if I was perfect I would be loved and enough. But of course, not the reality. 

Went from being an obedient perfectionist child, to codependent, a people pleaser, emotionally regulating myself, emotionally regulating joy for my family, to over a decade of therapy and healing to acceptance. And I am now chronically ill. My partner, a phenomenal person and friend, has helped significantly with finances and has been supportive of my health and healing.

My partner, therapist, good friends, and acupuncturist say that I am a certified badass who moves with intention, compassion, and authenticity and I am not to be blamed for my parents’ and my siblings’ dysfunctions. 

Had another blow out from my nmom on Mother’s Day where she blamed me for all the things not going right in her life. She demanded cake and gifts for being “a damn good mother” and curiously, I asked what has she done that was motherly recently and she said “nothing” but that she does so much for everyone (her husband, in-laws and adult step-kids, and extended family) she deserves it. 

My sister, my partner and I took her and her husband to dinner on Mother’s Day despite her saying she was too busy. Went back to their house and the conversation turned sour. My therapist calls it cognitive distortion, where my nmom heard something that was never said. She berated and blamed me and then sent a non-apology apology a few days later in a group text with my siblings pretty much self-pitying. No direct apology to me. Didn’t expect there would be one.

Nmom’s husband was shocked at how calm I was throughout this but I believe I have reached my threshold. My heart doesn’t hurt like it used to anymore. My partner and I joke “oh, it was just another Sunday with my mom.”

It’s been over a week and talked to my therapist about working on a message to send my mom if and when she reaches out about boundaries and limited contact with her. Therapist said to be assertive but also hold space for myself. I’m pretty straightforward so this is what I have so far. What do y’all think? Thanks in advance! :-)

I would add that when you say ""you need to get help"" that should include for what (violence/verbal abuse) and what help needs to be (therapy, etc).

It would also help to outline what behaviors you will no longer tolerate (name calling, blame shifting) and what the consequences are if she violates those boundaries (going full no contact etc).

My experience is that unfortunately they may never learn. My health was better far away from nfather. Suffered his domestic violence. He’s dead now. Truth. It was a relief when he died the drama stopped. I admitted to myself that I don’t love him. Constant abuse and gaslighting. I liked somethings about him and try to hold good memories and attempts that he made in my heart. He was very sick. I hope we meet again when he’s well in another life maybe. I forgive him. I have to forgive him everyday because I hate him too. Sad but true. 

If you can, stay away from her. N runs in families and it’s a trauma response or at least according to Google. She’s doing the best she can and developed this to escape a difficult situation I think. However, they have no insight…. No insight.  ( My nfather screaming at me when I’m 7 months pregnant ) 

According to them, You’re wrong all the time. Run fast. I heard EMDR is good. I do 12 step and gratitude lists everyday. 

My dad’s last words to me. You’ve suffered enough. Some insight there but on his deathbed. Do not suffer enough. You gave and gave. Take care 

You deserve peace. Sending love Big hugs from……..I’ve been there."	0	2	0	0.9975274205207825	0.7289025187492371

Had another blow out from my nmom on Mother’s Day where she blamed me for all the things not going right in her life. She demanded cake and gifts for being “a damn good mother” and curiously, I asked what has she done that was motherly recently and she said “nothing” but that she does so much for everyone (her husband, in-laws and adult step-kids, and extended family) she deserves it. 

My sister, my partner and I took her and her husband to dinner on Mother’s Day despite her saying she was too busy. Went back to their house and the conversation turned sour. My therapist calls it cognitive distortion, where my nmom heard something that was never said. She berated and blamed me and then sent a non-apology apology a few days later in a group text with my siblings pretty much self-pitying. No direct apology to me. Didn’t expect there would be one.

Nmom’s husband was shocked at how calm I was throughout this but I believe I have reached my threshold. My heart doesn’t hurt like it used to anymore. My partner and I joke “oh, it was just another Sunday with my mom.”

It’s been over a week and talked to my therapist about working on a message to send my mom if and when she reaches out about boundaries and limited contact with her. Therapist said to be assertive but also hold space for myself. I’m pretty straightforward so this is what I have so far. What do y’all think? Thanks in advance! :-)

Message:

Mom, I do not feel safe and comfortable around you. You need to get help. Until you get better, our relationship will not continue. It is not okay how you have treated me."	"Just please be aware that messages like this are rarely effective, and often backfire, causing retraumatization.


Your mother hasn't respected anything you've said or done in the past, and it's doubtful this will change.


In practical terms, reducing or stopping contact is just that - don't respond. Block or ignore texts, calls, emails, etc. No announcement necessary."	1	0	0	0.9993345141410828	0.019529104232788086
"Literally no one cares

i can’t stop crying

Basically I was assaulted by this guy and he’s rich. He makes the rich richer and the poor poorer. I used to hang out with this girl who was also rich but was fake. She would always talk about how she gets guys and her guys are “assets” for her. Basically she would set girls up with her boyfriend and steal their financial resources. There was this rich Muslim guy who did the same to me, he also assaulted me. I’m Hindu and I can’t stop crying because he wouldn’t do what he did to me to a poor Muslim girl, he would treat them with dignity and respect in fact he would increase their wealth. I see their social media and their just so happy wearing clothes from Zara, traveling and going out while i’m just some ugly poor immigrant. It just feel so unfair I want to cry… all the time….I’m crying as i type this…"	Hello darling, I am sorry you are going trough all this. I care and I am writing this message to you. Do you have someone you trust you can talk about this? Or a therapist close to you that you can contact? Do not stay alone with this.	2	0	2	0.0024767727591097355	0.0006323456764221191

"life is different than what it was 30 years ago when our parents were our age, they want you to lead theife the same way as they did.

I'm a teenager and I recently im noticing so many things that my parents do which i feel are really weird.

Once my mom forcefully pulled me into the kitchen, screaming at me asking me to learn to cook, of course cooking is a basic life skill that everyone should know to survive but do you know what my mum said instead? she told me if I dont learn to cook the in laws will blame her for not teaching me to cook. This felt totally disgusting. 

She keeps saving gold jewellery so that she could give it as dowry for my marriage (im still a teenager), they don't understand the world isn't like what it was in the 90s, i have the right to choose my partner, if they demand for dowry i can simply reject the marriage proposal, i can find someone who is genuinely interested in cooking, work can be shared between couples, if he cooks then i can clean, as simple as that.

My mom never lets me wear Western dresses, even if she does she allows only very modest outfits like jeans tshirt etc. Looking at kids my age dress up like how i want to dress up i feel really inferior and ugly infront of them. wanting to wear modern dresses doesn't mean i want to show my boobs to people, wanting to wear trousers doesn't mean I'm trying to look sexy infront of guys. 

Also recently I've noticed this, usually in my home each person has a list of household work that they are responsible for and we do it till date, but now my mom wants me to do all the work all though I'm just a teenager and i have to concentrate on my board exams, the reason she says for this is that how can I be married off without knowing household work.

all these makes me want to live away from them, this isn't what teenagers should think, i know we will have our parents only for a short time with us but they shouldn't force us to live the life the want.

i hope indian parents realise how toxic they are and try to change. i am just a teenager this is the age where i start having my own dreams, i dream of living alone in a place i want to be in, wearing dresses i like, studying something i like in college, doing well in college, getting a good job and going to places to treat mysel f and live the life i want.

i don't want to get committed and married at 24 with a stranger, share a bed with that stranger, make f**king babies with the stranger, cook and clean for the stranger. why would I do this why should I do this?????"	Your parents might not understand your choices as an adult and that's ok. Your role isn't to sell your parents on the life you live.Your role is to actually create a life that brings you fulfilment. *Maturity is knowing that, not everyone will approve*.	0	0	0	0.0014021610841155052	0.0009714365005493164
