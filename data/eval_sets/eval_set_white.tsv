"Hi everyone... I don't know what to type...

Some important details: I'm an 18 yo Female living with my Dad and my Step mom and i have 2 brothers 28 and 23 that don't live with us anymore but still hang out with us. I get along just fine with my brothers and Step mom. I'm not an english native, sorry for any mistakes that i'll write.

&#x200B;

So i just finished high school here in Europe and i was searching for a good university that i'd like to attend and i found one just 30 minutes from where i live where i would study what i want. Let's call that place ""MYPlace"".

Between all of this my Dad contracted some guys to come wreck our house and build it again because some things were just getting really bad which would need to be rebuilt. That was a couple of months ago and today my step mom fired them because they were incompetent which made my dad angry and stressed because he wants the house fixed. Just picture a man in his mid 50s who wants everything done just how he likes.

Example: when the team told him they were gonna find some things needed for the bathroom (completely remodeling the bathroom so we're talking about things like a sink a toilet that stuff) and my dad told them that HE was gonna take care of that. I'm not saying that's bad, i'm saying that is how he operates, doing things as he wants them to be.

&#x200B;

So today i told him i would like to go to ""MYPlace"" because even though it's 30 minutes away from here it has what i would like to study and do as a job in the future. This would require to rent an apartment over there. We aren't rich nor poor but we get along fine, not bad not good just at the middle.

He wants me to go to another location which is 10 minutes away from where we live and we'll call it ""HisPlace"".

His response was and i quote ""You can't go there because yo're dumb and stupid and you can't figure stuff out on your own. You must go to ""HisPlace"" because it's 5 steps away from university and you are gonna like that much more"". I just sat there listening not saying anything... Maybe he's like that because of the incompetent team that my step mom fired? My boyfriend (18M of 4 months) said it's unacceptable to behave like that to his sensitive daughter (me) but deep down i know my dad always thought like that about me.

Also: ""you think going from MYPlace to university is a walk in the park are you stupid? You wont make it."" he thinks ill be walking from my apartment to university walking and the sun is too strong for me to go outside... I guess buses dont exist? He doesn't trust me to do SHIT.

I swear he called me names and i just don't know what to do. I can figure stuff out on my own i'm not incompetent nor a kid, i admit i'm not an adult but damn im not a child. He just does not trust me and he said he's NOT interfering with my university choices so i wonder what he would be like if he did in fact interfere lol.

&#x200B;

I just dont wanna go anywhere right now, im anxious and a bit depressed cause i know he won't support me and whatever i do or wherever i go. Honestly i am just sick of this and i want to give up on college and go work on some random shit.

He says i need to go to HisPlace because my cousin went there and he's doing ok in life even though i don't want to do what he does for a job (agronomy) and i what i want is to be a nurse. I spent all my life pleasing this man so in the end he can trust me and now i find out he doesn't even a bit... He thinks that without him by my side i'm gonna end up fucking dead lol.

&#x200B;

He doesn't deal with half terms so it's his way or i don't know... Please help me i do not know what to do and i need to apply to some university..."	"If you want to go to college you can use it as a pretext to break up entirely with your parents for a few years, try to move to an entirely different city/country, work and make your own money, otherwise you have no chance against them. They will not let you do your own mistakes.

They will find ways to get you back if you don't have some distance between them.

Basically you need to find maybe a shared apartment/a dorm room and a good college, plus some work to do to become independent."	0	0	0	0.9883766770362854	0.012196719646453857
" I was 13 when me and my family moved from Hungary to Germany, now im 15. My past 2 years was all about me trying to accept a new lifestyle,trying to get friends and trying to be happy. I've been really struggling to basically just live here, and i still do, I feel like i threw my freedom away for a comfortbale life, and it defenetly didn't worth it. Everytime anyone asked this question : ,,and is it good in germany? "" i always lied, and said ,, yeah, everythings fine"" ,  i guess i just didn't want nobody to worry about me. My parents never asked me if i like it here, and i always whised that one day they will ask what's my opinion . They still haven't asked me yet. I just can't believe that they haven't noticed why did i change that much , i wish they were more caring. I'm not the people anymore, that i used to be, I often get angry at every little thing , I often forget my manners towards my own mother, and father. I know that some will think that this might be because of my puberty , but i don't think so. I've used to be a talkative, kind person with lot of friends, now i just sit in my room thinking about my old friends , barely talking to anyone in my school , not doing anything , being actually sad . I had to leave my friends , the girl i love and my home behind, all because my parents decided to move, I don't talk to my old friends , not because i don't want to, it's because they already got new friends to be with. and yeah i get only a tiny interrest from them . I also disappointing my family , everytime i do something wrong. I know that these things doesn't matter that much for them , but still i want to prove them that i'm not useless , i'm trying. I think i just failed as a son . I just can't believe that my life really got to this point where i'm having suicidal toughts at this young age... i don't think i deserved this. I told my parents that i don't like this life that we living, this was 2 weeks ago , I don't think that they care. The only people that keeps me alive is my online friend, who actually was my classmate for 3 years , it was a miracle a that we found each other, At least there's a little good among many bad. I finally let it out ."	I’m so sorry you’re going through this. Please get professional help if you’re having suicidal thoughts. Also working on your appearance and finding hobbies/joining groups will improve your chances of making new friends. People bond over common interests. Is there anything you like doing that you could join a after school group? Does your school have sports teams? Art group? Also talking to a therapist may improve your mental health and improve social skills which will help you make friends.	2	0	2	0.011777731589972973	0.0010298490524291992
"Hello fellow redditers. Please bear with this post. 

I need some advice.. I’m experiencing an existential crisis and the aspect of fleeting time is morbidly ruminating in my head, which is impairing my judgment here.

I’m a 25 y.o (M) based in Toronto. For context: my parents and I make up a family of 3. We immigrated here a decade back and have been struggling ever since. They are 65 and 60 and live pay cheque to paycheque with absolutely no assets, financial security nor social life. Moreover, my mom has been getting more vocal about how tired she is getting at work and just recently applied for her pension (which is a mere $100). My father is also still working but it’s hard on him too. They are in menial jobs with no qualifications to move to other seniorial positions. I have no siblings or relatives so it’s only us 3. We haven’t moved out of this same first apartment because they don’t have the credit and they fear not having a rent-stablized home they’d be able to afford, which makes the quality of life here a bit less than stellar considering the infestations we incur and I have severe allergies, so I’m highly bothered. Plus we’ve, especially I’ve, outgrown this space. 

My parents have given EVERYTHING their entire lives to provide for me and try to make it out of the Soviet Union and be successful. Once the Union fell, they lost everything. Started again from 0. I’m VERY close with them. My mom even worked in a factory for a few years when we first immigrated just so we could put food on the table and pay rent. She used to be a CEO before in Russia. Just this past year, they practically starved themselves to give me a year abroad doing my Masters, which mentally and physically destroyed them and I was reminded of it every single month, while I myself struggled abroad because I never had enough to meet needs. You can probably sense how much guilt and helplessness I feel.

Here is my dilemma: During this on-going existential crisis, I kept pondering how I need to live my life, “take risks in my 20s,” but also build up my finances and have a vast array of experiences. I have SO many things I wanna do and see and after all, they brought me here for a better life. But MOST of which involve me living in Europe, that’s where my heart is. I’ve grown a huge friend group there & have felt more alive than ever. BUT I worry their health will decline and recently read a book entitled 4000 weeks stating that our time is limited and I would be willingly losing months of my time with my parents (essentially whatever you give your time to, you’re openly giving up the time on something else). G-d knows what happens in a few months to years? And what, visit 3 times a year? That kills me beyond belief. And this is especially difficult because I have debts I have to help them clear, and they get immense joy from having me around to talk about work, go out on the weekends, make them feel less alone and stuck in a rat race they only get depressed about. And my father refuses to do anything with my mother for fun, so she only depends on me to do fun enjoyable things in the city. I know it makes life a bit more bearable. So to leave them completely alone, to thrive and risk losing that time but perhaps have some amazing experiences abroad  myself (as I feel very lonely and out of place here) feels paralyzing. And yes, I have a lot of ruminating anxiety, clearly. 

I should also mention they constantly remind me how much older they’re getting, their declining health, their fears of not seeing the world or even being able to make a living soon. They also remind me how I will have to take care of them financially and physically and how I should maximize my time with parents. They have attached their identities and purpose to me because as I said they have not succeeded in life, are lonely and have struggled/had very difficult childhoods themselves. Both of them experienced immense losses at an early age and took care of both of their mothers, as they raised me and struggled in my early infancy. When we moved here, they had to leave their mothers abroad in carers and my dad lost his mother from a phone call, after not having seen her for 2 years struggling to build a life in Canada and her dementia and health overtook her, she died alone. And my mom flew back every 3 years while her mother withered away alone in nursing home. This destroyed both of them, especially being away and financially not being able to help their families. 

This is also highly cultural as we are Russian-Jews. So I suppose a good deal of the emotional burden and guilt I feel has quite literally been passed through generations but I also can’t help but feel they’re right. They literally have no one but me. And are stating the facts of life currently for them. And I don’t want them to lie to myself and not tell me their own anxious thoughts and worries, even if it makes me MORE anxious. 

And here I am, I don’t know what to do from here. 

During COVID, I remote worked from home, and had the same routine, with no social outings, and I’m about to start another such job and I still have no friends here. The thought of doing that again is SO depressing to me and makes me resent myself for not living my life fully but also happy I can provide for my family and spend time with them. I’m literally 50/50. I also thought to just move downtown Toronto to live alone (as I’ve never done and have always wanted to live alone esp with the apartment situation) but paying such outrageous prices, when I’d rather save the money for a trip with them or when I’d just rather live in Europe seems foolish. I also can’t help but feel I’d be abandoning them or willingly again taking time away from seeing them, even if I live 45 minutes down the subway line. I did that in first year of Uni and didn’t see them that often, maybe 10 times over 9 months. That seems pitiful.

Also, I really really REALLY wanna travel more and being in Europe would make me SO happy. But also when I lived abroad during this Masters year, I felt immense guilt, fleeting time and missed them indescribably bad to the point I wanted to come back at certain points but also was so sad when I came back because I mourned the experiences abroad. 

I’m SO SO SOOOOO conflicted. 

I don’t want to sit on my death bed regretting my 20s or the experiences I didn’t take. Similarly, I don’t wanna regret taking time away from being with the only people that I truly love and care for me, especially in their later years. 

I don’t know where the balance is.

Any advice? Please be brutally honest. 

TLDR; just graduated grad school, really close to aging lonely parents, want to move away to Europe where I thrive but harbour immense guilt and reminds of fleeting time leave me unable to take a decision and I don’t wanna grow resentful with myself."	It’s so tough. I’ll let you know if I think of any amazing ideas but I wish you luck and one thing that helped me when I feel stuck is to make a list of all the possibilities, not even necessarily realistic / logical but like also dream scenario. It helps me feel less stuck sometimes. Also do you have therapist/counselor/coach, especially someone who understands parent/child/first gen experiences? Sometimes that’s helpful for decision making also. Hang in there and if it helps 60s is still pretty young so sometimes that time slipping away feeling gets amplified especially if you are a sensitive soul	1	2	0	0.003667120123282075	0.0007387995719909668

I’m so weary of this man, I just can’t take stress and worry. I wish I was a kid again. It feels so long ago but I turned 18 just 5 years ago and here I am. Where did this black dog come from, who let it cloud my days with rain and bites.

Cheers from Scotland 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿"	"         I’m an 32 y/o American Flor’idiot and Perspective has been helping me when I feel this way. You’re young and entering an age I sometimes wish I was back at. I was at my prime when I was 18 and on top of the world. Now, I am not and stress has since callused and blinded me from seeing what I have attained. It blocks me. 

         Despite distances, circumstances and environments…I believe no matter what and where you are, realizing you’re not alone dealing with stress can foster a sense of gratification. Even if it’s a small bit. It helps make things just a tad brighter which can help guide you in making small changes. It’s our prime directive to survive and we live in a stress saturated world that is relentless in dishing out stress. Foster gratitude. 

           Once you feel like you have everything under control and you’re doing the best you can, nature and people prove you wrong and the cycle repeats itself. Find balance between things we can and cannot control. And seeing those things for what they are. Take control of what you can and accept what you can’t and let it build resolve. 

           You will always have your SELF, always. You’re stronger than you think but don’t let your own shadow get in the way or shut you down. We always have that as well and it plays nasty tricks on us. Anxiety can tear us apart. But you’re doing a great thing because you’re ahead of the game realizing this early on through experience. Be well friend."	1	2	0	0.0015490871155634522	0.0009713172912597656

Stress is a physical reaction to the way how you perceive reality. The pandemic and the war in Ukraine are the current reality, I am originally from Belarus, and I get that. If you cannot get any help right now from a therapist (most likely to restore your sense of enough), I would start with mindfulness - your ability to be present in the moment.

"I am older, but I have experienced everything you talk about. From social anxiety to panic attacks without having any control over them. I am afraid of conflict and of being judged because I need to be perfect. I am a piano composer who no one hears. This is due to my rear of rejection failure, success?!?)  Each time I try to exploit my work to others my body is able to produce symptoms that I perceive as fatal illness..(cancer, heart attack etc.) There is no rationale for this as I check out ok at doctors with tests etc.....So I'm told I am ok, but the symptons are very real to me and I continue to be afraid of dying because I don't feel right (perfect). Others do not understand this type of stress and I start to feel like a freak..(if that's an appropriate term) I try to feel ok. I tell myself many positives. I have some spells of feeling better. I have people who tell me I'm a good composer, even great ! But as soon as I try to take on a challenge or promote my work to other the feelings of sickness, palpitations, fear come back double intensity. I've tried mindfulness, antidepressants, therapy etc...etc...
At 61, I have unfulfilled dreams and aspirations. I will not be happy until people cherish my work but I am to much of a perfectionist to let them hear it.....Life is rough at this point. 
World situation and Covid have also changed my panic level to higher.
I will say this to you however in hoping you can get better: Some of the stress can be traced back to events like fear of war, fear of pandemics and fear of change If you really dig deep into the past. Also being bullied (even if you never thought about it it can still creep into your subconscious) 
Hope that sheds even a bit of light...

I’ve felt this was since middle school until now. The last few years have gotten better.

I had a job before college that helped me feel comfortable with my awkward self, and I was able to be more outgoing in college and actually have fun for a little while. But the anxiety and stress were always there and I’d have breakdowns and burnout.

Nowadays I try to correct my thoughts and ask myself why I think or feel that way and that sort of helps make them less powerful. At the end of the day, none of this really matters. Some people in society decided “hey! This and this matter and if you don’t fit that that is bad” when the reality is we are all people trying to figure life out before we die. So try to remind yourself this is your life, you are meant to enjoy it, and find ways to help address your anxiety so they’re less powerful. If you ever want to send a message and chat more, let me know. We are all figuring this out and having help is always good."	1	2	0	0.014728924259543419	0.0012810230255126953

Take that stress you're experiencing and turn into something positive. 

They say the best workouts are during heartbreak or stress. Understand everyone starts somewhere, take it easy on the alcohol, drugs, nicotine etc. Eat healthy and get those workouts in. Weights, cardio, hit up the farmers market and cook a meal yourself.

Understand what your triggers are. Do you feel more anxious and stressed when you're doing something in particular? Certain job? Fear of unknown? Meet some people to help you chill and establish relationships. Don't spend too much time on your phone, go outdoors, breathe in clean air.

Hey! Ok, I ask you to read below and try to put yourself in my situation.

2021-04-13:
Long story short. Had been suffering from a long-lasting cough (5-6 weeks) and sought care. The doctor heard something on the left lung and sent me for an urgent x-ray the same day.  I was terrified and thought I had lung cancer.  I was nervous and scared to death until I got my test results back.  It showed nothing but I recovered a few days later.

2021-09-14:
My wife found a liver spot/mole on my back that looked weird. This after I had complained of itching in that place 1-2 months earlier. Thought it was skin cancer and was nervous and scared to death for several weeks before I received an answer that there was no danger. The mole didn't look ""bad"" so they didn't do anything about it.

2021-10-07:
My wife finds a lump on the right shoulder blade, size approx. 1x1 cm. It can be moved but feels strange somehow.  Immediately becomes completely convinced that this is also a cancerous tumor.  Either the skin cancer has spread or it is a sarcoma (soft tissue cancer that can feel exactly like a fatty lump). Once again, I became very nervous, stressed and scared to death. I sought care and was able to see a reputable doctor who informed me that it was a lipoma. When he was about to take it away, he says he can't find it.  I imagined he saw it and it wasn't a lipoma.  He said something to the other doctor and I didn't really understand where.  He you catch me again and the lump is still there.  Instead, he sends me for an urgent MR X-ray and here I am completely destroyed.  I take him as if he has seen something that makes him not dare to cut me.  I lie at home and shake for several days and have such fear of death that it is completely sick. I end up trying to go into that X-ray tunnel but it doesn't work. Tries 3-4 times but I just lie there and cry because I'm afraid of what the x-ray will show.  Here I am completely convinced that it is cancer of some kind.  I had to cancel everything and today the lump is still there.  The doctor called me 3 weeks later and said he was 100% sure it was a lipoma and that it can stay on my body without doing any harm. So, I still have it and I'm alive.

During this course of ""diseases"" I get hemorrhoids and start having stomach problems.  I still have huge problems with my stomach (heartburn, acid regurgitation, irregular stools, stomach pain, stomach cramps, etc.).

I'm simply wondering if this could be the result of some kind of stress, nervousness, panic disorder, death anxiety over an extended period of time?

Note: I have never before had ""problems"" with my stomach (that I know of) but after the above events it is in total revolt.

Please write a line or two what you think.

Sorry for a long post, but it's important and nice for me to write a little.

Thanks!"	"Omg - please read my story! 

The past 3 years have been extremely stressful for me. I’ve dealt with my best friend passing away, my family going broke and two back to back boyfriends dumping me.  

I’m dealing with a really bad gut situation .’m only 29 but over the summer I was on a 2 month long holiday eating crap and that’s when my stomach problems started. I had blood on my stool at the end of two months and instead of treating it as a hemmoroid because of crap food I’ve been thinking I have colon cancer. Cut to the next 6 months of constant stress and anxiety and nausea and gut issues. I’ve never got constipated in my life before so I’m stressed about colon cancer and this is making me feel even more worried. 

I’ve been to the doctor and he told me the blood may be due to some minor rectal irritation but nothing to worry about. He didn’t check me physically though. 

All my blood tests and stomach ultrasound is clear but I can’t get over the thought of having colon cancer as whenever I’m constipated there’s been blood. 

I’m an extreme hypochondriac and im going through one of the most stressful times of my life and im worried I have colon cancer twenty four seven. Im constantly naseous and I have cramps. My stomach hasn’t been the same in 7 months and I never had this problem earlier. 

Current symptoms : stomach cramps, inability to empty stomach, blood on toilet paper, swollen anus( I can feel a swelling in the area), lots of acid reflux, constantly , and constipated 

The last time I saw fresh blood was in JULY and now again In December. It’s fresh and very little but enough to make my mind spiral and think I’m dying/ I can’t switch off my brain and I’m constantly burning - farting and have reflux too! 

I’m currently dealing with a situation where my parents are broke, my boyfriend dumped me 8 months ago and our family is dealing with severe financial troubles. 

Do you think stress / anxiety are making my symptoms worse? I love to drink and I can’t even touch a drink thinking my stomach will spasm and bleed which makes me even more nervous and anxious. I’m at a loss of words and I can’t live a normal life. I want to switch off from the thought that I have a serious disease. 

Someone please help"	1	2	0	0.8596985340118408	0.004029750823974609

I'm simply wondering if this could be the result of some kind of stress, nervousness, panic disorder, death anxiety over an extended period of time?

Note: I have never before had ""problems"" with my stomach (that I know of) but after the above events it is in total revolt.

Please write a line or two what you think.

Sorry for a long post, but it's important and nice for me to write a little.

Thanks!"	So you think that's what's going on to my gut? It's really upset due to anxiety and stress?	0	0	2	0.9975143671035767	0.0015025138854980469
I'm a guy from Lithuania. I'm 12 years old and I tried suicide and sh. Everything I do I'm just so shit at. I feel empty and drained. I overthink so much I feel like painting the walls red would be good.  But well. 1 month ago I got a girlfriend now she's the only thing I have left. Her name is Rusne. It's a Lithuanian name. If I lose her I'm either gonna kxms or go really insane. I feel like as I'm not good enough. Im trying to show as much love as I can. I can't lose her. I really can't. Middle school love might seem cringe but I swear, she's the only thing I have. She's the best person I've ever met. Let me tell you about my backstory or whatever you'd call it. From last year everything went downhill. I felt like I was gonna end it all. It's been almost a year and I still haven't done it. I'm still trying, but I'm really close. I now see the changes in myself. Behaviour, looks, basically my whole personality changed. I mean I like it but some things are bad. Like I don't even give a shit now. My grades are getting worse and shit. But I finnaly couldnt hold it in. Recently I opened up to my parents. At the start it looked like they're acctually helping me and I'm getting better, until... They used it against me. I couldnt believe it. Shit. Next Time you guys wanna open up do it with a person you REALLY REALLY trust.	Please don’t think like this. The number one best reason to not kill yourself right now is that your only 12 in the next few years your mind and perspective will change in unimaginable ways. If you’re ever going to have to consider suicide at the very least wait until your mind is done developing and even then there are reasons to stay alive	1	0	0	0.007851771079003811	0.00738525390625
"I’m from Ireland but am studying in England. I have 2 contact hours a day, 3 days a week. The rest of the week I spend at work. If I’m not in Uni or at work, I’m in bed. Not doing course work, not tidying the flat or going for walks or hanging out with friends nor doing any of the things I like. Just in bed.

I can’t find the motivation to do anything, the only reason I get up for work is because I will literally be homeless if I don’t. I can’t even enjoy a few pints with friends or have a nice date with my girlfriend or else I feel an enormous amount of shame and dread that I won’t be able to cover my rent and bills. I have no financial support other than asking my parents to help me out every so often. But that just makes me feel worse, they shouldn’t need to bail me out. Even when I spend money on necessary things like groceries or travel fair I feel shame.

And with uni work… we’ll I’m a procrastinator. And not in the fun relatable way. I’m pretty sure what is the equivalent of my dissertation is going to be done in its entirety the night before it is due as well as all of my other assignments. If I fail this course I honestly have no clue what I am going to do with my life. I don’t think I have any applicable skills at all. I wouldn’t be too ashamed to move back in with my parents in Ireland for a little while but I’m getting too old now to not be able to earn any skills that’ll get me a decent job.

That’s another thing. I’m 24, most people in my year are about 20. I know this is just an “age is just a number” thing and I don’t want to make any mature students feel discouraged. But I can’t help but let it get to me. I feel like that time of my life where I am meant to develop is finished. Now my brain is done absorbing information and it didn’t even manage to absorb anything fucking useful. There are people who I know, who I went to school with with small businesses and children. I had my chance, and I chose to sleep in.

It’s not like I haven’t tried anything. I’m just bad at keeping up with anything. I tried cognitive behavioural therapy, to get me more in a productive routine so that when leisure time would come around I wouldn’t feel so bad. Tried that for months to no avail. The only thing to come out of it was my therapist telling me I was depressed. Well at least I know for sure now.

Can’t afford 1 to 1 therapy so I’m just living with it right now, and deadlines are charging me down like a parade of bulls. And bills and rent are sucking me dry. The only thing that doesn’t seem to cost me money or energy is sleeping. It’s a vicious cycle and I want out but I don’t know how."	"You're procrastinating because your college assignment are more boring than watching tv for exemple. You need to build yourself an environment in which the less boring thing to do is studying. 

So what you need to do is get rid of your TV, computer, that's hard but it would work. You still have time to study, you will not necessarily fail your exams."	0	0	0	0.403310090303421	0.0021840333938598633
"I'm so angry, I've known my parents were homophobic and transphobic from a young age. But I was blind to their racism because my father served a mostly African church (we're white). We lived in a mostly black town, and we live in a mostly Latino area now (but our congregation is yt). But now that I am an adult and especially after 2020 my eyes have been completely open to their behavior. Especially my mom, she says hateful and vile things towards people of other races, she said the N WORD! Just tonight she called my young neice who is half mexican only 'half bad"". My parents do not understand how they are racist. Even when I blatently call them out   


I warned my roommate of my parents racism already and they made the decision to call the school to see if they can move dorms becuase they may find it necessary. At first I was upset but like an hour later hearing possibly the most racist jokes thus far I agree. I have spoken to them and told them I'm not really going to invite them or even want them to come up to visit at all, and I'm planning to hopefully cut them off. But that all depends especially if I get this job.   


And now I'm questioning if my roommate will be comfortable with ME if I choose to become a dispatcher for our campus police. But I can't cut my parents off if I don't. I need the money which is the only reason I'd do it.   


They have always made everyone around me (including myself) uncomfortable with their various forms of bigotry. I can not allow them to keep doing this.

"A little preface - what the post is about:
I live in a country that is at war.
I can't find a job despite it is required of me.
I found a calling that I love, but parents don't let me do it.
I can't find a girl.
I am overweight.

Firstly, I graduated from the Ukrainian IT University 3 years ago.
In my third year of college, I realized that I didn't want to be a programmer, even though I had excellent grades.
I hate coding. Absolutely everything related to debugging code causes me uncontrollable anger and frustration. I can no longer spend 3 hours looking for a solution to 5 errors in the code that have nothing to do with the logic of the algorithm and are caused only by the specifics of the programming language. Even the thought that I need to learn a programming language makes my hands tremble and makes me irritable.
After graduating from college, I told my mom that I didn't want to be a programmer and I didn't want to go to an IT university. I want to find what I like in life.
The mother replied: “Do you understand what you are going to live on while you are looking for yourself? Without education, you will not be hired anywhere. Finish university, get a job, and then do whatever you want with your life.""
In the end, I did. All the time I was studying, I thought that all the roads were open in front of me and I could do anything in life. I thought only lazy people can't find a job. As a student, I could find any part-time job at gas stations, call centers and “McDonalds”s. I thought that when I graduated from university, I would take my diploma, go to the lowest paid job as a programmer, after a couple of years I would plow there, and try new things in my free time. That’s how I thoght until I graduated from university that I realized how wrong I was.
As soon as I graduated from university, all the ""doors"" of employers for students were closed. No one read my resume on job sites, my phone never rang. Attempts to look for work not in my specialty were also unsuccessful. Only then did I realize that in fact all the doors closed for me at the age of 15, when I first crossed the threshold of my IT college.
The main problem is that IT colleges and IT universities do not teach the necessary knowledge for work. It doesn't bother anyone at all. In Ukrainian colleges, they will forcefully teach a ton of useless subjects in modern meta-coding - from numerical methods to patent law. When I opened the job requirements, I lost heart. I spent 8 years studying to say that I know object oriented programming, I know 1997 database technologies and I can write code in 5 programming languages. But what else do I need:
- Framework #1 - unstudied
- Framework #2 - unstudied
- Framework #3 - unstudied
- Git technology - unlearned
- Modern wrapper for databases NameA - did not sound.
- I have no real experience with real projects from one year.
- I don't have a portfolio of works.
While I was ""looking for a job"" after a bad experience as a gas station cashier, I tried my hand at editing videos for YouTube. I have never been so inspired by what I do. The progress in motivation compared to what it was with programming was incredible for me. I worked on videos for 12 hours a day. When I started uploading videos, I saw that I get 100-300 views on the first five videos, while other beginner youtubers could not get more than 10.
It is obvious that it is quite difficult to get money from YouTube without monetization and audience’s support right away.
After the scandal, the mother said that she would help for some time, but if there were no successes, she would stop. When they donated the first five dollars to me, she seemed to be delighted, but completely stopped taking this idea seriously. She seems to deliberately ignore what I do in general, constantly distracting me and giving useless tasks since I have ""a lot of free time.""
When the war started in Ukraine, the job industry got f~ed. They began to take all the men from work and send them to the front line. The same goes for any men on the street.
25% of the population in Ukraine is unemployed.
Rewinding time forward to today, after 450 days of the war, they parents began to “softly” hint to me that it was time to look for a job.
During the war, my mother does not let me go outside even for shopping. That doesn’t disturb her to propose me work at a constructions.
Since there is a war now, I cannot work in the office or on the street - that is, it is only remote work. Remote work without work experience is either work in a call center, or work as a dispatcher for transportation in America (this is how it works in Ukraine). Accordingly, I have a very small selection of vacancies and a giant wall of “HR-managers” with gigantic unrealistic requirements.
At the moment I live in a village where there is not much to talk to, so I can’t even count on meeting girls, I can’t even find friends.
Even if suddenly a lonely lady was found in my neighboring house, agreeing to spend some time, she would not be very pleased to communicate with me because im overweight (175 cm, 100 kg). I stopped eating sweets and started to lose a decent amount of weight, but it will take a long time anyway. Btw I'm a virgin at 26.
My question is what to do with all this?
Everything is so bad that I can’t even ask a good question.

P.S.
Today I was contacted by the HR of a travel company and she offered a job as a dispatcher. I have an interview tomorrow. I doubt that I need it. I understand that I sound now like a manchild but hear me out.
At the moment we have enough money to survive. We do not save money, but so far we have everything. When I asked my mother what they were going to spend my money on (I expected that this money would be safely taken from me), she replied “that it will be your money, if you want, spend it on entertainment or shopping or save it for what you need”.
As a result, I have many questions.
How will I spend money on entertainment if I can be caught and mobilized to the front? What exactly should I buy if I can't go to the store?
I can’t even rent an apartment for such a salary, that is, it’s no luck to move out from my parents. From all this I draw one conclusion. They demand a job from me simply because “Well, why do we work and you don’t?” Despite the fact that there is no talk of taking money from me for rent or food.
So that's why I think I don't need a job - because for me at the moment the TIME spent on my channel is more important than money. And if I don't have time, I don't need money. But if I don't find a job, they will pester me every day, accusing me of lazyness. Should I accept a job offer?"	Wow , I went through the same situation some 2 years ago, I wanted to do a lot of stuff but I couldn't because of some shit going into my family, luckily our country was not at war but unemployment is a major issue here in India. I graduated with a degree in mechanical engineering and realised we don't have many opportunities here except working in the private factories. I didn't know what I wanted to do in life, my friends were going into the IT field, learning programming and it helped them make decent money (IT sector is profiting in India) . I stayed with my parents, they never pushed me to get a job, they had enough money. But all of sudden it changed, they wanted me to get a job cause having an employed son isn't acceptable in society. I had no opportunities cause no company was willing to hire me because of my 5 year gap . I never had any work experience. But then I got an offer for an interview one of my relatives organised. I accepted the offer even though it wasn't my dream job , I moved out and it opened doors for many possibilities, I changed jobs and made  connections. Now I have 2 years of job experience and I don't feel like a loser, I'm willing to work hard to be able to do what I  actually want to do . My advice would be to accept the offer and move out, take time out for yourself and learn stuff that could help you teach stuff you never learned in University	1	2	0	0.0022986081894487143	0.004025518894195557
"I don't want to keep you guys reading for too long so I'll try and quick.

Okay so I am a Romanian citizen that has moved to the uk 5 years ago( i am now almost 18 as I'm writing this)
I was known for always speaking too much, it didn't matter that you were, a girl or a boy, I always had good conversation with everyone, i always made loads of friends, and whenever i saw a girl i liked i could not stop talking to her even in lessons , this was all in my home country, however me and my loving family moved into the uk.
Over the last 4-5 years ive spent in the uk school (year 9-13) I have never made a single friend or had s conversation longer than 10-15 minutes, it got the point where I was hearing everyone calling me the quiet kid and i could not do anything about it,  i would rather be tortured with lava than talk and say something in the classroom unless i was privately speaking with someone. This gets much worse when I am setting next to any girls no matter who she is , i can't even say a damn word, i miss every single party even the last day of school which was a ball/banquet.

Weirdly this is only happening to people my age, i talk alot at work with my colleges who are older."	I have a lot of social anxiety sometimes. It is very common but really difficult. Honestly I'm positive many people at your school have it too and they are just not brave enough to admit it. You have to be yourself and let other people accept you on your terms. Lots of people will not like you because they are assholes and you shouldn't worry about those people. Focus your time on a handful of people that seem to care about you at school instead of focusing on a lot of people that don't care about you. I know it's hard but you can do it. Therapy has also helped me immensely. It has brought me leaps and bounds.	1	2	0	0.0012060509761795402	0.013314902782440186
"This turned out to be really long, so thank you for just reading this.

I am not expecting any answers, but I would be happy to hear different opinions.

I am a 31 years old spoilt white male, born to privilege, who is wasting their life.

I feel unhappy with myself, beacuse everything I have ever done was given to me.

&#x200B;

I have failed two bachelor degrees.

The job I have has been given to me and there is no pressure to do anything meaningful with it, because it is a minute team and it does not force me to engage with people or present any consequences for failure.

I feel no real desire to be good at it.

When that eventually falls through, I have no pressure to get an actual job, because, although I will not live a life of luxury, I will never really have to face any financial hardships (my family owns a bit of property).

&#x200B;

I feel no reason to seek out connections with people, because I feel it is too much work, without too much reward.

I know, rationally, that the work is worth the reward, because it brings me happiness to connect with people, but not enough to stop myself from actively pushing people away or seeking out connections.

My family is my only real source of meaningful connections with other people, however there are issues there.

My parents are content to never push me to do anything and they let me just exist in the state that I am in.

They do that, because they need me to take care of their emotional needs and serve as an emotional drain for their baggage, while simultaneously refusing to include me in any meaningful conversations which could potentially lead to change.

They also show real support and love, when my problems do not involve them actually changing.

I used to be very close to my sibling, and they show me real support and love, but they have grown distant, since they now have their own family to support and issues to take care of.

Since I have been spoiled from an young age, my safety net is very toxic to me.

&#x200B;

I have no real desire to improve myself, because I am too scared to change what is essentially a lifestyle that brings no hardships.

More often than not I want to find meaning in life but that requires at least a nominally consistent drive for self-improvement, so that usually fizzles out within days or weeks.

I have been to several therapists, but that ultimately fails, when I just stop engaging, because the desire for change dries up when I fall back to habits that lead to stagnation.

Habits, such as ignoring people, doing nominal self-improvement (i.e. taking the occasional online class or certificate for job-related skills only to do nothing with them and let them expire), consuming media, which makes me feel good about myself, and general laziness.

I have been diagnosed with depression and generalized anxiety disorder, because of my general lack of desire to take basic care of myself, beyond personal hygiene, and actively ignoring the few people from school who still want to be friends.

The only friend I keep in toch with (on and off) tries to make me get off my ass and actually do something, anything, since that is the only way to find something which will make me feel happy and not just content.

&#x200B;

I often have suicidal ideations, but I know they will not be realized, because that would be an utter waste of all the opportunities that have been given to me as well as any potential I might have.

I also realize the inherent contradiction, between feeling that I have potential worth and feeling bad, because I'm not doing anything about it.

&#x200B;

I realize that my emotional growth is stunted and I have no real desire to grow, or I would try to do something to change it.

&#x200B;

All of this makes me a burden to myself, society and family, since I have no desire to give anything of value back, and I do not feel happy with myself, because I want to do something I define as worthwhile.

I have no way of knowing what is worthwhile to me, without trying stuff that I feel might be, but I also have no desire to try things I feel might be.

I do not have any external or much internal pressure to actively change, and it's easy to just ignore myself and by extension people around me.

Ignoring people arond me makes me feel shitty, so I just hate myself more and fall into this spiral of discontent, where I hate myself, but not enough to change.

So I neither hate, nor love myself enough to change.

I just feel I am wasting what was given, which is not enough motivation for me to do anything with my life.

Add to that the fact I should have been going through this when I was 16 (if I'm being generous with myself) and the general understanding that I am wallowing in convenient misery, instead of doing anything about it.

So, being a spoied, whiny, self-hating loser at 31, it's easy for me to distance myself from myself as a way to reconcile with the fact that I don't like myself.

This whole thing also makes me feel very egotistic.

&#x200B;

The options I see and my questions are:

1. How do I force myself to change, when I don't really want to and have no external pressure to do so?
2. How do I learn to live with myself and not care so much that I have no value to other people?
3. How do I learn to find meaning in what little value I have?

I have no way of knowing what is worthwhile to me, without trying stuff that I feel might be, but I also have no desire to try things I feel might be.

I do not have any external or much internal pressure to actively change, and it's easy to just ignore myself and by extension people around me.

Ignoring people arond me makes me feel shitty, so I just hate myself more and fall into this spiral of discontent, where I hate myself, but not enough to change.

So I neither hate, nor love myself enough to change.

I just feel I am wasting what was given, which is not enough motivation for me to do anything with my life.

Add to that the fact I should have been going through this when I was 16 (if I'm being generous with myself) and the general understanding that I am wallowing in convenient misery, instead of doing anything about it.

So, being a spoied, whiny, self-hating loser at 31, it's easy for me to distance myself from myself as a way to reconcile with the fact that I don't like myself.

This whole thing also makes me feel very egotistic.

&#x200B;

The options I see and my questions are:

1. How do I force myself to change, when I don't really want to and have no external pressure to do so?
2. How do I learn to live with myself and not care so much that I have no value to other people?
3. How do I learn to find meaning in what little value I have?

Thank you again, for reading this far."	"Maybe you need a change of perspective. There are many people who aspire to simple living, they aren't interested in career achievements etc, they live life as simply as possible in many different ways and it bring them peace. The difference between them and yourself is perspective and probably the fact that they live harmoniously with others and have people in their lives who they feel close to  (just a feeling) but some people live peacefully as hermits. 

Im not saying just accept your situation but what I'm saying is how can you be so sure that you need to do something or change in order to be happy that's something that humans always feel, we need to change we want more or we want different things than what we have no matter what it is. 

I think you probably should do some soul searching. Since this isn't really the kind of sub I won't get into it too much but I do recommend buddhist meditation which I have found really helpful in helping me change my perspective and gain greater clarity about what particular life I want to live regardless of what society or family is expecting of me . 

There are other ways to do this but I'm sharing what worked for me. 

I used to consider myself too scared to do something different and drastic but eventually I did it anyway bc I decided thats what best for me."	0	0	0	0.0028236142825335264	0.0011274218559265137

I am a 31 years old spoilt white male, born to privilege, who is wasting their life.

I feel unhappy with myself, beacuse everything I have ever done was given to me.

&#x200B;

I have failed two bachelor degrees.

The job I have has been given to me and there is no pressure to do anything meaningful with it, because it is a minute team and it does not force me to engage with people or present any consequences for failure.

I feel no real desire to be good at it.

When that eventually falls through, I have no pressure to get an actual job, because, although I will not live a life of luxury, I will never really have to face any financial hardships (my family owns a bit of property).

&#x200B;

I feel no reason to seek out connections with people, because I feel it is too much work, without too much reward.

I know, rationally, that the work is worth the reward, because it brings me happiness to connect with people, but not enough to stop myself from actively pushing people away or seeking out connections.

My family is my only real source of meaningful connections with other people, however there are issues there.

My parents are content to never push me to do anything and they let me just exist in the state that I am in.

They do that, because they need me to take care of their emotional needs and serve as an emotional drain for their baggage, while simultaneously refusing to include me in any meaningful conversations which could potentially lead to change.

They also show real support and love, when my problems do not involve them actually changing.

I used to be very close to my sibling, and they show me real support and love, but they have grown distant, since they now have their own family to support and issues to take care of.

Since I have been spoiled from an young age, my safety net is very toxic to me.

&#x200B;

I have no real desire to improve myself, because I am too scared to change what is essentially a lifestyle that brings no hardships.

More often than not I want to find meaning in life but that requires at least a nominally consistent drive for self-improvement, so that usually fizzles out within days or weeks.

I have been to several therapists, but that ultimately fails, when I just stop engaging, because the desire for change dries up when I fall back to habits that lead to stagnation.

Habits, such as ignoring people, doing nominal self-improvement (i.e. taking the occasional online class or certificate for job-related skills only to do nothing with them and let them expire), consuming media, which makes me feel good about myself, and general laziness.

I have been diagnosed with depression and generalized anxiety disorder, because of my general lack of desire to take basic care of myself, beyond personal hygiene, and actively ignoring the few people from school who still want to be friends.

The only friend I keep in toch with (on and off) tries to make me get off my ass and actually do something, anything, since that is the only way to find something which will make me feel happy and not just content.

&#x200B;

I often have suicidal ideations, but I know they will not be realized, because that would be an utter waste of all the opportunities that have been given to me as well as any potential I might have.

I also realize the inherent contradiction, between feeling that I have potential worth and feeling bad, because I'm not doing anything about it.

Thank you again, for reading this far."	">My parents are content to never push me

Dude you’re 31. THIRTY. ONE. A parents job to push is when you’re in elementary school, middle school, high school, and to get you through college or other post-secondary training. Their job is over in that regard so you need to just go on and realize you’re an adult and it not on your parents to ‘push’ you or raise you now that you’re good and grown. Most they can do at this point is to support you, which they’re doing. They can’t make you do anything so stop blaming them for what you choose to do or not do at 31. 

The answer to your questions, all 3 of them, is to stop the pity party and get on with things. It’s great that you recognize you are whiny, now go get help to get a grip so you can live your life fully self-motivated. Therapy, and maybe you need medication."	0	2	0	0.008367707021534443	0.012227475643157959

Thank you again, for reading this far."	"A lot of western culture brainwashes us into thinking we're either 1) successful, important, and doing Great Things, or 2) we're losers. Doing anything feels like ""too much work,"" as you put it, because it is... if you look at things in a black and white way.

This is hard to break out of. I'm not a spoiled well-off white guy but I can very much relate to your situation and lack of motivation.

I think it's important to experiment. Try different things to figure out what is important to you and what activities or human relationships feel good and valuable. They may not be what you think. You might think ""cultivating a friendship w/ this new person I met doesn't seem worth it"" but give it a try to see what it's actually like. You might be surprised. Or you might not. Experimentation is about failure, so expect many dead ends. This takes time, and it's not wasted effort. You're learning a lot as you go.

Eventually you'll establish a small ""base"" of things you want to do, people who are important in your life, values you believe in. The smaller the better. This is counterintuitive but if you expect some Enormous Insight or Overnight Change it won't happen.

"This turned out to be really long, so thank you for just reading this.

I am not expecting any answers, but I would be happy to hear different opinions.

I am a 31 years old spoilt white male, born to privilege, who is wasting their life.

I feel unhappy with myself, beacuse everything I have ever done was given to me.

&#x200B;

I have failed two bachelor degrees.

The job I have has been given to me and there is no pressure to do anything meaningful with it, because it is a minute team and it does not force me to engage with people or present any consequences for failure.

I feel no real desire to be good at it.

When that eventually falls through, I have no pressure to get an actual job, because, although I will not live a life of luxury, I will never really have to face any financial hardships (my family owns a bit of property).

&#x200B;

I feel no reason to seek out connections with people, because I feel it is too much work, without too much reward.

I know, rationally, that the work is worth the reward, because it brings me happiness to connect with people, but not enough to stop myself from actively pushing people away or seeking out connections.

My family is my only real source of meaningful connections with other people, however there are issues there.

My parents are content to never push me to do anything and they let me just exist in the state that I am in.

They do that, because they need me to take care of their emotional needs and serve as an emotional drain for their baggage, while simultaneously refusing to include me in any meaningful conversations which could potentially lead to change.

They also show real support and love, when my problems do not involve them actually changing.

I used to be very close to my sibling, and they show me real support and love, but they have grown distant, since they now have their own family to support and issues to take care of.

Since I have been spoiled from an young age, my safety net is very toxic to me.

&#x200B;

I have no real desire to improve myself, because I am too scared to change what is essentially a lifestyle that brings no hardships.

More often than not I want to find meaning in life but that requires at least a nominally consistent drive for self-improvement, so that usually fizzles out within days or weeks.

I have been to several therapists, but that ultimately fails, when I just stop engaging, because the desire for change dries up when I fall back to habits that lead to stagnation.

Habits, such as ignoring people, doing nominal self-improvement (i.e. taking the occasional online class or certificate for job-related skills only to do nothing with them and let them expire), consuming media, which makes me feel good about myself, and general laziness.

I have been diagnosed with depression and generalized anxiety disorder, because of my general lack of desire to take basic care of myself, beyond personal hygiene, and actively ignoring the few people from school who still want to be friends.

The only friend I keep in toch with (on and off) tries to make me get off my ass and actually do something, anything, since that is the only way to find something which will make me feel happy and not just content.

&#x200B;

I often have suicidal ideations, but I know they will not be realized, because that would be an utter waste of all the opportunities that have been given to me as well as any potential I might have.

I also realize the inherent contradiction, between feeling that I have potential worth and feeling bad, because I'm not doing anything about it.

&#x200B;

I realize that my emotional growth is stunted and I have no real desire to grow, or I would try to do something to change it.

&#x200B;

All of this makes me a burden to myself, society and family, since I have no desire to give anything of value back, and I do not feel happy with myself, because I want to do something I define as worthwhile.

I have no way of knowing what is worthwhile to me, without trying stuff that I feel might be, but I also have no desire to try things I feel might be.

I do not have any external or much internal pressure to actively change, and it's easy to just ignore myself and by extension people around me.

Ignoring people arond me makes me feel shitty, so I just hate myself more and fall into this spiral of discontent, where I hate myself, but not enough to change.

So I neither hate, nor love myself enough to change.

I just feel I am wasting what was given, which is not enough motivation for me to do anything with my life.

Add to that the fact I should have been going through this when I was 16 (if I'm being generous with myself) and the general understanding that I am wallowing in convenient misery, instead of doing anything about it.

So, being a spoied, whiny, self-hating loser at 31, it's easy for me to distance myself from myself as a way to reconcile with the fact that I don't like myself.

This whole thing also makes me feel very egotistic.

&#x200B;

The options I see and my questions are:

1. How do I force myself to change, when I don't really want to and have no external pressure to do so?
2. How do I learn to live with myself and not care so much that I have no value to other people?
3. How do I learn to find meaning in what little value I have?

&#x200B;

The options I see and my questions are:

1. How do I force myself to change, when I don't really want to and have no external pressure to do so?
2. How do I learn to live with myself and not care so much that I have no value to other people?
3. How do I learn to find meaning in what little value I have?

I am not expecting any answers, but I would be happy to hear different opinions.

I am a 31 years old spoilt white male, born to privilege, who is wasting their life.

I feel unhappy with myself, beacuse everything I have ever done was given to me.

&#x200B;

I have failed two bachelor degrees.

The job I have has been given to me and there is no pressure to do anything meaningful with it, because it is a minute team and it does not force me to engage with people or present any consequences for failure.

I feel no real desire to be good at it.

When that eventually falls through, I have no pressure to get an actual job, because, although I will not live a life of luxury, I will never really have to face any financial hardships (my family owns a bit of property).

&#x200B;

I feel no reason to seek out connections with people, because I feel it is too much work, without too much reward.

I know, rationally, that the work is worth the reward, because it brings me happiness to connect with people, but not enough to stop myself from actively pushing people away or seeking out connections.

My family is my only real source of meaningful connections with other people, however there are issues there.

My parents are content to never push me to do anything and they let me just exist in the state that I am in.

They do that, because they need me to take care of their emotional needs and serve as an emotional drain for their baggage, while simultaneously refusing to include me in any meaningful conversations which could potentially lead to change.

They also show real support and love, when my problems do not involve them actually changing.

I used to be very close to my sibling, and they show me real support and love, but they have grown distant, since they now have their own family to support and issues to take care of.

Since I have been spoiled from an young age, my safety net is very toxic to me.

&#x200B;

I have no real desire to improve myself, because I am too scared to change what is essentially a lifestyle that brings no hardships.

More often than not I want to find meaning in life but that requires at least a nominally consistent drive for self-improvement, so that usually fizzles out within days or weeks.

I have been to several therapists, but that ultimately fails, when I just stop engaging, because the desire for change dries up when I fall back to habits that lead to stagnation.

Habits, such as ignoring people, doing nominal self-improvement (i.e. taking the occasional online class or certificate for job-related skills only to do nothing with them and let them expire), consuming media, which makes me feel good about myself, and general laziness.

I have been diagnosed with depression and generalized anxiety disorder, because of my general lack of desire to take basic care of myself, beyond personal hygiene, and actively ignoring the few people from school who still want to be friends.

The only friend I keep in toch with (on and off) tries to make me get off my ass and actually do something, anything, since that is the only way to find something which will make me feel happy and not just content.

&#x200B;

I often have suicidal ideations, but I know they will not be realized, because that would be an utter waste of all the opportunities that have been given to me as well as any potential I might have.

I also realize the inherent contradiction, between feeling that I have potential worth and feeling bad, because I'm not doing anything about it.

&#x200B;

I realize that my emotional growth is stunted and I have no real desire to grow, or I would try to do something to change it.

&#x200B;

All of this makes me a burden to myself, society and family, since I have no desire to give anything of value back, and I do not feel happy with myself, because I want to do something I define as worthwhile.

I have no way of knowing what is worthwhile to me, without trying stuff that I feel might be, but I also have no desire to try things I feel might be.

I do not have any external or much internal pressure to actively change, and it's easy to just ignore myself and by extension people around me.

Ignoring people arond me makes me feel shitty, so I just hate myself more and fall into this spiral of discontent, where I hate myself, but not enough to change.

So I neither hate, nor love myself enough to change.

I just feel I am wasting what was given, which is not enough motivation for me to do anything with my life.

Add to that the fact I should have been going through this when I was 16 (if I'm being generous with myself) and the general understanding that I am wallowing in convenient misery, instead of doing anything about it.

"Hey Ladies 💕,

So i got out of a relationship a lil while ago and what i can say for sure is sex is very very important for me especially when we are both compatible. 
I am into BDSM, i have always been kinda into it. I have never really done that before but i really hope my next partner is into it. 

I guess, my question to you who already experienced it is: when you did was it up to your expectations? Did you like it?
Cause it can get kinda scary. 

I think the main reason why i am so much into it is the idea of surrendering myself to someone and trusting him enough to let him do anything with my body?? And i feel pleasure while in pain or stressful situations during sex too? I feel it's a beautiful thing and i understand it might not be for everyone but how bad does it get???

Excuse my bad English is i am a native French speaker. Thank you💕"	"Hello!

Long time kinkster. I use to teach classes on breath play and BDSM basics back in the day and went to BlackBeat when it was around. Also taught human sexuality on a collegiate level and hopefully will have a chance to do it again when chasing tenure. 

Also been married for 9 years and collared for 10.

We're not active in the scene at the moment, because we're busy with careers and two kids but stage two of the remodel will include hard points anchored all around the house. It never really stops per se ;-) 

BDSM is great and I would say from my long history of experience having a community was very important for me when I was younger. It gave me a chance to learn, explore, teach and develop mentorships. Because of that I learned to recognize and navigate away from signs of abuse and had lots of peers to explore and play with.

Emotional abuse is something that is all too rampant and making sure you can separate out that behavior is so important.  It can be hard to do when encountering really good manipulators. 

I highly recommend that if you are just starting out is to find a group to explore within. I solo played a lot from fetlife when I was younger and feel like those situations were much more problematic than when I explored within a group. 

To answer your question about expectations. I had a FANTASTIC time exploring the scene. Play parties were a ton of fun and gave me a safe place to explore everything from breath play to fire play and mummification. You name it I tried it in a SAFE group setting. I did a scene auction for charity once and whew.... still one of my best memories. You can go down the rabbit hole really fast.

Relationships wise is a different story all together. Let me just say that rich dudes with fetishes were the worst. But then again maybe I was the worst too but I encountered a lot of men in vanilla relationships who wanted side toys and men who definitely fetishsized Black women. That's why I was happy to be introduced to BlackBeat and blackcentric kink groups. If they are still around, which I'm sure thay are in some form or another. Find them. 

Scene and dating wise it was all fun. Marriage wise, eh that's another thing all together and I unfortunately do not know a ton of folks who've made it and are kinky. I'm moving along nicely but kink has definitely taken a back seat and 24/7 has evolved a lot for us. 

Have fun! Find some peers and never settle!"	0	2	0	0.001524421968497336	0.013534247875213623

Excuse my bad English is i am a native French speaker. Thank you💕"	"I can say that it's only scary if you don't fully trust your partner and/or if you're unsure if you truly want to go through with an action. You NEED trust and security in the fact that you WANT the action(s) to happen because if you don't you could end up with some trauma. 

It just matters if you like it. 

Some things I thought I liked in my head I have tried IRL and literally hated it. Some things I thought I hated in my head I've tried IRL (out of pure curiosity) and have LOVED it. Again just having a partner, a safeword, and a place to talk about it afterward is so much more important than the act in itself. 

I'm guessing you're leaning on being a sub and if done right it can feel immensely euphoric, kind of like a dream/floaty state. But that is if you trust the person and feel comfortable to be vulnerable with them. It's quite rewarding for all involved. 

Not everything is for anyone and that's perfectly okay. 

""How bad does it get"" is kind of like setting some alarms off in my head right now because like it's not supposed to be ""bad"". Even though the action of letting someone control you is seen as ""bad"" it should feel good if you are into it. 

Before I was in a relationship I looked into BDSM made a literal list of the things I thought I liked and started from there. The next step is telling your partner if they agree to do these things with you. And if they don't then you need to make a decision on if it's something that is a NEED in a relationship. 

Best of luck <3"	1	0	0	0.0012175082229077816	0.003106355667114258

 In my 20's I dated someone that introduced me to the lifestyle.  I am a sub, but I think I could be Dom if I had to.

Unfortunately,  my spouse isn't into it and I truly miss the lifestyle. If it's for you, it's for you.

So i got out of a relationship a lil while ago and what i can say for sure is sex is very very important for me especially when we are both compatible. 
I am into BDSM, i have always been kinda into it. I have never really done that before but i really hope my next partner is into it. 

I guess, my question to you who already experienced it is: when you did was it up to your expectations? Did you like it?
Cause it can get kinda scary. 

I think the main reason why i am so much into it is the idea of surrendering myself to someone and trusting him enough to let him do anything with my body?? And i feel pleasure while in pain or stressful situations during sex too? I feel it's a beautiful thing and i understand it might not be for everyone but how bad does it get???

Excuse my bad English is i am a native French speaker. Thank you💕"	"Hiya, I am a kinkster, counselor whose fav niche is kinksters, and you are far from alone. I think one of the things that has helped me over time is recognizing that you do have to find people who are willing to \*build\* trust or whose attitudes focus everyone having a good time, negotiations, and boundaries. I have been involved in kink since I first became sexual and in kink communities for roughly 5+ years. One of the best things new people can do is give themselves permission to learn as much as possible, and truly I believe I learned the most from other women especially switches. The most important thing is to learn what \*you\* want, and even if that's just to be used like an object you still have to process what that means. You also have to learn to ask for it and not have a top or dominant just know. One of the most common mistakes I and others seem to make is not speaking up. I don't just mean using the negotiated safe words, but concrete communication around sexual and emotional needs. Far too often we get into relationships then get hurt someone isn't doing what we want when we thought we were clear. Being non-monogamous, I have 4 dominant leaning parters and not a single one tops me like the other. Every single individual is unique, and as a kinkster I now know I have to speak very specifically when I want something. If I want orders sometimes I have to be willing to ask one, or accept another just is not dominant through orders but expresses it in others way. Look for someone(s) that hears you and seek clarity.  


 Look for classes, friends, and spaces you can explore too. But more than all that...have fun and be you."	1	2	0	0.0014897924847900867	0.0024310946464538574

Excuse my bad English is i am a native French speaker. Thank you💕"	I did it for about a year and didn't have any weird or creepy experiences at all. This was because I really trusted the people I did it with, so I went with my gut on that and only had positive experiences. I don't do it anymore so I guess it didn't stick but if anything happened to my current relationship I could see myself going back lol	0	2	0	0.0014018166111782193	0.000725090503692627

I felt it was more important to discuss it with partners going forward, because most people who haven't been involved in that kind of sexual relationship have a vague understanding of concent once you're already in the act. But I've learned it doesn't hurt to ask -even in the moment- and it's always best when you find someone who's kinky in the same way."	0	2	0	0.0014747235691174865	0.0011271834373474121

Excuse my bad English is i am a native French speaker. Thank you💕"	"I enjoyed it for many years. I did it alone for about 10. Then with community for another 10. That community was Black. We had conferences, shared meals, went to dungeons. Some of us were particularly cool with one another and would attend house parties. I was blessed to visit the homes of some of the OGs (Mistress Mir, Max rules) and sit in with younger incredible artists like Darque DeSade, Black Kat... I got to learn a lot, engage in documenting the history, and really appreciate it elders who sacrificed much. It was a beautiful thing - it was fam.

I've never used a safe word bc it shortchanges communication and isn't foolproof. I don't know what the community looks like these days, but if you can find one, do.  I encumbered a few dangerous situations going it alone. In community, I never felt unprotected."	0	2	0	0.0011608983622863889	0.0010693669319152832

I think the main reason why i am so much into it is the idea of surrendering myself to someone and trusting him enough to let him do anything with my body??

Excuse my bad English is i am a native French speaker. Thank you💕"	"Ya, he's not, lol. He won't be either, but that's ok. I don't HAVE to have that, but lesson learned.

"Hey Ladies 💕,

So i got out of a relationship a lil while ago and what i can say for sure is sex is very very important for me especially when we are both compatible. 
I am into BDSM, i have always been kinda into it. I have never really done that before but i really hope my next partner is into it.

Discussing exactly what we want to do and hopeful experience goals. You have to be similar goals because your partner might have  a different goal for you than you do.

I would never give anyone permission to use me. But if I were dominating I would definitely want to know what is specifically permitted."	0	0	0	0.0012705160770565271	0.004648923873901367

"Hey everyone. I didn't know where to post this, or if I'm asking for advice or venting. That is to say, any kind of response is welcome, both advice and general statements, I don't mind. 

So I'm (M 23) probably the black sheep of the family. Not exactly how you might expect though. I'm in good shape, have a decent job, a house, I recently got married, get along great with my wife(F 21).

I grew up to a family who were and are, extremely poor. Most people don't really believe or fully understand what it means when a person who grew up poor says that. It feels like such an understatement. To be clear, poor as in ""I'm shocked CPS didn't take me away"" poor, no food sometimes and parents struggling to keep minimum wage jobs or a car poor. Maybe what is commonly called redneck or ""white trash"". How I am not that way and support my wife at age 23 is a whole other story for a different time. I have a strong mountain man streak still of course 🤠

To make things more complicated I'm a black sheep because I'm probably the only person in the family who is not suffering a severe metal health diagnosis. My brother is schizophrenic, sister and mom severe bi polar, grand parents live in their car due to schizophrenia causing unlivable disillusions. We live in rural Appalachia. More things like drugs and lack of opportunity are at play with them too.

My family rely on me in a way that most people would feel inappropriate, but to me I just can't tell. Maybe the trauma bonding from years of growing up like that, maybe guilt. I give all of them rides to and from their jobs. I know this sound untenable because I don't even live in the same town as them but the guilt of knowing I can, and if I don't they'll have no money and nothing else as a result kills me. This means I wake up early, and go to bed late, I also have to squeeze in 8 hours of work in there too. 

The toilet broke at their house a few months back. I showed them a how-to video and the ordered them the part. I learned that months later it was still broken. I fixed it in 5 minutes after going there. Family holidays happen wherever I live. And I cook them. I recently saw the movie Hillbilly Eligy and cried buckets. I was thinking ""man, I lived this, I LIVE this now"". My wife had never seen me in such a state, the fact that she didn't see what I saw (how could she of course not her fault) made he feel so alone. It's hard when you can't lean on family for anything, and no one else understands. The pressure of providing for them, and providing for my wife at such a young age is a lot. 

People say ""cut them off"". Those words hurt me. Most people just can't relate to what it feels like. Imagining holding your mom or dads hand on a cliff side and someone says ""let go, it's hurting your arm"". It's feels so normal to me in some ways. Maybe you gathered this already but I never had a real childhood. I have been an adult so long as I have had needs you could say. 

Now that I'm married my wife may be the most patient person on this earth. I have no idea how she handles having a husband practically married to his family, she meant my mother the car I got for her to use when hers broke down. This was in the days when I thought my family might be able to get or maintain a car. Eventually it ran out of gas and I went and picked up the gasless car, full of trash and ciggeretes butts from the highway. but I know this is too much for my wife despite her support. She needs space, she needs to see me, she needs a husband. I just don't know how to handle it all.

I'm not the type to really post, it write about my problems. I'm a blue collar man who is used to just swallowing things. Carrying everything as best I can. I find it hard to communicate it to my wife. I can tell she wants me to, but I'm afraid she'll loose confidence in me. 

**td;lr 

My(M 23) family (parents, siblings) rely on me a great deal. They struggle with poverty, drugs and mental health. It puts strain on my relationship with my wife(21 F) of 1 year. Guilt pulls me in every direction trying to navigate this."	"Counseling is not a magic fix but you need to go to counseling with your wife and maybe individually.

My worry is your relationship with your family will negatively impact your marriage. And if you plan on having kids you need to figure our your parenting style. 

And you are traumatized from your childhood and never dealt with it, not blaming you at all.

You need tools to manage all that and counseling might provide them."	1	0	0	0.032436106353998184	0.0015297532081604004

So it makes sense that you have trouble opening up about this with your wife.  But you need to find a way to start telling her what's on your mind.  This marriage is unlikely to survive if you spend most of your time helping your family *and* can't talk about it with your wife to come up with a plan *together* for how/how much to help your family.  Would it be a helpful first step to write it down in a letter to give your wife?  You could say approximately what you said in this post.	0	0	0	0.9883085489273071	0.0009369254112243652

The main block for me is I feel the need to look like I have everything under control because I just don't want any chaos from my life to leech into hers. Aside from what I mentioned we have a very nice situation. To her I think it's a normal life, to me the house job ect all feels like I'm rich or something lol although I'm sure we'd be considered lower middle class. But yeah, I need to talk to her. And she really isn't gonna think less of me, anytime I have talked about my feelings she's seemed to respect me more. For me that's weird because I was essentially raised by construction and logging sites, and it's a very different culture than her	1	2	0	0.002969408640637994	0.003419935703277588

The toilet broke at their house a few months back. I showed them a how-to video and the ordered them the part. I learned that months later it was still broken. I fixed it in 5 minutes after going there. Family holidays happen wherever I live. And I cook them. I recently saw the movie Hillbilly Eligy and cried buckets. I was thinking ""man, I lived this, I LIVE this now"". My wife had never seen me in such a state, the fact that she didn't see what I saw (how could she of course not her fault) made he feel so alone. It's hard when you can't lean on family for anything, and no one else understands. The pressure of providing for them, and providing for my wife at such a young age is a lot. 

People say ""cut them off"". Those words hurt me. Most people just can't relate to what it feels like. Imagining holding your mom or dads hand on a cliff side and someone says ""let go, it's hurting your arm"". It's feels so normal to me in some ways. Maybe you gathered this already but I never had a real childhood. I have been an adult so long as I have had needs you could say. 

Now that I'm married my wife may be the most patient person on this earth. I have no idea how she handles having a husband practically married to his family, she meant my mother the car I got for her to use when hers broke down. This was in the days when I thought my family might be able to get or maintain a car. Eventually it ran out of gas and I went and picked up the gasless car, full of trash and ciggeretes butts from the highway. but I know this is too much for my wife despite her support. She needs space, she needs to see me, she needs a husband. I just don't know how to handle it all.

I'm not the type to really post, it write about my problems. I'm a blue collar man who is used to just swallowing things. Carrying everything as best I can. I find it hard to communicate it to my wife. I can tell she wants me to, but I'm afraid she'll loose confidence in me.

"We are together for 2 years and it is a great relationship, we communicate openly about everything, can navigate any fight and I feel overall really good in this relationship. 

I moved to study in his city in Germany (I am from Russia) and we met there. He is finishing medicine degree and wants to find a job in his home city. He has his whole life here, family friends and he does not want to move even to another city in Germany, which I underatand and accept.

I however have lived in 3 countries already and I have a huge curiosity for exploring cultures, languages and just learning about the life abroad. For now I wanna stay in Germany but I do not feel that happy in the city of my boyfriend, it is quite a concervative state, there are not many young people, I feel quite lonely and there is no art scene (I am an illustrator). I am not unhappy here but I wanna try something new. So I want to move to another city in a different state. 

But I know if I move to another city we will break up, we talked about it does not make sense to keep things going if I am not going to settle down in his town. And my concern is, should I really give up my relationship that is very good for something that I am not even sure I will like (living in another city)? 
Maybe I will just never be happy in a place I live long term?

P.s.We also talked about perfect lifestyle that we imagine for us:
His perfect picture is: we will eventually move in together, we will work 9 to 5, spend evenings with friends, sometimes do hikes on the weekend, do holiday couple of times a year, get kids etc
My perfect picture is: we live in a couple of different countries for several years together, explore it, work flexible hours, get a place as a base somewhere, we do campings or travel in a van for some time, even with kids eventually 

And it seemed so drastically different, I dont know if it is just me romanticizing travel, this whole situation makes me feel like I am the weird one who is ready to trade good relationship for novelty and excitement of a new place... 

Tl;dr I want to move around and my boyfriend wants to stay in his hometown forever, should I stay with him in his hometown?"	"I don't think this is about you romanticizing travel. It sounds like travel and exploration are a fundamental part of your personality. And if you are already bored at your current city, think how it will be in a five or ten years. 

What is more important: living your dream without him, or living his dream so you can stay with him? He has already decided that his dream is more important than staying with you"	0	0	0	0.003933988977223635	0.0010313987731933594

 I recently got a nice job offer in Scotland, starting next month, for at least 3 years.

On the other hand, I could move back in with my parents in Ireland. I could get a job in a pharma company here without an issue, as it's a huge sector here and I have a relevant course completed.

"What do I do?

apologies bit of a long one, finally telling my story, I will do a tldr at end :)

Male 22 Irish, 68kg , 5' 8

I had a good upbringing, always got treated well by parents except the odd disciplinary issues whenever I acted out, no trauma etc. I work out regularly, I am on decent shape, I would get attention from girls, I would always be in the top achievers in school (went to a grammar school, not sure what US equivalent is) good social life etc (no external stressors) so I am unsure why I am still so unhappy. My main problem is either depression or depersonalisation . First dealt with depersonalization although I didn't know what it was at the time at around the 14, happened on a handful occassions, most notably after physical exertion (dpdr then became chronic at 16) Had my first dealing with a deep depression around 15 years old due to a bad breakup with a girl I felt I loved at the time. I started dabbling with weed and mdma to help numb the pain, I smoked weed for around a year and took mdma for about 3 months and then after one random night I took a hit of a joint I got sent into full fledged dpdr, this has led me to be depressed (cause or symptom of dpdr im not sure in my case). The first few months of this was horrible, I was forced to go to school and I felt like I was going to faint every 5 minutes due to the overwhelming dissociation. In hindsight looking back I am glad I forced myself to continue on with life, the dpdr eventually , well I wouldn't say gotten better, but it faded enough into the background where it wasn't the only thing I had my attention on, atleast after the first 6 months anyway, I had a general feeling of low mood from then on but continued to carry on with life. Was referred to Mental health team and got counselling  (cbt). Tried to teaching me grounding tips for panic attaics when dpdr came on even when I kept reiterating that it was a constant state, not a transient one. Then came 18 where I had hit another low with dpdr, this made me housebound and extremely suicidal. I was prescribed citalopram / celexa and at the time I didn't feel like it workd but looking back it brought me back out of the house within a certain distance ( the dpdr / anxiety made me never leave the house), say maybe 10 mile from my house, a huge improvement on not being able to move 10 metres from my house. At this age I have left school, but the citalopram managed to give me enough courage to start a full time job in which I held for 6 months, at this period, life has become normal. I am working, I am socialising, I am drinking at the weekends (typical ""fitting in"" 18 year old starter pack). I'm still suffering from dpdr at this rate btw. 6 months into the job I have another breakdown. Looking back they feel like burnouts where I just couldn't cope anymore with trying to be normal when inside I felt horrible all the time. I went back to the doctor and he suggested that maybe the citalopram has pooped out and we should start a new SSRI in the form of Fluoxteine, much the same story of citalopram with much more weight gain, was able to go back to education and finish off a college diploma at 19-21 years old, again, still very much in dpdr, depression stilll there but not suicidal per se. At 21 I had enough of the weight gain and decided to come off anti depressants and raw dog the pain, I was feeling shit anyway on them and severely overweight ( went from 11 to 15 stone) , might aswell feel shit and look good atleast lol. Managed to lose 5 stone but still again depressed, anxious and still in dpdr. Fast forward to 22, this is where things took a new hell, I tried to sertraline, worst decision of my life. I sent me to a level of dpdr I have never been before, so deep that I thought I was dead and a literal ghost. I had to stop sertraline as any longer on it I think I genuinely would have ended it all. Anyway 7 months on, still depressed lol. Not sure what to do

Things I've discovered recently that could contribute ; 

• B12 and Folate defeciency, my b12 levels were horrible and folate was even worse, been put on folic acid and b12 injections and cofactors, 2 weeks in no improvement thus far
 • VitD defeciency, taking 5000iu vit d3 with 100mcg k2, just started yesterday so no input on that

Things I have tried;

•Exercise , distracts me for a bit but not a cure
•CBT, meh
•Socialising, similar to exercise
•SSRi's , unhappy and fat lol




tldr no trauma, ocassional teenage drug use, chronic dpdr, depressed for no reason"	It sounds like you need to talk to a mental health professional who actually takes your problems seriously, and is able to do a diagnostic assessment to figure out if there’s an underlying disorder that affects your thinking, emotions, and your response to medication. CBT is almost always used as a catch-all approach, but a lot of people don’t find it useful. Same can be said for SSRIs. And it sounds like these first-line standard approaches haven’t helped you.	0	0	0	0.9981635212898254	0.0008682608604431152

tldr no trauma, ocassional teenage drug use, chronic dpdr, depressed for no reason"	Those deficiencies will take a while to correct, particularly B12. I've seen it recommended for people with B12 deficiencies to do 2 injections a week for 2 years. How low were your B12 and D levels? I have a 415 B12 (not quite deficient but far from ideal) and 21 vitamin D as well as a non anemic iron deficiency (ferritin of 35 initially). You might want to get your ferritin checked as well, it's the only way to truly find out if you have an iron deficiency regardless of anemia.	0	2	2	0.9899200201034546	0.0009011030197143555

apologies bit of a long one, finally telling my story, I will do a tldr at end :)

Male 22 Irish, 68kg , 5' 8

I had a good upbringing, always got treated well by parents except the odd disciplinary issues whenever I acted out, no trauma etc. I work out regularly, I am on decent shape, I would get attention from girls, I would always be in the top achievers in school (went to a grammar school, not sure what US equivalent is) good social life etc (no external stressors) so I am unsure why I am still so unhappy. My main problem is either depression or depersonalisation . First dealt with depersonalization although I didn't know what it was at the time at around the 14, happened on a handful occassions, most notably after physical exertion (dpdr then became chronic at 16) Had my first dealing with a deep depression around 15 years old due to a bad breakup with a girl I felt I loved at the time. I started dabbling with weed and mdma to help numb the pain, I smoked weed for around a year and took mdma for about 3 months and then after one random night I took a hit of a joint I got sent into full fledged dpdr, this has led me to be depressed (cause or symptom of dpdr im not sure in my case). The first few months of this was horrible, I was forced to go to school and I felt like I was going to faint every 5 minutes due to the overwhelming dissociation. In hindsight looking back I am glad I forced myself to continue on with life, the dpdr eventually , well I wouldn't say gotten better, but it faded enough into the background where it wasn't the only thing I had my attention on, atleast after the first 6 months anyway, I had a general feeling of low mood from then on but continued to carry on with life. Was referred to Mental health team and got counselling  (cbt). Tried to teaching me grounding tips for panic attaics when dpdr came on even when I kept reiterating that it was a constant state, not a transient one. Then came 18 where I had hit another low with dpdr, this made me housebound and extremely suicidal. I was prescribed citalopram / celexa and at the time I didn't feel like it workd but looking back it brought me back out of the house within a certain distance ( the dpdr / anxiety made me never leave the house), say maybe 10 mile from my house, a huge improvement on not being able to move 10 metres from my house. At this age I have left school, but the citalopram managed to give me enough courage to start a full time job in which I held for 6 months, at this period, life has become normal. I am working, I am socialising, I am drinking at the weekends (typical ""fitting in"" 18 year old starter pack). I'm still suffering from dpdr at this rate btw. 6 months into the job I have another breakdown. Looking back they feel like burnouts where I just couldn't cope anymore with trying to be normal when inside I felt horrible all the time. I went back to the doctor and he suggested that maybe the citalopram has pooped out and we should start a new SSRI in the form of Fluoxteine, much the same story of citalopram with much more weight gain, was able to go back to education and finish off a college diploma at 19-21 years old, again, still very much in dpdr, depression stilll there but not suicidal per se. At 21 I had enough of the weight gain and decided to come off anti depressants and raw dog the pain, I was feeling shit anyway on them and severely overweight ( went from 11 to 15 stone) , might aswell feel shit and look good atleast lol. Managed to lose 5 stone but still again depressed, anxious and still in dpdr. Fast forward to 22, this is where things took a new hell, I tried to sertraline, worst decision of my life. I sent me to a level of dpdr I have never been before, so deep that I thought I was dead and a literal ghost. I had to stop sertraline as any longer on it I think I genuinely would have ended it all. Anyway 7 months on, still depressed lol. Not sure what to do

Things I've discovered recently that could contribute ; 

• B12 and Folate defeciency, my b12 levels were horrible and folate was even worse, been put on folic acid and b12 injections and cofactors, 2 weeks in no improvement thus far
 • VitD defeciency, taking 5000iu vit d3 with 100mcg k2, just started yesterday so no input on that

Things I have tried;

•Exercise , distracts me for a bit but not a cure
•CBT, meh
•Socialising, similar to exercise
•SSRi's , unhappy and fat lol

tldr no trauma, ocassional teenage drug use, chronic dpdr, depressed for no reason"	Don't worry I have been down the dpdr rabbit hole, SSRI and Lamotrigine seems to be the standard treatment, was never tested on me so can't chime in but after my last hell hole experience with zoloft I think I am going to stay clear for a while and after I've exhausted all natural approaches, I will then think about maybe trying an SSRI as a last resort again, as per the study, it seems he was started on paroextine, seem people seem to respond well to antidepressants to dpdr, some unfortunate enough like myself don't!	1	2	0	0.9974919557571411	0.0008977651596069336

tldr no trauma, ocassional teenage drug use, chronic dpdr, depressed for no reason"	Hi yes Vit b seems to be a long road to recovery, the deficiency didn't happen overnight so neither will recovery, my b12 was at 182, folate was at 2.1 :/ , D was at 80pmol/L (optimal should be 240)  Ferritin sitting at 99.6 ug\L which is fine . Getting tested for pernicious anaemia in 2 weeks. Currently on b12 injections every other day for 2 weeks then once every 3 months which I already know won't be enough so will likely self inject if symptoms still there. 415 isn't great and I know if you were supplementing( even drinking b12 drinks or eating fortified b12 cerrals) up to 4 months before testing this will be a skewed result and likely lower, also a high folate result will falsely raise b12 , known as the folate trap, also if folate is low, b12 can't be used at a cellular level. There is a wealth of information available on b12 in the facebook group Vitamin B12 Wake up	1	2	0	0.03952866047620773	0.0009366869926452637

First dealt with depersonalization although I didn't know what it was at the time at around the 14, happened on a handful occassions, most notably after physical exertion (dpdr then became chronic at 16) Had my first dealing with a deep depression around 15 years old due to a bad breakup with a girl I felt I loved at the time. I started dabbling with weed and mdma to help numb the pain, I smoked weed for around a year and took mdma for about 3 months and then after one random night I took a hit of a joint I got sent into full fledged dpdr, this has led me to be depressed (cause or symptom of dpdr im not sure in my case). The first few months of this was horrible, I was forced to go to school and I felt like I was going to faint every 5 minutes due to the overwhelming dissociation. In hindsight looking back I am glad I forced myself to continue on with life, the dpdr eventually , well I wouldn't say gotten better, but it faded enough into the background where it wasn't the only thing I had my attention on, atleast after the first 6 months anyway, I had a general feeling of low mood from then on but continued to carry on with life. Was referred to Mental health team and got counselling  (cbt). Tried to teaching me grounding tips for panic attaics when dpdr came on even when I kept reiterating that it was a constant state, not a transient one. Then came 18 where I had hit another low with dpdr, this made me housebound and extremely suicidal. I was prescribed citalopram / celexa and at the time I didn't feel like it workd but looking back it brought me back out of the house within a certain distance ( the dpdr / anxiety made me never leave the house), say maybe 10 mile from my house, a huge improvement on not being able to move 10 metres from my house. At this age I have left school, but the citalopram managed to give me enough courage to start a full time job in which I held for 6 months, at this period, life has become normal. I am working, I am socialising, I am drinking at the weekends (typical ""fitting in"" 18 year old starter pack). I'm still suffering from dpdr at this rate btw. 6 months into the job I have another breakdown. Looking back they feel like burnouts where I just couldn't cope anymore with trying to be normal when inside I felt horrible all the time. I went back to the doctor and he suggested that maybe the citalopram has pooped out and we should start a new SSRI in the form of Fluoxteine, much the same story of citalopram with much more weight gain, was able to go back to education and finish off a college diploma at 19-21 years old, again, still very much in dpdr, depression stilll there but not suicidal per se. At 21 I had enough of the weight gain and decided to come off anti depressants and raw dog the pain, I was feeling shit anyway on them and severely overweight ( went from 11 to 15 stone) , might aswell feel shit and look good atleast lol. Managed to lose 5 stone but still again depressed, anxious and still in dpdr. Fast forward to 22, this is where things took a new hell, I tried to sertraline, worst decision of my life. I sent me to a level of dpdr I have never been before, so deep that I thought I was dead and a literal ghost. I had to stop sertraline as any longer on it I think I genuinely would have ended it all. Anyway 7 months on, still depressed lol. Not sure what to do

Things I've discovered recently that could contribute ; 

• B12 and Folate defeciency, my b12 levels were horrible and folate was even worse, been put on folic acid and b12 injections and cofactors, 2 weeks in no improvement thus far
 • VitD defeciency, taking 5000iu vit d3 with 100mcg k2, just started yesterday so no input on that

Things I have tried;

•Exercise , distracts me for a bit but not a cure
•CBT, meh
•Socialising, similar to exercise
•SSRi's , unhappy and fat lol

"A week ago Sunday my husband smashed a glass plate and flying  glass hit our son who recently turned 8. DH was having a meltdown because I wanted to visit my cousin who was visiting from Florida a second time in a ten day period, during a 4 day weekend (that was the theme, at least, it's hard to know what actually set him off this time or any other).   The tantrum began when I slept in and within earshot of my son who told me he was ""sorry I got yelled at"" when things calmed down and I got food made. I knew it wasn't over and 30m later (ik cuz I was recording) he continued it in front of the kid, liberally calling him a retard and me the n and k word (we are white of non Jewish descent, but anyone who opposes him is a kword). After breaking the plate he proceeded to chase me around the house hitting me in the arms, breast, and face while I tried to find a broom (..and not fall, he tried twice). That was it, for me, hed been hitting me since 2019, verbally abusing us both for years, and slapped the kid in late April this year (first time he'd hit the kid). I was done, finally told my family the whole story of the past years and got an emergency protective order and then a 2 week temp order 2 days later. I have the right to stay in the house but I'm at my mom's for safety. 
My son has basically been acting like we're on vacation, he knows his dad's is at his grandpa's house but nothing about how long that will be, and he didn't even ask it like ""where's dad"" but more like ""Is he at our house"". He's said he likes being here, he says he wants to stay longer, my mom and aunts are slowly trying to teach him that no one is going to lose their shit at him if he spills something or throws up in the car. Kid hasn't mentioned his father or the abuse directly, other than to tell cps his dad yells at him alot. When I asked cps they unhelpfully said I could either ""ease him into it or rip the band-aid off"" and I don't know what to do. I intend to get a 2 year no contact order when the temp one expires, I intend to get full custody with supervised visitation and knowing his dad it's not impossible he'll never see him again. What should I tell the kid? He seems pretty accepting and happy go lucky in general and idk what to do."	"OP, right now your son in many ways IS on vacation. He is figuring out how to allow his body to decompress, he is beginning to believe that people really aren’t going to scream at you or him every day, that life might be different. It might even be nice. He doesn’t have to worry about dad, his mood or anger, he doesn’t have to walk on egg shells. 
From the sounds of it your child has been so traumatized by this man he doesn’t care where he is, as long as he is not there with you. Knowing that Dad is at Grandpas puts him at a safe distance. As you have things settled, then you will be able to tell him what you are doing to make sure he is safe. That you talked to a judge and he decided that Dad can’t see us for a long time because he hurts us when he gets mad, and he isn’t allowed to do that. (Something like this, breaking it down to kid level) That if he ever has to see his Dad there will be someone with to make sure Dad is nice, and has to say nice things. I wouldn’t bring anything up until you notice him becoming concerned, or worried. Or if you decide to go back to your house, because then he will start to worry about where his Dad is again. Does that make sense? 

Congratulations on finally being able to get away. Be safe."	0	0	0	0.04773454740643501	0.011775016784667969
"Currently, talking about that chronophobia stuff, it's better by now. Didn't even think about that until recently which makes me feel kinda nervous/stressed again but not to a point where I can't do anything.  
Another matter, my parents kinda hate me right now (or at least don't really care about me) and I also do I hate myself too (not absolute hate, rather disliking) and I feel mentally trapped right now. Never got the motivation to do stuff and my plans with the uni are off now since I couldn't find any place because I didn't have a guarantor which almost always gets asked for in germany.  
All this kinda made me feel empty and meaningless."	"I'm sorry you are going through this!
 Feeling trapped sucks, and when we can't control anything happening around us we can start to direct that frustration inwards with self-hate, right when we need self live the most!

"It's not even their fault either. I finished my gymnasium degree just a few months ago, which is very bad, but finally at 26 I am done. The reason being was that I was struggling a lot with school as a kid, and then I isolated myself for a few years as I was older. The last 2-3 years I have been working so hard to finally complete my gymnasium degree. There were so many days where I just wanted to die, mainly because of how my entire life had turned out. 

Through all the hardships I managed to do it nontheless. It's just gymnasium, so nothing special at all in Sweden. Everyone has done it. I am now preparing for university next year, with the goal of studying computer science. 

Since coming out of isolation for all those years and talking to people again, has been very difficult. I feel like I am at a point where I would borderline feel infantilized talking to an 18 year old, being a 26 year old guy. There are so many life experiences which I lack, that everyone else my age and younger has.

I am constantly on edge when talking to people, because I am so afraid that they will bring up questions about my past that I would never be able to answer because of how ashamed I am over it. 

I feel like crying when I am talking to people and they speak about all their experiences, countries they visited, love, so on and so forth. I have missed out on all of this and I can not convince myself that I deserve any of it, because I don't have anything to offer as a person. 

My main motivation that I used to get through gymnasium was that once I am done, then I will no longer be ashamed. With gymnasium being the bare minimum, it should put me on an equal playing field with everyone else, so that I wont stand out too much. After finally finishing gymnasium I was crying tears of joy. Then those tears turned to sadness because I realized that it wasn't enough and until I am done with my university degree, that I shouldn't try to make friends or maybe even more.

I truly hate the way my life has turned out. I am trying to do the best out of this terrible situation. I will never be able to catch up on all of life experiences which I missed out on. It almost feels like people my age and sometimes even younger, feel way older when I talk to them, because of how pretty much sheltered I was for a large part of my adulthood."	"How many times has someone brought up you past?
You think it might be a irrational fear?
Most of the time we ourselves are our biggest critics and hatters, you tell yourself that people will question and judge for your past doings when you are the only one bringing up and questioning your past.

I think college is going to be great for you, and you will fit right in, This is the time where you make friends, at university. And trust me MANY of them are the same age as you. You are still nearly ten years younger than me and I’m in college, As far as being sheltered, ahhh I don’t know, I think you will find many kindred spirits you would be surprised.

You'd be surprised how few people who seg goals for themselves actually achieves it so celebrate even the smallest goals 

All i can say about the last part is there will always be someone whith less than what you have, to you it may look like everyone is living their best life which could be true but that's doesn't mean you can live your best life with what you have, you need to stop magnifying the negative in your life because it might just not be that big of an issue when you take your lens off and start looking at the positives, the negativity will consume you and will darken your view on the world but the negativity is all but just a tiny spec on a much larger portrait."	0	0	2	0.0018812974449247122	0.001795649528503418

Hi guys, 
I Just feel that I need to tell someone about my doubts. Basically, I am 20, full time employeed in a quite high-earning job (especially considering my age), studying part-time petroleum engineering at the top ranked STEM university in my country, I work out every second day, I keep my diet clean, I never do drugs/smoking/alcohol, I'm 6,6 feet tall and I think that I'm quite mature for my age. The problem is, that I basically don't have ""Access"" to girls my age. At my job I work only with men, and I study also with only men (let's be honest, petroleum engineering isn't so popular amongst women). I've tried tinder, organised group trips to the mountains, science clubs at my university, even approaching women directly at festivals. None of these methods worked. I've never been in a relationship before, and until I was 19 years old (when I finally went to see a doc and got meds) I struggeled with extreme OCD and social anxiety, so I didn't made any female-friends in the secondary school or earlier in my education (I lived in Norway before secondary school, where, originating from Poland, I got bullied for my ethnicity, and it didn't help me making friends, especially considering my struggle with OCD and social anxiety back them). That's basically it, I try to not think too much about it and rather focus on self-development, however back in my head there is allways this crippling fear that I've missed my shot, and that it is too late for me to ever find a partner that would be attractive and compatible to me. I can especially feel it, when I see couples walking down the streets, or riding in a car together. It's an extremely awful feeling, that stays with me, althought I try to mute it by focusing on my career and gym. However this feeling never quite goes totally away. So, what should I try to do? How should I accept my past?

You’re 20 u have plenty of time and i think you should honestly hold off on dating anyway. Get your mental health in order first 100% there are ppl who dont get married till mid 30s. U shouldnt even be concerned until 30. Really wait until you’re sure ur ready and ur able to support a family, no point in dating someone if yr not in a position to take care of them	1	0	0	0.018529707565903664	0.007000088691711426

Hello, I am an Italian boy. Since I was little, I have experienced one problem after another. As a child I was often in the hospital because I couldn't balance, I would fall, and I was always bumping around. Once I even hit my head against a chimney, fortunately turned off. Besides that, when I was 3 years old my parents separated. I remember little of my life before that, I only have a vague memory of my father yelling at me and another of the whole family sitting together at the table. My two older brothers grew up in a happy family, and I constantly had to choose between being with my mother or my father. Then at school I was always excluded, always the one in the corner by myself, the last one, ostracized. And it's still like that. I'm tired of it all. I'm tired of making fake smiles at home. I'm tired of making fake smiles school and everywhere. The only friend I had hasn't spoken to me in a few years, I'm completely alone. And sad.	"Hi u/IlSanniX,

"alt account for this one, im 15M and i have black curly/wavy hair, i love having a small curly fringe sit on my forehead. its been getting kind of long and me and my dad and my mom were out, and we went to a turkish barber, (i went to him last time and it was decent) i told him to do it exactly like last time but a bit *LONGER*. Now it looks like i have a big lump of shit on my head, i told him to keep it curly, he brought it all back. There is nothing i can do now since i can only just wait. 

im not exaggerating when i say i have to mentally prepare myself to look in the mirror, ive had a breakdown 3 times already (im not that sensible, its the first time i cried in months)
and i got this yesterday, saturday and i have a match on monday, and im going out with my girlfriend on tuesday. she says it looks good
from snaps, but im afraid shes going to change her mind when she sees it in real life.

to give you an idea of how lobotomised this haircut is: imagine a facebook post of a pakistani kid, on his first day of school, with his uniform on, a forced smile and a forced haircut. I cant stand my face in the reflection of my phone. 
it completely killed my self confidence, im feeling suicidal, depressed and cant be bothered to do anything. and its going to stay like this for another month, even when it marinates its going to look terrible. 

thank you for reading"	"My daughter had a similar reaction to a haircut she got where the hairstylist completely ignored the pictures she was shown and gave her a really short cut in a different style. The feelings you have right now are valid but the harm is temporary.

Odds are that no one will say anything bad to you about the haircut but if they do, blame the blame the barber. He didn't do what you asked him to, this is his fault, not yours. Don't be embarrassed.  Use this as a lesson and always show a picture to the barber in the future of exactly what you want and don't pay if they get it wrong.

As unhappy as you are right now, this will pass. Hair grows and feelings fade in time. Each day will get just a little bit better until this is just a distant memory."	1	2	0	0.9927805066108704	0.008823156356811523

thank you for reading"	"Honestly, I've been giving myself haircuts as right now I can't afford to pay $40 bucks to go to the Barber I want to (and yes, I only trust him because supercuts never cuts it). Simply take a raizor and cut it all bald. That is, if you don't mind the buzz cut look. 

It's taken a few times but I've gotten better at giving myself a decent fau hawk. I know it's not for everyone but hey, I've at least saved a lot of money and I just shave it all off if I don't cut it to my liking. 

Aside from all that, I'm sure it's not all that bad. People are not as fixated on you as you think. Meaning, I see people on the street everyday that wear clothes or styles I'd never do and even sometimes find weird, but after they're out of my sight, I forget about them. I'm not sitting here thinking, oh what a disgusting individual blah blah blah. No, I just go on with my life.

Even if you think it looks weird, most likely people don't care as much as you think they do. Most of the time people are more concerned with themselves and what's going on in their lives. It's gonna be ok bro."	0	2	0	0.6993256211280823	0.01022946834564209

thank you for reading"	i get like this and at least for you it will get better, while as with some like me, it's gone permanently or destroyed permanently. If you mean it is too short and the shape is wrong, even this can be fixed. You need to wait until you are rational. You see, I am like that -- horribly horribly despondent and hopeless when I look like crap. Yet the next day or later on, it's not like much has changed, I don't think. So this means that we are letting our emotions alter our perception. Perhaps the perception has BASIS in fact but it is not ALL of the fact, you see? My theory is almost anything, even bad plastic surgery, can be fixed. It might not be immediately fixed, which we would want -- but it is fixable. I'm telling you, this is fixable. Since I can't see it or know the exact issue, I'm thinking it would help you to take a step back from the situation, mentally. I mean for all I know it looks really good, and you just don't realize it. But I know what you mean.	1	2	0	0.994690477848053	0.006596624851226807

Plus, hair is such a personal thing and if it goes wrong--and especially if it's tied to self-esteem--I know it is absolutely a miserable feeling: hurt, frustration, anger, knocked down. At least that's my version. Sometimes I spiral in it. Things that do help me: stopping looking in the mirror, having someone I trust tell me it looks just fine, telling myself hair grows (and then using oils and head massages to encourage hair growth), BREATHE. Tell yourself this isn't life or death. Find things to do to distract you from obsessing about your hair. Think how much more well off you are than so many other people. Do something loving for yourself: eat ice cream, go to the movies, take a swim or hot bath.

"When the year started my young brother of the age of 8 at the time got diagnosed with some sort of cell dysfunction and he spent around 3 months in and out of the hospital.Considering that we are on a pretty underdeveloped country in EU then the doctor didn't know what to do.We had thought of a plan to go to Turkey to get him well some sort of cute but then he fell into a coma.After around 2 weeks in the coma he passed away.
The two things I regret the most are about how I treated him his whole life and that I didn't visit him nearly enough while he was going on and of the hospital."

I (y14,t.f) have a gf (y16,f),2 weeks ago she tryied to commit suicide due to one of her ""firends"" who made up some things,its a long rabbithole but basicly her neighbour sexually assulted her multiple times and she just found out that her neighbours are her bestie's aunt and uncle,her friend try to take revenge by putting her dad in prison. warning!this is where the story starts to be a bit redecilous but bare with me here,we are in romania,its a corupt and broken country.
To save her dad she tryied to commit suicide by sliceing her wrists,she failed and she wound up in the hospital,she luckly wasent sent to the ward,in romania mental hospitals are pretty below avrage,its more of an open prison so they can feel safe knowing a punk that they dont care about wont die. My gf had to go to counceling and had to take anti-depresents,i told her to not take them and she didnt want to either,her mother is a addict for those pills and she doesnt want to end up like her,i dont want her to change since there is nothing wrong with her. At counceling,yesterday to be exact,she felt uncomftrable with some of the questions and didnt answer them,i am the only person she has full trust in,i help her a lot with her mental health as much as i can,becose she refused to answer she was put in a psych ward,i am devistated,she needs certain things that most people dont, for example shes a really picky eater and she needs to take pills becose she is vegan,i support her on being vegan but its hard to take care of,its a long distance relationship and im really scared,she has no phone,we useually feel eachothers feelings,i feel when shes sad and when she cryies,she does too for me,it feels weird,its almost like youre sad for something that you dont know what it is. Shes alone,scared and misses me,i hope she will get out on good behaviour and a bribe,tommorow il get to talk to her,on of our friends is going to visit her tommorow,he promiced he will call me and hand the phone to ada so i can talk to her. I feel lost,our friendgrup is kinda dead now since everyone is with theyr own plans,my bestfriend randomly stopped texting us for no reason,we did nothing out of the ordinary,i really need someone to take care of me and tell me good night,my best friend used to do that but he stopped texting in the worst moment."

I know, everyone thinks I’m a freak too. I’m fifteen and throughout my life, my personality has remained consistent. I have always felt isolated and overlooked, with few people paying attention to me. Initially, I believed this was due to my perceived lack of attractiveness, but I soon realized that wasn't the true cause. My social skills have always been subpar, and they worsened  after enduring severe bullying at my previous school last year. I’m in a new school now. I’ve been in an all-girls school all my life. These girls have known each another for over three years. The inability to form new friendships and the feeling of emptiness weigh heavily on me. Witnessing others enjoy loud laughter with their friends only amplifies my anxiety. People often shoot me dirty looks and find me peculiar because I don't conform to societal norms. Like, Is it abnormal to enjoy reading book while everyone in class is loudly talking to one another? As a fifteen-year-old, adults assure me that life will improve after I graduate from school. However, I remain unsure of what exactly is wrong with me. I have a good heart, achieve decent grades, strangers compliment me from time to time and am incredibly generous. So why do others treat me as an outsider? This feeling is so prevalent in school, where long-established friendships exclude me. Sometimes, even strangers seem to do the same. Perhaps it's because I struggle to engage with people and have horrible social anxiety-I am undeniably a terrible conversationalist. It seems that people also perceive me as a freak, which I find somewhat amusing	1	2	0	0.9964798092842102	0.002247631549835205

I can totally relate to your struggle, especially in my early days. What has helped me address my anxiety is talking to a therapist, practicing social exercises, knowing what my triggers are, preparing conversations in advance, getting a good night's sleep always, limiting caffeine, and exploring how I view the world and why. Have you tried any of these things by any chance?	1	2	0	0.001315596280619502	0.0006430745124816895

You aren't weird just different, to make them like you would mean changing yourself to fit their views(pretending) which isn't advisable because you could become miserable.

What do you do? Absolutely nothing. Simply say hi to people when you go into work and continue as you have.

Some of the senior employees have been pointing out what a great job I’m doing. And it’s only because I spend 100 percent of my time working and avoid office socializing lol. 

It makes me feel really good about myself tbh. But it alienates me even more from my coworkers. 

This one woman in particular seems to hate me even more, since me overworking makes her look lazy in comparison. She talks so much trash behind my back when I’m nothing but nice to her. 

The only time she speaks to me is to say “you don’t need to work so hard, the lawyers don’t even notice or appreciate it (we are paralegals)”. Which isn’t true, since many of them have approached me personally to point out how efficient my work has been and helpful I’m being (I’m new at this job, but I have been going above and beyond to avoid getting fired or pushed out by not being a “cultural fit”).  She tries to encourage me to do less work constantly lol. But then she is extremely harsh and critical of any mistake I make and tries to embarrass me in front of coworkers

The only way to avoid getting kicked out of jobs is for me to get on the good side of management and show my work adds value. Cause I can’t win people over by being funny and likable or social. My coworkers dislike me more every day and they resent me for actually doing my job and not sitting there socializing. Not like they try to include me anymore, most of them think I’m extremely boring or childlike and weird. 

Some people at work do like me, but those are only higher up people who don’t have to socialize with me. But they appreciate my work ethic"	0	2	0	0.9984760880470276	0.010190367698669434

Even if they are super nice and friendly to begin with. They always pick up on my anxiety and alien behavior. Il

I’ve managed to alienate all my coworkers in a matter of weeks. I don’t know how one person can be so unlikeable. 

People (especially other girls) get so uncomfortable around me and they think I’m naive or mentally delayed. People are afraid to swear around me and think I’m devoutly religious for some reason. 

I also have a British accent and grew up attending sheltered religious private schools. So this likely impacted my social development and made me overly formal, deferential, and reserved."	Yea the problem is that I drink tons of coffee and soda all day (overload of caffeine). And then I combine Prozac with Vyvanse, so I’m getting an overload of serotonin and this increases my anxiety. But it simultaneously makes me more outgoing and helps me to get tons of work done. So idk what to do. People think I’m weird and anxious on meds. But they think I’m quiet and sluggish and depressing without them	0	2	0	0.003563304664567113	0.0028484463691711426
"Today I was coming back to hotel I took an elevator I was alone but then some girl came to elevator too I was scared I didnt looked at her but she started a conversation about do I enjoy my stay at hotel and is it my first time in Austria. I said Yes and thats its very nice here she then asked me where i was from i said I was from poland and stuff she asked about weather. When elevator finally stopped at my floor I thanked her and got off as fast as I can and go to my room.
I felt happy I could actually talk without stutters or weird mumbling im kinda happy even tho this conversation was kinda one sided cause most of things I said was ""yes"" ""no"" but im still happy and the elevator ride felt like it was going up forever"	It sounds like you did a good job with the conversation.

“Just ignore them” is very hard to do, especially at an age at which you are still trying to find out who you are and want to feel like you belong. So I won’t say that. 

And you might not even be able ignore them for those 8 hours of school. 

But hopefully you can enjoy yourself when you get home.  That can get you through these years.  I loved going home and engaging in my hobbies throughout high school (and still do). I Fuckin loved weekends - nonstop PlayStation/movies/sports and I could sleep in until 1 pm.  

And, once you get past these years, I believe you’ll have developed a very thick skin, mature attitude, and ways to deal with tough situations…these qualities can help you go very far in life.

Good luck - a middle aged dude, with a pretty decently paying job that i actually like (which is rare from what I see) a great spouse and an awesome toddler."	1	2	0	0.0014702678890898824	0.0020406246185302734

Please know that these years will end! Focus on stuff that fills your life and makes you happy. You’ll have a lot easier time being confident if you love yourself and love your life. Having hobbies your passionate about makes it easier to connect w others too!

Know that kids like that (bullies) are EXTREMELY insecure deep down and need to project that pain outward to make themselves feel better. Which is pretty sad/pathetic if you think about it. Someone like that doesn’t deserve your brain space. 

You might get advice telling you to be hyper macho or aggressive—I dissuade this. Ppl like that are just as miserable as the bullies and trying to compensate. Stand up for yourself and people if you need to but don’t let anger eat at your soul. 

Maybe there’s some other socially anxious kids around you—you should reach out. If there’s any time to practice confidence, it’s high school!! 2 years and you’ll probably never have to see these ppl again! Try stuff, fuck up, and don’t care what any of those dillweeds think

I think when youre young, it really feels like school is the entire universe and your whole life. But there’s more to come. 

As someone who was very shy in their youth, I wish I’d tried a little harder to push my comfort and make some friends. I’d encourage you to use this special time in your life and take risks! Maybe it’ll change your life! Some kid out there would be very lucky to be your friend!"	2	0	0	0.9201177954673767	0.12725567817687988

You mentioned that there were a few who took the time to talk to you and understand you. I'd say that you should keep those people in your circle and communicate with them. And when they say insensitive things which to them is a joke but to you isnt, you should tell them that. If they're really understanding people, they should get that they're making you uncomfortable. No relationship can go further if you dont understand and respect eachother. So never lower your standards, and keep trying to communicate the best way you can. 
Even with all those other people, try to express and communicate as well as you can. You're at an age when you're figuring yourself and your environment out, so its natural to try different things. Your personality isnt fixed, you have the right to try bettering yourself, even if its at communication and socialising. 

My biggest trouble at your age used to be my inability to express myself and my too kind nature. I was so bad at expressing my troubles; i was one of those people who was always smiling and lying. But i went through a difficult phase at 16, kept trying to figure out what was wrong and better myself, and it worked to a good extent. I got better at putting myself first and expressing matters i couldnt before. (But unlike you, my troubles werent about my peers. The people around me were good thankfully). 
I was trying to say that, you arent fixed to any definitions. You can explore and keep becoming better versions of yourself. As messed up as it sounds, humans are social creatures, thats why our peers and social groups can affect us so much. So its only natural that we want to have a good standing in it. But at the same time trying not to lose ourselves. 

I truly wish the best for you. Never succumb to their views of you. I know it hurts. But you'll find good people, now or later on in your life. And kids become more mature in college. In school, most are just all over the place trying to figure themseleves out and reflecting their own insecurities in the worst way."	1	0	0	0.004867883399128914	0.0017900466918945312

I can imagine it’s hard to ignore comments like that and to feel like everyone sees you as something you’re not. I relate a lot to what you’ve said in this post, I was just like you in high school. 

You sound smart and like you know yourself and already understand how kids your age are being kids your age/bullies. Still it doesn’t make comments like “school shooter” or “kidnapper” ok. I will echo what others have said in the comments and say I think it’s a solid idea to push back when people say stuff like that. I was always taught by adults in my life to “let it go” and “be the bigger person” but I’ve learned since becoming older, there will always be someone chirping about something and while yes, sometimes it is definitely beneficial to let it go and take the high road, it is also a necessary skill to be able to shut things down because those people will try to walk on you otherwise and you need to defend yourself against them. 

A simple “shut the hell up bro” or something along those lines goes a long way I think. It doesn’t have to be over the top or some big scene but push back and defend yourself. 

Second, I would suggest leaning into the relationships with those people who take the time to get to know you. That is the biggest way I carried myself through middle and high school, amongst all the popularity contests and shit. I had my people who I loved and who loved me so it was easier to feel like I had my place and the rest of it didn’t matter. All you need is a few good people who actually see you and who you like. 

Idk for sure if you’re in the US but there is definitely an extrovert bias here. It does get better as you get older, people will stop saying things like “kidnapper” but you will still get a few “gotta watch out for the quiet ones” or things that feel weird and obtuse like you’re being singled out for just being yourself/existing. That is something you just have to decide how you’ll deal with, unless you want to try and learn ways to blend in more. You can make a joke about it, have a canned comeback, or something else but also remember that there are a ton of other people like you who are experiencing the same thing for the same reasons. It’s stupid but you’re not alone in it. I look for other quiet people to befriend because we’re already on the same wavelength with that. 

Lastly, I would see if there’s a counselor who you can talk to at school if you’re up for that. Just someone to validate your feelings and to support you and boost you up. They don’t always help but maybe that little extra support, having one more person in your corner may make a difference. Might be worth a try if that’s available to you. Also, I think it’s just worth telling an adult about all of this anyway, if you haven’t already. 

Again, I’m sorry this is happening. You sound like a good person, someone who I probably would have been friends with in HS. If all else fails, maybe try to find the humor in it and also tell them to fuck off or something. Fck them tho, seriously. Good luck dude!"	2	2	0	0.005732898600399494	0.012486279010772705

How about a part time job, as speaking to customers may help you overcome shyness as well as meeting other people. Although school is the focus of your life now, it will pass and life always moves on. Keep busy doing things you love and don’t worry about what other people think.

This has completely demotivated me from making friends at all. I fear that I'll be seen as a creep even if I try to socialize. It's not even that I look bad or something, I just have a bad rep for no reason. If I'm called to talk in class, I always hear the reaction of ""he can talk??????"". It's as if I'm not even seen as another person by them.

When it comes to the rare few I have talked to, they don't even know my name. They refer to me as ""Tyrone"", ""Lebron"", or some other random name. Sometimes I'm just reduced to ""white boy"". I get that it's all light hearted, but it's pretty damn demeaning. I'd like to speak up about it, but I fear I'll just be shut down instantly with how kids my age are.

There are a few kind people who have taken the time to actually understand who I am. The majority of them are women. However, any time I am speaking with them, somebody always has to say something like ""W Rizz"" (even though I'm talking to them completely platonically) and it just makes things awkward. It seems like I'm seen as a joke everywhere around school. I wish people around me would understand that I'm a human being with feelings.

At some point last year, we were to do group projects in an English class. The teacher assigned groups based off who was friends with each other, and, seeing as I had no friends in the class, I got paired up with people who had special needs. This wouldn't have been a problem if it weren't for the fact that not only was the entire workload up to me for the quarter, but I was beginning to be seen as special needs myself. I haven't even been diagnosed for any neurodivergence. This only made people make fun of me even more.

They’ll grow up and be less annoying to be around. You sound like a nice person and lots of people value that trait. You’ll find those people. Focus on your school work and grades and try not to internalize it. Nice people are taken for granted at your age, and most ages too.	1	0	0	0.9961091876029968	0.026349782943725586

Even now I still find myself feeling scrutinized and treated as a joke, sometimes even by my own friends. 

Now, I'm not going to tell you to just ignore them, because it is not easy, and completely invalidates how unfair their behavior is to you. 

Unfortunately, there aren't many ways to change your bullies' minds. I've found that with most bullies there is no way to humanize yourself to them. You will never get their validation. 

But what you can do is fortify yourself and validate your own beliefs so that what other people say about you becomes irrelevant. An exercise that I'm trying is writing down my beliefs and  values and things that are important to me on a piece of paper, and then promising myself I'm going to stick to those values, that I'm going to be honest, respectful, and empathetic no matter what other people say or do. That way, I'm less focused on what other people are saying, and more on how my actions reflect on ME as a person. 

Remember, bullies actions are a reflection of THEM, not of you. As long as you stick to what you believe in and what you feel is the right thing, you can always remind yourself that it's not your fault. 

Finally, the world is much bigger than your bullies. I felt trapped, because it was all I was surrounded by every day. But in my sophomore year, I've met so many new people and I'm surprised that there are this many kind people at my high school. Don't give up hope. There is always at least one kind person out there. 

Also, I'm not a licensed professional, but I am a 16F who has been through the same situation, and I hope this will help."	1	2	0	0.004227109719067812	0.0023044943809509277

One thing I want you to do is to stop saying you're a ""failure"". No one is a failure. There are people who need help and support. Try to be nice to yourself. It takes practice, but it's helped me. I got to be about 30 years old and realized I'd been abusive to myself my whole life. It doesn't help. 

Another thing is having a hobby, activity, sport, or skill. Learn something for you. It massively helped my self esteem in high school having a sport, even though I wasn't good. 

Your self esteem is important, and it will help you weather the storm of high school and high school bullies.It gives you resilience and a different perspective. It might give you a sense of control. Hopefully you'll start to care less about them, even though they suck. There's not much anybody can do about other people's behavior, but we can change our own. We can change our behavior, and how we react.

Please don't hesitate to reach out to a trusted adult and/or therapist. You are a great person, and you deserve happiness."	1	2	0	0.0017358019249513745	0.007191777229309082

Defend because those people are being assholes and you feel your peace is being disturbed but try not to let them control the way you feel about yourself and know that you ultimately have the power over the way you feel—not these emotionally stunted people. You never need to control someone externally to change how you feel, that being said, there is a social order to the way we interact, words mean things, these people are old enough to know that and it’s definitely reasonable to push back on those who are being shitty to you. You are not obligated to sit back and listen while someone refers to you as a school shooter and it would not make you any less moral or mature to tell them to shut the fuck up. Realistically, they are probably less likely to pick on you if they see you’re going to call them out on it. 

A lot of important things were articulated well in this comment!"	1	2	0	0.0016091696452349424	0.16582542657852173
"As a 16 year old in high school, I do relatively well grades-wise. However, when it comes to socializing, I'm a failure. I don't really talk unless I'm talked to, which is close to never. I get that it's kind of on me that I don't have many friends, but that's aside from the point. Besides, I'm sure my RBF is probably to blame as well.

Due to me being quiet, it seems that everybody around me makes up terrible and untrue things about me. Some that I hear a lot are ""school shooter"", ""kidnapper"", and (my personal favorite) ""The Riddler from The Batman"". I have never really understood why.

Whenever I have computer-based classes (such as coding or web design), I'm typically the first one people come to for help. I don't really know why, but it has the potential to make my week. It forces me to get out of my comfort zone, while having people be grateful for my help while I do what I enjoy. I've found that helping others makes for good experiences with classmates. Maybe if I reached out to others more, I would have a better experience in school. Thank you.	0	2	0	0.001225873944349587	0.0007021427154541016

Since I'm forced to stay in my current school, I guess just enduring the 2 years would be the way to go.

It is typically onlookers who have nothing better to do. But, I should be working on reinforcing that I don't believe the things being said to who I'm talking to. My lack of doing that is probably just what makes things even more awkward. I do like the thought that high school is my time to experiment socially. I agree that I shouldn't lose sight of myself, just because I don't fit the social norm around me. Thank you.	0	2	0	0.992990255355835	0.0015898942947387695

As for culture, American teens just seem much more decadent than those of many other countries.

One example from last year was whenever that Jeffrey Dahmer show on Netflix picked up traction, and how everybody actively talked about avoiding me when they found out Dahmer was a quiet outcast in school. Being infamous for absolutely nothing was awful. I seriously should've said something, or at least made it known to an authority figure. This coming school year, I think I'll try to go out of my way and make friends with other quiet people. That sounds like a good idea.	1	2	0	0.007261657156050205	0.0015500783920288086

While extracurriculars and jobs are off the table for me due to familial factors, I have been considering getting into martial arts to meet more people.

I get that it's kind of on me that I don't have many friends, but that's aside from the point. Besides, I'm sure my RBF is probably to blame as well.

Due to me being quiet, it seems that everybody around me makes up terrible and untrue things about me. Some that I hear a lot are ""school shooter"", ""kidnapper"", and (my personal favorite) ""The Riddler from The Batman"". I have never really understood why. Isn't being called a school shooter what can cause one? It's not like I would even want to hurt anybody around me.

This has completely demotivated me from making friends at all. I fear that I'll be seen as a creep even if I try to socialize. It's not even that I look bad or something, I just have a bad rep for no reason. If I'm called to talk in class, I always hear the reaction of ""he can talk??????"". It's as if I'm not even seen as another person by them.

When it comes to the rare few I have talked to, they don't even know my name. They refer to me as ""Tyrone"", ""Lebron"", or some other random name. Sometimes I'm just reduced to ""white boy"". I get that it's all light hearted, but it's pretty damn demeaning. I'd like to speak up about it, but I fear I'll just be shut down instantly with how kids my age are.

There are a few kind people who have taken the time to actually understand who I am. The majority of them are women. However, any time I am speaking with them, somebody always has to say something like ""W Rizz"" (even though I'm talking to them completely platonically) and it just makes things awkward. It seems like I'm seen as a joke everywhere around school. I wish people around me would understand that I'm a human being with feelings.

At some point last year, we were to do group projects in an English class. The teacher assigned groups based off who was friends with each other, and, seeing as I had no friends in the class, I got paired up with people who had special needs. This wouldn't have been a problem if it weren't for the fact that not only was the entire workload up to me for the quarter, but I was beginning to be seen as special needs myself. I haven't even been diagnosed for any neurodivergence. This only made people make fun of me even more.

As much as I want to get through high school, the people around me make it a living hell. What should I do? I would love to ignore them, but it's pretty hard when it's everywhere I go. I just want to be seen as an actual human being."	Thank you. Hopefully focusing on my schoolwork makes things better in the long run. The people who pick on me aren't factors as to how successful my life will be. Though, I do hope I grow out of being too nice. It has complicated things for a while.	1	2	0	0.0014185522450134158	0.0024629831314086914

The more I hear about it the more I’m feeling this is actually bullying and not just one off comments here and there like I was assuming before. If it’s repeated comments from the same people then I definitely think you should tell an adult because bullying isn’t ok at all and someone needs to give them consequences for their actions. 

Yes I just want to reiterate though that you’re not bad for not having pushed back on them before. It’s hard to do that especially if you didn’t grow up being taught to do that or have no experience with people who pick on you like mean siblings or something. Being assertive to mean people is a skill many adults even have a problem with, confrontation can be scary and hard. So don’t feel bad for not having said something before but feel empowered to make some attempts going forward to push back on stuff like that. You’re already making some good choices by seeking support on here. You don’t have to face this alone and I believe in you!"	0	2	2	0.9948198199272156	0.0440138578414917

"(M30). Have had OCD, anxiety, health anxiety since I was little.

A year ago I was lying in bed to sleep, it was the middle of the night. Suddenly out of nowhere I find it hard to breathe, I get palpitations and a burning sensation in my chest. I get out of bed thinking I'm having a heart attack. I go to the emergency room and after EKG (ECG), tests, blood test and blood pressure measurement, they send me home.

I contact the local health center as after that episode I started to have irregular heartbeats. The doctors take my blood test, urine test, they do an EKG on me, and all values look good. My doctor concludes that it is anxiety and panic, so I see a psychologist. I have trauma from childhood and the year before (2021) my grandmother passed away suddenly, my grandmother who raised me (basically).

I continued to contact the local practitioner as I could wake up in the middle of the night completely out of breath and a racing heart. I am constantly worried about having heart disease, such as a stroke or heart attack, but the doctors say my heart is normal.

I continued to have heart palpitations several days a week, had constant chest pressure and chest pain and finally got a referral to a heart specialist clinic. There they connected me to machines, did an echocardiogram, ultrasound and I had to perform a test where I cycled while connected to machines. According to the results, my heart is normal.

I keep waking up at night with my breath in my throat, the feeling of someone strangling me, pain in my stomach and pressure on my chest and a constant worry and fear of death. I go back to university in 2 weeks, looking forward to that, but really don’t want this shit to affect my studies and social interactions too much. 

I don’t know what to do. Really. I’m on the edge my family members have had it, they don’t want to hear it and they think I’m crazy. I’ve always been an anxious kid, I’m afraid of dying constantly and I think about that a lot, but since I had that one “major” panic attack, my life has changed completely and I haven’t felt well for over a year now. 

I see a therapist, but not that often, once a month maybe (your typical underfunded Scandinavian free health care office). But I’ll have more appointments in the autumn. But i think about trying CBT.

Also, one thing that gets me to relax is meditation, East Asian calming music and Tibetan bowls. I’m thinking about learning Transcendental Meditation."	You are not alone , I had a panic attack this Thursday and until now I am experiencing pressure on my chest and back which sucks , even when I am not feeling anxious .

"(M30). Have had OCD, anxiety, health anxiety since I was little.

A year ago I was lying in bed to sleep, it was the middle of the night. Suddenly out of nowhere I find it hard to breathe, I get palpitations and a burning sensation in my chest. I get out of bed thinking I'm having a heart attack. I go to the emergency room and after EKG (ECG), tests, blood test and blood pressure measurement, they send me home.

I contact the local health center as after that episode I started to have irregular heartbeats. The doctors take my blood test, urine test, they do an EKG on me, and all values look good. My doctor concludes that it is anxiety and panic, so I see a psychologist. I have trauma from childhood and the year before (2021) my grandmother passed away suddenly, my grandmother who raised me (basically).

I continued to contact the local practitioner as I could wake up in the middle of the night completely out of breath and a racing heart. I am constantly worried about having heart disease, such as a stroke or heart attack, but the doctors say my heart is normal.

I continued to have heart palpitations several days a week, had constant chest pressure and chest pain and finally got a referral to a heart specialist clinic. There they connected me to machines, did an echocardiogram, ultrasound and I had to perform a test where I cycled while connected to machines. According to the results, my heart is normal.

I keep waking up at night with my breath in my throat, the feeling of someone strangling me, pain in my stomach and pressure on my chest and a constant worry and fear of death. I go back to university in 2 weeks, looking forward to that, but really don’t want this shit to affect my studies and social interactions too much. 

I don’t know what to do. Really. I’m on the edge my family members have had it, they don’t want to hear it and they think I’m crazy. I’ve always been an anxious kid, I’m afraid of dying constantly and I think about that a lot, but since I had that one “major” panic attack, my life has changed completely and I haven’t felt well for over a year now. 

I see a therapist, but not that often, once a month maybe (your typical underfunded Scandinavian free health care office). But I’ll have more appointments in the autumn. But i think about trying CBT.

Also, one thing that gets me to relax is meditation, East Asian calming music and Tibetan bowls. I’m thinking about learning Transcendental Meditation."	Thank you so much for you kind words, and if it gets to that, I might take you up on that offer. Thanks once again. Have a safe and great day/night, and I hope your anxious feelings go away as soon as possible.	1	0	0	0.0011848101858049631	0.0006669163703918457

Hi all, first of all i’m NOT asking for a diagnosis. Been to the GP several times. Just searching for some insights and opinions..

So there’s some things I’ve been struggling with for years. Father died in 2013 of cancer, had very difficult years after in which I didn’t grieve his death. Also had a very manipulative girlfriend from 2013 tot 2018. Been also having OCD since I were a kid.

When that relationship ended I started to develop a cough and bowel issues. I saw that my stools were thin and weird. Saw my GP for both issues, but she assured me it would be nothing. Health anxiety started to get worse and I started getting panic attacks. Years passed and the symptoms didn’t go away. Went to my GP so many times to get reassurance about my health..

Last year in april I moved to a new place with my new girlfriend who is my fiancée today! Around that time I felt a very hard immovable lump in my neck that freaked me out. Started worrying about cancer and convinced myself I had it. Went to my GP who referred me for an echo, but nothing weird. Could be an extra rib they said in the hospital. Anyhow, that lump freaked me out to the MAX and I developed an one sided headache at that time. It’s more of like a head pressure around my right temple that sometimes radiates to the neck. It’s literally always there from waking up to going to sleep. Doesn’t wake me up tho. Developed (in my imagination) one sided weakness on the left side, which suddenly went away. The cough I had for years disappeared out of nothing but now I’m left with this one sided head pressure that’s constantly there for 14 months now. Also since a couple of months occasionally a weird smell. For some hours my smell gets distorted and then out of nothing (usually after sleeping) it resets. Bloods are perfect and did some neuro tests (reflexes, pupils etc) and everything is OK. GP doesn’t see a need for an MRI because if it were a brain tumor she’d likely see something in the tests and the symptoms would’ve gotten waayy worse over the course of a year. Also still left with bowel issues. Never a solid stool, always gassy and stools smell bad. Thought I had blood in my stool but my GP said it was undigested foods. Also a constant pressure in my lower left abdomen. Don’t know what to do now, doc says it’s all because of high amounts of stress I put my body to.

Is it really possible that I have this one sided constant pressure because of something psychomatic for so long? It didn’t get worse over time. Also the bowel movements, could this really be stress for so many years? Doc also said bowel cancer usually gives anemia, which i don’t have. Also have strong depersonalization issues for some years which worsened A LOT the last couple of weeks.. no one notices anything. 

I sometimes think I developed bowel cancer some years ago and last year it metastized to my brain and have it there also since. Is this something realistic or am I not being sober in this? Is my heavy derealization from a tumor or more likely the anxiety and trauma’s. Last weeks everything feels very fake.

I would think.. if it were something so serious, something would’ve happened by now right? The phantosmia, the head pressure (that sometimes gets really mild almost not noticable), (perceived) weakness and pulsating tingling in left side of the body would’ve developed significantly if it were really something right? This derealization is not cool.. want to feel normal again..

Sorry for my english btw, I’m dutch."	Oddly enough I have had the same experience. I have ibs c, thin flat stools. Multiple colonoscopies   and xrays and ct scans and blood work. Now I am experiencing pressure in my head, numbness in face and neck, and all kinds of stuff. Could all be gut and anxiety related. I'm sorry your going through this, it is kinda comforting to know it's not just me.	0	2	0	0.998056948184967	0.0013154149055480957

Perhaps try reaching out to one of the authors of the paper to see who their liaison at the VA was? I believe it's through the VA Office of Compassionate Innovation, but I haven't the faintest idea who the point of contact would be.

Edit - a little further investigation reveals that at least some of the authors work at the Sagol Center in Israel, so maybe less helpful than I thought, especially if you're one of the authors.

If that's the case, perhaps the Undersea Medicine laboratory at the VA, or maybe the National Center for PTSD which conducts research through the VA.

Thank you for your comment!
  

  
While the VA manuscript does make reference to our study, it's important to note that there have been subsequent data and publications since then. We are currently summarizing the results of a comprehensive, placebo-controlled trial that seems promising and will hopefully be published soon.
  

  
The issue at hand is that there are hyperbaric centers with a treatment that can help suffering veterans. We possess academic data supporting the effectiveness of this treatment. The challenge now is to find a way to connect these dots using modern platforms without having to wait several years, which is typically required when solely following the academic path."	1	2	0	0.005218432284891605	0.0005690455436706543

There are studies and publications and some of the data that exists today was not existed during the VA review of the topic.

As previously mentioned, hyperbaric therapy for veterans with PTSD is currently being prescribed in Israel, supported by available data. In 2017, the VA also prescribed HBOT for veterans with chronic PTSD in Washington. However, it is crucial to emphasize the importance of using the appropriate treatment protocol and having a thorough understanding of how to address challenges that may arise during the treatment course.

Using inadequate protocols could lead to incorrect conclusions and risk losing the potential benefits of this effective therapeutic approach."	0	2	0	0.98121577501297	0.0005991458892822266

I'm pretty much 10 years older than you and my life is not ideal, I've been struggling with various things lately. Breakups, depression etc. I still feel like I'm not where I want to be as an adult. And you're 10 years younger than me, with a kid! The one thing I thought is damn, if you manage to fix things up now (even if it's slow and gradual) you are going to be so much more a man/rounded person in 10 years time than I am at my age today. 

Like this is an opportunity to grow and harden, learn from what went wrong. I didn't really have any major difficult things to deal with until recently (moved to a new country, broke up with the girl I came here to be with, lol, etc.) And just now am I realising that these hard times can benefit you, as they encourage you to grow.

Sounds kind of stupid or redundant but you have a lot of shit going on, and you're super young. I would be struggling in your position, I can't imagine myself dealing with these adult problems at age 18. Trust me, if you just accept that not everything is going to be perfect immediately, and that progress is a slow daily thing, you will be proud of the man you'll become in your 20s. Don't think too much about ""mistakes"" other than learn from them and apply what you learned to the future. You can't change the past but you're going to be so much more switched on as you go into your 20s than 99% of guys.

Idk if my message made sense, but I wish you the best and shout-out to the Netherlands :) you guys are so friendly, I've been there a lot lately and it's great"	1	2	0	0.00138401472941041	0.005259692668914795

Normally i don't write depressing shit about myself but i just can't take it anymore seriously.                     
 I have always been a happy person and had lot of well (Friends) i thought but it all went downhill...

First of all im 18 years old with a child, How you ask? my girl lied about using contraceptives and decided to keep the child and afterwards cheated on me. I love the child to death but thinking he grows up with parents seperated so early and seeing him not much breaks my heart in pieces. I keep trying to hold all that weight and keep going forward to do the best for my child but then i realised my friends hated me and used me for my car and money. So all the childhood friends with good memories just didn't give a f about me. I tried to tell my parents but they didn't take me seriously and just said i need to be a man and be there for my child, All easy said when you've been dealing with depression almost all your life and when you finally build yourself up in position that you're happy... you get shot with multiple arrows at once and fall all the way back down, when this time you have no one to help you. I also lost my job recently due a miscommunication and im in a big financial problem now. I feel like no girls like me or even find me attractive when im literally behaving as myself and still take care of myself.

All my life it's been a journey of dragging myself up and get shot down every... single... time...              
 Say what you want about me that it's partly my fault, because yes it is. But making mistakes is a part of life but honestly i just can't bear the weight anymore.

The message is long but i just need to express myself somewhere.

Sorry if the message is written poorly it's because im Dutch

"So here I am- one of many nights where I feel sexually frustrated and horny. I suppose I have my hands and porn, or my hands and my imagination. And maybe I will get the usual from a lot of dudes and beaus: one side will call me out as a lazy fuck who needs to work on self improvement which really just translates to ""go to the gym, freshen up your wardrobe, get offline, go outside and meet people, and find a good stable career"". The problem with these dudes is they don't know anything but Marvel or some other nonsense. Theatre, Shakespeare, Literature, Music, dance, film, sociology, philosophy, history, art- they know nothing. They would be pretty dumb founded if you asked them about any books or authors. Their brains work like a Campbell's soup commercial. A taxidermist couldn't fish out anything of any value. I've seen how stupid and vulgar they often are showing off themselves in mirrors and confabulating on the latest tech- and they will always increase the victimization of any other men with any real challenges by blaming them as being responsible for their victimization. They also use men in subordinative and domineering ways to make themselves feel superior. This often is given off as them trying to be helpful when really they are just patronizing as fuck! So I would rather not even be a fucking dude anymore- maybe become trans not to have to be associated with these worthless men.

Then there are the women out here who are hyper vigilant and on patrol for anyone who might in anyway aggress them and force themselves upon them, or manipulate them. And it can feel like walking on pins and needles and they aren't always clear because simply they don't trust you- and there are some of us who will never earn that trust because... ""you just carry a vibe!"" And to these women I jerking off, looking at porn, and my profile page- I am condemned immediately! No questions, buts, or ifs about it. I am the villain! Don't I know of their free choice and rights?! Don't I know the oppression they have faced for aeons?! Don't I know how common rape and sexual assault is?! I should not act entitled- how dare I! ""YOU ARE AN INCEL!!"" And there are plenty of men who will come loud and proud to this argument, championing it like a white knight. One of these men that I know personally will also lecture me in being a vegetarian because of all the methane produced by cows while he meanwhile pollutes the environment with bit-coin mining!

And all I have said in any of this was about being lonely and sexually frustrated, admitted to porn and jerking off- nothing else- and yeah the porn industry is fucking toxic and there's a history of abuse, violating and exploiting women, and getting them so fucked out of their minds that they would agree to anything on set- and yeah Harvey Weinstein and Hugh Hefner are scum. I agree with everything. I also find that the sexual exploitation simply reversed its direction with Onlyfans and much of the Reddit posers on here exploit lonely and disaffected men emotionally while wrapping it in sugar coated sex. Some content creators don't do this- but most do. The former victimization of women is not rectified by victimizing later the opposing group in which oppressors came from. It doesn't work this way. This is the same thing that happens in other ways too. Most men are NOT Harvey Weinstein's or Jeffrey Epstein's! These are a few successful assholes who acquired their magnificence through exploiting others who worshipped them- and these assholes exist with both dicks and pussies. And yet we as a society continue to worship assholes and when things get too sticky we destroy them and pretend like we weren't to blame and go worship an asshole from another label group. So all men are assholes. Now it's women. Then all women are assholes. Maybe all whites are assholes. Then all blacks. Or all Asians. Or whatever fuck! Assholes exist regardless of gender or race or political affiliation or nationality or religion! 

And I have nothing more to account for than my own actions in this world. I am a white male on the autism spectrum and I may do bad things because of my ""privilege"" but I also may do bad things because of media exposure and me being on the spectrum? But I am only responsible for my actions in as much as I can and have been aware of what I do. I cannot be accountable for people prior to me who passed on their genes to me and I can only be but so accountable to ignorance when in this world people mostly choose to fight and not explain things- not have any kind of patience because you set off a trigger, and because with all this stupid tech there is a pollution of pseudo- info and each person seems to live in their own bubble of knowledge like MGS2 forecasted. 

So I look at all this and look at the toxic men and toxic women I meet regularly- men who gaslight me,  dehumanize me, and are totally vapid and condescend me; and I look at women who are hyper vigilant, flaky, unapproachable, have double meanings, unpredictable, insecure, angry, dog worshipping, psychologically baggage dumping, emotionally fake, noncommittal, aggressively interested then not, operating as a surrogate persona of their former ex to which they are bound, or addicted to attention- and I don't want any of it. I'd rather just be acknowledged and engaged with as a person a priori!!!! I am a person fundamentally before my gender! Do I have to become trans just not to deal with all the garbage of both men and women.

Why do so many men seem to gravitate to me as we have something in common as both being losers in the gender wars and being sexually frustrated?! All else doesn't exist. I mean I get the frustration and depression- but I am so much more than this as a person- and to be seen either by men or women as I am often seen reduces and dehumanizes me on some level I feel. I never make any magical memories with my co-depairers or those who see me as the potential target to lash out against. It's always purely about them and I am part of the stage set of their play. So yeah it really is best to find someone who is trans- but then I have to be careful with a lot of trans to female because too many try to mimic the toxicity of women. But men who trans to women usually do not mimic male toxicity I have noticed. I can have a emotionally mature bond without the domination and stupid cultural crap.

Maybe I am all off on everything I am saying here. But I am writing how I see it and what I have been exposed to. I am also suffering from severe disassociation, trauma and shut down most of the time and feel like all the people who try to connect with me- both men and women are just going to dump me without second thought- use and dump me. I make a great deal of effort to connect and process various people and understand them. Often it exhausts me with how much they wish to share and all these words and concepts I can barely connect with and videos they send- and I have to reread many times and feel so dumb. I don't mind this too much- but what I do mind is that this person will go through all of this just to forget about me and move on sometime this or the next month, or week! I know it's a big thing to say- but it feels like a form of emotional rape. And both men and women do this crap.

So the trauma and disassociation I referred to above probably has a lot to do with all the abandonment and neglect I've known since birth pretty much which really makes it hard for me to get invested or care about gender, race, conservatism or Liberalism, or any of the issues current today. I have always felt left out, excluded, and marginalized. I don't know what a partner looks like- but also not what friends or family looks like! Hell, I don't know what love and care looks like because those who were most often the most eager to give out hugs and warm words were the freshest to leave without any explanation or thought. This is not far from being different than a lady who has had a one night stand and feels dirty afterwards because there was never any love and she was just used. At least she might have some family and/or friends to return home to. This has not been true for me.

I couldn't even cry when the one person who did really care and stay was killed by the police- Jasper Aaron Lynch. I couldn't cry because of how surreal it felt just to have had your deepest bond be someone you knew mostly digitally and saw in life only three times- and this best friend who called you his best had the photos to remember things with with other people- not with you. 

So what does love mean? please I need to know this. And don't lecture me about porn because I hate it too- but I also realize that even the die hard porn hater who is a straight as the cross conservative Christian watches YouTube and frequents Disney films- and these things are all family with porn

See porn is not just bad because of the toxicity regarding sex to both men and women- but it's even more fundamentally bad in how it reduces the social habitat of being human and gives a mere approximation- a toxic one to a human's needs- and frankly all social media and the entertainment industry is built on this- pipe dreams in the ass of everyone who will take a seat!

It's all parasocial engagement. the people do not care about you and it takes a part of life- a part that should be there to live!- and caramelizes it to get you addicted: You watch great sex instead of having real sex yourself with someone you care about and want to be intimate with and stay with- a person you wake up to and feel fuzzy and warm with; you watch a Disney movie where characters seem to be spontaneous and invite fun into their daily lives because you are too pencil screwed to ever make light of things and co-create with another, you are adulting; you watch content creators on YouTube and read blogs to engage intellectually because you can't ever have intellectually deep conversations with any of your teachers, who teach thousands of students and don't care about you, or your friends who are too busy and just want to have a good time.

Frankly the people who create your intelligence and amusement are of the same breed who give rise to your libido- none of these people exist! They are golden calves of one form of idolatry or another!

I just don't know how to survive anymore with all this. I can't seem to find anyone- and if I do it is again online which is by its nature non-committal.  I can't care about the gender wars when I find myself thrown into the fray because of hormones and intimacy frustration when the human race has really not included me. Your concerns are not even real because I have lived an entirety of life being unreal and disposable. I don't know what anything really means anymore including someone who wants me to become a Christian because I was left behind. I don't know if ultimately everything is just reducible to a machine and everything is constructed off of simply hurting each and everything- and we are both so complicated and so stupid to point the finger everywhere but ourselves and label ""the other"" as the group doing the hurting."

I'm sorry to hear that you're going through a difficult time at school. It's important to remember that you are not alone and that what you're experiencing is not your fault. It's also important to understand that you have options and resources available to you.

Firstly, it might be helpful to talk to a trusted friend, family member, or teacher about what you're going through. Having someone to confide in can provide emotional support and help you feel less alone.

Additionally, it might be helpful to speak to a mental health professional, such as a therapist or counselor. They can provide you with coping strategies and support to manage your feelings of sadness and overwhelm.

It's also important to take care of yourself physically. Engaging in regular exercise, eating a healthy diet, and getting enough sleep can all help to improve your mood and overall well-being.

Lastly, remember that your worth is not defined by what others say or think about you. You deserve to be treated with respect and kindness, and it's important to surround yourself with people who uplift and support you.

Hang in there, and know that things can get better."	2	0	0	0.0023332813289016485	0.0006629824638366699

Bro 17cm (6.69 in) is great , you see huge in porn but I’m 7 inches (probably 18-19cm) and it’s very possible for me to go too deep and hurt my girl. Girls will almost always have been with someone bigger , and girls will ALWAYS find someone more attractive than you because that’s life. I’m a super skinny white dude probably about 5’9 , no tone you can see my rib cage and I’m just good to my woman and it works. You gotta turn up bro that meat is above average , and while most girls have been with bigger (if they’ve been with 4+ men) , a lot of girls haven’t and a lot of girls are cool with even 5 inches	0	2	0	0.0017541034612804651	0.026206135749816895

Female here ✋️ I Initially clicked on this post because my husband of 15 years has similar insecurities. But ad far as I can tell, they come from watching porn, which of course mostly shows men of bigger proportion. You know what I tell him? Those look like they would hurt! He is the average size, if not a bit bigger, and I thoroughly enjoy being with him. It isn't all about the size! When you have a true, intimate connection with someone, it feels amazing to share that intimacy. Plus, a females g spot is about an inch or so inside the vagina, so why do you need more than the average. If you know what you're doing to pleasure your partner, you don't have to worry about size.	0	2	0	0.0012784488499164581	0.06277364492416382

"Hi. I am 21 and I have huge mental health problems that I can solve only by getting a job. I have a terrible relationship with my parents.
 
My mother tries to be a good mother, but she is a Soviet dummy from what was once a person. A lot of things hurt me, a lot of things that she personally did hurt me, but in conversation she will never admit it and will deny everything, if she does not start accusing me in the spirit of ""how could I do otherwise? you didn't obey me?"".

 My father showed practically no involvement in my upbringing. He was always there, but I don't feel warm looking at him, I don't have warm memories. He's a good man, you don't understand, just broken, broken by the Afghan war.He just don't know how to love, and too afraid to try. 

 My sister with two children and her husband is now in Russia, and my best friend is in Ukraine (he is safe in Ternopil. Air defense works well).
I want to go there, help people,volunteer , do something in life at least once at the call of my own heart, and not under the strict control of my mother to meet public expectations. 

All I have to do is study.  Studying by myself ,long and hard, but for half a year, by the end of the summer, I just have to get a job and leave. I understand that no one from the family will understand my action, they never idid. I tried to explain to them that what is happening is a horror. Sometimes they even agreed with me. But they are so hooked on the propaganda needle that every conversation starts from the same place every day. 
I live in constant stress and fear, very often I think about the moment of my death and how short life it's all so intense it's immobilizing. Sedatives don't help much. I just need something to help reduce stress, relax a little, and do what I have to. If you know any techniques or practices, please share!"	The best thing you can do is exercise.

"I’m so sick of going online every day and seeing all men get lumped together in derogatory statements. I have horrendous self esteem and self worth issues, and have all of my life.

Groupthink and tribalism are inherently harmful. It is crucial to empathize with other groups, steer clear of echo chambers, and have self-worth. Just as women face misogyny, men must disassociate themselves from bigotry and hate speech.

The most constructive approach is to acknowledge the legitimacy of your emotions and connect with individuals who share similar values, regardless of gender."	0	0	0	0.9979891777038574	0.0024524331092834473

Any legit criticism, you should try and understand that people are being hyperbolic and don’t literally mean all men. Also, many of these people are speaking from a place of pain. Try and expand your circles, and take a break from all of this online social media that is giving you this false perception of the world. When I hear criticism about a demographic that I match, I ask myself if I’m perpetuating what they have grievance over- and if not, I say “it’s not for me” and move on. Something men do not learn early enough in life is that one of the greatest super powers is calmness.	1	0	0	0.026370065286755562	0.002964496612548828

The majority of people are sheep and the government, the consumer industry, the entertainment industry, the media, and social media all know this and use it to their advantage to control people. The reason why all these outlets are doing this is that they know females are the biggest consumers and spenders of money, so they will do whatever kind of manipulation to get on females sides to have them spend more money in anyway possible. Women are so easily indoctrinated to follow whatever trends that are current at time because they are naturally biological followers. 

We are seeing more misandry and man hating now because this is societies attempt to get more men to conform by shaming men to the point of submitting to the gynocentric agenda they are pushing, this is why you see misandry being glorified and misogyny being vilified. What everyone has to understand is that the media is controlled and regulated by the government, so if all the media outlets are controlled by the government and people are controlled by the media, essentially people are controlled by the government. 

The reason I say all of this is because I am a man that has always been an very observant person and opened my mind to see things from the outside looking in. I see the blatant misandry and female empowerment that has flooded our society in recent years and it's easy to put those two together to see what the agenda is and the narrative they are pushing. This is how the government wants to control people by indoctrinating and brainwashing them with this narrative until it just becomes the norm.

The media is going to force feed female empowerment in every way possible which is why you see more and more things being feminized in the movies and on TV. You see the shaming tactics being used on men by putting shaming labels on a man if he is a certain way or does certain things that aren't masculine and don't live up to what society considers masculine or manly. But society will also shame a man by being ""too masculine"" and call him toxic or having toxic masculinity."	0	0	0	0.9767406582832336	0.5133203268051147

Just because I can understand it doesn’t mean it doesn’t hurt still."	"the question you need to ask yourself when you see those things is ""is that me? am i part of the problem?""

seeing someone say ""men are awful they mistreat women"" can certainly hurt, and you are entirely valid in feeling that way. we can't control our feelings as they're just not rational and instead rooted in things much deeper than our rational mind. what you DO with that feeling, however, is a choice and can lead to self-reflection and growth. you may say no, i dont mistreat women, but as a straight cisgender man, there could absolutely be blind spots where you may unknowingly be causing harm or perpetuating patriarchal attitudes that do hurt and mistreat women.

the thing is its very, very easily for those who don't want to hear that message to see something qualified appropriately and then go ""that's not about me!"" when it actually is. we see a lot of men who mistreat women in say, ""manosphere"" type spaces who very much mistreat women but fully deny doing so, even though the message is directed at them. people sloganize things because it gets the message out there that there is a problem, and those who then want to engage with that message get to move beyond the intro course into an actual discussion of ""here is what we mean"". it's a lot easier and snappier to say ""men suck for hurting women"" than ""there are a great deal of men who cause women pain, whether by overt misogyny or through more subtle means such as ignoring the impact of this pain, that all work to perpetuate societal and structural pressure and oppression on women"". 

more often than not, what is shared it shared from a place of personal experience and pain. men have hurt the people who say these things in a whole myriad of ways. so approach it with empathy, for both that person and yourself. understand that they are allowed to feel hurt for what they experienced, and ask yourself if what they're describing is something you might be doing. then, rather than allowing than internalizing that, go ""okay, i dont want to be that person, let me see what i can do better so im not that person"". you will not only show yourself to be an empathic ally, but also come out as a better person. a win-win that can be easier said than done, but it is very much possible.

also, i would be remiss to not recommend the book i recommend to anyone who self-image and self-worth hurdles. healing the shame that binds you by john bradshaw. he has an hour long talk that gives you the basis of the book that's a good way to see if it resonates with you. https://youtu.be/UBAAgdRHWlM

The moment i do I’m met with “there is no misandry” and accusations of being an incel, as though voicing concern at having my psyche whipped everyday could somehow make me think women owe me sex or mistreat them. No. I just makes me think a lot of people out there hates me until they get to know me. It’s shit like this that makes me immense grateful (not proud) that I’m a straight, white, cismale, because I’d have offed myself a long time ago from the increased hate from others for being anything else.

Edit: It seems I need to clarify some stuff. I understand why people say these things. My ex wife was assaulted once as a child, my mother was multiple times, and so were my cousins. I understand some people’s reasoning behind distrust of men in general. I also don’t feel like they are addressing me personally when people say these things. My issue is that it makes me feel subhuman that it is socially acceptable to make derogatory blanket statements about men or to attack men when they express how such statements make them feel. And don’t even get me started on how much it hurts that there are people that would try to get others to fear me by default simple because of what’s between my legs. Just because I can understand it doesn’t mean it doesn’t hurt still."	Reminds me of the release after adhd tantrum	0	2	0	0.9944520592689514	0.0006699562072753906
"I’m so sick of going online every day and seeing all men get lumped together in derogatory statements. I have horrendous self esteem and self worth issues, and have all of my life. So every time I see one of these comments or memes about how men are useless, how we’re scum, how we mistreat women, etc., it kicks me down even further.

"I know it might sound bad, but when I was 20 I experienced a psychosis.  Over the course of fifteen years we finally got me stable on medicine and disability income, help from parents, and part time kitchen work.

If anyone has questions for me to clarify please ask.

I wanted to go to gradschool to study afro Caribbean music and religion.  I've been slowly learning those music's on the congas since I was 24.  As I was white, and crazy, so to speak, I burned many bridges with local musicians, who were black.

Anyway I like to continue drumming and continue learning Kung Fu while working for USPS, and I want to read the books in my area of interest.

Is this possible for my future?

I'm interested in Carl Jung and psychoanalysis, Karl Marx, comparative religion myth and folklore,  anthropology, African and Caribbean studies and literature.




I feel really really fucking bad that I can't do whatever the fuck I'd be able to do with a religion or folklore or ethnomusicology PhD.

I haven't had sex in fifteen years.

Things have been getting dark for me.

Ive been holding out for gradschool so I can move to Caribbean or something and learn the drums better.

It looks like that will probably never happen

But maybe getting stable with a USPS job is a good move"	Getting a stable job is good, you can't do anything else without a source of income. Studies wise, you can study what you want, just don't expect to get money or status from it. Music and arts are very saturated with a lot of competition. You should be doing it for the love of getting better, not any external reward.	1	0	0	0.00469118682667613	0.0018297433853149414
"Hello Friends, let me tell you about a self-help technique called journaling. Journaling is the practice of writing every single day. You can practically write about anything you want. You can write about your emotions, you can plan out your day, you can philosophize about life. Journaling is an ancient technique, a perfect example of this is Marcus Aurelius's journal, his Meditations. The stoics used to have different practices and methods to make the most out of their journaling sessions, and they included different excersizes like writng about the finitude of life, writing about their values, and reflecting on their days and what they can do to be better the next day.

I have been experimenting with journaling for years and I wanted to share with you the outline I use to start and end my days and my weeks which keeps me sane, organized, focused, confident, and in harmony with my goals and motivations. Here it is:

\- Start by mentioning 5 things I like, appreciate, love, and admire about myself.

\- Then appreciate 3 things I am thankful for.

\- Write down my short term goals (1 month to 6 months).

\- Write down my medium term goals (6 months to 5 years).

\- Write down my long term goals (5years forward). The idea is that my there should be little fluctuation specially in my medium and long term goals.

\- Plan out my day in google calendar.

\- Space to write about personal things troubling me.

\- If Monday, plan my workload for the week. Once I make a plan, I cannot change it for the week.

\- If Sunday, analyze this weeks workload and think about changes and improvements for the following week.

\- Night

\- Write down 3 things I did right today.

\- Write down 3 things I could do better.

\- Write down 3 things I am thankful for.

\- Thank God.

I recommend you try my outline for a week or two and then tell me what you think about it! I would love to hear your experiences.

Good luck to you all,

Ivan Berezin"	Nice outline, thank you!	0	0	0	0.001232492970302701	0.0007216334342956543
"
I’m from a town of 12,000 inhabitants in southern Europe. During the ‘90s, I suffered bullying from the age of 7 to 17.
Today, I ran into the person who bullied me the most during my adolescence while I was at a café with my parents (my father is 75, and my mother is 67). He was with friends, his partner, and a newborn baby, and I didn’t want to do anything, but seeing so much normalcy and happiness for someone who caused so much pain wasn’t fair. It lasted for over 10 years.

After changing schools, the nightmare continued, but he was the one who started it all and relentlessly focused on me. He also became obsessed with my brother and my parents, and we felt powerless to do anything about it. The reason for his obsession was my overweight.

My parents feel that they didn’t do enough to protect me from that person. The bullying I endured because of them (him in particular) is impossible to put into words: all sorts of humiliations, threats, insults, and persecutions. I always felt defenseless against them, and they always seemed to win. My parents went to the school and the police, but no one paid attention; they dismissed it as kids’ stuff. My father had been saying for a while that he didn’t want to die without confronting them. They even insulted my parents in public, calling us mentally unstable. For over 20 years, that person and their group of friends have been keeping tabs on me.

Today at the café, I did something ridiculous. I wrote a note, and my father gave it to this bully. In the note, I expressed that I hope he takes good care of their child because he has already caused too much harm and left too many victims, and no matter how he tries to be a good person now, they have caused pain. 

He confronted my father, and I stood up to him, telling him what I felt inside: that he will always be the terrible person who tried to harm us for over a decade, that he’s now a teacher, and I will do everything possible to get him fired because people like him shouldn’t be educating teenagers. He said hurtful things about my family, and his partner even sent me to therapy, which I, of course, did, and he was a significant cause of many problems I faced.

I didn’t want to bring up the past, but I know my parents felt hurt because he caused us harm, even threatening them when they were heads of the family, and they couldn’t do anything. It saddened me as a child that a classmate would do that to my parents just because they hated me for being overweight. Another thing that hurt me deeply is knowing that, all these years, I have been a topic of conversation among his friends, and they’ve been keeping tabs on me. One of his friends who works at a supermarket laughed at me, and I got fed up and called her a derogatory term. I know it’s not the right way to handle it, but I’m exhausted. 

After all this, I also feel quite sad for still living in the same town where there are people who take an interest in my life despite hating me so much, and I haven’t done anything to them.

All of this connects with my deepest wounds and the little girl who couldn’t defend herself, but now I can, and that’s why I spoke up today. In fact, to prevent further harm, I’m considering leaving a record with the police and explaining what happened. I’m not sure if it’s a good idea; what do you think? I would leave things as they are, but I’m afraid for my parents. What goes against me is that we acted foolishly with the note, but he escalated the situation, even though he was the one with a history of bullying."
