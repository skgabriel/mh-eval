function reviewres1(){alert(""Response: I'm so sorry to hear that you're going through this. Please remember, it's totally normal to want comfort and connection with a partner, but it's also important to be able to feel okay when you're alone. Here are some suggestions that might aid in dealing with your anxiety: First, try practicing mindfulness or meditation. It grounds you in the present moment and helps alleviate worries about the future. Apps like Headspace or Calm can guide you through this. Second, seek professional help. Therapists or counselors can teach you coping mechanisms and cognitive behavioral techniques. Third, openness is key. Discussing your feelings with your partner can lead to a better mutual understanding. They may also help to reassure you when you're apart. Lastly, take care of your physical health. Regular exercise, a balanced diet, and adequate sleep greatly improve mental wellbeing. Remember, it's okay to seek help and it's a sign of strength, not weakness. You are not alone in this and there are numerous resources available for you."");}","1.2: (Interpretations) Does the response communicate an understanding of the seeker’s experiences and feelings?

function reviewpost2(){alert(""Seeker Post: I live with my parents, who have no idea how bad my depression is. They think my room is messy because I'm lazy but in reality I just don't have the strength to clean it. I also suffer with sensory issues which makes cleaning harder. My room isn't even messy anymore; it's filthy. I mostly struggle with managing my bin, which has resulted in a rat infestation in my room. My parents don't know and I'm scared to tell them in case they get mad. But I don't know how to fix it on my own, especially since I don't do well with things like that. Unfortunately, I need to get my room clean in a week and I just don't know what to do. I've always struggled with cleaning but my depression has made everything so much harder, so I'm very worried that it won't get done in time. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you"");}

function reviewres2(){alert(""Response: It sounds like you're in a tough position, and I'm really sorry that you're feeling this way. In terms of your immediate issue of cleaning your room, I have a couple of suggestions. Firstly, you might want to consider using disposable gloves and putting on some music or a podcast to help you gain the strength to start the cleaning process. Try breaking it into small, manageable tasks. For example, you could focus on picking up any food waste first, then move on to other tasks. For the rat infestation, I would recommend getting professional help, as they can carry diseases and the infestation could spread. You might need to inform your parents about it. Remember, they are your build-in support network, they will likely want to help you when they see you're struggling. You can explain it as you need assistance dealing with an infestation and cleaning your room, no need to disclose your depression if you're not comfortable. In addition, keeping your environment clean can have positive effects on mental health. You can take small steps towards this every day. You might want to consider seeking help from a professional for managing your depression, as well. You don't have to go through this alone, and there are resources available to help you. And don't forget to celebrate your progress - every step forward is a victory. Let us know how things are going. And congratulations on making progress with your room! It's certainly not an easy task but you took on the challenge and that's a huge accomplishment. Keep going at your pace and don't forget to take care of yourself along the way. You've got this. Look after yourself, you're on the right path. Sending peace and strength your way."");}","1.2: (Interpretations) Does the response communicate an understanding of the seeker’s experiences and feelings? In what manner?

I don't know how to tell her to leave me alone. The best relationship we ever had was when I lived in another state. I moved back because of my dad, but now he's gone. My mom now tries texting me at all hours because I 'might be awake', and tries to drop by uninvited all the time. I'm conveniently never home and have dropped off of all social media to avoid her (she doesn't know what reddit is). Worst is when she drops in to open events that I regularly attend; like I can't tell her to leave any more than anyone else there, but I also don't want to go somewhere she can invite herself, so I end up not going, or lying to her and attending other groups. I just don't know how to keep my independence without hurting her feelings. I get that she's lonely, but I don't want to be her go-to person.

function reviewres3(){alert(""Response: I'm really sorry to hear about your predicament and your loss. It sounds like you're experiencing a difficult time, and it's absolutely fine to want your own space and independence. The first thing I'd recommend is finding a counsellor or therapist, even if it's online. They'll be well-equipped to help you manage your relationship with your mom during this emotional time. This isn't only for you but will benefit your mom too since you seem to understand she's also grieving, and she might need to speak to someone professional too. Then, would it be possible for you to have an open and compassionate conversation with your mom? You could explain that you're grieving too, just in a different way, which means wanting more space, and it doesn't mean you care any less. Assure her you don't want to push her away, but there needs to be a balance that keeps both of you comfortable. In addition, consider suggesting activities or hobbies for her to take part in, or if she would be open to it, a grief support group. This could provide her with the social interaction she seems to need right now and help her feel less lonely without over-relying on you. Most importantly, it's vital that you take care of your own mental and emotional health during this time. It's okay to set boundaries, and it's okay to grieve in your own way.

Understand that there’s no “right” pace to reply. People understand we all have lives, and sometimes a reply might take a little longer. Anxiety can be a challenge, but remember it's okay to step back and take care of yourself first. It's not about a 'good enough reason' to someone else, it's about you and your well-being. Start small and navigate through conversations at your own comfort level. Maybe try responding to messages once a day at a fixed time, so you can control when you interact with them. Being open about it could be a possibility as well. You'd be surprised how understanding people can be about anxiety. It’s a part of being human, it's not a reflection of who you are. Progress is not a linear journey, and it's great that you are noticing improvement and trying to reply more. Remember, every effort is a step forward. You're doing great! Keep going.

Before this we used to do great trips, London, USA etc which I enjoyed. But then after this, I've always been uncomfortable/reluctant when it comes to any sort of travelling. Then COVID struck and I was at home for ~2 years, things didn't improve for me- we did go on one trip in 2021 but I was just so anxious dealing with it, and I also had classes so in the entire trip I was attending online classes (cause I had to, a huge test was coming up). My problem is that I'm anxious before the trip happens and during it I'm completely fine. It's gotten better now tho, but not completely cured. Going alone or with friends seems like a mammoth task. Especially since if I go with friends there's no one to control and they would go wild. I know I need to get over this for the future. Any tips?"");}

I don’t mind the looks I get but I don’t want to hurt the people I care about I just want to protect them but if I can’t even stop myself from hurting then the how am I supposed to stop others.

function reviewres6(){alert(""Response: I would suggest you seek help in the form of mental health counseling to get to the root of the issue ASAP if you haven’t already. Physically hurting people is dangerous for them and can get you in serious trouble with the law, no matter the reason.

That’s do to the fact my mom had many jobs and was still in college while my father was an addict. I think this is where it came from I’m pretty sure. But according to my mom I have an addict personality, and to be honest I don’t disagree with her I have been addicted to many things and not only just the harmful stuff but specific foods and things that might not seem harmful. But they can most definitely be in large quantities. The reason why she said this is because she has plenty of evidence to support it. I have always been addicted to something ever since I was a kid I had an addiction wether if it was bad or good I had always had one. Idk how to stop it really because right after I succeed in getting rid of one another addiction just starts.

Also I had a small good conversation with someone which made me happy that moment. I was supposed to go to see my psychiatrist but I didn't go because I was scared. It's really hard to go there. But it's ok at least I tried to think about going there. I need to change my medicines. Overall I'm sad but not too much. Like 4/10. That's good.

function reviewres10(){alert(""Response: Hi there, Sorry to hear you've been going through such a tough time. But I commend you for acknowledging your feelings and sharing parts of your journey here. It's an important step. Burdening emotions like sadness or loneliness can be really overwhelming, but remember, change is a process, not an event. You've already moved from a 9/10 to a 4/10 and that's progress in itself. So, you're right. There's no fixed timeline for getting better. Sleep is really essential for our mental and physical health. To help crash the erratic sleep pattern, you could try relaxing activities before bedtime like reading or meditation. Going for a walk in nature can also help reset your body clock. It's understandable that you're scared to go to the psychiatrist—it can be really daunting. But seeking professional help is a crucial step, especially if it's about changing your medications. Try to focus on the help and relief you'll get after the visit, instead of the fear or discomfort you might feel. You could ask a friend to go with you for support. Remember, it's okay to have good moments too. Savour them, cherish them. The small conversation that made you happy is something to hold onto. It's these moments that show us there's still joy to be found, even in the toughest of times. Hold on to hope, you're far stronger than you realize. Here for you."");}","1.2: (Interpretations) Does the response communicate an understanding of the seeker’s experiences and feelings? In what manner?

Even if it’s a small bit. It helps make things just a tad brighter which can help guide you in making small changes.

My two older brothers grew up in a happy family, and I constantly had to choose between being with my mother or my father. Then at school I was always excluded, always the one in the corner by myself, the last one, ostracized. And it's still like that. I'm tired of it all. I'm tired of making fake smiles at home.

It can be truly helpful to share your story openly with them, you do not have to go through this alone. Remember, it's perfectly alright to express that you're not okay and ask for help. It's also okay to include your grandparents in this journey if it feels right to you. They might be more understanding than you expect. Surviving mental health challenges takes strength and patience, and please remember that it's okay you're not okay now. You're not alone in this journey, your thoughts and feelings are valid, and you're stronger than you believe. Reach out immediately when you are feeling this way. You matter and there are people ready to help.

function reviewpost14(){alert(""Seeker Post: Why does quietness or social awkwardness make people so uncomfortable? I feel like a leper or pariah.

function reviewres14(){alert(""Response: From your post, it sounds like you're feeling isolated and misunderstood. It’s important to remember that everyone has their own insecurities and social challenges, and you're not alone in feeling this way. Social awkwardness or quietness can sometimes make people uncomfortable simply because they may not be familiar with it. People tend to be comfortable with what they know. However, this doesn’t mean there's anything wrong with you. It's important to remember that not everyone's opinion of you defines your worth. Sometimes, differences can be intimidating or off-putting initially, but they can also be what make us unique and interesting. Your upbringing and cultural background are part of who you are, but they don’t have to limit your interactions or relationships. You might consider using these experiences as a foundation to build bridges with others by sharing some aspects of your history or culture. Also, if your quiet nature and anxiety are constant sources of distress, it may be beneficial to seek professional help. Talking to a therapist or counselor can provide methods to manage anxiety and develop more comfortable social skills. The key is to move at your own pace and not to judge yourself harshly. Additionally, finding supportive online communities who share similar experiences can also help alleviate feelings of loneliness or being an ''alien.'' You're unique and there’s a place in the world for you. All it takes is a bit of time to find your tribe. Remember, being different is not being defective. Embrace your differences and let them be your strength."");}","1.2: (Interpretations) Does the response communicate an understanding of the seeker’s experiences and feelings? In what manner?

But if you go looking for it, you'll just drive yourself crazy, and there's nothing you can fix anyway. I would try and find a way not to be too worried about what other people think of you. And it's **definitely** a losing game trying to guess how people feel about you - whether it's about racism or otherwise. ''What other people think of you is none of your business.'' - this is true for all of life, tbh. I know you're young and at [age] emotions are def tuned up to 11 and a half - no one can blame you for feeling nervous, hesitant, weary - especially in this particular news climate.

function reviewres17(){alert(""Response: I'm really sorry to hear that you're feeling this way, and it's absolutely valid that these feelings and experiences have led to this frustration. It's evident that you're grappling with some deeply ingrained societal biases and prejudices. The stress of being constantly stereotyped and boxed in can be very overwhelming. It's important to understand that these beliefs don't represent your worth or value as an individual. Speaking up and challenging these stereotypes, just as you're doing, is one of the key steps in combating this bias. Reach out to people who understand, who will listen, and those who will support you. It could be friends, family, or groups that aim to promote understanding and fight prejudice.                                                                                Additionally, consider seeking help from a professional counselor, who can provide strategies to cope with these feelings and situations. They may also help you in handling the stress and emotions from dealing with such issues. Online resources are available too; websites, blogs, podcasts, and forums dedicated to combating racial inequality. Remember, your identity is not defined by others' prejudices or stereotypes. You are wholly unique – You have the right to define who you are and be the best possible version of yourself that you can be. Please take care of your mental health, it's just as important as your physical health. You are seen, your struggle is acknowledged, and you are worthy of respect. Let's keep working towards a world where everyone is seen as an individual, regardless of their race or ethnicity."");}","1.2: (Interpretations) Does the response communicate an understanding of the seeker’s experiences and feelings?

function reviewres20(){alert(""Hey there, it sounds like you're going through a really tough time right now and I'm sorry you feel this way. It's completely okay to not have everything figured out and to allow time for the pieces to fall in place. When life throws you curveballs like this, it's important to acknowledge how you're feeling and give yourself room to breathe. When it comes to finding motivation and a sense of purpose again, perhaps you could reflect on the things that have given you joy or fulfillment in the past. Was there something else apart from your initial goal of going to the USA and doing your undergrad that really got you excited or passionate? I'd suggest breaking it down into smaller, achievable tasks and goals. It could be as simple as trying to find something new to learn each day. This might help to reignite that spark again in the meantime. Remember, it’s okay if your WHY changes or evolves over time based on various circumstances. You might find a new path and purpose that aligns with who you are now and where you're at in your journey. Take some time to focus on your physical and mental health - it’s important to look after yourself in these challenging times. You're not alone in feeling this way. Many of us struggle with a sense of direction and purpose, especially when plans don't work out as we expected. Just keep in mind: you're more resilient and adaptable than you might think. Hang in there and try to embrace the path of self-discovery that you're on, wherever it may lead. Lastly, don't hesitate to seek professional help if you feel too overwhelmed. There are resources available and people who are trained to assist in situations like these. You don't have to carry all this weight by yourself. Sending good vibes your way!

function reviewres24(){alert(""Response: Now that you have been honest and noticed where you can improve you can start. When you notice yourself on the phone while neglecting responsibilities, then put it down. Noticing gives you the decision to do something different. Practice having your attention on your tasks and doing them with gratitude and meaning. Don't indulge in negative thoughts that says ''I don't want to do this now'' ''I will rush through this task/responsibility so I can get to my phone''. Release all negative thoughts and emotions, by allowing them to come and go. And practice good thoughts/attitudes/feelings/actions. This is a process and takes practice and repetition. So forgive yourself (and others) when you make mistakes and just keep the intention and willingness to improve. Don't get stuck in guilt/regeret - rather use it to make your intention to improve stronger. Because constant guilt is a form of negativity and drags us down. How we feel, or in other words our attitude, influences how we see and react to life. Good attitudes gives us more power to learn and grow. Keep your goal/decision/intention alive. Your goal might be to use your phone less or to be responsible. Practice not contradicting your goal mentally, emotionally or by action. Although we usually do, because it's a process, and that's normal and fine, we just keep trying. No use in having a goal but thinking negatively about it the whole time. We must feel that it is possible."");}","1.2: (Interpretations) Does the response communicate an understanding of the seeker’s experiences and feelings? In what manner?

function reviewres26(){alert(""Response: I'm sorry to hear that you've been having such a tough time, but please know that you're not alone. There are so many in the world who strive to understand themselves better, especially when dealing with mental health issues. Psychiatrists help best they can with the knowledge they have, but remember, mental health is still a progressing field, and new discoveries are being made every day. I understand that you urgently need answers about your condition, but while the experts work on that, let's try together to manage your symptoms as best as we can. It's perfectly normal to want clarity about your situation, but the idea that ''you can't have a psychotic disorder if you know about your symptoms'' is not set in stone. Knowledge of your symptoms and their management could be seen as a strength, indicative of your self-awareness and resilience. Your regular medication is proof of that and is incredibly vital. While you seek further help, it may be beneficial to discuss these feelings and experiences with a trustworthy counselor or therapist. They can provide different strategies and tools to help manage the symptoms when they 'spill over.' Keeping a detailed log of when these symptoms occur, what triggers them, and your overall feelings before, during, and after each incident could potentially be a beneficial tool not only for you, but also for the professionals assisting you. Please continue to reach out, not just to professionals, but to supportive communities like this one. Remember, your experience is valid, and it's your proactive attitude in seeking clarity and understanding that is truly commendable. You're stronger than you realize, and every step, no matter how small it may seem, is progress towards better mental health."");}","1.2: (Interpretations) Does the response communicate an understanding of the seeker’s experiences and feelings?

function reviewpost28(){alert(""Seeker Post: I (>[age][gender], for full transparency) recently saw a social media post stating something along the lines of ''if you ask [gender] what love is, they'll list chores'' and I def don't dispute the general social and systemic spirit of the statement, but it made genuinely curious what love looks/sounds/feels like to [gender], [ethnicity] [gender] in particular. So what is love to you? What does it look like for someone to make you feel loved? In what ways do you want to be loved/how? What is a ''loving space'' for you? How do you show/give love to/on others? Bonus question: Any thoughts on separating loving someone from the act of re-enacting ''roles'' learned in (often traumatic) childhood wrt emotional attachments/connections (or lack thereof) with parents?"");}

function reviewres28(){alert(""Response: It's great to see such in-depth interest and sensitivity towards the perspective of others, especially regarding a topic as complex as love. Everyone experiences love differently, but one common theme is feeling understood, accepted, and cared for. A ''loving space'' for many may be a space of comfort, security and respect. Mental, emotional, and physical safety is likely to be a crucial element to feeling loved. Love can be shown in various ways, such as through acts of kindness, thoughtful gestures, open communication, or simply spending quality time together. As for your bonus question, separating love from re-enacting ''roles'' learned in childhood comes down to self-awareness and understanding one's patterns. Therapy or support communities can often help individuals to recognize and challenge these learned behaviors. Everyone deserves to experience a healthy and fulfilling connection that isn't marred by past traumas, and this is often a journey that requires a lot of personal work and introspection. Remember, this conversation is an open space without judgments for it can take a village to nurture one's understanding of love. Everyone's opinion will vary, and it's important to listen to as many perspectives as possible."");}","1.2: (Interpretations) Does the response communicate an understanding of the seeker’s experiences and feelings?

function reviewres29(){alert(""Response: It's natural for two individuals to have different views, even when they are in a relationship. The key is to respect each other's stance and come to a mutual understanding. Communicate your feelings calmly and express why you are concerned about excessive social media usage. It's not about limiting her freedom, but about maintaining a healthy balance. You can suggest activities that both of you could engage in which would lead to personal growth and bonding, instead of idling away on social media. Leading by example is a good start; spend less time on social media yourself and engage more in real-life activities. You may want to seek a professional relationship counselor's help if your conversations don't result in a resolution. Remember, a solution will only be sustainable if both parties agree willingly.

function reviewres30(){alert(""Response: Congratulations on 6 months of sobriety! That's a big step and you should be proud of yourself. Your medication regimen sounds like it's been carefully considered, although it's clear you're not feeling the way you want to. As I'm not a medical professional, I recommend discussing your symptoms in detail with your doctor to reassess the options. Remember, everyone's body responds differently to medication and it seems like you're still in the process of finding the right ''cocktail''. Everyone's recovery journey is different and sometimes it can take longer to find the right balance. Don't get discouraged. In the meantime, consider implementing some strategies for managing your anxiety and intrusive thoughts. Mindfulness exercises, deep breathing, journaling, or consistent physical activity can all potentially help manage symptoms of anxiety and depression. If appropriate, also consider speaking to a counselor or therapist for extra support on these issues. Remember, the key is not to go through this alone. Your healthcare professionals are there to assist you, and there are numerous support networks available for those battling addiction and mental health issues. You've already shown enormous strength. Hold onto that, it'll keep carrying you forward. The perfect mix for you is out there, and while it might take some time to find, you’re already on the path to discovering it. Best of luck—we’re all rooting for you."");}","1.2: (Interpretations) Does the response communicate an understanding of the seeker’s experiences and feelings? In what manner?

function reviewres32(){alert(""Response: It’s human nature to make judgements about something in a black and white manor. This especially plagued my high school life growing up, I’d always be thinking something about how I hate myself and I’m such a bad person because of the combination of negative experiences that illustrate the lack of skills that I value (aka being a bad person by ur own judgement.) The biggest idea that helped me was that no person is bad or good, as good and bad is really just a result of what you’ve come to understand about the world right now, including what others might think. The reality is that the experiences you’ve had are not only valid but human and they shaped who u r today whether u like it or not. There was not way to stop experiencing life and you can't change the past but the beautiful thing about being in the present moment and knowing that you couldn’t of done a better job living, cause the only requirement to experience life is to live. Nobody you meet may ever share the right advice, and that’s because the world is so diverse, everyone can’t be summed up by one experience or an ability. There’s people u’ll never understand, there’s experiences u’ll miss out on but the same goes both ways. Bad people only exist in comparison to others and comparing ur experiences with some life that u’ll never experience or understand the person behind that life is something that I’ve spent years doing, for a whole lot of jack shit."");}","1.2: (Interpretations) Does the response communicate an understanding of the seeker’s experiences and feelings?

function reviewres34(){alert(""Response: Hi there, thanks for sharing what you're going through. It can be tough dealing with physical changes and mental health struggles at the same time. Speaking from my experiences, it does seem like both can definitely influence each other. Weight can play a role in how much one sweats, although there are many individual factors at play. As you work towards your weight loss goal, it's encouraged to also pay attention to other ways to take care of your physical well-being such as maintaining a balanced diet and working on active methods of coping with your anxiety. As far as the depression and anxiety impacting this situation, our bodies can respond to these conditions in various ways which can include increased sweating. That being said, correlation is not causation and it's important to discuss these symptoms with a healthcare professional. With regards to your parents' worries about antiperspirants, it might be helpful to engage them in a conversation with a doctor. Often, they can provide appropriate guidance on safe and effective products. Remember, it's common to experience ups and downs while dealing with such challenges. Consistent self-care rituals, grounding exercises and coping strategies could help manage some of these symptoms. You also may want to consider speaking to a mental health professional about your social anxiety and changes in mood. P.S. it's okay to make a typo! We all do it 🙂"");}","1.2: (Interpretations) Does the response communicate an understanding of the seeker’s experiences and feelings? In what manner?

function reviewres39(){alert(""Response: I'm so sorry to hear that you're experiencing this. It's understandable to feel overwhelmed and scared given your experiences. No one should have to endure such trauma. I firstly want to commend you for reaching out and trying therapy -- it's a huge step towards taking care of your mental health. Therapy often takes time & the right professional for a breakthrough to occur. If therapy didn't work, it might be helpful to try a different therapist or approach such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) or Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR), which are known to help with PTSD symptoms. In addition to professional help, engaging in self-care activities and coping strategies yourself may be beneficial. Regular exercise, mindfulness meditation, relaxing hobbies, journaling your feelings, or simply taking long walks can help ease anxiety over time. One more crucial part - try to reach out to a support network of people who understand what you're going through. This might be a trusted person in your life, an online forum of people with similar experiences, or a local Self-Defense PTSD support group. Finally, don't hesitate to contact immediate help lines if you are feeling intense anxiety or panic attacks. Organizations like the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) or the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) have helplines that offer immediate assistance. Stay strong – help is out there and no situation is hopeless."");}","1.2: (Interpretations) Does the response communicate an understanding of the seeker’s experiences and feelings? In what manner?

function reviewpost40(){alert(""Seeker Post: I([age][gender]) see my gay friends have relationships wherein romantic interaction is not based on gender norms, both members of the relationship having creative freedom in how they choose to love each other. A strong majority of straight relationships seem to contain a gendered code of conduct that strips individuals from having a sense of creativity in their relationships. For one, basically all straight proposals are all done in the same way: man gets down on one knee with ring. On the other hand, gay relationships seem able to incorporate creativity and personal freedom in how such an event is done. As a straight person, I simply cannot accept how my relationships are almost guaranteed to be restrictive and boring."");}

function reviewres40(){alert(""Response: Definitely, breaking free from traditional norms and expectations can bring a breath of freshness into any relationship. The societal expectations you are referring to are based on stereotypical gender roles which are gradually changing. The first step towards having the type of relationship you admire in your gay friends starts with you. Be upfront with your partner about your desires for creativity, flexibility, and equality. Long-lasting relationships are built on openness as this sets the tone for the level of understanding each partner has about the other's needs and demands. Also, bear in mind that these 'rituals', like a man proposing on his knee, are merely norms. You could choose to do something completely different. The key is to find a partner who also respects and values individuality, creativity, and freedom. Talk to them about what you both want, rather than what society expects from you. You might even be surprised to find that many straight couples are also breaking away from the traditional norms and adopting more 'liberated' forms of romance. So, don't back yourself into the corner of the 'inevitable boring relationships'. You can and should create the relationship you desire.

function reviewpost46(){alert(""Seeker Post: My son is 8 and he has autism. We have therapists and support workers and he goes to a main stream school. He is happy and confident and loves going there. Today, another call from school - he was playing a game with some classmates and one of them got upset. He wanted to continue the game without them and a teacher pulled him up and told him off for not being a better friend. Because he argued they have decided that he can't be trusted to listen to teachers so can no longer do school field trips unless we take him ourselves. My son has never been invited to a birthday party or a play date. Every day at school pick up I hear kids say mean things about him. He ignores them. He got hit once, on purpose, he said they told him it was a game. It's fine for other kids to be mean with intent, but his not understanding social cues make it ok to bully and exclude him. My son may never get married or even have a partner, may never have kids, may never even get a job he loves because at 8 years old he is already written off. I'm exhausted trying to defend my son, I'm exhausted trying to teach him that the world is a kind place, that you help people and you care and it comes back to you...it doesn't. The outcomes for a child with his condition are not great, he has genetic factors that are life limiting. Iwill.likely outlive him. I want him to know he is loved, safe, that we see how funny and kind and smart he is. But the second we go out the front door people don't care, or it's too hard, or they are just mean. I failed as a [gender] before I even began. It's utterly lonely and I don't think I will ever forgive myself. No matter. How hard I try, no matter how much I advocate for him. I can't fix the world."");}

function reviewres46(){alert(""Response: I'm so sorry to hear that you're struggling in this situation. It's painfully obvious from your post just how much you care about your son. It sounds like you're doing an amazing job advocating for him. The world is a challenging place for those who are different, but with someone like you by his side, he's got a fighting chance. It's heartbreaking to hear about the exclusion your son is experiencing at school. Is it possible to discuss these issues with the school administration? It's important for them to understand that all children, including those with autism, need to be treated with respect and dignity. About monitoring field trips: It might be a good idea to recruit some of your close friends or family members who understand your son and his needs, so that they can be back-up support if you ever need help taking him. Don't blame yourself for anything. Your son's challenges are not your fault. It sounds like you're doing everything you can to give him a safe and loving environment. It can be distressingly lonely to shoulder these burdens. It's important to find support for you, too. A local autism support group might be a good place to start. They understand your struggles and could provide valuable advice and comfort. Keep in mind that love and understanding can make a huge difference in someone's life. Continue to show him that unconditional love, by doing so, you are continually shaping him to be a better person despite the obstacles. The society might judge him, but your home will always be a sanctuary where he feels loved, understood, and safe. And remember, no one writes off an individual's future at an age of 8. He has so much potential to unlock, you just need to find a way to help him tap into it. Lastly, allow yourself some grace. Parenthood, especially in complex circumstances, is a constant learning curve. You're doing the best you can and that's what most important. Please do reach out to professional assistance for your own mental health. You deserve support too.

function reviewpost48(){alert(""Seeker Post: Over the past few years - like most ppl - I’ve had a rough time with covid lockdown, plus then I was diagnosed with hiatal hernia, then divorce, and now financial pressures of single-handedly running a household. I was hoping to put this all behind me but last summer new symptoms started to appear: + IBS / GERD (hiatal hernia) + Cardiac arrythmias (thousands a day) + Various skin complaints. + Alopecia Barbae (beard patches) I’ve now had 9 months of all these symptoms and I’ve tried individual meds like beta blockers, PPI, tweaking diet, exercise with no luck... the docs say this is all because of going through a major life disruption and it’s due to underlying stress. The cardio and gerd stuff is so bad I’ve started avoiding stuff but I have CBT planned as a last resort treatment. Concerned the stress is permanently damaging my health. Anyone deal with anything similar? Go through a major event and suffer chronic stress? Any of these symptoms? Did they resolve after a time? How do you treat underlying, chronic stress?"");}

function reviewres48(){alert(""Response: Firstly, I want to send you an internet hug and say that it's incredibly difficult what you've been through and are still going through. Remember, it's okay not to be okay. When dealing with chronic stress, it's essential to focus not only on physical symptoms but also on emotional wellbeing. Isn't it interesting (and horribly frustrating) how our bodies react to stress? A multidisciplinary approach may work best, like you have with your CBT scheduled. It might be worth investing in emotional self-care routines too. This could include mindfulness exercises such as meditation or deep-breathing exercises. I have personally found an app called Headspace to be very helpful. Try to ensure you're getting enough sleep - poor sleep can exacerbate stress symptoms and focusing on good sleep hygiene can help. On tough days, remember, it's okay to dial down your expectations and just to do what you can. Finally, connecting with others who have similar experiences can be healing. There are many online forums and support groups dedicated to cardiac arrhythmias, GERD, and chronic stress that can offer advice and understanding. You're not alone. Please remember to always follow the advice provided by your healthcare professionals. They understand your health history and can tailor treatment plans accordingly. You're already doing so much to look after yourself, I wish you all the best in your journey towards wholesomeness!"");}","1.2: (Interpretations) Does the response communicate an understanding of the seeker’s experiences and feelings?
