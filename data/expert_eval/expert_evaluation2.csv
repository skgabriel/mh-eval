For the past three months I have been experiencing random small twitches all over my body is it ALS? Anxiety? Also could be it be a vitamin deficiency?,"Could trauma be involved? Very often, we store traumatic (or """"micro-traumatic"""") experiences in the brain and/or body and they show in vastly different psycho-somatic illnesses. I'm just having an uneducated guess here, it could be myriads of other things as well, of course.",Human,black
"I have intense separation anxiety when I’m away from my partner. And every time I leave them I begin to cry a lot. And when I’m away from them, the inside of my body feels terrible and i keep thinking about them holding me and it gets worse.
I have very strong emotions and I don’t really know how to process/handle them.
Does any one have any tips?","I'm so sorry to hear that you're going through this. Please remember, it's totally normal to want comfort and connection with a partner, but it's also important to be able to feel okay when you're alone. Here are some suggestions that might aid in dealing with your anxiety: First, try practicing mindfulness or meditation. It grounds you in the present moment and helps alleviate worries about the future. Apps like Headspace or Calm can guide you through this. Second, seek professional help. Therapists or counselors can teach you coping mechanisms and cognitive behavioral techniques. Third, openness is key. Discussing your feelings with your partner can lead to a better mutual understanding. They may also help to reassure you when you're apart. Lastly, take care of your physical health. Regular exercise, a balanced diet, and adequate sleep greatly improve mental wellbeing. Remember, it's okay to seek help and it's a sign of strength, not weakness. You are not alone in this and there are numerous resources available for you.",AI ,
"I live with my parents, who have no idea how bad my depression is. They think my room is messy because I'm lazy but in reality I just don't have the strength to clean it. I also suffer with sensory issues which makes cleaning harder. My room isn't even messy anymore; it's filthy. I mostly struggle with managing my bin, which has resulted in a rat infestation in my room. My parents don't know and I'm scared to tell them in case they get mad. But I don't know how to fix it on my own, especially since I don't do well with things like that. Unfortunately, I need to get my room clean in a week and I just don't know what to do. I've always struggled with cleaning but my depression has made everything so much harder, so I'm very worried that it won't get done in time. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you \n\n Update: Thank you so much for all of your advice. I’m happy to report that although my room isn’t spotless, it’s clean and liveable. Thank you for all of your advice and kind words","It sounds like you're in a tough position, and I'm really sorry that you're feeling this way. In terms of your immediate issue of cleaning your room, I have a couple of suggestions. Firstly, you might want to consider using disposable gloves and putting on some music or a podcast to help you gain the strength to start the cleaning process. Try breaking it into small, manageable tasks. For example, you could focus on picking up any food waste first, then move on to other tasks. For the rat infestation, I would recommend getting professional help, as they can carry diseases and the infestation could spread. You might need to inform your parents about it. Remember, they are your build-in support network, they will likely want to help you when they see you're struggling. You can explain it as you need assistance dealing with an infestation and cleaning your room, no need to disclose your depression if you're not comfortable. In addition, keeping your environment clean can have positive effects on mental health. You can take small steps towards this every day. You might want to consider seeking help from a professional for managing your depression, as well. You don't have to go through this alone, and there are resources available to help you. And don't forget to celebrate your progress - every step forward is a victory. Let us know how things are going. And congratulations on making progress with your room! It's certainly not an easy task but you took on the challenge and that's a huge accomplishment. Keep going at your pace and don't forget to take care of yourself along the way. You've got this. Look after yourself, you're on the right path. Sending peace and strength your way.",AI ,
"My dad just died and my mom wants me to hang out with her all the time. I''ve never liked doing casual things with her, and I'm very independent. I don't know how to tell her to leave me alone. The best relationship we ever had was when I lived in another state. I moved back because of my dad, but now he's gone. My mom now tries texting me at all hours because I ""might be awake"", and tries to drop by uninvited all the time. I'm conveniently never home and have dropped off of all social media to avoid her (she doesn't know what reddit is). Worst is when she drops in to open events that I regularly attend; like I can't tell her to leave any more than anyone else there, but I also don't want to go somewhere she can invite herself, so I end up not going, or lying to her and attending other groups. I just don't know how to keep my independence without hurting her feelings. I get that she's lonely, but I don't want to be her go-to person. Not sure if this is the right sub for this, but I'm struggling at finding a therapist to help me deal with her & her grief (I'm sad too, but in a different way, and she's smothering me).","I'm really sorry to hear about your predicament and your loss. It sounds like you're experiencing a difficult time, and it's absolutely fine to want your own space and independence. The first thing I'd recommend is finding a counsellor or therapist, even if it's online. They'll be well-equipped to help you manage your relationship with your mom during this emotional time. This isn't only for you but will benefit your mom too since you seem to understand she's also grieving, and she might need to speak to someone professional too. Then, would it be possible for you to have an open and compassionate conversation with your mom? You could explain that you're grieving too, just in a different way, which means wanting more space, and it doesn't mean you care any less. Assure her you don't want to push her away, but there needs to be a balance that keeps both of you comfortable. In addition, consider suggesting activities or hobbies for her to take part in, or if she would be open to it, a grief support group. This could provide her with the social interaction she seems to need right now and help her feel less lonely without over-relying on you. Most importantly, it's vital that you take care of your own mental and emotional health during this time. It's okay to set boundaries, and it's okay to grieve in your own way. Please reach out whenever you need to; we're here to support.",AI ,
"i’ve been struggling with replying to people on social media, especially people i don’t usually talk to. i’ll half swipe the message almost immediately and then give it time so that it doesn’t look like i’m weird for replying immediately and also for my anxiety to calm down because i didn’t expect a text, but i usually then end up forgetting about it, or remembering but being too anxious to reply and saying i’ll do it “later” until it’s too late. i don’t have this problem when i’m texting people who i talk to daily or i’m close with, just like acquaintances and stuff. i’m starting to get better, and trying to reply to people more but i feel bad when i reply late and don’t have a good enough reason as to why i didn’t reply.","Hey there, sending you love and understanding. Your feelings are completely valid, and this is something many people struggle with. Understand that there’s no “right” pace to reply. People understand we all have lives, and sometimes a reply might take a little longer. Anxiety can be a challenge, but remember it's okay to step back and take care of yourself first. It's not about a 'good enough reason' to someone else, it's about you and your well-being. Start small and navigate through conversations at your own comfort level. Maybe try responding to messages once a day at a fixed time, so you can control when you interact with them. Being open about it could be a possibility as well. You'd be surprised how understanding people can be about anxiety. It’s a part of being human, it's not a reflection of who you are. Progress is not a linear journey, and it's great that you are noticing improvement and trying to reply more. Remember, every effort is a step forward. You're doing great! Keep going. You're not alone in this.",AI ,
"I don't know when exactly it started. Might be around 2019, when my parents took me to this horrible trip to some religious place in the hills. Before this we used to do great trips, London, USA etc which I enjoyed. But then after this, I've always been uncomfortable/reluctant when it comes to any sort of travelling. Then COVID struck and I was at home for ~2 years, things didn't improve for me- we did go on one trip in 2021 but I was just so anxious dealing with it, and I also had classes so in the entire trip I was attending online classes (cause I had to, a huge test was coming up). My problem is that I'm anxious before the trip happens and during it I'm completely fine. It's gotten better now tho, but not completely cured. Going alone or with friends seems like a mammoth task. Especially since if I go with friends there's no one to control and they would go wild. I know I need to get over this for the future. Any tips?",Went through some of the top posts of this sub.

"So I have decided to well distance myself from most of my friends. The reason why is even though i seem to be getting better. The people around me keep getting hurt because of me. But there’s not reason for me to get rid of my friends that I don’t see in person anymore so there’s no reason to worry about them because they did seem to get hurt.
The reason why the people around me are getting hurt is because of me. Now that I have show more emotion I tend to lose control over my emotions and when I do I try to control it but it just makes me angry. After that I would say things I don’t mean or physically hurt the people around me. I don’t mind the looks I get but I don’t want to hurt the people I care about I just want to protect them but if I can’t even stop myself from hurting then the how am I supposed to stop others.
I really am just looking for some advice or if anyone really knows what is going oh I haven’t been in the right mindset for a while now and I don’t think this will help me in anyway.","I would suggest you seek help in the form of mental health counseling to get to the root of the issue ASAP if you haven’t already. Physically hurting people is dangerous for them and can get you in serious trouble with the law, no matter the reason. Anger is a normal emotion, however, we all have to find healthy ways to cope with and or express it. You’re right, this might not help, but at least you put yourself out there. It’s a great step in the right direction. If nothing else, I hope you continue to find answers.",Human,
"So ima just keep this short, but most of my life I’ve never gotten attention from my parents. That’s do to the fact my mom had many jobs and was still in college while my father was an addict. I think this is where it came from I’m pretty sure. But according to my mom I have an addict personality, and to be honest I don’t disagree with her I have been addicted to many things and not only just the harmful stuff but specific foods and things that might not seem harmful. But they can most definitely be in large quantities.
The reason why she said this is because she has plenty of evidence to support it. I have always been addicted to something ever since I was a kid I had an addiction wether if it was bad or good I had always had one. Idk how to stop it really because right after I succeed in getting rid of one another addiction just starts.

"I have no friends aside from one from primary school who I infrequently catch up with. I really just find most people not to be worth talking to, as I find it hard to connect with many people due to my lack of shared interests and my social anxiety. However, I often feel lonely and kinda sad especially when I see people who are having a good time with their friends. I did actually have a weird experience making a friend just recently though, but he's way older than me so it's a bit weird to hang out in person. I noticed he had an interest in something I really liked, and we had this great chat for about 10 minutes. It flowed so smoothly, and it was super passionate. We still message each other every couple of days. Can anyone else relate to this?",I have 3 friends that I treasure because it was extremely hard to make lasting friendships for me but since I moved country I don't have them around me. I catch up with them online/phone and that's nice and I actually feel quite ok not having new friends around here. My partner wants to find friends for me but I am resistant. I know it's because of my anxiety but I am comfortable with it. Not sure if that's a good thing 😅 I always get more comfortable with people not around my age.

A lot of people have intrusive thoughts, you’re not alone. You’re no worse a person than if you didn’t struggle with this. Remember to keep in touch with your support system, you mentioned a therapist and that’s good.

I know... it affects me. I had my sleep on schedule before but the recent events didn't allow me to have a good sleep. But it's fine. I can change it slowly. Had a little dark thoughts at night but it didn't last long. Some self hatred and other usual stuff but it wasn't that bad. I mean can I get better in one night? Of course not. Still felt lonely (or alone... I don't know my English sucks:() but that's fine too. Pain is part of my journey. I'm not feeling strong yet but it doesn't hurt like last week. Also I had a small good conversation with someone which made me happy that moment. I was supposed to go to see my psychiatrist but I didn't go because I was scared. It's really hard to go there. But it's ok at least I tried to think about going there. I need to change my medicines. Overall I'm sad but not too much. Like 4/10. That's good. I mean it was 9/10 last week so I'm still satisfied .,"Hi there, Sorry to hear you've been going through such a tough time. But I commend you for acknowledging your feelings and sharing parts of your journey here. It's an important step. Burdening emotions like sadness or loneliness can be really overwhelming, but remember, change is a process, not an event. You've already moved from a 9/10 to a 4/10 and that's progress in itself. So, you're right. There's no fixed timeline for getting better. Sleep is really essential for our mental and physical health. To help crash the erratic sleep pattern, you could try relaxing activities before bedtime like reading or meditation. Going for a walk in nature can also help reset your body clock. It's understandable that you're scared to go to the psychiatrist—it can be really daunting. But seeking professional help is a crucial step, especially if it's about changing your medications. Try to focus on the help and relief you'll get after the visit, instead of the fear or discomfort you might feel. You could ask a friend to go with you for support. Remember, it's okay to have good moments too. Savour them, cherish them. The small conversation that made you happy is something to hold onto. It's these moments that show us there's still joy to be found, even in the toughest of times. Hold on to hope, you're far stronger than you realize. Here for you.",AI ,
"I get a job I try hard I realise I hate everything about it and I’d rather be depressed incessantly reading and eating a pot noodle once a day.

You’re young and entering an age I sometimes wish I was back at. I was at my prime when I was 18 and on top of the world. Now, I am not and stress has since callused and blinded me from seeing what I have attained. It blocks me. Despite distances, circumstances and environments…I believe no matter what and where you are, realizing you’re not alone dealing with stress can foster a sense of gratification. Even if it’s a small bit. It helps make things just a tad brighter which can help guide you in making small changes. It’s our prime directive to survive and we live in a stress saturated world that is relentless in dishing out stress. Foster gratitude. Once you feel like you have everything under control and you’re doing the best you can, nature and people prove you wrong and the cycle repeats itself. Find balance between things we can and cannot control. And seeing those things for what they are. Take control of what you can and accept what you can’t and let it build resolve. You will always have your SELF, always. You’re stronger than you think but don’t let your own shadow get in the way or shut you down. We always have that as well and it plays nasty tricks on us. Anxiety can tear us apart. But you’re doing a great thing because you’re ahead of the game realizing this early on through experience. Be well friend.",Human,white
"Since I was little, I have experienced one problem after another. As a child I was often in the hospital because I couldn't balance, I would fall, and I was always bumping around.

"Why does quietness or social awkwardness make people so uncomfortable? I feel like a leper or pariah. Everyone eventually ends up disliking me or thinking I’m weird.

It’s important to remember that everyone has their own insecurities and social challenges, and you're not alone in feeling this way. Social awkwardness or quietness can sometimes make people uncomfortable simply because they may not be familiar with it. People tend to be comfortable with what they know. However, this doesn’t mean there's anything wrong with you. It's important to remember that not everyone's opinion of you defines your worth. Sometimes, differences can be intimidating or off-putting initially, but they can also be what make us unique and interesting. Your upbringing and cultural background are part of who you are, but they don’t have to limit your interactions or relationships. You might consider using these experiences as a foundation to build bridges with others by sharing some aspects of your history or culture. Also, if your quiet nature and anxiety are constant sources of distress, it may be beneficial to seek professional help. Talking to a therapist or counselor can provide methods to manage anxiety and develop more comfortable social skills. The key is to move at your own pace and not to judge yourself harshly. Additionally, finding supportive online communities who share similar experiences can also help alleviate feelings of loneliness or being an ''alien.'' You're unique and there’s a place in the world for you. All it takes is a bit of time to find your tribe. Remember, being different is not being defective.

Idk where to start and start for what.","Hey there, it sounds like you're going through a really tough time right now and I'm sorry you feel this way. It's completely okay to not have everything figured out and to allow time for the pieces to fall in place. When life throws you curveballs like this, it's important to acknowledge how you're feeling and give yourself room to breathe. When it comes to finding motivation and a sense of purpose again, perhaps you could reflect on the things that have given you joy or fulfillment in the past. Was there something else apart from your initial goal of going to the USA and doing your undergrad that really got you excited or passionate? I'd suggest breaking it down into smaller, achievable tasks and goals. It could be as simple as trying to find something new to learn each day. This might help to reignite that spark again in the meantime. Remember, it’s okay if your WHY changes or evolves over time based on various circumstances. You might find a new path and purpose that aligns with who you are now and where you're at in your journey. Take some time to focus on your physical and mental health - it’s important to look after yourself in these challenging times. You're not alone in feeling this way. Many of us struggle with a sense of direction and purpose, especially when plans don't work out as we expected. Just keep in mind: you're more resilient and adaptable than you might think. Hang in there and try to embrace the path of self-discovery that you're on, wherever it may lead. Lastly, don't hesitate to seek professional help if you feel too overwhelmed. There are resources available and people who are trained to assist in situations like these. You don't have to carry all this weight by yourself. Sending good vibes your way!

"During the last 16 years of my parents’ marriage, my dad has been paranoid and jealous of my mom even though she’s the breadwinner and he barely works. Yesterday was the last straw when my mom was working at the nail salon and my dad accused my mom of cheating, saying that “the nail salon closed a long time ago”. To which my mom called her coworkers and showed camera footages for proof, but he refused to look or listen.

The first step would be to ensure that you and your mom are safe. Could you stay with a trusted friend or family member, at least for a few days? In regards to reporting this situation, you could contact your local police station; they may direct you to their Domestic Violence Unit or similar department. You should also consider seeking legal advice on how to deal with property rights as your mom is the breadwinner and paid for the house.

"I am a [age] year old [gender] ( [nationality] )  , married with a kid . I have my own family business which my father helped starting around 8-9 years ago .

Phone is the reason of many failures in my life , I know that but still I can't stop it . I can't enjoy anything . I miss important things in my life I am hurting my business Help me to stop this . Note : i have anger issues too Gets furstated easily Being in retail , you have to be polite but sometimes I am super annoying","Now that you have been honest and noticed where you can improve you can start. When you notice yourself on the phone while neglecting responsibilities, then put it down. Noticing gives you the decision to do something different. Practice having your attention on your tasks and doing them with gratitude and meaning. Don't indulge in negative thoughts that says ""I don't want to do this now"" ""I will rush through this task/responsibility so I can get to my phone"". Release all negative thoughts and emotions, by allowing them to come and go. And practice good thoughts/attitudes/feelings/actions. This is a process and takes practice and repetition. So forgive yourself (and others) when you make mistakes and just keep the intention and willingness to improve. Don't get stuck in guilt/regeret - rather use it to make your intention to improve stronger. Because constant guilt is a form of negativity and drags us down. How we feel, or in other words our attitude, influences how we see and react to life. Good attitudes gives us more power to learn and grow. Keep your goal/decision/intention alive. Your goal might be to use your phone less or to be responsible. Practice not contradicting your goal mentally, emotionally or by action. Although we usually do, because it's a process, and that's normal and fine, we just keep trying. No use in having a goal but thinking negatively about it the whole time. We must feel that it is possible.",Human,asian

They do work most of the time, but the symptoms do ''spill over'' sometimes. Doctors say ''you can't have a psychotic disorder if you know about your symptoms'' but I only know about them after I've taken my meds and they take them away and I see clearly again.

I understand that you urgently need answers about your condition, but while the experts work on that, let's try together to manage your symptoms as best as we can. It's perfectly normal to want clarity about your situation, but the idea that ""you can't have a psychotic disorder if you know about your symptoms"" is not set in stone. Knowledge of your symptoms and their management could be seen as a strength, indicative of your self-awareness and resilience. Your regular medication is proof of that and is incredibly vital. While you seek further help, it may be beneficial to discuss these feelings and experiences with a trustworthy counselor or therapist. They can provide different strategies and tools to help manage the symptoms when they 'spill over.' Keeping a detailed log of when these symptoms occur, what triggers them, and your overall feelings before, during, and after each incident could potentially be a beneficial tool not only for you, but also for the professionals assisting you.

Bonus question: Any thoughts on separating loving someone from the act of re-enacting ''roles'' learned in (often traumatic) childhood wrt emotional attachments/connections (or lack thereof) with parents?","It's great to see such in-depth interest and sensitivity towards the perspective of others, especially regarding a topic as complex as love. Everyone experiences love differently, but one common theme is feeling understood, accepted, and cared for. A ""loving space"" for many may be a space of comfort, security and respect. Mental, emotional, and physical safety is likely to be a crucial element to feeling loved. Love can be shown in various ways, such as through acts of kindness, thoughtful gestures, open communication, or simply spending quality time together. As for your bonus question, separating love from re-enacting ""roles"" learned in childhood comes down to self-awareness and understanding one's patterns. Therapy or support communities can often help individuals to recognize and challenge these learned behaviors.

It can be tough dealing with physical changes and mental health struggles at the same time. Speaking from my experiences, it does seem like both can definitely influence each other. Weight can play a role in how much one sweats, although there are many individual factors at play. As you work towards your weight loss goal, it's encouraged to also pay attention to other ways to take care of your physical well-being such as maintaining a balanced diet and working on active methods of coping with your anxiety. As far as the depression and anxiety impacting this situation, our bodies can respond to these conditions in various ways which can include increased sweating. That being said, correlation is not causation and it's important to discuss these symptoms with a healthcare professional. With regards to your parents' worries about antiperspirants, it might be helpful to engage them in a conversation with a doctor. Often, they can provide appropriate guidance on safe and effective products. Remember, it's common to experience ups and downs while dealing with such challenges. Consistent self-care rituals, grounding exercises and coping strategies could help manage some of these symptoms. You also may want to consider speaking to a mental health professional about your social anxiety and changes in mood. P.S. it's okay to make a typo! We all do it🙂",AI,unknown

It's understandable to feel overwhelmed and scared given your experiences. No one should have to endure such trauma. I firstly want to commend you for reaching out and trying therapy -- it's a huge step towards taking care of your mental health. Therapy often takes time & the right professional for a breakthrough to occur. If therapy didn't work, it might be helpful to try a different therapist or approach such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) or Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR), which are known to help with PTSD symptoms. In addition to professional help, engaging in self-care activities and coping strategies yourself may be beneficial. Regular exercise, mindfulness meditation, relaxing hobbies, journaling your feelings, or simply taking long walks can help ease anxiety over time. One more crucial part - try to reach out to a support network of people who understand what you're going through. This might be a trusted person in your life, an online forum of people with similar experiences, or a local Self-Defense PTSD support group. Finally, don't hesitate to contact immediate help lines if you are feeling intense anxiety or panic attacks.

"I([age][gender]) see my gay friends have relationships wherein romantic interaction is not based on gender norms, both members of the relationship having creative freedom in how they choose to love each other. A strong majority of straight relationships seem to contain a gendered code of conduct that strips individuals from having a sense of creativity in their relationships. For one, basically all straight proposals are all done in the same way: man gets down on one knee with ring. On the other hand, gay relationships seem able to incorporate creativity and personal freedom in how such an event is done. As a straight person, I simply cannot accept how my relationships are almost guaranteed to be restrictive and boring.
","Definitely, breaking free from traditional norms and expectations can bring a breath of freshness into any relationship. The societal expectations you are referring to are based on stereotypical gender roles which are gradually changing. The first step towards having the type of relationship you admire in your gay friends starts with you. Be upfront with your partner about your desires for creativity, flexibility, and equality. Long-lasting relationships are built on openness as this sets the tone for the level of understanding each partner has about the other's needs and demands. Also, bear in mind that these 'rituals', like a man proposing on his knee, are merely norms. You could choose to do something completely different. The key is to find a partner who also respects and values individuality, creativity, and freedom. Talk to them about what you both want, rather than what society expects from you. You might even be surprised to find that many straight couples are also breaking away from the traditional norms and adopting more 'liberated' forms of romance. So, don't back yourself into the corner of the 'inevitable boring relationships'. You can and should create the relationship you desire. As you navigate your relationships, remember that creativity, comfort, and freedom are not exclusive to any sexual orientations, but are universal needs that everyone can and should incorporate into their relationships.

We got into an argument and here are some things she said: -she doesn’t see my father as a [ethnicity] man because that would make her pity him -she doesn’t worry about my safety as a [ethnicity] person because that would stress her out -when she’s around other [ethnicity] people she “feels their energy” and gets embarrassed of my dad Is there any way I can let go of the hurt that I’m feeling and move past this?,"Are you old enough to move away? Live with other relatives? Are you close to your dad’s side of the family? To me, it seems like you don’t have enough support from people in your family.",Human,unknown
"I'm [age], [gender], and autistic and also socially awkward. Ive never had what I can call a friend ever. I'm always on my own. I've had partners, but never a friend. I've been trying to get myself out there and be normal but I always seem to mess up because I'm just garbage at communicating with people. I have no idea at this point how to even make friends or socialise with people. Everything I do is on my own. I just don't know what to do anymore. I thought today I would put myself out there, try to actually communicate like a normal person, but I messed up again. The one thing that frightens me is dying alone. It feels like that's fate for me. I feel so damn lonely ATM","Hi there, consider joining a support group, either online or in person, where folks have similar experiences, also autism-focused social skills therapy might help. Remember it's not about being ''normal'', it's about finding your comfort zone.",AI -  3 lines,unknown
"hey folks, [age][gender] here, i used to live on autopilot my whole life, had miserable childhood, strict- micromanaging- abusive father.... last few months, I started reflecting back and got into self improvement and I found many miserable pattern that are repeating in my life. I tried affirmations and journaling stuff. I know my patterns , but still i feel depressed and cant break the patterns. (Iknow all the psychological scientific reasons why i am facing all this.... have already read many blogs, books.. have enough knowledge....but IDK how to get out of this completely and create a brand new version 2.0) Amongst you people, have anyone faced the same issue in life? and if Yes, how did you overcome this? Because, i need validation whether anyone has changed his/her life by overcoming the same phase. HOW???? PLS HELP!","Things can get into your hard drive, so to speak, when you're young. That's what you see vestiges of now, even though you're a grown-up. See if you'd be open to getting therapy to deal with these things that hold you back. It couldn't hurt.",Human,unknown
"My son is 8 and he has autism. We have therapists and support workers and he goes to a main stream school. He is happy and confident and loves going there. Today, another call from school - he was playing a game with some classmates and one of them got upset. He wanted to continue the game without them and a teacher pulled him up and told him off for not being a better friend. Because he argued they have decided that he can't be trusted to listen to teachers so can no longer do school field trips unless we take him ourselves. My son has never been invited to a birthday party or a play date. Every day at school pick up I hear kids say mean things about him. He ignores them. He got hit once, on purpose, he said they told him it was a game. It's fine for other kids to be mean with intent, but his not understanding social cues make it ok to bully and exclude him. My son may never get married or even have a partner, may never have kids, may never even get a job he loves because at 8 years old he is already written off. I'm exhausted trying to defend my son, I'm exhausted trying to teach him that the world is a kind place, that you help people and you care and it comes back to you...it doesn't. The outcomes for a child with his condition are not great, he has genetic factors that are life limiting. Iwill.likely outlive him. I want him to know he is loved, safe, that we see how funny and kind and smart he is. But the second we go out the front door people don't care, or it's too hard, or they are just mean. I failed as a [gender] before I even began. It's utterly lonely and I don't think I will ever forgive myself. No matter. How hard I try, no matter how much I advocate for him. I can't fix the world.","I'm so sorry to hear that you're struggling in this situation. It's painfully obvious from your post just how much you care about your son. It sounds like you're doing an amazing job advocating for him. The world is a challenging place for those who are different, but with someone like you by his side, he's got a fighting chance. It's heartbreaking to hear about the exclusion your son is experiencing at school. Is it possible to discuss these issues with the school administration? It's important for them to understand that all children, including those with autism, need to be treated with respect and dignity. About monitoring field trips: It might be a good idea to recruit some of your close friends or family members who understand your son and his needs, so that they can be back-up support if you ever need help taking him. Don't blame yourself for anything. Your son's challenges are not your fault. It sounds like you're doing everything you can to give him a safe and loving environment. It can be distressingly lonely to shoulder these burdens. It's important to find support for you, too. A local autism support group might be a good place to start. They understand your struggles and could provide valuable advice and comfort. Keep in mind that love and understanding can make a huge difference in someone's life. Continue to show him that unconditional love, by doing so, you are continually shaping him to be a better person despite the obstacles. The society might judge him, but your home will always be a sanctuary where he feels loved, understood, and safe. And remember, no one writes off an individual's future at an age of 8. He has so much potential to unlock, you just need to find a way to help him tap into it. Lastly, allow yourself some grace. Parenthood, especially in complex circumstances, is a constant learning curve. You're doing the best you can and that's what most important. Please do reach out to professional assistance for your own mental health. You deserve support too. Sending you strength and peace.",AI,
"I have several conditions which mean chronic stress. These are all in hand as best as can be hoped. Recently though, I’ve been having nasty bouts of pain in my ribs because of stress. It feels like I’m wearing a corset. Does anyone have any reliefs as to how to combat this?","""Chronic Stress"" is all in your head and the meaning you are attaching to things. Typically when people are ""Stressed"" you are thinking too much about future things that will likely never happen. People who are ""depressed"" are caught thinking in the past. The easiest way to combat this is to live in the present and ask yourself every morning ""What can I do today that will help me have a better tomorrow?"". Then just focus on that all day. This is advice my mentor gave me years ago and its made a world of difference for me. Hope this helps!",Human,
"Over the past few years - like most ppl - I’ve had a rough time with covid lockdown, plus then I was diagnosed with hiatal hernia, then divorce, and now financial pressures of single-handedly running a household. I was hoping to put this all behind me but last summer new symptoms started to appear: + IBS / GERD (hiatal hernia) + Cardiac arrythmias (thousands a day) + Various skin complaints. + Alopecia Barbae (beard patches) I’ve now had 9 months of all these symptoms and I’ve tried individual meds like beta blockers, PPI, tweaking diet, exercise with no luck... the docs say this is all because of going through a major life disruption and it’s due to underlying stress. The cardio and gerd stuff is so bad I’ve started avoiding stuff but I have CBT planned as a last resort treatment. Concerned the stress is permanently damaging my health. Anyone deal with anything similar? Go through a major event and suffer chronic stress? Any of these symptoms? Did they resolve after a time? How do you treat underlying, chronic stress?",,AI,
"I don’t usually do this ... but I’m looking for support. I’ve been feeling really lonely lately & I have no one to talk to.. currently texting my mom & im bawling. I texted her because I was missing her (and I don’t even have a good relationship with her). I want friends.. people to talk to .. people to hangout with. My mind has been feeling like a prison. When I hear whispers or “[gender]” at my work & where I live, I always think it’s about me. My mind makes me think it’s about me. So then that’s all I can think about. And for fucks sake I can’t get my ex out of my mind. [gender] emailed me again saying [gender] wants me back & then coincidentally I see [gender] in town (driving) & [gender] pulls out behind me & follows me. And then leaves me a voicemail that says [gender] misses me a ton & it was good to see me but that [gender]’s trying to move on. Even tho [gender] just sent me an email saying [gender] wants me back. I keep thinking about texting [gender] & going back. But I know that’s bad. I want [gender] out of my mind.",,AI,
