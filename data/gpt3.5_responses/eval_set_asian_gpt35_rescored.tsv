"I'm so sorry to hear that you're feeling this way. It sounds like you're under a lot of pressure with your upcoming exams and the expectations from your father. Remember, you are not alone in this struggle. Many students experience periods of feeling overwhelmed and find it difficult to concentrate and study.

First and foremost, take a deep breath and try to acknowledge your feelings. It's okay to feel scared and overwhelmed. Give yourself permission to feel those emotions, but also remind yourself that you have the strength to overcome these challenges.

Start breaking down your workload into smaller, manageable tasks. It can be overwhelming to look at the big picture with tons of chapters and undone homework. Begin by creating a study schedule or a to-do list. Prioritize your tasks based on urgency and importance. This way, you can tackle one task at a time and gradually work towards completing them.

Consider seeking support from your teachers, classmates, or a tutor. They can provide guidance, answer your questions, and help you understand difficult concepts. It's important to communicate your concerns with your teachers, as they may be able to offer additional resources or accommodations to support your learning.

Take care of your mental health along the way. Remember to take regular breaks during study sessions. Engage in activities that help you relax and unwind, such as exercising, meditating, or pursuing hobbies you enjoy. Make sure you are getting enough sleep and maintaining a balanced diet as these factors can greatly impact your overall well-being and ability to focus.

Additionally, consider talking to a mental health professional or counselor about your feelings of depression. They can offer you guidance and tools to cope with your emotions and provide support as you navigate this challenging time.

Remember, it's never too late to start anew. Stay focused, stay positive, and remember to be kind to yourself throughout this journey. You have the ability to overcome this and succeed. Reach out to your support system, and remember that there are people who genuinely care about your well-being. You got this!"	2	0	0	0.0007240176200866699	mental health forum

"I'm sorry to hear that you're feeling overwhelmed and struggling with your studies. It sounds like the pressure from your father and the weight of all the work you have to catch up on are adding to your stress. Remember, it's important to take care of your mental health during this challenging time.

One strategy that might help is breaking down your workload into smaller, more manageable tasks. This can make studying feel less overwhelming and help you build momentum. Consider creating a study schedule or to-do list that outlines specific tasks you want to accomplish each day. Start with shorter study sessions and gradually increase the time as you become more comfortable.

Additionally, finding a quiet and comfortable study space can be helpful in minimizing distractions and improving focus. Try to eliminate distractions, such as turning off your phone or using website blockers if needed.

It may also be beneficial to reach out to your teachers for support. They can provide guidance on how to tackle the backlog and help you prioritize your studies. Don't be afraid to ask for extensions or additional resources if necessary.

Remember, it's okay to take breaks and engage in activities that bring you joy. Balancing study time with leisure activities is important for your overall well-being. Incorporating stress-reducing activities such as exercise, meditation, or spending time with friends can help improve your mood and motivation.

If you find that your depressive symptoms persist or worsen, I encourage you to consider talking to a mental health professional. They can provide additional support and strategies to manage your mental health during this challenging time."	2	0	0	0.0006819963455200195	clinician

"I'm sorry to hear that you're feeling overwhelmed and struggling with your studies. It can be tough when we feel like we've wasted time and are now facing the consequences. Remember, you're not alone in feeling this way - many students have been in similar situations before.

Firstly, it's important to acknowledge that feeling pressured and anxious about your exams is completely normal. However, it's important to find healthy coping mechanisms to navigate these emotions. Have you considered trying some relaxation techniques or mindfulness exercises to help manage your stress levels? Deep breathing exercises or meditation could be helpful in calming your mind before studying.

It might be beneficial to create a study schedule that breaks down your workload into manageable chunks. By setting smaller goals and gradually increasing your study time, it can help to alleviate the feeling of being unable to study for longer periods. Additionally, make sure to take regular breaks during your study sessions to avoid burnout.

Don't hesitate to seek support from your teachers or academic counsellors. They can provide guidance and resources to help you catch up on missed work and keep up with your school's timetable. Remember, it's never too late to start making progress.

Lastly, be kind to yourself. It's important to acknowledge your efforts and celebrate small victories along the way. Remember that your mental health is just as important as your academic success. Make sure to take breaks to engage in activities that you enjoy and help you relax.

If your feelings of depression persist, it may be helpful to reach out to a mental health professional. They can provide guidance and support as you navigate your emotions."	2	0	0	0.0006902217864990234	forum with demographics

"I'm really sorry to hear that you're feeling overwhelmed and depressed. It can be incredibly challenging to try and catch up on a whole year's worth of studying, especially when you're feeling down. It sounds like you've had a lot of pressure from your father and your teachers, which is only adding to your stress. 

Firstly, it's important to remember that you're not alone in feeling this way. Many students go through periods of feeling overwhelmed, especially when facing important exams like JEE Adv. It might be helpful to reach out to your friends or classmates who are also preparing for the exam, as they may be experiencing similar challenges.

It's completely understandable that you're finding it difficult to concentrate and study for extended periods of time. When we're feeling depressed or anxious, our ability to focus can be greatly impacted. One strategy that might be helpful is to break down your studying into smaller, manageable chunks. For example, try setting a timer for 20-30 minutes and fully dedicate yourself to studying during that time. Then, give yourself a short break before diving back in. 

In addition to managing your studying, it's important to take care of your mental health. Consider incorporating self-care activities into your daily routine, such as going for a walk or practicing mindfulness exercises. Building a routine that includes both study time and self-care can help you create a sense of structure and balance in your life.

Remember, it's okay to ask for help. If you feel comfortable, reach out to a supportive adult in your life, such as a teacher or counselor. They may be able to offer guidance and resources to help you navigate this challenging time. Lastly, try to be kind to yourself and remember that your worth is not solely determined by your academic performance. Take it one step at a time, and know that you have the strength to overcome these obstacles."	2	0	0	0.0008268952369689941	forum w/o demographics
"Sometime I tend to be a bit hypochondriac and I know that. But for some reason it doesn't help much. 

When I walk home I usually pass a house with a very cute and playful, young German Shepard (maybe a year old? I don't really know). Sometimes this dog drops out one of its toys to someone to throw it back, so it can chase it, bring back and throw it out between the bars of the fence again. Yesterday the dog sat behind the fence again, waiting for someone. Since the ball, the dog usually drops out, were not really intact to say the least, it tried to drop out a very soft and chewy, yellow toy. The poor dog had a hard time throwing it out, because it always stuck to the bars of the fence, so it started to furiously chew the toy for some reason. I thought he just trying to drop it out, so when he brought the toy close to the fence I tried to take it away (the dog seems very friendly, so I didn't think it was a bad idea). As I tried to take the toy away the dog accidentally ""bit"" me. I wrote ""bit"" me because it didn't even break the skin, and the ""bite mark"" literally just looked like when you press your teeth to finger harder. 

Ever since I'm a bit nervous about getting rabies, because even though to get infected, the bite has to break the skin, but during the winter my eczema on my hand gets a lot worse, and my hand is usually full of micro cuts and small wounds, so maybe the dog's saliva got into one of the many wounds on my hand. I know it sounds stupid, but when I tell you all the things that are against me getting rabies, I will sound straight retarded to even worry about it. 

I live in Slovakia (near Bratislava). When your dog grow older than 3 month, you have to vaccinate it against rabies. It's mandatory. (But my thoughts says what if the owner failed to do that?)

Second my country is almost rabies free. Only the eastern part of the country has a very few rabies cases every few years (and even these infected wild or stray animals mostly are from Poland and Ukraine, and just crossed the border). I don't think the western part of the country where I'm from had a single rabid animal in the last 5 years (probably even much more). I read in an article that the last man who died of rabies, died in 1990. So in 32 years, no deaths of rabies. But my thoughts says what if it just wasn't in the news, but did happened? 

Why am I like this?"	"Hey everyone! So I had a little encounter with a playful German Shepard the other day and now I'm a bit worried about rabies. I know it's highly unlikely, especially considering the dog's behavior and the vaccination laws in my country. Plus, there haven't been any reported cases in my area for decades. But being a bit of a hypochondriac, my mind is still running wild with ""what ifs."" Can anyone relate or offer some reassurance?

It's important to remember that the risk of contracting rabies in your situation is extremely low. Not only is your country almost rabies-free, but the dog in question seems well-cared for and friendly. Plus, since the bite didn't break the skin, the chances of any transmission are even lower. Your thoughts about the dog's vaccination status and the possibility of unreported cases are understandable, but they are unlikely scenarios based on the information you provided.

It's also worth noting that your concern for your health and well-being is valid. However, if these thoughts and worries are starting to interfere with your daily life and causing significant distress, it might be a good idea to reach out to a mental health professional who can help provide support and guidance. They can work with you to explore underlying anxiety triggers and develop coping strategies tailored to your specific needs.

Remember, you're not alone in experiencing these kinds of concerns, and seeking help is a courageous step towards better mental well-being. Take care!"	2	0	0	0.0019924044609069824	mental health forum

It's important to remind yourself that your hand's eczema and the minimal nature of the bite reduce the chances of transmission even further. Rabies is typically transmitted through deep bites that break the skin, and in rare cases, through contact with infected saliva into an open wound.

" 

I (23F) am lost and I don’t know what to do anymore. It all started in high school, long story short I stopped studying and barely passed my classes, in a miracle I got into a good university with a good 5 year program (thanks to the system of the country I live in). The first semester it was going okay til it wasn’t, I was failing everything, fast forward to the second and I was failing everything again, I just wasn’t studying, going to lectures wasn’t helping, all i did was my lab work and assignment but failed every exam. Sure I’m not really interested in what I'm studying but that’s absolutely not as important as me failing my classes. In the fourth semester I got into academic probation, I still couldn’t study enough to get through it so I got into a second probation, basically a whole year of being out of school. By some miracle I passed the class I needed to get in school again and went on to the fifth semester, I passed nothing in that one except the assignments. Got into probation a 3rd time (this semester) and just now found out I will be in probation this next semester too. So basically as a 5 year program, all my friends are graduating this year while I'm two years behind and will be graduating in the next 3 years. And I haven’t passed any exam in the last two years so I have 10 unfinished courses. I don’t know what’s wrong with me, if I'm lazy, if I don’t care. I thought it could be adhd and I went to a psychologist but they told me they couldn’t test me since they prioritise minors and my issue didn't seem to be urgent since I've gotten into university and the wait list is at least 6 years and if I wanted to get tested NOW I'd have to go the private route and pay around 3k dollars which i can't do right now. 

My parents ( I live with them cause we’re asian etc) are both doctors so imagine the expectations they both have on me. I haven’t told them everything though. They know about my first probation but not the second, they know about the third current one but not this upcoming one this next semester. And they don’t know about the failed 10 courses either. I wanted to hide it from them because I believed I could pass everything quietly and they’d never have to know but I dug a hole so deep for myself. I'll have to tell them about the next semester though because I can’t hide it in any way and I don’t know how I'm going to do it. They’re already disappointed that I'm behind and they’ll be so mad now. My mom doesn’t work because of mental health issues but my dad is in his late 60s and works. I live with them and he is basically providing for all of us, they all keep reminding me to graduate quick so I can easily stand on my feet, and maybe that we can move to a country where it's easier for them to work and make better than here because they're here with me just for my education. I feel so bad for my dad who goes to work everyday for us while I’ve been doing nothing just sitting on my ass for the past two years. He is getting old and I want to make things easier for them but I just can’t seem to study for the life of me. I wish I could tell them everything and then ask for help but I know I can’t because they’ll never forgive me, they’re nice to me after being mad about the probations and they still get me gifts and buy me stuff while I have this huge secret that I'm failing everything. If they find out they won’t trust me again.

I really don’t know what to do I wanna pass my classes and start new so bad but I keep telling myself that things will be different this time while nothing is ever changing. Maybe you’re gonna tell me I'm burnt out but no way, I’ve had 2 years of doing nothing but sitting at home sleeping, I don’t remember the last time I’ve studied consistently, maybe 10 years ago. I don’t know what I'm even expecting from here just a listening ear I guess. I want to get better, my brain has ideas as to how to but my body just won't listen to me."	Hey there, I'm really sorry to hear that you're feeling lost and overwhelmed. It sounds like you've been struggling with your studies for a while now, and that's tough. Remember, you're not alone in this, and there are people who want to help you. It might be worth considering reaching out to your university's academic support services for guidance on how to improve your study habits or seeking advice from a school counselor.

I (23F) am lost and I don’t know what to do anymore. It all started in high school, long story short I stopped studying and barely passed my classes, in a miracle I got into a good university with a good 5 year program (thanks to the system of the country I live in). The first semester it was going okay til it wasn’t, I was failing everything, fast forward to the second and I was failing everything again, I just wasn’t studying, going to lectures wasn’t helping, all i did was my lab work and assignment but failed every exam. Sure I’m not really interested in what I'm studying but that’s absolutely not as important as me failing my classes. In the fourth semester I got into academic probation, I still couldn’t study enough to get through it so I got into a second probation, basically a whole year of being out of school. By some miracle I passed the class I needed to get in school again and went on to the fifth semester, I passed nothing in that one except the assignments. Got into probation a 3rd time (this semester) and just now found out I will be in probation this next semester too. So basically as a 5 year program, all my friends are graduating this year while I'm two years behind and will be graduating in the next 3 years. And I haven’t passed any exam in the last two years so I have 10 unfinished courses. I don’t know what’s wrong with me, if I'm lazy, if I don’t care. I thought it could be adhd and I went to a psychologist but they told me they couldn’t test me since they prioritise minors and my issue didn't seem to be urgent since I've gotten into university and the wait list is at least 6 years and if I wanted to get tested NOW I'd have to go the private route and pay around 3k dollars which i can't do right now. 

My parents ( I live with them cause we’re asian etc) are both doctors so imagine the expectations they both have on me. I haven’t told them everything though. They know about my first probation but not the second, they know about the third current one but not this upcoming one this next semester. And they don’t know about the failed 10 courses either. I wanted to hide it from them because I believed I could pass everything quietly and they’d never have to know but I dug a hole so deep for myself. I'll have to tell them about the next semester though because I can’t hide it in any way and I don’t know how I'm going to do it. They’re already disappointed that I'm behind and they’ll be so mad now. My mom doesn’t work because of mental health issues but my dad is in his late 60s and works. I live with them and he is basically providing for all of us, they all keep reminding me to graduate quick so I can easily stand on my feet, and maybe that we can move to a country where it's easier for them to work and make better than here because they're here with me just for my education. I feel so bad for my dad who goes to work everyday for us while I’ve been doing nothing just sitting on my ass for the past two years. He is getting old and I want to make things easier for them but I just can’t seem to study for the life of me. I wish I could tell them everything and then ask for help but I know I can’t because they’ll never forgive me, they’re nice to me after being mad about the probations and they still get me gifts and buy me stuff while I have this huge secret that I'm failing everything. If they find out they won’t trust me again.

I really don’t know what to do I wanna pass my classes and start new so bad but I keep telling myself that things will be different this time while nothing is ever changing. Maybe you’re gonna tell me I'm burnt out but no way, I’ve had 2 years of doing nothing but sitting at home sleeping, I don’t remember the last time I’ve studied consistently, maybe 10 years ago. I don’t know what I'm even expecting from here just a listening ear I guess. I want to get better, my brain has ideas as to how to but my body just won't listen to me."	"I'm sorry to hear that you're feeling lost and unsure of what to do. It sounds like you're dealing with a lot of pressure and high expectations from both yourself and your parents. It's important to remember that struggling in academics doesn't mean that you're lazy or don't care.

Considering your concerns about ADHD, it's unfortunate that the psychologist couldn't test you at the moment. However, it might still be worthwhile exploring other resources or options for an evaluation, even if it means waiting a bit longer. Maybe you could reach out to other mental health professionals to inquire about their services or recommendations. Additionally, there might be support groups or online communities where you can find people who have experienced similar challenges and can provide guidance.

Regarding your parents, I understand why you feel hesitant to share everything with them. However, keeping such a significant secret can be stressful and impact your mental well-being in the long run. Perhaps you could consider having an open and honest conversation with them about your struggles. It might surprise you how understanding and supportive they can be, especially given their professional backgrounds. Remember, they want what's best for you and may be more willing to help than you expect.

In the meantime, it could be beneficial to explore strategies for studying that work best for you. Everyone learns differently, so finding a study routine that suits your learning style can make a big difference. Experiment with different techniques, such as breaking down tasks into smaller, more manageable chunks, creating a study schedule, utilizing visual aids, or seeking out additional resources like tutoring or study groups. Developing healthy habits and self-care routines, such as prioritizing sleep, exercise, and relaxation, can also contribute to improved focus and motivation.

Lastly, please remember to be kind and patient with yourself. Change takes time, and setbacks are a normal part of any journey. You're not alone in your struggles, and reaching out for support, whether it's from loved ones, professionals, or online communities, can make a significant difference. Keep trying and remember that your worth extends far beyond your academic performance. You deserve support and understanding as you navigate this challenging period."	2	0	0	0.0007616281509399414	mental health forum

"I'm sorry to hear that you're feeling lost and struggling with your studies. It sounds like you've been dealing with this for quite some time and it's taking a toll on you. It takes a lot of courage to reach out and share your experiences. While I can't provide direct help in this format, I would encourage you to consider a few steps.

Firstly, it might be helpful to have an open and honest conversation with your parents about what you've been going through. I understand that you're worried about their reaction, but keeping this secret could also be adding to your stress. It's important for them to understand the challenges you're facing so they can provide support.

Secondly, I hear that you're interested in exploring whether ADHD might be a factor in your difficulties. While it may be challenging to access testing through the public system, it might be worth considering other options, such as seeking a second opinion or exploring affordable private testing options in your area. ADHD can significantly impact your ability to focus and study effectively, so it's worth addressing.

Lastly, it might be beneficial to reach out to your university's counseling services or a mental health professional who specializes in working with students. They can provide guidance, support, and help you develop strategies to manage your studying and improve your academic performance.

Remember, you don't have to face these challenges alone. There are resources available to support you, and reaching out for help is a positive step towards finding a solution."	2	0	0	0.0007156729698181152	clinician

"I'm sorry to hear that you're feeling lost and unsure of what to do. It sounds like you've been facing academic challenges for a while and it's been affecting your self-esteem. It's completely understandable to feel overwhelmed and to question what might be wrong.

Firstly, it's important to remember that seeking help is a sign of strength, and it can greatly benefit your overall well-being. While it's unfortunate that you weren't able to get tested for ADHD, there are other resources available to explore. You could consider looking for low-cost or community mental health clinics, support groups, or online resources that may offer guidance on managing your study habits and addressing any potential underlying issues.

Sharing your struggles with your parents can be difficult, especially when you fear their disappointment. However, keeping everything to yourself may only add to your stress and isolate you further. It may be helpful to find a calm and appropriate time to sit down with them and express your concerns. Let them know that you are trying your best but have been facing obstacles. By opening up, you give them a chance to understand and support you through this challenging time.

It's important to be compassionate towards yourself and avoid self-blame. Remember that progress takes time, and setbacks are a normal part of any journey. Instead of dwelling on past failures, focus on developing healthy study habits and seeking support. You mentioned that your brain has ideas on how to get better, so start by breaking down your goals into smaller, manageable tasks and setting aside dedicated time for studying. You might find it helpful to create a study schedule or seek out study techniques that work best for you.

Lastly, know that you're not alone in this. Many people face academic challenges and experience periods of feeling stuck. Reach out to friends, classmates, or online communities who can provide support and share similar experiences. They may have insights or strategies that could be beneficial for your situation.

Remember to be patient with yourself and celebrate every step forward, no matter how small. You have the strength to navigate this difficult period and find a path that works for you."	2	0	0	0.0007329583168029785	forum with demographics

I can understand how overwhelmed you must be feeling right now. It sounds like you're struggling with your academic performance and experiencing a significant amount of pressure from your parents. It's not easy when there are high expectations to meet.

Even though it may feel like it, you're not alone in this. Many individuals face challenges with motivation and staying focused on their studies. It's important to remember that mental health can play a role in academic performance. The fact that you've already sought help from a psychologist shows that you are proactive in trying to find answers.

While it's unfortunate that public healthcare isn't able to prioritize testing for you at the moment, there are other options you can explore. Have you considered talking to your university's counseling services? They may be able to provide assistance and support. They can also guide you on possible avenues for affordable private testing if it's necessary.

It's understandable that you're hesitant to share everything with your parents, given their expectations. However, opening up and having an honest conversation with them might bring some relief. Sharing your struggles and seeking their support could potentially lessen the burden you're carrying on your own.

In the meantime, it might be helpful to break your studying down into smaller, manageable tasks. Setting achievable goals and establishing a study routine can help you get started and build consistency. Additionally, finding a study group or seeking tutoring assistance from your university might also provide you with the structure and support you need.

Remember, it's vital to prioritize self-care during this challenging period. Identifying coping strategies like exercise, relaxation techniques, connecting with friends, or engaging in hobbies can help manage stress and improve overall well-being.

Lastly, reaching out for help is a great first step, and I encourage you to continue seeking support, not only here but also from professionals who can offer specialized guidance. Keep trying different approaches until you find the one that resonates with you.

You can get through this, and with the right resources and support, you will find your path forward."	1	0	0	0.0006977319717407227	forum w/o demographics

Lastly, try to focus on the present moment and taking small steps towards finding a new path or purpose. Setting short-term goals for yourself can help provide a sense of direction and accomplishment. Remember, it's okay to feel lost or unsure at times, but don't give up on yourself.

Remember, it is natural to feel empty and without direction during times of transition. It takes time and effort to find new purpose and goals. Be patient with yourself as you explore new possibilities and allow yourself the space to gradually rediscover what ignites that spark within you.

Take small steps towards exploring your interests, talking to people who have pursued similar paths, or seeking advice from career counselors. Engaging in self-exploration and seeking support can be valuable steps towards finding a new sense of purpose and direction in your life.

It sounds like you are going through a tough time right now, and it's completely understandable to feel lost and demotivated when your previous goals and aspirations no longer seem attainable. It's important to remember that it's okay to feel this way, and many people experience similar struggles in different stages of life. 

While I don't have all the answers for you, I can offer some suggestions to help you find a new sense of purpose and direction. Firstly, try to take some time for self-reflection. Ask yourself what truly interests and excites you. Consider your passions, hobbies, and values. Identifying these can guide you towards a new goal or purpose that aligns with your personal aspirations.

Additionally, exploring opportunities in your immediate surroundings can be a great starting point. Take advantage of the resources and connections available in India, such as local organizations, community projects, or mentorship programs. Engaging in activities that give back to your community could help reignite that spark you're missing right now.

Furthermore, don't hesitate to seek support from friends, family, or professionals. Sometimes, talking to someone who understands and can provide guidance can make all the difference. Mental health professionals, career counselors, or even support groups may be able to offer valuable insights and help you navigate this challenging period.

Remember, it's okay to not have all the answers right away, and finding your new purpose may take time. Be patient with yourself throughout this process, and try to practice self-care and self-compassion. You are not alone, and there are people out there who can support you on this journey. Keep searching and exploring, and eventually, you will find your way."	1	0	0	0.0006309151649475098	forum w/o demographics
"Most problems started in 2020. In March, the start of covid. I was sick (and i don't know the reason why) and my dad came, from the most southern province of the country back to discuss with me. He announced that the divorce i did not know about was gonna happen, and kinda after that day he just left to my step family. That's part one: the divorce. 
After a few months when we were all emotionally unstable i went to visit to their house and also sleep there. From 2020-2021 most of those events happened. There are a few key moments. There were moments where my step brother (2 then) and step sister (7), were pretty annoying. I hate them both. At some point in 2021 there was conflict and i got so mad i pointed a knife towards my step mother that i still hate. Since then was i not allowed to there anymore. That's the divorce part. 

Now for the school and crush part. So since 2020 I've had a crush on someone (gender unconfirmed) and we were friends, lifelong. Together with my childhood friend, we were the 3 Musketeers. But my crush began to hate on my friend, causing me to have to choose for 1. I chose my crush, not to realize she was already internet dating with people scattered across the world. So i changed my mind and chose my friend. After this change my crush began being extremely toxic and is now my enemy, also causing some bad traumas. 

The basic school: i was never a group's child. I'm not bullied, neither accepted. I didn't really have much friends, except 2 till now (IRL). Most others betrayed me. 

My mom: i live alone with my mom, and some conflicts made. Maybe this is just puberty, or Asian parenting. But i don't quite believe she really does love love me. 

The interneg saga: since fall 2022, I've been playing a lot of hypixel. I met someone (a girl) and she invited me to her SMP. I met a lot of friends and we had fun. Around september the SMP kinda died and nobody really joined anymore. I downloaded discord again, and begon chat with 2 of friends. The girl was really unactive on both discord and minecraft (she's only active at breaks apparently). The other friend was a 16 year old Austrian boy. He was the first internet friend. We were great friends. After that success, i began gaining more internet friends. I decided to recall my old youtube series SMP, and invited him, along with 3 other friends. After that success i opened a discord server for the friends too. More friends were coming. When at a rare moment, i realized i had feelings for the girl that invited me to the SMP (as she really knew me and accepted me, even helping me with my murder habit). Sadly she's still only online around school breaks. At some point at January, one of my internet friends invited a guy named Oz. He played on my creative server along with other friends. At one point he decided to be bad and destroy my steakhouse in game (almost). I banned him from both servers. Others disagreed, so a month later he re-appears. He then tried to grief. So he was banned again. Then a weird glitch happened to the server, and for no reason he was re-invited. A hacker was controlling him (unsure, great chance he lied). We ""solved"" the hacker, but then some conflict came. I said not so nice things to him, as nuking his country or that the hacker may come back to hack him and his family. The Austrian boy, was really scared out by this and left in neutrality. He thought i was going insane so unfriended me. He said i needed mental health help. 

What should i do. I don't think i have a bad life, but that's because i compare it to African starving children. Am i going through depression, puberty or is this normal?"	"Hey there! 💬 It sounds like you've been through a lot of challenging situations lately, and it's completely understandable to feel overwhelmed. It's important to remember that everyone's experiences are valid, so comparing them to others isn't necessary. 💪🌟

You mentioned conflicts with your stepfamily and some toxic relationships. It might help to talk to someone you trust about these issues and seek their advice. It's always good to have support! 🤝💕

Regarding your crush and friendships, remember that it's okay to prioritize your own well-being. Surround yourself with positive influences and people who truly appreciate you for who you are. Your happiness and mental health should come first. 🌈😊

As for your feelings about your mom, misunderstandings and conflicts can happen in any relationship. Communication is key! Try having an open and honest conversation with her about your concerns and how you've been feeling. It's possible that things might improve once you both understand each other better. 🗣️❤️

Lastly, it's important to address your mental health. If you're feeling overwhelmed, down, or unsure, consider reaching out to a mental health professional who can support you on this journey. They can help determine if what you're experiencing is depression, puberty-related, or simply a part of life's ups and downs. Remember, seeking help is a brave and positive step! 🌟✨

You are not alone in this, and things can get better! Take care of yourself and always remember to prioritize your well-being. 🌻💙"	1	0	0	0.0006937980651855469	social media

"I'm sorry to hear that you're feeling overwhelmed by everything that has been happening in your life. It's important to remember that everyone's experience is valid, and what may seem small to others can still have a significant impact on your mental well-being. It's understandable that you're feeling confused and unsure about what you're going through.

Firstly, it's important to acknowledge your emotions and concerns. It seems like you have been through a lot of changes recently, including the divorce of your parents and conflicts within your family. These experiences can be emotionally challenging and can contribute to feelings of sadness, anger, or confusion. It might be helpful to find someone you trust, whether it's a family member, friend, or mental health professional, to talk about your feelings and provide you with support.

Regarding your school and social life, it can be difficult to find your place and feel accepted, especially when you've had experiences of betrayal from friends. Remember that forming meaningful connections takes time, and it's important to be patient with yourself. You mentioned having a few friends, and that's a great starting point. Continue nurturing those relationships and consider exploring new hobbies or joining activities where you can meet like-minded individuals who share your interests.

As for your relationship with your mom, conflicts can arise between parents and teenagers, especially during puberty. It's important to communicate openly and honestly with her about how you're feeling. Express your concerns and let her know that you would like to work on your relationship. Sometimes, it takes time for parents and children to understand each other better, and open communication can help build stronger bonds.

Regarding your online experiences, while it's great that you've made friends through gaming and Discord, it's important to remember that online relationships are different from real-life relationships. It's essential to prioritize your mental well-being and establish healthy boundaries with others online. If certain interactions are causing you distress, it might be helpful to take a step back, reevaluate your online friendships, and focus on the ones that bring positivity into your life.

In terms of your mental health, it's difficult to diagnose yourself based on a forum post. However, it may be helpful to consult with a mental health professional who can assess your thoughts, feelings, and experiences. They can provide you with a proper diagnosis, if necessary, and work with you to develop coping strategies to navigate through these challenges.

Remember, seeking help is a sign of strength, and it's important to take care of your emotional well-being. You don't have to face these challenges alone, and there are people who can support you along the way."	2	0	0	0.0006446242332458496	mental health forum

I want to acknowledge the difficult experiences and emotions you've been going through. It sounds like you've encountered multiple significant challenges in your family, friendships, and online relationships, which can undoubtedly take a toll on your mental well-being. While I am unable to provide the help that you need in this online forum, I encourage you to seek support from a qualified mental health professional who can help you navigate these complex emotions and provide the appropriate guidance.

It's important to remember that comparing your experiences to others, such as African starving children, might minimize the validity of your own emotions. Each person's struggles are unique and deserve attention and care. It's also worth considering that your feelings could be influenced by a combination of factors, including various life transitions, relationship dynamics, and general emotional development during puberty.

Speaking with a mental health professional could provide you with a safe space to explore your feelings, work through difficult experiences, and develop coping strategies to manage any emotional distress you may be experiencing. They can also help you navigate your family dynamics, address conflicts in relationships, and explore your sense of self-worth.

Remember, reaching out for support is a courageous step, and it's never too early or too late to seek help. Take care of yourself and trust that with the right support, you can find ways to cope and navigate these challenges.

"It sounds like you've been dealing with a lot of challenging situations lately, and it's completely understandable to feel overwhelmed. It's difficult when significant changes, like your parents' divorce, happen without much warning and can leave you feeling confused and hurt. It's important to acknowledge and process these emotions, so reaching out for support is a great step.

Regarding your school and friendships, it's not uncommon to experience difficulties in these areas during adolescence. It can be tough to find your place and navigate social dynamics. Remember that the actions and attitudes of others are not a reflection of your worth. Sometimes, people's behavior comes from their own personal struggles, and it's important not to blame yourself.

In terms of your relationship with your mother, puberty can indeed bring about conflicts and misunderstandings within parent-child relationships. However, it's important to communicate openly and honestly with her about your feelings. It could help both of you better understand each other and find common ground.

As for your internet friendships, it's important to keep in mind that online interactions can sometimes be complicated and misunderstandings can arise. It seems like there have been some difficult situations with certain individuals. Remember to prioritize your own well-being and avoid engaging in toxic relationships. It might be helpful to take a break from those friendships and focus on developing healthier connections that bring you joy and support.

While I can't provide a diagnosis, it may be beneficial for you to talk to a mental health professional who can offer guidance and support. A therapist or counselor can help you navigate these various challenges, process your emotions, and develop healthy coping mechanisms. They can also assist in understanding whether what you're experiencing is part of normal developmental changes or something that may require further attention.

Lastly, it's important to remember that your experiences are valid and deserving of care and attention, regardless of what others may be going through in different parts of the world. Comparing your struggles to others does not invalidate what you're going through. Your feelings and experiences matter, and seeking support and understanding is a positive step towards improving your well-being."	1	0	0	0.0006742477416992188	forum with demographics

"Tl;dr
When unpleasant things happen, I feel numb, anxious and/or repulsed by my partner whom I love and treasure very much, and have a very strong healthy relationship with. I cannot find anything about this phenomenon. Any help would be very much appreciated<3


I [25F] love my partner[23F] to death, they are the light of my life, my sunshine and guiding moonlight, my best friend, my everything, and the best possible thing I could’ve ever asked for or dreamt of. We are in a very happy, stable, healthy relationship. 

Before we get into the problem, there are a couple factors to take note of.
Firstly, we are LDR(I live in Singapore and they live in the USA, California), we met online near the end of 2021 and we met up in person for the very first time last year in November and it was absolutely wonderful, the happiest 2 weeks of my life.
Secondly, I live in a pretty awful household. I’ve been severely emotionally abused and neglected my entire life and my family is the bane of my existence. I was also severely bullied growing up. I think I’d just sort of gone numb as a coping mechanism, at some point in my life I even experienced a couple months of depersonalisation/ derealisation during highschool. Right before I met my partner, I had just broken out of a 4 year depression period and was finally getting treated for adhd in hopes that I could get my life together. I was… extremely numb at that point, and I could almost feel my brain melting. Despite being numb, it scared me so much it’s what prompted me to see a psychiatrist. It was only last year where I’ve been able to realise the extent of my mental illness. Later on I started getting treated for anxiety and depression as well.

So! Around two months in of being with my partner, some family issues flared up and I was on the receiving end of one of my sister’s worst emotional outbursts. I didn’t think much of it, in the moment I reacted calmly. But I remember feeling extremely nauseous and anxious that night. The next day when I video called my partner, as we do, I noticed I was a little repulsed by them? Which was weird but my initial reaction was to brush it off however the feeling just kept growing stronger. They didn’t do anything different or anything, just looking at them filled me with what I can only describe as pure utter repulsion. Which is a complete utter 180 of the usual warmth and love I feel for them.
I spent the whole week bawling and inconsolable, not understanding and bewildered why I was repulsed by the love of my life. In the end I stayed at my friends place for 3 days to get away from my family and limited time with my partner to reduce the feeling of repulsion. I had very clearly communicated the situation to my partner who was extremely understanding, concerned and sympathetic but was unable to do anything, especially being the subject of my repulsion. After 2 weeks the the feeling slowly started to subside and I was able to feel my whole feelings of warmth and love for them again.

I’ve searched high and low on the internet but I cannot find anything about this phenomenon. Why is it directed at my partner, my favourite person in the world? Why not literally anyone else?🥲

Of course I knew there was always a possibility this might happen again but yet I was kinda caught off guard. A week ago my partner and I had a serious discussion after 2 weeks of them being away on a work trip and unable to call. It was over something we have discussed before and it’s something that can’t really be helped due to the distance and time difference of 16 hours, but nonetheless we both end up tearful and just… sad due to the circumstances.

Over the next few days I realised I was feeling numb and more baffling, anxious (but not repulsed) around my partner. Which has never happened before. They have always been my biggest comfort. The anxiety especially flares up when they mention things like our future visits or our hypothetical wedding and future house together. Usually I love discussing these things, and it makes me very happy knowing our future together is something we both think about. But currently they just fill me with anxiety and dread. I have since communicated all this to my partner and we have decided not to touch on those topics until further notice. They have been extremely sweet and supportive, and despite me being scared and confused I can’t feel my love for them, they have been extremely optimistic and confidant about my feelings for them. Which helps a little. At least someone knows how I really feel I suppose :’)) Since this isn’t their first rodeo they’re not scared and confused like last time, just sweet and supportive.

I don’t understand what happened, it’s not like we’ve never discussed serious before. We have very open and radical communication and honesty. So I fail to understand what triggered this bout of… whatever this is.:(

I’m panicking, I don’t know what to do. My partner is an amazing, wonderful person and aside from the inner daily inner turmoil and frustration, I also hate to put them through this. I miss them too, and I just… don’t understand why I feel this way or why this is happening. I’m scared. I don’t want to feel this way, I don’t want to lose them, I can’t help but feel they deserve someone who won’t go through this bouts of not even knowing how or why they feel a certain way. Is this normal? Am I doomed to periods like this for the rest of my life? Is this abnormal? Should I continue this relationship? If my brain self sabotaging?? Why is it targeting the best thing in my life?? Does it think it’s too good to be true?? I don’t want to hurt my partner😭😭 

If you’ve reached the end, thank you. This is certainly quite the long read😅 I appreciate you getting this far and if you have any advice or similar experiences, please enlighten me I’d be ever so grateful to learn from them.<3"	"Hey there! 💕 First of all, I want to say that I'm really sorry you're going through this. It sounds like a confusing and difficult situation. It's great that you have such a strong and loving relationship with your partner, and it's understandable that you want to understand and overcome these feelings.

From what you've shared, it seems like there may be some underlying factors contributing to these bouts of numbness, anxiety, and repulsion. It's possible that the stress and trauma from your past, as well as the difficult family environment, could be affecting your emotional well-being. It's important to acknowledge the impact that past experiences can have on our present feelings and relationships.

Seeking support from a mental health professional could be really helpful. They can provide guidance and help you navigate through these emotions. They could also help you explore any possible triggers and patterns that might be contributing to these experiences. Remember, seeking help is a sign of strength and self-care.

It's also important to maintain open and honest communication with your partner, which it seems like you're already doing. Sharing your feelings and concerns with them can help them understand and support you better. Together, you can find ways to navigate through this and work towards a healthier, more fulfilling relationship.

You're not alone in this, and there are people who can help you through it. Stay strong, keep communicating, and don't hesitate to reach out for support. Sending you lots of love and support! ❤️"	2	0	0	0.0006400942802429199	social media

When unpleasant things happen, I feel numb, anxious and/or repulsed by my partner whom I love and treasure very much, and have a very strong healthy relationship with. I cannot find anything about this phenomenon. Any help would be very much appreciated<3


I [25F] love my partner[23F] to death, they are the light of my life, my sunshine and guiding moonlight, my best friend, my everything, and the best possible thing I could’ve ever asked for or dreamt of. We are in a very happy, stable, healthy relationship. 

Before we get into the problem, there are a couple factors to take note of.
Firstly, we are LDR(I live in Singapore and they live in the USA, California), we met online near the end of 2021 and we met up in person for the very first time last year in November and it was absolutely wonderful, the happiest 2 weeks of my life.
Secondly, I live in a pretty awful household. I’ve been severely emotionally abused and neglected my entire life and my family is the bane of my existence. I was also severely bullied growing up. I think I’d just sort of gone numb as a coping mechanism, at some point in my life I even experienced a couple months of depersonalisation/ derealisation during highschool. Right before I met my partner, I had just broken out of a 4 year depression period and was finally getting treated for adhd in hopes that I could get my life together. I was… extremely numb at that point, and I could almost feel my brain melting. Despite being numb, it scared me so much it’s what prompted me to see a psychiatrist. It was only last year where I’ve been able to realise the extent of my mental illness. Later on I started getting treated for anxiety and depression as well.

So! Around two months in of being with my partner, some family issues flared up and I was on the receiving end of one of my sister’s worst emotional outbursts. I didn’t think much of it, in the moment I reacted calmly. But I remember feeling extremely nauseous and anxious that night. The next day when I video called my partner, as we do, I noticed I was a little repulsed by them? Which was weird but my initial reaction was to brush it off however the feeling just kept growing stronger. They didn’t do anything different or anything, just looking at them filled me with what I can only describe as pure utter repulsion. Which is a complete utter 180 of the usual warmth and love I feel for them.
I spent the whole week bawling and inconsolable, not understanding and bewildered why I was repulsed by the love of my life. In the end I stayed at my friends place for 3 days to get away from my family and limited time with my partner to reduce the feeling of repulsion. I had very clearly communicated the situation to my partner who was extremely understanding, concerned and sympathetic but was unable to do anything, especially being the subject of my repulsion. After 2 weeks the the feeling slowly started to subside and I was able to feel my whole feelings of warmth and love for them again.

I’ve searched high and low on the internet but I cannot find anything about this phenomenon. Why is it directed at my partner, my favourite person in the world? Why not literally anyone else?🥲

Of course I knew there was always a possibility this might happen again but yet I was kinda caught off guard. A week ago my partner and I had a serious discussion after 2 weeks of them being away on a work trip and unable to call. It was over something we have discussed before and it’s something that can’t really be helped due to the distance and time difference of 16 hours, but nonetheless we both end up tearful and just… sad due to the circumstances.

Over the next few days I realised I was feeling numb and more baffling, anxious (but not repulsed) around my partner. Which has never happened before. They have always been my biggest comfort. The anxiety especially flares up when they mention things like our future visits or our hypothetical wedding and future house together. Usually I love discussing these things, and it makes me very happy knowing our future together is something we both think about. But currently they just fill me with anxiety and dread. I have since communicated all this to my partner and we have decided not to touch on those topics until further notice. They have been extremely sweet and supportive, and despite me being scared and confused I can’t feel my love for them, they have been extremely optimistic and confidant about my feelings for them. Which helps a little. At least someone knows how I really feel I suppose :’)) Since this isn’t their first rodeo they’re not scared and confused like last time, just sweet and supportive.

I'm sorry to hear that you're going through such a difficult time right now. It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of conflicting emotions and it can be really confusing and overwhelming. It's important to remember that you're not alone in this and seeking support is a great first step.

Given your past experiences with emotional abuse and bullying, it's understandable that you may have developed coping mechanisms such as numbness and depersonalization. These defense mechanisms can sometimes create challenges in our relationships, especially when we're going through stressful or emotionally intense situations.

It's great that you've been open and honest with your partner about what you're going through. Communication is key in any relationship, and it seems like you both are working together to find ways to navigate these difficult emotions. It's important to continue that open dialogue and maintain that support system.

Please keep in mind that I'm not a mental health professional, but it might be beneficial for you to consider seeking therapy or counseling. A trained therapist can help you explore these feelings further and provide guidance on coping strategies for managing the anxiety and numbness. Additionally, they can assist in addressing any unresolved trauma from your past that might be impacting your current emotions.

Remember, it's okay to ask for help, and professional support can make a significant difference in your mental well-being. Take care, and I hope you find the support and guidance you need."	2	0	0	0.0006725788116455078	mental health forum

It sounds like you've been through a lot in your life, including emotional abuse and bullying, and these experiences may be impacting your current feelings.

Your description of feeling repulsed and anxious towards your partner after certain events suggests that there may be underlying emotional triggers or trauma responses at play. It's not uncommon for past trauma and difficult experiences to affect our current relationships and emotions. It might be helpful to explore these triggers further and consider seeking professional help from a therapist or counselor who specializes in trauma and relationship issues.

Additionally, being in a long-distance relationship can bring its own set of challenges and emotions. The distance and time difference can create feelings of anxiety and uncertainty about the future. It's important to communicate openly with your partner about your feelings and concerns, just as you have been doing.

Regarding your question about whether this is normal or if it will continue in the future, it's difficult to say without understanding the underlying causes more fully. However, with the support of therapy and understanding of your emotions, it's possible to work through these challenges and develop strategies to cope more effectively. Remember that relationships can be complex, and it's normal to experience ups and downs.

Lastly, I want to emphasize that you deserve support and understanding in your relationship. While it's natural to have concerns about how your emotions may impact your partner, it's important not to blame yourself or feel like you're undeserving of love. By seeking help and working on understanding yourself better, you can build a stronger foundation for your relationship and overall well-being.

Take care, and remember that seeking professional help can provide guidance and support during this difficult time."	2	0	0	0.0006476044654846191	clinician

Many people experience unexplained feelings of repulsion, numbness, or anxiety towards their loved ones, even in healthy relationships. It's important to remember that these feelings don't necessarily reflect the reality of your relationship or your partner's worth.

Given the background you shared about your difficult past and struggles with mental health, it's possible that these feelings could be linked to unresolved trauma or emotional patterns. Sometimes, when we experience distressing events or emotions, our brain can associate those feelings with the people or situations that are present at the time. This may explain why you're feeling repulsed or anxious around your partner, despite their loving and supportive presence.

It's encouraging to hear that you have open and honest communication with your partner. Continue to share your feelings and concerns with them, as they can provide support and understanding during this challenging time. In addition, it may be helpful to seek support from a mental health professional, such as a therapist or counselor. They can help you explore these feelings further and provide guidance on coping strategies or therapeutic techniques that can aid in your healing process.

Remember, you deserve love and happiness just like anyone else, and it's okay to seek help and support when you need it. Take things one step at a time, be patient with yourself, and prioritize your own well-being."	2	0	0	0.0006774663925170898	forum with demographics

It sounds like you're dealing with a lot of emotional distress and confusion, and it can be incredibly overwhelming. I'm not a mental health professional, but I can offer some general support and suggestions.

Firstly, please remember that you're not alone in experiencing these kinds of feelings. Many people struggle with intense emotions and changes in their relationships, especially in the context of past trauma or challenging family situations.

It's worth considering that the negative emotions you're feeling towards your partner may be a result of the stress and turmoil you've been experiencing in your personal life. Trauma and difficult family dynamics can influence our emotional responses and impact our relationships in unexpected ways. It might be helpful to explore this possibility with a therapist who can provide guidance tailored to your specific situation.

In the meantime, it's great that you're communicating openly and honestly with your partner about what you're going through. Their support and understanding can be a valuable source of comfort during this time. It might also be beneficial to establish some self-care routines and coping strategies to help manage the anxiety and distress you're experiencing. This could involve engaging in activities that bring you joy or finding healthy outlets for your emotions, such as journaling or talking to a trusted friend or family member.

Remember, it's important to prioritize your own well-being. Seeking professional help from a therapist or counselor who specializes in trauma and relationship issues might provide you with the tools and guidance you need to navigate this situation. They can offer insight into your specific circumstances and help you work through any underlying emotional challenges.

Lastly, try to be patient and kind to yourself during this process. Healing from trauma and managing complex emotions can take time, and it's normal to have ups and downs. Hold onto the love you feel for your partner and trust that with the right support, you can work through the challenges you're facing. Take things one step at a time and remember that you deserve happiness and a healthy relationship.

Please reach out to a mental health professional who can offer more targeted support and guidance. They're equipped to provide you with the tools you need to explore these complex emotions and find a way forward. Take care of yourself, and I hope you find the help you're looking for."	2	0	0	0.0006369948387145996	forum w/o demographics
"Hey, I'm a 16-and-a-half-year old, and I've just moved to the US (California specifically) from Japan (city with about 1 million people) after living there for 2.5 years.

So, to put some background, I lived about half of my life in Hong Kong in an international school and was attending middle school until early 2021 when we suddenly had to move to Japan, where my mom is from. Dad moved to Calfiornia in late 2022. The move and subsequent stay in Japan completely destroyed me, and today I suffer from severe depression due to the experience. I basically had zero personal development and was messed up there, losing much of my contact with my friends and all, alongside failing to integrate with Japanese society. Today I feel like I'm still 14.5 years old, and am extremely scared of growing up.

I suffer from a multitude of problems from that experience, and I do not understand how I'm supposed to grow up.

I literally have no idea what to do, and I just don't know how this isn't just going to go further downhill for me.

&#x200B;"	"Hey everyone, I really need some advice and support. I recently moved from Japan to California after living there for 2.5 years, and it has been an incredibly tough experience for me. I'm 16-and-a-half years old and I feel like my personal development has been completely halted. I lost touch with my friends and struggled to integrate into Japanese society. Now, I have severe depression and I feel stuck in my teenage years.

My parents keep saying that it was just a short part of my life and that I'll see it differently when I grow up. But to me, it feels like I need to live my teenage years now, or it's just not worth it. Starting 10th grade instead of 11th grade is being considered, but I'm worried that my age will prevent me from experiencing things as a teenager.

I feel so lost and I don't know what to do. Can anyone offer any advice or insight? I would really appreciate it. Thanks. 🙏"	1	2	0	0.0012697577476501465	social media

I'm really sorry to hear that you're going through such a tough time. Moving to a new country can be incredibly difficult, especially when it comes with a lot of changes and disruptions to your life. It's completely understandable that you're feeling lost and unsure about your future.

It's important to remember that your feelings are valid and it's okay to be scared or upset about the situation. It's also important to have a support system in place during times like these. Have you talked to anyone about your feelings? Speaking with a counselor or therapist could be helpful in processing your emotions and finding coping mechanisms.

Regarding your concerns about growing up, it's important to remember that everyone's journey is different. While it might feel like you missed out on certain experiences, it doesn't mean you can't still have a fulfilling and enjoyable adolescence. Sometimes, we have to redefine our expectations and find joy in new experiences and opportunities. It might take time, but with the right support, you can navigate this challenging period.

Starting 10th grade instead of 11th might give you some breathing room to adjust and find your footing. It's a decision that should be made based on what feels right for you, academically and emotionally. Remember to communicate your thoughts and concerns openly with your parents so they can understand where you're coming from.

In addition to seeking professional help, reaching out to others who have gone through similar experiences can provide comfort and guidance. Online communities or support groups can offer valuable insights and support from people who understand your struggles.

Finally, try to be patient with yourself. Healing takes time, and it's important to prioritize self-care and self-compassion. While it may be challenging right now, there is hope for a brighter future ahead.

Take care, and reach out if you need anything."	2	0	0	0.0006545186042785645	mental health forum

&#x200B;"	"I'm sorry to hear about the difficult time you've been going through. It sounds like the recent move to Japan had a significant impact on your well-being and sense of identity. It's important to recognize that experiences like these can be challenging, and it's understandable to feel the way you do.

Transitioning to a new country and culture can be overwhelming, especially during such formative years. Feeling a sense of disconnection, loss of friends, and difficulty integrating into a new society are common experiences for individuals in similar situations. It's important to acknowledge and validate your feelings.

Your parents' perspective of seeing the experience as a short part of your life may come from a different understanding of what you're going through. It might be helpful to communicate your thoughts and emotions to them, expressing your need to have a sense of normalcy and belonging during your teenage years. Open and honest communication can help them better understand your perspective.

Starting 10th grade instead of 11th can offer you an opportunity to build a new support system and adjust to your new environment. Additionally, you might consider exploring outlets that can allow you to connect with others who share similar interests or backgrounds. This could include joining clubs, sports teams, or other extracurricular activities, both in school and in the community. Engaging in these activities can provide a sense of belonging and help you form new relationships.

In regards to the fear of growing up, it's important to remember that everyone's journey through adolescence is unique. It's understandable to have concerns and uncertainties, but growth and personal development happen at different paces for everyone. It might be helpful to break this concept of ""growing up"" into smaller, more manageable steps. Focus on setting small goals and rewarding yourself for accomplishing them. This can help you gradually build confidence and embrace new experiences.

Lastly, seeking support from a mental health professional can provide you with additional guidance and strategies to cope with your current challenges. A therapist or counselor can work with you to explore your emotions, develop coping mechanisms, and help you navigate this period of your life. They can also provide a safe and non-judgmental space for you to discuss these concerns.

Remember, it's okay to feel the way you do, and reaching out for help is a positive step towards healing. You deserve support and understanding as you navigate this difficult time."	2	0	2	0.0006412863731384277	clinician

I'm really sorry to hear about the difficult time you've been going through. Moving to a new country can be a challenging experience, especially when it impacts your personal development and connections with friends. It's understandable that you're feeling lost, scared, and unsure about growing up in these circumstances.

It sounds like you're yearning for the opportunity to experience your teenage years and feel like you've missed out on that due to the move. It's natural to feel this way, as adolescence is a significant time for personal growth and exploration. It's important to acknowledge and validate your feelings.

While it may seem like time is against you, it's essential to remember that personal growth and development don't have an expiration date. Just because you didn't have the typical teenage experience doesn't mean you won't be able to grow and find joy in life. It may take some time, but with the right support, you can navigate this challenging period and find happiness.

Consider talking to your parents about your feelings in a calm and open manner. Share your perspective and emotions with them, helping them understand the impact the move has had on you. They might not fully grasp the depth of your experience, and expressing yourself could foster a more empathetic understanding.

Additionally, it could be beneficial to seek professional help from a therapist or counselor who specializes in adolescent issues. They can provide you with guidance, coping strategies, and techniques to navigate through your depression and explore your identity without feeling limited by your past experiences.

Lastly, try to focus on the present moment and what you can control. Engage in activities or hobbies that bring you joy, make new connections, and seek out supportive communities online or in your local area. Surrounding yourself with positive influences and supportive individuals can help you on your journey of self-discovery and growth.

Remember, it's never too late to find happiness and fulfillment, even if the path may be different from what you initially envisioned. Keep reaching out for support and seeking opportunities to make meaningful connections. You deserve to live a fulfilling life.

Take care."	2	0	0	0.0006603598594665527	forum with demographics

I'm really sorry to hear about the difficult time you've been going through. Moving to a new country can be incredibly challenging, especially during your teenage years when personal development and building relationships are so important. It sounds like the transition to Japan was particularly tough for you, and it's understandable that it has had such a significant impact on your mental health.

Feeling like you missed out on your teenage years and struggling to integrate into Japanese society can be very isolating and contribute to feelings of depression. It's important to remember that your experiences are valid and that it's completely normal to feel the way you do.

It's unfortunate that your parents don't fully understand your perspective and the impact this has had on you. Their dismissive attitude may stem from a lack of awareness or understanding of your emotional needs. It might be helpful to try to have an open and honest conversation with them about how you're feeling and the specific challenges you're facing as a result of the move. Sometimes, parents need a little help and education to fully grasp the extent of our struggles.

Starting 10th grade instead of 11th grade could potentially give you more time to adjust and find your place in the new school environment. It's commendable that you're actively considering what might be best for your mental health during this time. It's important to prioritize your well-being and not rush into anything you're not ready for.

In terms of how to navigate your fear of growing up, remember that each person's journey is different, and it's okay to take things at your own pace. It might be helpful to seek support from a mental health professional, such as a therapist or counselor, who can provide guidance and techniques to help you navigate these emotions.

Additionally, consider reaching out to any support networks you may have available, such as friends, family, or even online communities, who can offer understanding and empathy. Remember, you're not alone in your experiences, and connecting with others who have gone through similar challenges can be incredibly comforting and validating.

Lastly, take small steps towards self-care and self-exploration. Engage in activities you enjoy, find hobbies or interests that bring you joy, and try to build a support system of friends who share your interests. It may take time, but gradually immersing yourself in these experiences can help you regain a sense of self and enable personal growth.

Remember, healing and finding your place takes time, and it's okay to feel lost or unsure right now. Give yourself the patience and compassion you deserve and lean on those around you for support. You are strong and resilient, and with time and support, you can find your path forward."	2	0	2	0.000699162483215332	forum w/o demographics
"I (18m) was sexually assaulted multiple times by my cousins in different occasions (26m and 28m) when I was 8 and they were 16 and 18. Hello everyone, I decided to tell you this story to get it off my chest. A bit of a backstory, my father is european and my mother is asian. Back in 2013 we went to my mother's country for a ""vacation"" that turned out to be an 8 year nightmare. There I met my extended family on my mother's side. Particularly my first cousin, let's call him Chris. Chris was the youngest of 2 siblings that were orphaned due to their mother being killed by their father and running away.

One day, he was babysitting me while my mum went to the casino to gamble. My other siblings went to my other cousin's house (not part of the story) to play with them. So I was left with him alone. I was playing with my tablet when he called me and told me to go to the bedroom because he is bored and wants to play a game. So as a naive 8 year old boy, I obliged.

He tells me to lay beside him so he can show me how to play this game. He taught me how to jerk off. A few moments later, he tells me to do the same for him. I said okay and did the same to him. 

One night, while we were sound asleep. He was laying beside me while my other siblings were in another bed, he started to sexually assault me. I woke up to a sharp pain, and him going full on me. I kept silent, thinking that he wanted to play at this late at night. This went on for a good 30 minutes where he finished and went back to sleep. This happened multiple times. 

I later discovered sex and realised that he was doing it to me. I questioned myself if I was gay and I was in denial, telling myself that I like women and I'm not gay. (I was bullied pretty early on for acting a bit feminine)

Now going to the other cousin. Let's call him Joe. He is my 2nd cousin and lived with my aunt while he was studying.

One day we went there for 3 days to visit them and so we met there. We played with my other cousins all day and when night fell and we went to sleep, I slept beside Joe.

I woke up to him feeling my butt while he takes my hand and puts it in his gentleman's area. I was afraid because he looked scary when we first met and so I remained silent and obliged at every motion he makes, he pushes me down, I go down. That went on the 2 nights that we were there. 

I was pretty traumatised and in denial because I am not gay, I like women. And so I kept it a secret.

3 years ago I left that one hell of a country to return back to the home country of my father. I was put on therapy but I didn't mention that I was sexually assaulted by Chris and Joe. And so I still bear the trauma right now.

I don't want to reveal it to my parents since they separated 6 years ago. Because I am alright at the moment. A few nights ago though, I accidentally overshared it with a friend and I kind off regret it but I couldn't help it. 

I feel a big weight off my chest has been relieved and I feel much better now. Thank you for reading."	"Hey everyone, I just wanted to share something that has been weighing on me for a long time. When I was younger, I went through some truly traumatic experiences that I've never really talked about before. It's been difficult to process, especially since it involved family members.

I was sexually assaulted by two of my cousins on different occasions. It happened when I was only 8 years old, and they were older. It's something I've carried with me for a long time, feeling confused and even questioning my own identity.

Recently, I accidentally shared this with a friend, and while part of me regrets it, I also feel a huge relief. Opening up about it has lifted a weight off my chest. It's a step towards healing and moving forward.

I haven't told my parents about what happened, mostly because they separated a while ago and I'm doing alright now. However, I am in therapy, and it's helping me work through some of the trauma.

It takes a lot of courage to open up about such a traumatic experience, and it's understandable that it has been weighing on you. It's important to remember that what happened to you was not your fault, and you are not alone in this.

Sharing your experience with a trusted friend can actually be a positive step towards healing. It allows you to release some of that burden you've been carrying and receive support from someone who cares about you. It's completely normal to have mixed feelings after sharing something so personal, but remember that you took a brave step in reaching out for support.

Considering the impact this trauma has had on you, it might be helpful to revisit the idea of therapy. A professional therapist can provide a safe and confidential space for you to explore your emotions, work through the trauma, and develop coping mechanisms. If you feel comfortable, you might want to consider talking to your therapist about the sexual assault and how it has affected you.

Remember, healing takes time, and it's okay to reach out for support whenever you need it. Take care of yourself and continue to prioritize your well-being. You deserve support and healing after what you've been through."	2	0	0	0.0007001161575317383	mental health forum

One night, while we were sound asleep. He was laying beside me while my other siblings were in another bed, he started to sexually assault me. I woke up to a sharp pain, and him going full on me. I kept silent, thinking that he wanted to play at this late at night. This went on for a good 30 minutes where he finished and went back to sleep. This happened multiple times. 

I later discovered sex and realised that he was doing it to me. I questioned myself if I was gay and I was in denial, telling myself that I like women and I'm not gay. (I was bullied pretty early on for acting a bit feminine)

Now going to the other cousin. Let's call him Joe. He is my 2nd cousin and lived with my aunt while he was studying.

One day we went there for 3 days to visit them and so we met there. We played with my other cousins all day and when night fell and we went to sleep, I slept beside Joe.

I woke up to him feeling my butt while he takes my hand and puts it in his gentleman's area. I was afraid because he looked scary when we first met and so I remained silent and obliged at every motion he makes, he pushes me down, I go down. That went on the 2 nights that we were there. 

I was pretty traumatised and in denial because I am not gay, I like women. And so I kept it a secret.

3 years ago I left that one hell of a country to return back to the home country of my father. I was put on therapy but I didn't mention that I was sexually assaulted by Chris and Joe. And so I still bear the trauma right now.

I don't want to reveal it to my parents since they separated 6 years ago. Because I am alright at the moment. A few nights ago though, I accidentally overshared it with a friend and I kind off regret it but I couldn't help it. 

I feel a big weight off my chest has been relieved and I feel much better now. Thank you for reading."	"Hello there,

Firstly, I want to commend you for finding the courage to share your story. It takes a lot of strength to open up about such painful experiences, and I'm glad that you were able to voice your feelings.

It's important to remember that sexual assault is never the fault of the survivor, regardless of their gender or sexual orientation. Your experiences were traumatic, and it's completely normal for them to have affected you in various ways.

Considering that you mentioned being in therapy, I highly encourage you to discuss these incidents with your therapist. They are trained to help individuals work through trauma and can provide you with the support and guidance you need. Opening up about your experiences will allow them to better understand your struggles and customize your therapy accordingly.

You also mentioned keeping these incidents a secret from your parents, which can be a difficult decision to navigate. If you feel comfortable and believe it would be beneficial, you might consider discussing this with a trusted adult in your life, such as a relative or counselor. They can offer you additional support and potentially assist in finding appropriate resources.

Remember, healing takes time, and everyone's journey is different. Continue to reach out for support, whether it's through therapy, support groups, or online communities like this one. You are not alone, and there are people who care and want to help.

Take care of yourself, and keep sharing your feelings. Your voice matters, and I admire your strength in speaking up."	2	0	0	0.0006601214408874512	forum with demographics
"I (18m) was sexually assaulted multiple times by my cousins in different occasions (26m and 28m) when I was 8 and they were 16 and 18. Hello everyone, I decided to tell you this story to get it off my chest. A bit of a backstory, my father is european and my mother is asian. Back in 2013 we went to my mother's country for a ""vacation"" that turned out to be an 8 year nightmare. There I met my extended family on my mother's side. Particularly my first cousin, let's call him Chris. Chris was the youngest of 2 siblings that were orphaned due to their mother being killed by their father and running away.

One day, he was babysitting me while my mum went to the casino to gamble. My other siblings went to my other cousin's house (not part of the story) to play with them. So I was left with him alone. I was playing with my tablet when he called me and told me to go to the bedroom because he is bored and wants to play a game. So as a naive 8 year old boy, I obliged.

He tells me to lay beside him so he can show me how to play this game. He taught me how to jerk off. A few moments later, he tells me to do the same for him. I said okay and did the same to him.

I'm really sorry to hear about what you've been through. It takes a lot of courage to open up and share your experiences, and I'm glad that you were able to find some relief by doing so. It's important to remember that what happened to you was not your fault, and you didn't deserve to be treated that way.

It sounds like the trauma you experienced has had a significant impact on your life and well-being. While I understand that you may not feel comfortable talking to your parents or mentioning it in therapy, it's crucial to have support from professionals who can help you navigate the trauma and its effects. There are counselors, therapists, and support groups specifically trained to assist survivors of sexual assault. They can provide a safe space for you to discuss your experiences, process your emotions, and work towards healing and recovery.

Remember that seeking help is not a sign of weakness, but rather a brave step towards healing and reclaiming your life. You don't have to face this alone, and there are people out there who are ready to support you. If you're unsure where to start, consider reaching out to organizations like RAINN (Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network) or local mental health hotlines. They can provide guidance and connect you with resources that are suitable for your specific situation.

Please take care of yourself and know that you deserve support and healing."	2	0	0	0.0008268952369689941	forum w/o demographics
"Trigger warning, close call (accident). You may skip.

Had a lot of bad thoughts these past few weeks, tough day at work, no breaks sa sermon kahit pag uwi.

I was riding my bike kanina sa Coastal, way above speed limit kasi its ""throttle therapy"".

I know its toxic, pea-brain strat kesa to talk it out. Hindi lang ako comfortable na magkwento ulit. It felt good, until it didn't.

Cruising at 106, tulala without knowing na may bump sa right side ng kalsada if you are riding southbound and nakalagpas na ng toll.

Nagulat buong katawang lupa ko, my handlebar wobbled. I thought I'm a goner. Tried to control it, my left hand lost its grip and I throttled it while leaning backwards para hindi lumala yung wobbling.

Eventually I gained control ulit before going up the ramp papuntang Las Piñas-Bacoor and pulled over shortly. I was shaking pagbaba ng bike, took me 2 hours bago ako umalis ng rest area na yon.

Umuwi ako ng bahay ng maayos, hindi lumagpas ng 30 takbo ko after what happened kahit 4 AM at walang katao-tao sa kalsada.

To kuya Lorenzo who checked up on me, thank you. Hindi ko man nakuha number mo, sobrang pasasalamat kong tumigil ka para kausapin ako at kamustahin.

Drive safe, friends. Don't be an asshole like me. Thanks."	"Hey everyone, I just had a really close call today and I just need to talk about it. I've been dealing with a lot of negative thoughts lately and work has been tough, so I decided to go for a bike ride to clear my mind. I know it's not the healthiest coping mechanism, but it usually helps. 

Today, I was riding on Coastal, going way over the speed limit because it's a form of ""throttle therapy"" for me. I was just lost in my thoughts until I suddenly hit a bump on the right side of the road. It scared the life out of me and my handlebar started wobbling. I thought that was it, I was a goner. I tried my best to regain control, but my left hand lost its grip and I had to throttle it while leaning backwards to prevent the wobbling from getting worse.

Luckily, I managed to regain control before reaching the Las Piñas-Bacoor ramp and pulled over. I was shaking when I got off my bike and it took me a solid two hours before I could even leave the rest area. 

I made it home safely, but I was so shaken up that I didn't go faster than 30 km/h, even though it was 4 AM and there were no other cars on the road. 

I just want to send a huge thank you to Kuya Lorenzo who stopped to check on me. Unfortunately, I didn't get his number, but I am so grateful that he took the time to talk to me and make sure I was okay. 

Please, everyone, drive safe and don't be reckless like me. I've learned my lesson. Thanks for listening."	1	2	0	0.0011063218116760254	social media

Firstly, I want to commend you for reaching out and sharing your story. Opening up about these challenging experiences can be difficult, but it's a great step towards healing and seeking support.

It's understandable that you find it uncomfortable to talk about your feelings. However, talking it out can be incredibly helpful in processing and navigating through difficult emotions. If you're not ready to confide in someone close to you, you might consider reaching out to a mental health professional. They are trained to provide support and can offer guidance on coping strategies.

It's important to try and find healthier ways to deal with stress and negative thoughts. While ""throttle therapy"" provided temporary relief, it's not a sustainable long-term solution. Exploring other coping mechanisms, such as engaging in hobbies or activities you enjoy, practicing mindfulness or relaxation techniques, or even seeking therapy, can help alleviate some of the stress and pressure you may be feeling.

Remember that it's okay to ask for support. If you ever find yourself in a distressing situation again, try reaching out to someone you trust, or even consider contacting a helpline specifically designed for situations like this. They can provide immediate support and offer guidance on how to navigate through those moments.

Take care of yourself and prioritize self-care. You have shown strength in sharing your story, and with the right support, you can find healthier ways to cope with the difficulties you face. You are not alone, and there are people out there who genuinely care about your well-being."	2	0	0	0.0006551146507263184	mental health forum

anw, skl."	"I understand how overwhelming and anxious you must be feeling right now about the upcoming exam. It's completely normal to feel scared and doubt your abilities, especially when comparing yourself to others who seem to have passing effortlessly.

First of all, it's important to remember that everyone has their own study methods and pace. Just because your friends didn't study as much doesn't mean that you won't do well by putting in the necessary effort. In fact, taking the time to review and study can greatly increase your chances of success.

It's understandable that work commitments have taken up a lot of your time recently, making it difficult to study consistently. However, instead of dwelling on the past, try to focus on the time that you do have left before the exam. Create a study schedule and prioritize the topics that you feel less confident about. Break down your studying into smaller, manageable chunks, and make the most of the time you have available.

When it comes to feeling doubtful about your abilities, it's important to challenge those negative thoughts. Remember that your worth and intelligence are not solely defined by one exam. Everyone has their strengths and weaknesses, and it's perfectly okay to struggle in certain subjects. Acknowledging areas where you might need more work is a positive step towards improvement.

Try not to let your worries about your performance on this exam overshadow your long-term goals, such as going to law school. One exam does not determine your entire future. Even if things don't go as planned, it's important to remain resilient and keep working towards your goals.

Lastly, be kind and patient with yourself. Remember to take breaks, practice self-care, and engage in activities that help you relax and alleviate your anxiety. You are capable and have come this far for a reason. Believe in your abilities, stay focused, and give it your best shot. You've got this!"	1	0	0	0.000855565071105957	mental health forum

It is not uncommon to feel this way, especially when comparing yourself to others who may have passed with minimal review. However, it is important to remember that everyone's learning and studying styles are different.

Feeling inadequate or doubting your intelligence is a common concern many students have. It is important to challenge these negative self-perceptions and remind yourself of your strengths and accomplishments. Remember that it is normal to have areas of difficulty, such as math or Filipino, but that does not define your overall intelligence.

It is natural to feel overwhelmed when you haven't had as much time to study as you would have liked. Instead of dwelling on what you haven't done, try to create a plan to make the most of the time you have left. Focus on the areas you feel confident in and allocate specific time to study the subjects you feel less prepared for.

As for your concerns about your future plans of attending law school and taking the bar exam, it's important to take things one step at a time. Try to stay present and focus on the task at hand, which is preparing for the CSE. Remember that success in one exam does not dictate your ability to succeed in law school or the bar exam.

Lastly, it can be helpful to talk to someone about your worries, whether it's a trusted friend, family member, or a mental health professional. They can provide support, help you develop coping strategies, and offer guidance as you navigate through this stressful period.

Remember to take care of yourself during this time, get enough rest, eat well, and engage in activities that help you relax. Good luck on your exam, and remember that your worth and intelligence are not solely determined by one test."	1	0	0	0.0007964968681335449	clinician

I can completely understand why you're feeling scared and anxious about taking the exam on Sunday. It's normal to compare ourselves to others, but it's important to remember that everyone has their own strengths and weaknesses.

It's okay if you haven't been able to study as much as you would have liked due to work. Try not to beat yourself up about it. Instead, focus on maximizing the time you do have to study effectively. Break down the material into manageable chunks and prioritize the areas where you feel least confident.

Feeling doubts about your abilities is something many people experience when facing exams. However, it's important to challenge those negative thoughts. Remember, self-doubt doesn't necessarily reflect your intelligence or capabilities. Try to practice self-compassion and remind yourself that everyone has areas where they struggle.

If you find yourself feeling overwhelmed, take a step back and engage in some self-care activities. Make sure you're getting enough rest, eating well, and taking breaks when needed. Taking care of your mental well-being is just as important as studying.

As for your future plans of going to law school, it's normal to feel uncertain about your abilities and whether you can handle the challenges that lie ahead. Keep in mind that the CSE is just one step in your journey. It doesn't determine your worth or potential success in law school or any other endeavor.

Remember to take it one step at a time, stay focused, and give yourself credit for the effort you're putting in. It's normal to feel anxious before an exam, but try to channel that energy into productive studying rather than letting it consume you.

Life can be overwhelming at times, but remember that even the clouds release their burdens as rain. You're not alone in feeling this way. Take a moment to breathe, find support from your loved ones, and remember that you have the strength to get through whatever is weighing you down.

"It's okay to cry when there's too much on your mind--

The clouds rain too when things get heavy.

\-Amina Mehmood"	"Hey, Amina Mehmood! Thank you for sharing this poetic reminder that sometimes it's okay to let it all out through tears. It's crucial to acknowledge that when we're feeling overwhelmed, crying can be a healthy outlet for our emotions. It's essential to remember that our mental health matters, and we shouldn't be ashamed of expressing our feelings.

Sometimes it can be challenging to cope with a heavy mind, but reaching out and seeking support is a brave step towards healing. Sharing your thoughts and concerns with someone you trust, like a close friend, family member, or therapist, can provide immense relief. They can offer a listening ear and perhaps help you gain some perspective on whatever is weighing you down.

Additionally, finding healthy coping strategies can make a significant difference. Engaging in self-care activities such as meditation, journaling, or engaging in hobbies that bring you joy can help alleviate stress. It's essential to prioritize your well-being and take time for yourself, even in the midst of life's challenges.

Remember, you are not alone in your struggles, and there is support available. Keep talking about what you're going through, both here and with the people around you. Letting out tears can be a step towards finding healing and resilience. Take care, and know that you have a community here ready to lend a helping hand."	1	0	0	0.0006824731826782227	mental health forum

\-Amina Mehmood"	"Dear Redditor,

I wanted to acknowledge and validate your emotions first and foremost. It is completely normal to feel overwhelmed when there is a lot weighing on your mind. Crying can be a healthy and cathartic way to release those emotions and allow yourself to process what you're going through.

Remember that just like the clouds release rain when burdened, you too can find ways to let go and find relief. Exploring coping strategies such as talking to someone you trust, engaging in activities that bring you joy or relaxation, or perhaps journaling your thoughts and feelings can be helpful.

If you feel comfortable, consider reaching out to a mental health professional in your area. They can provide you with the support and guidance you may need during this difficult time. Remember, it's never a sign of weakness to seek help, but rather a brave step towards taking care of your emotional well-being.

Take care of yourself and be kind to yourself as you navigate through this period. You don't have to face it alone.

Warm regards,

Amina Mehmood, Mental Health Clinician"	1	0	0	0.0006489157676696777	clinician

\-Amina Mehmood"	"Hey there, 

I just wanted to remind you that it's completely okay to cry when you feel overwhelmed. Sometimes, when life gets too heavy, our emotions find their way to the surface through tears. It's a natural and healthy way for our bodies and minds to release some of that built-up tension.

Remember that you're not alone in feeling this way. Just like the clouds release rain when they become burdened, it's okay for you to let go and release your emotions as well. It doesn't make you weak or less capable, but rather shows that you're in tune with your feelings.

If crying becomes a frequent occurrence or starts affecting your daily life significantly, it might be worth considering seeking some additional support. Talking to a therapist or counselor can provide a safe space for you to explore and work through the root causes of your heavy thoughts. They can help you develop coping strategies and provide guidance to navigate these overwhelming periods.

In the meantime, be gentle with yourself. Allow yourself to cry, and remember that it's a sign of strength to acknowledge and express your emotions. Take breaks when you need them, practice self-care, and reach out to your support system for comfort and understanding.

Hang in there, things will get better. 

Sending you positivity and strength,

\-Amina Mehmood"	"Hey Amina Mehmood, 

I just wanted to say that it's completely okay to cry when you're feeling overwhelmed. Emotions can really weigh us down sometimes, and shedding tears can be a healthy way to release those feelings. Just like the clouds that cry when they're burdened, we humans do too. It's a natural response to the weight on our minds.

Remember that it's important to give yourself some grace and allow yourself to feel. It's okay to let it out and not keep everything bottled up inside. Crying can actually be quite therapeutic and help us process our emotions. If you find yourself in a place where you're constantly feeling overwhelmed, it might be worthwhile to reach out to a mental health professional who can offer additional support and guidance.

Take care of yourself, Amina Mehmood. Remember that you're not alone, and there are people who care and want to help."	1	0	0	0.0006760358810424805	forum w/o demographics

I'll cut to the chase because I really need some guidance here on how to manage my girlfriend's condition.
  
These diagnosis has been confirmed by a psychiatrist here in Sarawak, Malaysia. 
  

  

  
She has : 
  

  
1. Depression: She would randomly fall into depression anytime she feels alone (most frequent reason and it has been observed to be true) therefore to remedy this, she goes out every single day to shop for clothes , eat at cafes, and frequent a bar that my aunt's best friend owns (to mostly listen to music, play pool, karaoke)
  

  

  
2. Schizophrenia (Hear's voices if surrounding is too quiet, telling her she's not good enough/should harm herself for being useless. To drown these voices out, she constantly listens to music on high volume).
  

  
3. Anxiety: She gets super anxious if there is a stampede level amount of people in locations such as ballrooms etc so there is a limit to how much she can tolerate .
  

  
The deadly combo: Depression and Schizophrenia,  Everytime she feels alone , she would freeze up and experience both of these at the same time, it would start with an uncontrollable onset of depression followed by voices in her head telling her to harm herself / not good enough / no point in staying alive.  To DROWN these voices she self harms . She would cut lines on her wrist with a pen knife until she feels ""calmer"" . According to her, seeing blood on her wrists makes her calm , it stops the voices (she claims the voices would be overpoweringly annoying and she thinks the only way to drown them out would be to cut herself which she claims bring relief.
  

  

  
I'm at a stage where I'm constantly spending time with her nearly everyday skipping important errands which is unsustainable and disuptive to my life as well because I can't trust her to be alone. She seems to also be afraid of being alone too, but when she is , she would try to control symptoms with loud music to drown voices and if necessary she would take an emergency prescription called ""CLONazepam"" to supress her emotions etc and fall asleep. 
  

  
""Escitalopram"" is another prescription for her depression and anxiety. As well as another one to treat schizophrenia (forgot the name).
  

  
She also seems to be suffering from chronic insomnia where she would be able to stay up to 48 hours if she's not taking her depression prescription (which also helps her sleep)
  

  
The main problem I need help with is to find a way to help her manage her urges to self harm , lately it seems to be amplifying. Most of the time she takes her prescriptions and she would be fine, but there are days when she would feel a severe instant onset of depression+schizophrenia and the medication would be too late to stop her from the thought of self harming. A good example was yesterday when she was with me in my room and I fell asleep before her since she left her medication that helps with sleep at her home, she woke me up and told me she is experiencing extreme depression and she felt like self harming herself and she cried. I reassured her that I won't leave her side and would be there constantly to keep her from her urges, prior to waking me up , she took the emergency prescription ""CLONazepam"" which eventually kicked in and made her drowsy and she eventually fell asleep. Had I not been there she told me she would have 100% tried to cut herself. She told me the voices in her head was so annoying that she needed to cut herself to feel relief. 
  

  
So now you can see why this is a problem. Eventually I will find a job and I wouldnt be able to be present as often anymore. I need to find ways to help her manage the symptoms better and ultimately try to cure her onset schizophrenia because that seems to be the most debilitating part of her condition . It disrupts her life completely and she isnt able to work because of it. 
  

  
Despite all the consultations with psychiatrists (whom seem to be absoultely unexperienced and unprofessional) here in sarawak malaysia ,  she still feels these things. The only thing that works is her medication however the therapy part of her treatment doesnt seem to be effective. Previously during her first attempt to get professional help,  they would keep her in the hospital and restrain her for a few days because of the self harming.She told me the psychiatrists and staff were mostly rude to her and treated her like she was a crazy person. In therapys sessions , they would literally tell her not to  ""overthink about things"" as an advice which stunned me. She also was taught steps to help manage symptoms from a binder which she could not bring home so she would have to jot it down on her phone or something.
  

  

  
(Extra background info)
  
1. I onced rushed to her house with a first aid kit and just saw her sitting there non chalantly with her wrists filled with dried up blood from the cuts and acts like it's normal and she would like laugh when I took it seriously. She would tell me ""relax it's normal , everytime i cut my wrists i dont feel anything,it's just small cuts, I'm not gonna die or anything""
  

  
2. We've only gotten together with her for 2 months , and i decided to be with her knowing her symptoms because I fell in love and I wanted to help her to get better but this seems to be taking a toll on me too as she would go out every single day and expects me to be there with her (not forced however but I would force myself to be there to accompany her to keep her safe as she only has 2 friends currently (whom are working and arent always available)
  

  
3. She was raped by her own brother at 14 , her family members did not believe her claims. Now is staying with parents still but rapist brother is in another city. I told her to make a report but she didnt want to risk being disowned by her parents. She's currently 18, I'm 23. 
  

  
4. She also has a history of abusive exes (verbal abuse) 
  

  
5. She has a history of taking recreational drugs such as ecstacy and ketamine ( she stopped at the moment ) , so we're chinese and there are lots of chinese connections here in our hometown that deals drugs mostly at Karaoke Centers. Currently she stopped already but she still keeps in contact with those people. I adviced her to cut ties with these people but she doesnt want to. She told me she isnt confident that she cant completely stop it in the future if i ever am not around. 
  

  
6. Her family is aware of her condition but doesn't understand it therefore is often dismissive of her condition and considers it a burden and a waste of their time. (This is the most hearbreaking part)
  

  

  
To anyone who's gone through the same thing and recovered or psychologists on this platform. I'm in desperate need of help to help my girl manage her symptoms. I'm really afraid of losing her . She has the kindest soul but she hides her pain constantly and she doesnt want to open up to others. But she has me now and I constantly remind her that she can talk to me about anything but it's still something she is working on . She constantly hides her pain and acts like everything is okay , makes jokes constantly but when she's alone that all changes. Obviously hiding it all in has been something she's been doing for years and it's definitely not healthy in the long run and it comes back with a vengeance anyways whenever she's in a state of loneliness and helplessness. 
  

  
I appreciate you guys in advance for any advice that you can give her . She doesn't know how else to seek help so I'm going to seek help for her. Money is also a constraint so I cant bring her to a more qualified/experienced  therapist/psychologist in another city yet but maybe in the future. Saving up the money as we speak."	Hey there, I'm really sorry to hear about what you and your girlfriend are going through. It's really important to seek professional help and support for her condition. Remember that there are helpline numbers you can call or online resources that might provide guidance as well. Take care and I hope you find the help you need.	2	0	0	0.0005983114242553711	social media

"I'm so sorry to hear about the challenges you and your girlfriend are facing. It's clear that you care deeply for her and want to help her manage her symptoms. 

Firstly, it's great that she is receiving treatment and taking medication for her conditions. Medication can be an important part of managing symptoms, but it's also crucial to have a holistic approach to mental health. Therapy can be incredibly helpful in teaching coping mechanisms and providing tools for managing difficult emotions. If the therapy she has received in the past hasn't been effective, it might be worth considering trying a different therapist or type of therapy. Different approaches can work better for different individuals, so don't lose hope in finding one that works for her. 

In addition to therapy, there are some things you can do to support her. Encourage her to engage in activities that promote relaxation and reduce stress. This can include things like practicing mindfulness, deep breathing exercises, or engaging in hobbies that she enjoys. Regular exercise can also be beneficial for managing symptoms of depression, anxiety, and insomnia. 

Having a support system is crucial, so encourage her to reach out to friends, family, or even support groups who can offer understanding and empathy. You're doing a great job being there for her, but it's important for her to have multiple sources of support. 

It's also important to address the self-harm urges. Encourage her to develop a safety plan that includes alternative coping skills for when she feels the urge to self-harm. This can include activities like drawing on her skin instead of cutting, writing in a journal, or calling a crisis helpline when she feels overwhelmed. It might be helpful for her to work closely with a mental health professional to create this plan.

Lastly, remember to take care of your own mental health as well. Supporting someone with mental health challenges can be extremely demanding and it's important to have your own support system. Consider seeking help for yourself from a therapist or support group to help navigate these difficult circumstances.

While I can't provide the exact help that you need, I hope these suggestions can provide some guidance. Remember that recovery and managing mental health conditions is a process, and it takes time. Keep seeking support, ask for help when needed, and remain patient and understanding."	2	0	0	0.0006879568099975586	mental health forum

"I'm sorry to hear about the challenges that you and your girlfriend are facing. It sounds like she is dealing with a complex set of symptoms and experiences, which can be really overwhelming. It's great that she has your support and that you are seeking help for her. While I cannot provide direct treatment or a diagnosis online, I can offer some general suggestions.

Firstly, it's important for her to continue taking her prescribed medications as directed by her psychiatrist. These medications can help manage her symptoms and stabilize her mood. Encourage her to communicate openly with her healthcare provider about any side effects or concerns she may have regarding her medication.

Regarding therapy, it may be helpful for her to consider finding a therapist who specializes in trauma and can provide a safe and supportive environment for her to process her experiences. Therapy can help her develop coping strategies, explore underlying issues, and work towards healing.

In the meantime, you can also support her by practicing active listening and being non-judgmental. Encourage her to express her feelings and concerns, and assure her that you are there to listen without judgment. Additionally, encourage her to engage in self-care activities like exercise, relaxation techniques, and hobbies that she enjoys. These activities can help distract her from distressing thoughts and promote overall well-being.

While you are working towards being financially able to seek more specialized help, there are online resources available that offer support groups and forums where she can connect with others who may have similar experiences. These platforms can provide a sense of community and understanding.

I'll cut to the chase because I really need some guidance here on how to manage my girlfriend's condition.
  
These diagnosis has been confirmed by a psychiatrist here in Sarawak, Malaysia. 
  

  

  
She has : 
  

  
1. Depression: She would randomly fall into depression anytime she feels alone (most frequent reason and it has been observed to be true) therefore to remedy this, she goes out every single day to shop for clothes , eat at cafes, and frequent a bar that my aunt's best friend owns (to mostly listen to music, play pool, karaoke)
  

  

  
2. Schizophrenia (Hear's voices if surrounding is too quiet, telling her she's not good enough/should harm herself for being useless. To drown these voices out, she constantly listens to music on high volume).
  

  
3. Anxiety: She gets super anxious if there is a stampede level amount of people in locations such as ballrooms etc so there is a limit to how much she can tolerate .
  

  
The deadly combo: Depression and Schizophrenia,  Everytime she feels alone , she would freeze up and experience both of these at the same time, it would start with an uncontrollable onset of depression followed by voices in her head telling her to harm herself / not good enough / no point in staying alive.  To DROWN these voices she self harms . She would cut lines on her wrist with a pen knife until she feels ""calmer"" . According to her, seeing blood on her wrists makes her calm , it stops the voices (she claims the voices would be overpoweringly annoying and she thinks the only way to drown them out would be to cut herself which she claims bring relief.
  

  

  
I'm at a stage where I'm constantly spending time with her nearly everyday skipping important errands which is unsustainable and disuptive to my life as well because I can't trust her to be alone. She seems to also be afraid of being alone too, but when she is , she would try to control symptoms with loud music to drown voices and if necessary she would take an emergency prescription called ""CLONazepam"" to supress her emotions etc and fall asleep. 
  

  
""Escitalopram"" is another prescription for her depression and anxiety. As well as another one to treat schizophrenia (forgot the name).
  

  
She also seems to be suffering from chronic insomnia where she would be able to stay up to 48 hours if she's not taking her depression prescription (which also helps her sleep)
  

  
The main problem I need help with is to find a way to help her manage her urges to self harm , lately it seems to be amplifying. Most of the time she takes her prescriptions and she would be fine, but there are days when she would feel a severe instant onset of depression+schizophrenia and the medication would be too late to stop her from the thought of self harming. A good example was yesterday when she was with me in my room and I fell asleep before her since she left her medication that helps with sleep at her home, she woke me up and told me she is experiencing extreme depression and she felt like self harming herself and she cried. I reassured her that I won't leave her side and would be there constantly to keep her from her urges, prior to waking me up , she took the emergency prescription ""CLONazepam"" which eventually kicked in and made her drowsy and she eventually fell asleep. Had I not been there she told me she would have 100% tried to cut herself. She told me the voices in her head was so annoying that she needed to cut herself to feel relief. 
  

  
So now you can see why this is a problem. Eventually I will find a job and I wouldnt be able to be present as often anymore. I need to find ways to help her manage the symptoms better and ultimately try to cure her onset schizophrenia because that seems to be the most debilitating part of her condition . It disrupts her life completely and she isnt able to work because of it. 
  

  
Despite all the consultations with psychiatrists (whom seem to be absoultely unexperienced and unprofessional) here in sarawak malaysia ,  she still feels these things. The only thing that works is her medication however the therapy part of her treatment doesnt seem to be effective. Previously during her first attempt to get professional help,  they would keep her in the hospital and restrain her for a few days because of the self harming.She told me the psychiatrists and staff were mostly rude to her and treated her like she was a crazy person. In therapys sessions , they would literally tell her not to  ""overthink about things"" as an advice which stunned me. She also was taught steps to help manage symptoms from a binder which she could not bring home so she would have to jot it down on her phone or something.
  

  

  
(Extra background info)
  
1. I onced rushed to her house with a first aid kit and just saw her sitting there non chalantly with her wrists filled with dried up blood from the cuts and acts like it's normal and she would like laugh when I took it seriously. She would tell me ""relax it's normal , everytime i cut my wrists i dont feel anything,it's just small cuts, I'm not gonna die or anything""
  

  
2. We've only gotten together with her for 2 months , and i decided to be with her knowing her symptoms because I fell in love and I wanted to help her to get better but this seems to be taking a toll on me too as she would go out every single day and expects me to be there with her (not forced however but I would force myself to be there to accompany her to keep her safe as she only has 2 friends currently (whom are working and arent always available)
  

  
3. She was raped by her own brother at 14 , her family members did not believe her claims. Now is staying with parents still but rapist brother is in another city. I told her to make a report but she didnt want to risk being disowned by her parents. She's currently 18, I'm 23. 
  

  
4. She also has a history of abusive exes (verbal abuse) 
  

  
5. She has a history of taking recreational drugs such as ecstacy and ketamine ( she stopped at the moment ) , so we're chinese and there are lots of chinese connections here in our hometown that deals drugs mostly at Karaoke Centers. Currently she stopped already but she still keeps in contact with those people. I adviced her to cut ties with these people but she doesnt want to. She told me she isnt confident that she cant completely stop it in the future if i ever am not around. 
  

  
6. Her family is aware of her condition but doesn't understand it therefore is often dismissive of her condition and considers it a burden and a waste of their time. (This is the most hearbreaking part)
  

  

  
To anyone who's gone through the same thing and recovered or psychologists on this platform. I'm in desperate need of help to help my girl manage her symptoms. I'm really afraid of losing her . She has the kindest soul but she hides her pain constantly and she doesnt want to open up to others. But she has me now and I constantly remind her that she can talk to me about anything but it's still something she is working on . She constantly hides her pain and acts like everything is okay , makes jokes constantly but when she's alone that all changes. Obviously hiding it all in has been something she's been doing for years and it's definitely not healthy in the long run and it comes back with a vengeance anyways whenever she's in a state of loneliness and helplessness. 
  

  
I appreciate you guys in advance for any advice that you can give her . She doesn't know how else to seek help so I'm going to seek help for her. Money is also a constraint so I cant bring her to a more qualified/experienced  therapist/psychologist in another city yet but maybe in the future. Saving up the money as we speak."	"I'm really sorry to hear about the challenges you and your girlfriend are facing. It's clear that she is dealing with multiple mental health conditions and that it's having a significant impact on both of your lives. It's commendable that you're seeking help and support for her.

Firstly, it's important to remember that managing mental health conditions can be a complex process that requires professional guidance. While I can't provide the specific help you need, I can offer some general suggestions that might be helpful:

1. Encourage her to continue taking her prescribed medication consistently and on time. Medication plays a crucial role in managing symptoms and stabilizing mood.

2. Encourage her to engage in regular therapy sessions with a qualified mental health professional. Therapy can provide her with coping strategies and techniques to better manage her symptoms and develop resilience.

3. Encourage her to reach out to local support groups or organizations that specialize in mental health. These groups can provide a sense of community and understanding, which can be incredibly helpful for someone living with mental health conditions.

4. Help her create a safety plan for when she experiences severe episodes of depression or suicidal ideation. This plan should include emergency phone numbers, contacts, and steps to take when she feels overwhelmed. Having a plan in place can provide some relief and a sense of control during difficult times.

5. Encourage her to engage in self-care activities that promote relaxation and positive mental health, such as exercise, mindfulness techniques, and hobbies. These activities can act as healthy coping mechanisms and help divert her attention from harmful behaviors.

6. Ensure that you prioritize your own self-care and well-being as well. It's important to establish healthy boundaries and seek support for yourself when needed. Caring for someone with mental health conditions can be challenging, so it's crucial that you also prioritize your mental health.

While these suggestions may provide some relief, it's important to remember that professional help is most effective in managing mental health conditions. Continue saving up money to consult with a qualified therapist or psychologist in the future. They will be able to provide the expertise and guidance that your girlfriend needs.

Remember, you are doing your best to support her, and that in itself is commendable. Keep seeking help, and I hope your girlfriend finds the support and treatment she needs to manage her symptoms effectively."	2	0	0	0.0006628632545471191	forum with demographics

1. Encourage her to attend therapy: Therapy can be a valuable tool for managing mental health conditions. It might be worth exploring different therapists or psychiatrists in your area, as finding the right fit is important. If possible, you could also look into online therapy options, which can be more affordable and accessible.

2. Build a support network: Encourage your girlfriend to join support groups, either in person or online, where she can connect with others who may be going through similar experiences. It can be comforting for her to talk to people who understand what she's going through and have successfully managed their symptoms.

4. Educate yourselves: Learn as much as you can about her conditions to better understand her struggles and how to support her. There are many resources available online, such as websites, books, and articles, that can provide valuable insights and strategies for coping with depression, schizophrenia, and anxiety.

5. Encourage responsible medication use: It's important for your girlfriend to follow the prescribed medication regimen and not make any changes without consulting her healthcare professional. Regular medication use, in combination with therapy, can help manage symptoms more effectively.

6. Encourage her to seek professional help for trauma: Given her history of trauma, it might be beneficial for her to receive professional help specifically focused on healing from her past experiences. Trauma-informed therapists or counselors who specialize in trauma may be able to provide the support she needs.

7. Maintain open communication: Continue to be there for your girlfriend and actively listen to her when she wants to talk. Let her know that you are there to support her, without judgment or pressure. Encourage her to express her feelings and thoughts openly, as this can be an important step toward healing.

Remember, these suggestions are not a substitute for professional help. It's crucial to encourage your girlfriend to seek assistance from qualified mental health professionals who can provide a proper diagnosis, personalized treatment, and ongoing support."	2	0	0	0.0006873607635498047	forum w/o demographics
"So the thing started in march when lost my job. From the country i belong it's really hard to find a well paid job while being a student. I was super happy with my job. So when I lost the job I was feeling heartbroken. I tried to start everything again but i failed. 
Also I am not good looking or pretty neither have a light skin tone which fits the society's preference. 
I don't have a love life too. Actually I am scared to approach to anyone with the looks I have. 
The things got worst when my mom also start picking on me or you can say bullying me for having a dark skin tone or not for being pretty. It's one of the big reason why i stop posting myself on socials. 
She also says i lost the job because she prayed. 
Everything is so messes up in my life. I don't eat properly anymore all I do is watching series online. Which you call you a escape for me. 
Can anyone help me with my situation? I want to recover from all this. Please..

They might have some good resources for you. Also, taking care of your mental well-being is crucial, so try finding healthy ways to cope with stress like engaging in hobbies or connecting with friends.

I'm really sorry to hear that you're going through such a tough time. It sounds like you've been dealing with a lot of challenges, and it's understandable that it's taking a toll on your mental health.

Losing a job can be incredibly difficult, and it's completely normal to feel heartbroken about it. It's important to remember that your worth is not defined by your employment status or appearance. You have so much more to offer the world beyond those things.

It's unfortunate that your mom is bullying you and making hurtful comments about your appearance. It's important to remember that her opinions do not define you. Your worth and beauty come from within, and it's crucial to surround yourself with supportive and loving people who appreciate you for who you are.

Watching series online might provide a temporary escape, but it's important to take care of yourself in other ways as well. Eating properly is crucial for your physical and mental well-being. Try to incorporate healthy and balanced meals into your routine, even if it feels difficult right now. Taking small steps towards self-care can make a big difference in your overall well-being.

Recovering from all this won't happen overnight, but there are some steps you can take towards healing. First, it might be helpful to seek support from a mental health professional, such as a therapist or counselor. They can provide you with a safe space to talk about your struggles and help you develop coping mechanisms.

Additionally, consider reaching out to friends or support groups who can understand and empathize with what you're going through. Sharing your feelings and experiences with others can be incredibly validating and help you feel less alone.

Remember to be kind to yourself during this challenging time. Healing and finding self-confidence takes time, but with patience and support, you can overcome these obstacles and build a fulfilling life.

Take care."	2	0	0	0.0007138848304748535	mental health forum

It's also tough when societal beauty standards and family expectations weigh heavily on your self-esteem. It's important to remember that beauty comes in many forms and everyone deserves love and acceptance, regardless of their appearance. It sounds like your mom's comments have taken a toll on your self-image, which is definitely challenging to navigate. 

It's positive that you have found solace in watching series online, as this can provide a temporary escape. However, it's important to address the underlying issues and work towards recovery. Seeking support from friends, family, or even a mental health professional can be beneficial in helping you navigate these challenges. They can provide guidance in finding healthy coping mechanisms and assist you in rebuilding your self-esteem. 

Since I am not able to provide the help that you need directly, I encourage you to reach out to someone who can, whether it's a trusted person in your life or a mental health professional in your country.

It can be incredibly demoralizing to lose a job that brought you happiness, and the added pressure from your mom must make it even more difficult. Remember, you are not defined by your appearance or societal preferences. Beauty comes in many forms, and you are worthy of love and happiness just as you are.

Rebuilding your life after a setback like this takes time and effort, so be kind to yourself throughout the process. It might be helpful to start by setting small, achievable goals that can give you a sense of progress and accomplishment. This could be anything from updating your resume to reaching out to friends or mentors who may be able to help you find job opportunities.

In terms of your relationship with your mom, it may be important to establish clear boundaries and communicate your feelings to her. Let her know how her words and actions are affecting you, and try to have an open and honest conversation about your emotions. If the situation becomes too difficult or toxic to handle on your own, consider seeking support from a therapist or counselor who can offer guidance and coping strategies.

Taking care of your overall well-being is crucial during this time. Remember to nourish your body with healthy food, even if it feels challenging. Engaging in activities that bring you joy and taking breaks from online series can also help prevent excessive escapism. Finding hobbies or joining social groups that align with your interests can provide a sense of purpose and community.

While online forums like this can provide support, it's important to remember that they are not a substitute for professional help. Consider reaching out to mental health resources in your country or seeking therapy services to explore your emotions and experiences more deeply. You deserve support and guidance during this difficult time. Stay strong and take things one step at a time."	2	0	0	0.0007637739181518555	forum with demographics

Losing a job can be incredibly disheartening, especially when it aligns with societal pressures and expectations. It sounds like you're struggling with self-esteem issues related to your appearance, which can further add to your difficulties with finding love and feeling accepted.

It's incredibly hurtful to be bullied or picked on by a loved one, particularly your own mother. These negative comments about your skin tone and appearance can deeply impact your mental well-being and self-image. Taking a break from social media can be a positive step in protecting yourself from additional negativity and comparison.

Using online series as a means of escape is understandable, as it allows you to momentarily distract yourself from the challenges you're facing. However, it's important to recognize that this might not be a sustainable or healthy coping mechanism in the long run. 

Since you reached out for help, I would encourage you to consider seeking support from mental health professionals. They can provide guidance in navigating these difficult emotions and help you develop coping strategies. Additionally, speaking to a counselor or therapist can give you a safe space to discuss your concerns and explore ways to overcome them.

Furthermore, consider seeking out support groups or online communities that are tailored to individuals who are going through similar challenges. Connecting with others who understand your experiences can be incredibly validating and helpful in your recovery journey.

Remember, recovery is a process and it takes time. Please don't hesitate to reach out for the support you need and deserve. You're not alone in this."	2	0	0	0.0008391141891479492	forum w/o demographics
"How does one cope with crisis after crisis?

I’m tired. So tired that I seem strangely calm. 

I hate my life. Because it’s nothing but pain and suffering. I’m an average person who has been tested way beyond my limits, with no reprieve, no breaks, no appreciation.

"How does one cope with crisis after crisis?

Dealing with one crisis after another can be incredibly draining, and it's understandable that you feel frustrated and unsupported. Remember, you don't have to face this alone, and reaching out for support is an important step in coping with these challenges.

Firstly, it's crucial to prioritize your own well-being. Taking care of yourself is not selfish, but rather necessary for your mental and emotional health. Identify activities or hobbies that bring you joy and make time for them, even if it's just a few minutes each day. Engaging in self-care activities can help to relieve stress and give you a sense of control over your own life.

Additionally, seeking out a support system can be incredibly helpful during difficult times. Consider reaching out to close friends or family members who can provide you with a listening ear or emotional support. If you feel comfortable, you might also want to explore seeking therapy or counseling. A professional can offer helpful strategies and tools for managing stress and coping with the challenges you're facing.

Remember, it's important to allow yourself to feel and acknowledge your emotions. It's natural to feel overwhelmed, but suppressing your feelings can be detrimental to your well-being. Find healthy outlets to express your emotions, such as journaling, art, or talking to someone you trust.

Lastly, it could be beneficial to consider setting boundaries with your family. Communicate your needs and limitations openly and assertively. Letting others know that you also require support and acknowledgment is essential. If necessary, seek out resources or organizations that provide assistance to individuals in similar caregiving roles.

You matter, and your feelings are valid. It may take time to find the right balance and coping mechanisms, but know that it's possible to navigate through crisis after crisis and find moments of calm and peace. Reach out for help, take care of yourself, and remember that you deserve support and understanding too."	2	0	0	0.000691533088684082	mental health forum

It sounds like you have been carrying a heavy burden and feeling overwhelmed by the constant crises in your life. It's completely understandable that you might feel exhausted and unappreciated.

Coping with crisis after crisis can be incredibly challenging, but there are strategies that may help you navigate through these difficult times. Firstly, it's important to prioritize self-care and make sure you're taking care of your own physical and emotional well-being. This could mean finding moments to rest, engaging in activities that bring you joy or relaxation, and seeking support from friends or trusted individuals.

Building a support network can also be helpful. Consider reaching out to friends, family, or even seeking support from a therapist or counselor who can provide you with a safe space to express your emotions and help you develop coping strategies.

It's important to remember that your feelings and needs matter too, even though it may feel like they are constantly overlooked. Finding ways to assert your boundaries and communicate your needs to others can be an important step in prioritizing your own well-being.

Finally, therapy or counseling can provide a valuable space to explore and process your emotions, gain perspective, and develop effective coping strategies. A mental health professional can assist you in developing a plan to manage the overwhelming challenges you're facing.

"Hi,  
I am new on Reddit (and to this sub). I am 26 (fast approaching 27) but hope that's not an issue. I liked the topics discussed in this sub and thought about sharing something I felt recently. 

So, I used to really like a girl in my college days. She liked me as well. But we both knew it'll never work because there were so many hurdles between us (I don't want to get into details, but coming from India for marriage caste, religion, etc. are very important stuff, especially for older people, and creates many problems - yeah it sucks!). Anyway, for this reason, we always kept a distance. We were good friends, she called me for everything, whatever help she ever needed I was the first person she ever called. Even when we were never in any kind of relationship, she'll still get jealous when I get too close to some other girls. But not in a weird possessive ay, but I'd say in a cute way. Anyway, college life ended just like that, we did keep in touch. Random messages & calls from time to time. After a few years, she got married (Arranged marriage, It's India!). She invited me to it. I got to talk to the groom and I liked him. I know it's a bit hard to get a grasp about someone with a few minutes of conversation but still, I felt they're a good match.   
After her marriage, our contact reduced so much. We rarely talked. But that was okay. I was over her and she wasn't on my mind all the time like she used to be and I moved on. But a few days ago, on their marriage anniversary, she posted her wedding pics and looking at that I felt all the feelings I had came back to me at once.  


I wonder how different my life would have been if we were of the same religion. (Please don't judge us here because it's really hard in some communities to marry someone of a different religion. It literally destroys families.)  


 I was wondering whether anyone here ever looked back in their life & felt something like this.  


Just sharing one of my favorite poems which kinda explains my feeling.

Your story about the girl from college is quite touching. It's tough when circumstances create barriers between two people who genuinely like each other. It sounds like you had a strong bond and even though things didn't work out, it's great that you were there for each other as friends.

The feelings resurfacing after seeing her wedding pictures must have been quite overwhelming. It's natural to wonder how things could have been different if certain factors weren't in the way. Sometimes life takes us on unexpected paths, and it's okay to reflect on those ""what ifs.""

Thank you for sharing that beautiful poem! It definitely captures the emotions you're feeling.

Welcome to Reddit and to this sub! Thank you for sharing your story with us. It sounds like you had a special connection with this girl during your college days, and it's understandable that seeing her wedding pictures brought back those feelings. It can be difficult to look back on our lives and wonder ""what if,"" especially when certain societal or cultural barriers prevented us from pursuing a relationship.

It's not uncommon to have moments of reflection and nostalgia, especially when we come across reminders of significant relationships from our past. It's natural to wonder how our lives might have been different under different circumstances. These feelings can bring up a mix of emotions, from sadness to curiosity.

If you're comfortable, you could try expressing these emotions through journaling or writing. This can be a healthy way to explore your feelings and gain some clarity. It may also be beneficial to reach out to a trusted friend or family member and talk about what you're experiencing. Sometimes, simply allowing ourselves to process our emotions with someone who cares can provide a sense of relief.

Remember, it's important to be kind and patient with yourself during these moments. It's okay to have conflicting emotions, and it's okay to have a bittersweet nostalgia for what could have been. If you find that these feelings persist or significantly impact your daily life, it could be helpful to reach out to a mental health professional who can provide guidance and support.

Lastly, thank you for sharing the poem. It beautifully captures the feeling of longing and reminiscence. If the arts resonate with you, you may find solace and an outlet for your emotions through poetry, music, or other artistic endeavors.

Take care, and remember that you are not alone in your experiences. We're here for you."	1	0	0	0.0006306767463684082	mental health forum

Thank you for sharing your experience and feelings with us. It sounds like you had a significant connection with this girl during your college days, and it's understandable that seeing her wedding photos brought back a wave of emotions. It's common to wonder ""what if"" and reflect on the past, especially when there were significant obstacles preventing the relationship from progressing. Remember, it's natural to feel a range of emotions and it's okay to take some time to process them. It may be helpful to explore these feelings further and examine what they mean to you. 

Reflecting on our past experiences can provide valuable insights about ourselves and our desires. However, it's important to find a balance between rumination and focusing on the present. It might be helpful to shift your focus towards your own personal growth, interests, and relationships. Exploring new hobbies, meeting new people, or seeking support from friends and family can be beneficial in moving forward.

If these feelings continue to be overwhelming or if you find it challenging to manage them on your own, it could be helpful to seek support from a mental health professional. They can provide you with a safe and non-judgmental space to explore your emotions and develop strategies to cope with them. Remember, it's always okay to ask for help when needed.

Thank you for sharing your story and feelings with us. It's completely normal to have these thoughts and reflections on past relationships and what could have been. It sounds like you had a deep connection with this girl during your college days, and it's understandable that seeing her wedding photos would trigger those old emotions.

Many people have experienced similar situations where circumstances prevented a relationship from progressing, and it can be challenging to let go of those ""what if"" thoughts. However, it's important to remember that life often takes unexpected turns and we have to make the best of the situations we find ourselves in.

While it may be difficult, try to focus on the present and the positive aspects of your life. Reflect on the growth and experiences you have gained since college, and the relationships you have built with others. It's natural to feel a range of emotions, especially when reminiscing about past connections, but try to channel those feelings into personal growth and finding happiness in the present.

If these feelings continue to bother you and impact your well-being, it may be helpful to seek support from a counselor or therapist. They can provide a safe and nonjudgmental space for you to process your emotions and work through any unresolved feelings. Remember, it's okay to seek assistance when needed.

I have crush on a girl in my class. I have heard many rumors about her having a crush on me. Even her friends tease her about it. But i dont think thats true because one time i saw her eyes tear up when she was getting teased. She is also a simple girl not too much hi fi and she also doesnt use insta.
  

  
I have even matched our horoscope and she has perfect compatibility for me. And i am sure shes not in a relationship right now.
  

  
PLS HELP ME AND KEEP IN MIND THAT MY BOARDS WILL BE CONDUCTED IN FEB AND I HAVE TO GET STRAIGHT A's.

TL;DR! :I AM A 15M KID WHO HAS A CRUSH ON A GIRL 15F , SHE MAY ALSO HAVE A CRUSH ON ME AND I WANT TO ASK HER OUT BUT MY INDIAN CULTURE DOES NOT ALLOW THIS."	"Hey everyone, need some advice here! I'm a 15-year-old Indian boy studying in 10th grade. I'm 6ft tall, fair, and pretty good at studies. My parents happen to be the director and principal of my school, so you can imagine the pressure! I'm a simple guy and don't even use Instagram.

Here's the thing - I have a huge crush on a girl in my class. I've heard some rumors going around that she might have a crush on me too. Even her friends tease her about it. However, there was this one time when I saw her getting teary-eyed from all the teasing. She's also a simple girl, not too much into the fancy stuff, and yep, she doesn't use Instagram either.

I've even checked our horoscopes, and it seems like we are perfectly compatible! Furthermore, I'm pretty sure she's not in a relationship right now.

I really need your help with this, guys! However, please keep in mind that in my Indian culture, asking someone out is not common. Oh, and on top of that, I'll have my board exams in February, so I need to focus and get straight A's. Any advice on how to navigate this situation would be greatly appreciated!

It's understandable that you're feeling confused and unsure about what to do in this situation. It's great that you're seeking help and support. While I can't provide a definitive solution, I can offer some thoughts and suggestions that may assist you.

Firstly, it's important to remember that cultural norms and expectations can differ, and it may be helpful to consider them while navigating such situations. With that said, open communication is often key when it comes to relationships.

If you feel comfortable doing so, you could try initiating a conversation with the girl and casually getting to know her better. This could be done in a group setting or during school activities where you both feel at ease. Building a connection and friendship can be a good starting point.

It's also important to manage your time and priorities effectively, considering your upcoming exams. Maintaining a balance between your studies and personal life is essential. Hence, it might be helpful to plan your time and set aside specific moments to relax and engage in activities that you enjoy.

Ultimately, it's essential to remember that decisions about relationships should be made with consent and mutual respect. Take your time, try to understand your own feelings, and respect her feelings as well.

If you feel overwhelmed or find it challenging to navigate these emotions, considering speaking with a trusted adult, counselor or mental health professional who can provide guidance and support. They can also help you explore ways to balance cultural norms with your personal desires.

Remember, you're not alone, and seeking support is a sign of strength. Wishing you the best of luck with both your studies and finding a resolution to your feelings!"	1	0	0	0.000635683536529541	mental health forum

TL;DR! :I AM A 15M KID WHO HAS A CRUSH ON A GIRL 15F , SHE MAY ALSO HAVE A CRUSH ON ME AND I WANT TO ASK HER OUT BUT MY INDIAN CULTURE DOES NOT ALLOW THIS."	"Dear Redditor,

Thank you for reaching out and sharing your feelings and concerns. It's clear that you have a crush on a girl in your class, and you've heard rumors that she might have feelings for you as well. It's important to remember that rumors and teasing are not always accurate reflections of someone's feelings.

Considering your cultural background, I understand that it may feel challenging to navigate relationships and express romantic interest. Indian culture often has its own norms and expectations when it comes to dating and relationships. It can be helpful to open up a conversation with your parents about your feelings and seek their guidance on how to handle this situation in a manner that respects your cultural values.

Yet, it's also essential to prioritize your mental well-being and balance it with your academic goals. With your boards approaching in February, it's crucial to focus on your studies and find a healthy balance between your personal life and academics.

Here are a few suggestions to consider:

1. Communication: Consider talking to the girl directly, honestly, and respectfully. Focus on building a friendship first and see how things develop over time.

2. Seek Support: If you feel comfortable, talk to someone you trust, such as a close friend, family member, or mentor, about your feelings. They may provide guidance and support as you navigate this situation.

3. Time Management: Create a study schedule that allows you to focus on your academic goals while also leaving time for personal activities and self-care. Prioritize and manage your time effectively to alleviate any stress that might come from juggling multiple responsibilities.

Remember, your mental health is significant, and it's essential to take care of yourself emotionally. If you find yourself struggling with your emotions or experiencing increased stress, consider reaching out to a mental health professional who can provide additional support and guidance.

Take care, and best of luck with your studies and your personal journey!

Sincerely,

It sounds like you're in a bit of a predicament with your crush. It can be tough when cultural expectations clash with your personal desires. While I can't provide specific advice without more information, I can offer some general suggestions that might help you navigate this situation.

1. Reflect on your feelings: It's important to understand your own emotions and motivations. Take some time to think about why you're interested in this girl and what you hope to achieve by asking her out. Understanding your own feelings can help guide your decision-making process.

2. Consider cultural expectations: Sometimes, cultural norms can put pressure on us to act in certain ways. It's important to weigh the potential consequences of going against these norms. Reflect on your own cultural values and how they align with your personal desires. Think about whether it's possible to find a balance between the two.

3. Communication is key: If you feel comfortable, it might be worth having an open and honest conversation with your parents about your feelings. Explain to them why it's important to you and listen to their perspective as well. Sometimes, through dialogue and understanding, you can find common ground.

4. Seek advice from a trusted adult: Talking to someone you trust, such as a mentor or family member who understands your cultural background, can provide guidance and support. They may have experienced similar situations or have insight into how to navigate cultural expectations while pursuing relationships.

5. Focus on your studies: It's great that you're dedicated to your academics and want to excel in your exams. Remember that your education is important, so be sure to prioritize your studies while also considering your personal life. Finding a balance between the two can help reduce stress and keep you on track for your goals.

Remember, every situation is unique, and it's essential to consider your individual circumstances before making any decisions. Take the time to reflect and seek support from those around you. Best of luck, and I hope everything works out for you!"	1	0	0	0.0006340146064758301	forum with demographics

"Hey there, it sounds like you're facing a common situation with having a crush on someone in your class. It's natural to feel excited and also a bit nervous about expressing your feelings.

However, it's important to remember that cultural norms and values can vary, and it's essential to respect and follow the guidelines set by your family and community. Indian culture often emphasizes education and focuses on academic success, as you mentioned your upcoming exams.

Considering this, it might be helpful to prioritize your studies and focus on your upcoming board exams. Try to devote your time and energy to achieving your academic goals.

If you're still interested in pursuing a friendship with the girl you have a crush on, you can start by building a friendship based on shared interests and common activities. This can help you get to know her better while still respecting cultural boundaries.

Remember, communication and mutual understanding are key in any relationship, so it's crucial to have an open and honest conversation with your parents about your feelings as well. They may be able to provide guidance and support while considering both cultural expectations and your emotional well-being.

"Hey Reddit,

I'm (28F) an American living in Europe I won't say where for anonymity. I met my husband (30M) during the pandemic and when restrictions were lifted I made the journey to meet him. We were smitten, and I moved over and we now have a child. My mother (55F) tries to come over several times a year to come see me and our little one. She usually stays about a Month. Which is great when it comes to quality time with her grandchild, but our relationship is quite tumultuous.

I grew up in a very authoritarian single parent household. My mother is misogynistic, has never been financially stable, and doesn't align in the same political opinions of either of her children. Growing up she forced us to go to a very toxic ""Church"" who labeled me a ""Bad seed"". She even at one point threatened to kick me out over not wanting to attend once I turned 18. I could go on and on about that Church, but that's another story. She was also very harsh with her punishments. Including taking our doors for several months when I was a teen, my door knob so I wouldn't lock my doors, and grounded me from going outside or seeing my friends besides at school for 6 months. She is very impulsive as well, often changed jobs, would constantly have us move houses or go back to live with our grandparents. Which honestly was our saving grace for alot of my childhood. And she is a very argumentative and basically always wants to talk about conservative politics even knowing I've asked her to try not to bring up these topics as it is harming our relationship. She is a very loving mother and I know she does love and wants the best for me. I'm also aware I need therapy.

The problem I'm having is she told me recently she was going to work on her career (which I will also not divulge) towards moving here for work. She wants to live closer and maybe even eventually live with us. Our relationship is very complicated, but I love her and want her to be happy. I just would rather have our relationship still be at a distance. I know I can't control her actions, but how do I tell her I'd rather her not try to come and live with my family. My husband would also not like this. 

So Reddit what do you think? 

TD;LR: My mother told me of her 5 year plan to come live near me. We have a very complicated relationship where I would rather us stay at a distance. How do I tell her gently?"	"Hey Reddit friends! 🌟 Need some advice here. So I (28F) moved to Europe and met my amazing husband (30M) during the pandemic. We now have a little bundle of joy! 🥰 My mom (55F) visits us quite often, which is awesome for grandchild bonding time, but our relationship is pretty complicated. She's had some authoritarian tendencies, and we have different views on a lot of things. We've had our fair share of clashes, but she's still my mom, and I love her. 

Here's the thing: she recently mentioned her 5-year plan to move closer to us and possibly live with us. While I want her to be happy, I feel it would be better if we keep our distance. My husband feels the same way too. How do I gently communicate this to her without hurting her feelings? Any advice is greatly appreciated!

It sounds like you're facing a complex situation with your mother and wanting to navigate it in a gentle way. First of all, it's great that you recognize the need for therapy, as it can provide you with valuable guidance and support in dealing with these emotional challenges.

When it comes to discussing your mother's plan with her, it's important to approach the conversation with empathy and honesty. Start by expressing your love for her and your appreciation for her desire to be closer to you and your family. Then, gently explain that due to the complicated nature of your relationship and the dynamics that currently exist, you believe it would be best for you to maintain some distance.

It might be helpful to emphasize that this decision is not a reflection of your love for her, but rather a consideration of what you believe would promote the healthiest and most positive dynamic between you all. Perhaps mentioning the importance of maintaining healthy boundaries within families could also be helpful.

Remember, open communication is crucial, so encourage her to share her thoughts and feelings as well. The goal here is to foster understanding and find a compromise that respects everyone's needs and desires.

Lastly, remember to involve your husband in the conversation. Share your feelings with him and listen to his thoughts and concerns. It's important to approach this as a team and find a resolution that both of you feel comfortable with.

Hopefully, these suggestions can help you navigate this sensitive situation. Keep in mind that seeking guidance from a therapist or counselor will provide you with even more valuable insights tailored to your specific circumstances. Take care!"	1	0	0	0.0006615519523620605	mental health forum

It sounds like you have been through a lot in your relationship with your mother, and it's understandable that you feel conflicted about her potential plans to move closer to you and your family. It takes strength and courage to acknowledge that you may need therapy to navigate these complex emotions and relationships.

When it comes to communicating your feelings to your mother, it can often be helpful to approach the conversation with empathy and honesty. Start by acknowledging her love and good intentions, as you have already done here. Then, express your own needs and boundaries clearly and respectfully. You can let her know that while you appreciate her desire to be closer, you feel more comfortable maintaining some distance in your relationship. Emphasize that this is not a reflection of your love for her, but rather a decision based on what you believe is best for your family dynamics.

Consider discussing this topic with your husband beforehand so that you can have a unified stance and provide each other support during the conversation. Ultimately, it's important to remember that you cannot control her actions, but you can express your needs and boundaries honestly and respectfully.

Take care and consider seeking therapy to further explore and navigate the complexities of your relationship with your mother.

It sounds like you're facing a challenging situation with your mother and you're looking for guidance on how to convey your feelings to her. First of all, it's great that you recognize the need for therapy, as it can provide valuable support in navigating complicated relationships.

When it comes to discussing this with your mother, it's important to approach the conversation with empathy and honesty. Consider having an open and calm discussion with her, expressing your thoughts and concerns in a respectful manner. You might want to emphasize that you value her as a mother and appreciate her love, but also acknowledge the challenges that you've faced together due to your differing beliefs and the volatile nature of your relationship.

Let her know that you and your husband have established a life and routine that work for your family, and that introducing additional dynamics such as living together might disrupt that balance. Communicate the importance of maintaining a certain distance, while still assuring her that you care about her happiness. You can explain that this distance doesn't reflect on your love for her, but instead is a way to preserve the stability you've created for your child and yourselves.

It's crucial to set boundaries in a kind and firm manner. Let her know what you're comfortable with and what your family's needs are, so that she understands your perspective. By being clear and transparent, you give her the opportunity to respect your wishes and make choices accordingly.

Remember, these conversations can be difficult and emotions may arise. Make sure to maintain open lines of communication and be willing to listen to her thoughts and feelings as well. This process may take time, but having an honest and respectful dialogue can contribute to a healthier and more sustainable relationship.

Take care, and I wish you the best of luck in navigating this sensitive situation."	1	0	0	0.0006399750709533691	forum with demographics

First of all, it's great that you reached out for support. Dealing with complicated family dynamics can be really tough, and it's important to prioritize your own well-being. 

Based on what you've shared, it seems like you're aware of the need for therapy, which is a positive step towards healing and finding a resolution. Therapy can provide you with tools and coping mechanisms to navigate challenging relationships, set boundaries, and express your needs effectively. It might be helpful to find a therapist who specializes in family dynamics or trauma to help you work through your past experiences and current struggles.

When it comes to addressing the issue with your mother, it's crucial to approach the conversation with kindness and empathy while still maintaining firm boundaries. You could start by having an open and honest conversation with her about your feelings and concerns. It might be helpful to express how much you value the grandchild-grandparent relationship and the special bond they share, but explain that for the sake of your own mental health and the harmony of your current family, you would prefer to maintain a certain distance.

It's essential to communicate your boundaries clearly and kindly, while recognizing her feelings and desires as well. Let her know that you love her and want her to be happy, but living together may not be the best option for you and your husband at this time. By emphasizing that it's about what's best for everyone involved, rather than solely rejecting her, it may help soften the blow.

Remember, you can't control your mother's actions or reactions, but you can control how you respond and set your own limits. Trust yourself and prioritize your emotional well-being throughout this process.

Take care and reach out if you need further support."	1	0	0	0.0006761550903320312	forum w/o demographics
"A few weeks ago, I (28M) found out that I have an older half sister (35F) through 23andMe. Let's call her Emily. We share the same father. She reached out to me and I've gotten to know Emily a bit.

Emily seems like a lovely person and I feel blessed to have discovered that I now have an older sister. She's married and has two young kids. I haven't met her husband or her kids yet, though she wants to introduce me to them soon.

Through talking with Emily, I've since learned that my father had a one night stand back when he was a grad student in university, and that her bio-mom later put her up for adoption. My father does not know that Emily exists. Emily seems to have had a happy life and grew up on the other side of the country. While I grew up in California, she grew up on the East Coast. I now live in the East Coast and I've even met Emily in person for coffee once and we share many of the same physical features (same eyes, same nose, tall height, etc.).

Anyway, here's why I'm on Reddit and asking for help. Emily wants to get to know the rest of the family and meet them. As far as I know, I'm the only one in my immediate family who used 23andMe, and Emily hasn't met anyone from my family yet. I've told Emily a bit about my father (61M) and sister (25F) but haven't really mentioned much. Emily wants to meet our father and sister. 

I haven't told my family about Emily yet. The truth is, my father was extremely abusive growing up and I'm basically in limited contact with him with the occasional text every few months. I haven't seen him in years. I talk to my mother on the phone occasionally. 

How do I proceed from here? How do I go about explaining to the rest of my family the existence of my older half-sister? I feel like doing so would cause a huge rift between my parents. I'm not sure how my other relatives would even react to this. And, while I'm 100% Asian-American, Emily is half-Asian and half-white and super white-passing. I'm not sure how my parents and other family members would react to this. Several of them are pretty racist.

I'm not sure how Emily will react to meeting my father. My father was abusive and is toxic and sexist. I feel like she'll be disappointed when meeting him. She's told me that she's always wanted to know a bit about her father and get to know her Asian side of herself. 

I've thought about maybe telling my sister first and asking her what she thinks and going from there, and starting with introducing my sister to Emily first.

Any advice on how I should proceed from here? How do I bring this up to my family? How do I introduce them?

TL;DR: I discovered I have an older half-sister. We share the same father. She wants to meet the rest of the family. Neither knows the other exists.

Recently discovered I have an older half-sister, Emily, through 23andMe. She's an amazing person and I feel lucky to have found her. The thing is, I haven't told my family about her yet.

I'm worried about how to bring this up to my family and what their reaction will be, especially since some of them have racist views. Emily wants to meet them and I'm unsure how to handle it.

"I'm sorry to hear about the difficult situation you're facing, but I understand your desire to navigate this situation in a thoughtful and considerate way. It's great that you have gotten to know Emily and have found a connection with her. 

Given the complex dynamics within your family and your concerns about their reactions, it might be helpful to approach this situation step by step. You mentioned considering talking to your sister about Emily first, and that could be a good starting point. Sharing the news with someone you trust within your family can provide support and help you gauge their reaction. Your sister might have valuable insights and perspectives that could guide your decisions moving forward.

When discussing this with your sister, it's important to provide context about your abusive upbringing and your limited contact with your father. Help her understand the reasons behind your concerns and the potential impact this meeting could have on her and Emily. Keep in mind that your sister may have her own emotional response to this news, so it's crucial to create a safe space for open communication.

As for introducing Emily to your family, it might be helpful to set clear boundaries and expectations beforehand. Communicate your concerns about your father's past behavior, and make it clear that you prioritize Emily's emotional well-being and want to ensure a safe environment for her. This may involve setting ground rules for interactions or even discussing the possibility of meeting in a neutral location or with a support system in place.

Regarding your family's potential reaction to Emily's racial background, it's unfortunate that some members may have racist views. It's important to approach this issue with empathy and address it when necessary. It might be helpful to have open conversations with Emily about your family's potential biases, so she is aware and can make informed decisions about her involvement.

In navigating this situation, it could also be beneficial to seek support from a therapist or counselor who can provide guidance and help you process your emotions. Having a professional to turn to can offer an outside perspective and help you navigate the challenges that may arise.

Remember to prioritize your well-being and emotional health throughout this process. It's commendable that you are considering and taking into account the potential impact on others while also navigating your own emotions. Take things at a pace you're comfortable with, and don't hesitate to reach out for support when needed."	2	0	2	0.000670313835144043	mental health forum

"I can understand that this situation is causing you a lot of anxiety and uncertainty. It's important to approach this delicate matter with care to ensure the well-being of everyone involved. Here are some suggestions on how you could proceed:

1. Reflect on your own feelings: Take some time to understand your own emotions and thoughts about this situation. Consider how meeting your half-sister might affect you, and how you can manage any potential challenges that may arise.

2. Communicate with Emily: Have an open and honest conversation with Emily about your concerns regarding your father. Share your experiences and make her aware of the difficult relationship you had with him. It's crucial that she knows what to expect beforehand, so she can make an informed decision about meeting him.

3. Speak to your sister: As you mentioned, discussing this matter with your sister could be a good starting point. Share your discovery with her and discuss how you can handle this information together. Her support may be invaluable as you navigate the complexities of introducing Emily to your family.

4. Create a support plan: It's essential to have a support system in place. If possible, identify individuals within your extended family who are more open-minded and accepting. Speaking to them beforehand might provide insight into how others might react or if there are any unexpected concerns to address.

5. Choose the right time and place for introductions: When you feel ready, plan a meeting with your sister and Emily, choosing a safe and comfortable environment. This will allow them to form a connection before introducing your father, if deemed appropriate. If there is a chance that your father will negatively impact Emily's experience or well-being, it might be better to hold off on introducing them.

6. Seek professional guidance: If the situation feels overwhelming or you're unsure of how to proceed, consider seeking counseling or therapy. A mental health professional can provide support, help you navigate family dynamics, and guide you in making informed decisions.

Remember, you have every right to prioritize your well-being and establish boundaries if necessary. Ultimately, the decision to bring Emily into your family dynamic rests with you, and it's important to consider what is best for everyone involved."	1	0	0	0.0006722211837768555	forum with demographics

It's great to hear that you've connected with your half-sister and that you find her to be a lovely person. Discovering new family members can be both exciting and challenging. It's understandable that you have concerns about introducing her to the rest of your family, considering the history of abuse and some potential racist attitudes.

It might be helpful to establish clear limits on his involvement in your life and potentially in your half-sister's life as well. Remember, your responsibility lies primarily with ensuring your own well-being and the well-being of those you care about.

Ultimately, introducing your half-sister to your family members should be done at a pace that feels comfortable for you. It's important to prioritize open communication, honesty, and mutual respect.

"Hi people, 

I am from India, my sister and brother-in-law shifted to England last year in July. Brother-in-Law has a history of physical abusing my sister in India.

Can someone complain to the corporate on my behalf? My idea is that whoever makes the call will disguise as some Women Help NGO. "	"Hey everyone,

I'm reaching out for some help regarding a situation my sister is going through. About a year ago, she and her husband moved to England from India, but unfortunately, he has a history of physically abusing her. Recently, he started causing trouble again, this time mentally and financially, and my sister decided to report it to the police. They registered it as a non-crime domestic abuse incident back in April.

My family and I are really worried about her and want her to come back to India. However, she's hesitant because of her 18-month-old nephew. We are aware that this toxic relationship will only get worse and that my sister will be the one to suffer for speaking up.

I had an idea to report the police incident to the corporate office where my brother-in-law works, but unfortunately, the HR informed me that even if I make an anonymous call, they would have to reveal to him that an investigation is taking place, thus making things even more difficult for my sister. He would immediately suspect that someone from our family made the call.

I was wondering if anyone could help me by making the complaint to his corporate office on my behalf. My plan is for the person making the call to pretend to be a Women Help NGO. Any assistance or advice would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you all in advance."	1	2	0	0.002612769603729248	social media

I'm really sorry to hear about the difficult situation your sister is facing. It can be incredibly challenging dealing with a toxic and abusive relationship. It's admirable that you and your family are concerned for your sister's well-being and trying to find a way to help her.

Reporting the incident to your brother-in-law's workplace is definitely a valid option to consider. However, it seems like making an anonymous call may not be the best approach in this situation, as the HR has informed you that they would have to reveal the investigation to your brother-in-law. This could potentially put your sister at risk, as he may suspect that it was someone from her family who made the call.

I understand your desire to protect your sister by having someone else complain on your behalf. While it's a thoughtful suggestion, it's important to remember that organizations like women's help NGOs typically work with survivors directly to ensure their safety and confidentiality. It may be more effective for your sister to reach out to them herself if she feels comfortable doing so.

In the meantime, it might be helpful for your sister to seek professional support, such as counseling, to cope with the emotional and mental toll of the abusive relationship. Encourage her to explore local resources available in England that specialize in domestic abuse. They can provide valuable guidance on how to navigate the situation and offer options specific to her circumstances.

Additionally, it's important for your sister to develop a safety plan in case the situation escalates. This could include having a secret code word or phrase with a trusted friend or family member, making sure she has access to important documents and emergency numbers, and identifying safe spaces where she can go if needed.

Remember, supporting your sister is crucial, but ultimately, it will be her own decision to leave the relationship. Let her know that you and your family are there for her without judgment and that you're ready to help whenever she's ready to take that step.

Take care."	2	0	0	0.0014005303382873535	mental health forum

I'm really sorry to hear about the difficult situation your sister is facing. It's understandable that you and your family are concerned for her well-being. I am unable to make the call on your behalf, but I can provide some guidance on possible steps you can take.

Firstly, I encourage you to support your sister in any way you can and continue to provide her with emotional support. She may greatly benefit from having a strong support system during this challenging time.

In terms of reporting the incident to your brother-in-law's workplace, it's important to recognize that making an anonymous call may not be as effective as it seems. If your sister's safety is a major concern, it may be more helpful to explore other options. It could be worthwhile to encourage her to seek legal advice or consult with local domestic violence helplines or organizations in England. They may provide valuable guidance and support tailored to her specific situation.

Additionally, it's crucial for your sister to have a safety plan in place. This might involve ensuring she has a safe place to go in case of an emergency or documenting instances of abuse. Encourage her to keep important documents and identification in a safe location, and to share her situation with a trusted friend or neighbor who can offer assistance if needed.

Ultimately, the decision for your sister to come back to India or to stay in England is hers to make, and it's important to respect her autonomy in this process. However, letting her know that you and your family are there to support her emotionally and provide any assistance she may need can make a significant difference.

I hope this information is helpful, but please remember that I am unable to provide direct therapeutic services. If you or your sister find yourself in immediate danger, please reach out to emergency services in your area."	2	0	0	0.0007379651069641113	clinician

Encourage her to reach out to local authorities or seek professional help if she feels comfortable doing so. It could be helpful for her to gather evidence of the abuse, such as photographs, videos, or statements from witnesses, to present a stronger case if she decides to take legal action in the future.

Finally, it's crucial to remind your sister that she is not alone in this. Support from loved ones like yourself, along with professional help, can make a significant difference. Encourage her to consider therapy or counseling to help her cope with the emotional toll this toxic relationship has taken on her.

Please take care, and I hope things improve for your sister soon."	2	0	0	0.0009605288505554199	forum with demographics
"Hi people, 

I am from India, my sister and brother-in-law shifted to England last year in July. Brother-in-Law has a history of physical abusing my sister in India. This year too he again started troubling my sister (controlling mentally & financially), my sister called the police, and they registered it as a non-crime domestic abuse incident. This was back in April. 

Me and my parents want my sister to come back to India, but my sister decided to stay back. Mainly because of my 18 months old nephew. She is in a toxic relation; we know the guy is going to relapse and take it out on my sister for complaining to the police.

I had this idea of reporting the police incident to the corporate where my brother-in-law works. But the HR told me that even if I make the call anonymously, they will have to reveal to the guy why an investigation is taking place (keeping my identity anonymous). It will just cause more trouble for my sister, since he will immediately imply that someone from the girl's family made the call. 

Can someone complain to the corporate on my behalf? My idea is that whoever makes the call will disguise as some Women Help NGO. "	"Hi there, 

I understand that you're in a difficult and concerning situation with your sister and brother-in-law. It's understandable that you want to help and protect your sister and your 18 months old nephew from the ongoing abuse.

While I can't personally assist with making the call to your brother-in-law's workplace on your behalf, I can offer some suggestions on how you may navigate this situation:

1. Seek support from local resources: Reach out to local Women Help NGOs or organizations that specialize in domestic abuse. They may be able to provide advice, guidance, and potential assistance in reporting the abuse to your brother-in-law's workplace.

2. Encourage your sister to seek professional help: It could be helpful for your sister to speak with a therapist, counselor, or even a support group. They can provide her with coping mechanisms, emotional support, and guidance to make the best decisions for herself and her son.

3. Communicate your concerns: Maintain an open and honest line of communication with your sister. Express your concerns and worries about the potential relapse of your brother-in-law's abusive behavior. Encourage her to prioritize her safety and well-being.

4. Gather evidence: If possible, gather any evidence of the abuse that has occurred in the past. This evidence might be useful in reporting the abuse or seeking legal actions in the future.

Remember, every situation is unique, and seeking professional advice can help guide you and your family through this challenging time. It's important to prioritize the safety and well-being of your sister and her child."	1	0	0	0.001208961009979248	forum w/o demographics
"so i had recently told my parents about the fact that i drink socially. my mom was not okay with it and she kept overthinking over it for months. i came back to home from college and my mom was constantly talking about drinking drinking and drinking calling me a drunkard and what not, inspite of it being pretty much controlled and moderated on my end.

my dad was initially okay with this but mom kept provoking him to DO SOMETHING about it. then my dad’s ego triggered and he’s a narcissist and he asked me to cancel my flight tickets back to college or he will break my mac. i canceled the tickets but asked my bf for some money and booked fresh ones for today. dad asked me to show the bank details for who paid and i cant show because they are also not okay with me having a boyfriend. so i kept begging them to just leave it and let me go. if he got to know about the bf he would abuse him or beat him up like he did to my last bf. i was scared. i just wanted to take my flight for today and leave. he threatened to break my phone so i ran from home. he locked my mac in an almirah. he tracked me down hunted me and brought me back home, again asking for bank details. i didn’t share. i booked cab so that i can leave for airport. after the cab came, he threatened me that if i sit in the cab, he will do something reallly realllyy bad. i begged him. he pulled me. and threw my luggage outside the cab. brought me back home. told me i will never go back to college. i cried and begged to let me catch my flight. he told my how i was sooo wrong to have the audacity to book the flight and an uber all whilst he was against it. i said i am sorry to cater to his narcissistic ego. i cried to just let me go. he said ill stay, show him the bank details tomorrow and then leave after 10 days. i didn’t want to show the bank details. i asked him to pls understand, it’s private. he said what private? wtf are u hiding from me? he slapped me. i went to my room started crying. he locked my laptop and phone in an almirah and locked me in another room. i kept crying then my aunt knocked. i told her everything about why i cant show the bank details etc. she said she will try convincing them. she went and talked to them and told them that she thinks whatever is in the statements is fine. she asked them to trust her and let me go. they said fine- they will not check my statements and i can only go after 10 days. then i didn’t go for my flight and stayed against my will. today they stealthily took my passbook and they have gone to the bank to get the statement’s printed . once they get to know about my bf they are going to do the same thing to him, abuse him on call, they will also abuse me and enforce a break up and they will threaten him that if he keeps any contact with me, they will screw him and his family over. and they are also not booking my flight tickets for after 10 days as of now, saying they will see. i don’t want to stay here. i want to run away to college. my dad is a narcissist and mom has some other issues in which she gets sadistic pleasure everytime i am hurting because she thinks i am learning a lesson for drinking. i dont know what to do. should i file a complaint? but i am not financially independent yet. should i call women’s rights (i am based in india btw). or should i just live with it?"	"Hey everyone, I'm facing a really difficult situation at home and I could really use some advice. I recently shared with my parents that I drink socially, and my mom has been overly obsessed about it ever since. It's frustrating because I have it under control and moderate my drinking responsibly.

Unfortunately, my dad's ego got triggered, and he's acting out because of my mom's constant provoking. He even threatened to break my MacBook if I didn't cancel my flight back to college. I managed to book new tickets, but now he wants to know who paid for them, and I can't show him because they're also not okay with me having a boyfriend.

I'm scared because if he finds out about my boyfriend, he'll do something terrible to him like he did with my last partner. I just want to leave and catch my flight, but my dad won't let me, and I don't want to show him my bank details. He's become physically aggressive, and it's really frightening.

I tried talking to my aunt, and she said she'll try to help, but my parents are insistent on knowing everything. They now went to the bank to get my statements printed, and if they find out about my boyfriend, they'll do the same thing to him and threaten his family.

I feel trapped and don't know what to do. Should I file a complaint? I'm not financially independent yet, so that complicates things. Should I contact women's rights organizations? I'm based in India, by the way. Or should I just try to endure this situation?

Any advice or support would be greatly appreciated. Thank you so much. #HelpNeeded #FamilyIssues"	1	2	0	0.006753087043762207	social media

"I'm so sorry to hear about the difficult situation you're going through with your parents. It sounds like their reaction to your drinking and having a boyfriend has been extreme and unhealthy. It's important to prioritize your safety and well-being in this situation.

Firstly, it's essential to have a support system during challenging times. Reach out to friends, other family members, or a trusted adult who can help you through this. You don't have to face this alone.

Considering your concerns about physical abuse and the control your parents are exerting, it may be worth exploring options to protect yourself. Contacting a local women's rights organization in India can provide you with guidance and support specific to your situation. They can provide you with information about your legal rights and options available to you. They may also be able to offer resources for financial assistance or shelter if needed.

In addition, it may be helpful to seek guidance from a mental health professional who can provide you with coping strategies and support during this challenging time. They can help you develop a safety plan and provide you with the necessary tools to navigate this difficult situation.

Remember, your well-being is crucial, and you deserve to feel safe and respected. Take care of yourself and reach out to the appropriate resources for assistance. You deserve support and understanding."	2	0	0	0.0009923577308654785	mental health forum

"I'm really sorry to hear about the difficult situation you are facing at home. It sounds like you are dealing with a lot of emotional abuse and control from your parents, and it's understandable that you feel scared and trapped.

First and foremost, your safety and well-being should be a priority. If you feel that you are in immediate danger or at risk of harm, contacting the authorities for assistance may be necessary. In India, you can reach out to the National Commission for Women or local helpline numbers for guidance and support.

It's important to remember that you are not alone. Connecting with someone who can provide emotional support, such as a trusted friend, counselor, or helpline, can be really helpful during this difficult time. They can offer you guidance and help you explore your options.

Considering your financial dependency, it might be helpful to create a safety plan. This plan can include identifying resources in your community, such as shelters or organizations that support survivors of abuse, as well as exploring potential avenues for financial independence or support.

As you navigate your situation, please remember to prioritize your mental and emotional well-being. Seeking professional help from a therapist who specializes in abusive relationships can provide you with the necessary guidance and support to heal and make the best decisions for yourself.

My parents' marriage has been tough, and it's reached a breaking point. 😢 My dad has been super paranoid and jealous of my mom for the past 16 years, even though she's the one bringing home the bacon 🍞, and he barely works. But yesterday, things got way out of hand... 🚫

While mom was working at the nail salon, my dad accused her of cheating and claimed that the salon was closed. 🤦‍♂️ Mom, being the awesome lady she is, called her coworkers and showed video footage to prove her innocence. But he refused to even look or listen. 😡

Last night was a nightmare. Dad terrorized my mom and gave us an ultimatum to move out by Sunday, even though it's mom who paid for the house. 😭

In this situation, it might be important for you to prioritize your safety and well-being. One option is to contact local authorities or a helpline specifically for cases of domestic violence or abuse. They can provide guidance on how to proceed and can assist you with finding resources and support.

Gathering evidence is crucial if you decide to take legal action or involve authorities. It's a good idea to document incidents, conversations, or any abusive behavior. This could include taking pictures, recording conversations (if legal in your area), or saving any threatening messages he might send. Such evidence can be beneficial if you need to file for a restraining order or document a pattern of abuse.

You can also reach out to local support organizations focused on domestic violence or mental health. They may be able to provide you and your mom with valuable resources, counseling services, or legal advice specific to your area.

Remember, you don't have to go through this alone. Reach out to friends or other trusted individuals who can provide emotional support during this difficult time. Please prioritize your own safety and don't hesitate to seek professional help."	2	0	0	0.0011423826217651367	mental health forum

Yesterday was the last straw when my mom was working at the nail salon and my dad accused my mom of cheating, saying that “the nail salon closed a long time ago”. To which my mom called her coworkers and showed camera footages for proof, but he refused to look or listen. Last night, he terrorized my mom and gave us until Sunday to move out of the house that my mom paid for. What could I do in this situation? Who can I report this to and what evidences would I need?

"A little context my father has been abusing me and my mother for years now. My mother at the front of verbal and physical violence, and me at the front of verbal violence.

So what...can I do currently? What steps should I take to ensure that me and my mother remains safe and could have a bright future?

In terms of the language barrier and difficulty making friends in Korea, it can be challenging to adapt to a new environment, especially when you feel more comfortable in a different language.

I'm not even confident enough to drive by myself, I'm full of self-doubt and the past 2 years I just experienced such self loathing thoughts,I'm an introvert, was a really shy kid,and I hate this about my personality, I've always wished I was different, was an extrovert but the last 2 years,these thoughts were so amplified,it made me really dislike myself and dislike so many parts of my personality-I'm a people pleaser and feel like such a pushover,all I could think over the last 2 years was,wow I'm such a loser,doormat,not confident enough to drive,and I don't even have a career or am smart enough to find a job,still living at home,plus I'm fat and ugly-
yes on top of all this,I grew up fat,I managed to lose some weight over the last 1.5 years,but I've always been insecure because of this as well and heard things like you'd look nicer if you lost weight or you'll find a guy if you lost weight as a teenager and at 18 a guy even told me you'd look better if you lost weight-really made me believe I wasn't good enough and made me all the more closed of to guys and dating in the past 4 years.
Also,because of my awkward,quiet nature,I was unable to form a proper concerte friendship in college,despite being in college for 5 years. Isn't that so abnormal? A young person who has no proper friend from college? 
This made me dislike myself a lot more last year and really made me feel like had I been not me,had I been a non-awkward extrovert I wouldn't have this problem. 
I'm finally starting to realize just how much in shambles my mental health has been for the past,especially 4 years,and I hate it. Feels like I lost a part of my life,and as a result of which I ignored my dating life and even college social life for the past few years.
I just want to ask,is this normal? To be closed off socially due to shit,shit mental health.
Am I a loser because I haven't kissed anyone at this age where even 17 year olds are having sex? Also,I'm not one to hookup,or have casual sex,I'd prefer a genuine relationship,iam already self conscious and really awkward, is this another factor that is going to make things harder for me,dating wise?
Am I a complete weirdo or outcast because of this or am I doomed to be alone because of this?
Also,since I've just realized these things,as of now my priority is to just work on getting my career sorted, and to better my mental health and make a few new friends,join the gym and focus on my physical health as well-I don't want to prioritize dating as of now after the realization of how trash my mental health was.
Is that the right thing to do? 
Idk why,I feel like if I de-prioritize dating any further, I'll just die alone with no sexual experience, and will just become a weird outcast and people my age will eventually settle down,be married,etc. and will be heavily judged for being xyz age and not having had a  proper relationship or experience with physical intimacy. 
Can anyone relate/understand?
I feel like I cannot share any of this with my closest friends because they won't really understand, and I don't want to share something and have my feelings be dismissed or invalidated.

Also,if you managed to read everything, thank you so much!"	"Hey there, 

I'm really sorry to hear that you've been feeling this way. It sounds like you've been carrying a heavy burden with your mental health for a while now, and it's completely understandable that it has affected your confidence and self-perception. Many people struggle with similar feelings of self-doubt and low self-esteem, so you are not alone in this.

It's important to remember that everyone's journey is unique, and there is no set timeline for relationships or experiences. You are not a loser or a weirdo because you haven't had certain experiences at a particular age. Many individuals prioritize different aspects of their lives at different times, and it's okay to focus on your career and personal growth right now. Taking care of your mental health should always be a priority, and I'm glad to hear that you recognize its importance.

Regarding your concerns about dating, it's important to be true to yourself. It's completely okay to prefer genuine relationships rather than casual encounters. Being self-conscious and awkward doesn't make you any less deserving of love and companionship. It may take time to find someone who appreciates you for who you are, but it's worth waiting for the right person who values you as a whole.

Deprioritizing dating for now to focus on yourself and your mental health is a wise decision. Taking steps to improve your career, physical health, and social life can all contribute positively to your overall well-being. Making new friends, joining the gym, and investing time in activities that bring you joy can help build confidence and may lead to meaningful connections and friendships.

Lastly, I understand that it can be challenging to share such personal feelings with friends, especially if you worry they won't understand or could dismiss your emotions. Is there anyone else in your life, such as a trusted family member or a counselor, whom you could talk to? Sometimes, seeking professional help and guidance can provide valuable support and help you navigate these emotions.

Remember, you are not alone in your struggles, and it's important to be kind to yourself during this journey. You deserve happiness and fulfillment, and it's never too late to create the life you desire. Take things one step at a time, focus on self-improvement, and seek support when needed. You're on the right track, and I believe in your ability to overcome these challenges."	2	0	0	0.0007923245429992676	mental health forum

It's important to remember that everyone's journey is unique, and there is no ""normal"" or ""abnormal"" when it comes to social interactions or dating.

Your priority to focus on your career and mental health is a commendable decision. Taking the time to prioritize self-improvement and overall well-being can be very beneficial in the long run. It's essential to prioritize your own needs and goals before worrying about external expectations or societal pressures.

Feeling self-conscious or awkward in social situations is something that many people experience, but it's important to remember that these feelings don't define you as a person. Building genuine friendships takes time and effort, and it's okay if you haven't formed a concrete friendship in college. Remember that meaningful relationships can happen at any age and in various contexts.

It's completely okay to prefer genuine relationships over casual encounters, and it's important to honor your own boundaries and preferences. There is no right or wrong way to approach dating, and it's all about finding what feels comfortable and right for you.

If you're feeling like you can't share your feelings with your closest friends, it might be helpful to consider seeking support from a mental health professional. They can provide a safe space for you to explore your thoughts and feelings without judgment and can offer guidance and support in navigating these challenges.

Remember that your feelings and experiences are valid, and you deserve to be heard and supported. You are not alone, and there are resources available to help you on your path to improved mental health and overall well-being."	2	0	0	0.0006417632102966309	clinician

Many people go through periods where they question their life, relationships, and self-worth. It's important to remember that everyone's journey is unique, and there is no ""normal"" timeline for experiences like relationships and intimacy. It's okay to take your time and prioritize your mental health and personal growth.

It's great that you've recognized the importance of focusing on your career and mental well-being right now. Building a strong foundation of self-care and self-love can improve your overall happiness and confidence, which in turn can positively impact your relationships in the future. Joining a gym and taking care of your physical health can be a great way to boost your self-esteem and meet new people as well.

Remember, being an introvert or having shy tendencies doesn't make you any less valuable or worthy of love and connection. It's important to embrace and accept yourself for who you are, rather than wishing to be someone else. Celebrate your unique qualities and strengths.

If you're finding it difficult to form deep friendships or connections, you may consider seeking out support from a therapist or counselor. They can provide guidance and help you work through any underlying issues that may be contributing to your feelings of self-doubt and social isolation.

Lastly, please remember that your worth is not determined by your relationship status or sexual experience. It's essential to prioritize your own well-being and happiness rather than fearing societal judgments. Focus on becoming the best version of yourself and trust that the right opportunities for love and connection will come when the time is right.

If you need a safe space to talk and share your thoughts and feelings without fear of dismissal or invalidation, consider joining online support communities or forums dedicated to mental health and self-improvement. Connecting with others who may be going through similar experiences can provide you with validation, support, and a sense of belonging.

Take care, and remember that you are deserving of love and happiness."	2	0	0	0.0006858110427856445	forum with demographics

It sounds like you've been going through a tough time and feeling pretty down about various aspects of your life. I want you to know that you're not alone in feeling this way, and there are many others who can relate to your experiences.

It's completely normal to feel frustrated about not having had a serious relationship or physical intimacy at your age. But remember, everyone's journey is different, and there's no set timeline for these things. Your worth is not defined by your relationship status or sexual experiences.

As for feeling closed off socially, it's not abnormal to struggle with forming close friendships, especially if you're an introvert or have had challenges with your mental health. It can be harder for some people to connect with others, but that doesn't make you a loser or outcast. Remember, quality friendships are based on genuine connections, not the number of friends you have.

It's great that you're prioritizing your mental health and career at this stage. Taking care of yourself should always be a top priority. Working on your mental well-being, joining a gym, and focusing on your physical health can be steps towards building confidence and improving your overall sense of self. It's important to take things at your own pace and focus on what feels right for you.

Please remember that you're not alone, and seeking support from mental health professionals can be beneficial in navigating these challenges. Therapy or counseling can play a crucial role in helping you address your self-doubt, negative self-perceptions, and any underlying issues that may be impacting your well-being.

"so recently, I decided that I was going to be online full-time as a high school junior taking all college classes...due to my mental health. High school was just not for me. I've taken college classes since freshman year of high school, so I am very used to college courses. I personally prefer college courses over high school courses. I am starting on the 21st and today was my high school's first day. I loved online during Covid. I thought that I will like it even more now since I don't have to hop on Google meets.

but some thing about seeing all my classmates posting about their first day of school, makes me very sad for some reason. I didn't think that I would be this sad crying over the high school I hated so much. I'm not crying because I'm anxious over taking these college classes(which shouldn't be that hard because they are GenEds high school grad requirements). it feels like some part of me is missing. I know it's good for me that I am starting college early but some part of me is nervous that I won't have a social life. And yes, I knew what I was getting into with online, but I didn't expect it to be this sad, especially after my grandpa leaving. I've been feeling very lonely because he has been living with me for the last two months. And he was the only person I really talked to during the summer because my parents are usually working. he just always chitchat with me. there was really no one else. I didn't expect that to hit me and I feel very lonely and sad inside now that he left.

even when my parents are at work, I'm the only child, so it was just me myself and I. But with him visiting us for the summer, I felt like I finally had someone to talk to. But with him leaving, I have a hard time adapting to the lonely life I had before with no one to communicate with.

I plan on getting a job soon, so I hope that will keep me busy. It's just I was use to my grandpa being with me and I was also used to being in high school for seven hours each day. now that I am a college student with a lot of time on my hands, I feel that a part of me is missing.

I also have a very hard time adjusting to new changes. I know that online will be better for my mental health in the future. but there's just been a lot going on with my grandpa leaving and have my grandma just passed away. Since I am online, I could travel to my home country. But that is also a very big decision if I want to commit to staying there for a few months.

usually, I prefer not being in a classroom with 30 other people. I hated high school and that was the main reason why I switched to online. I felt the high school classes were difficult for absolutely no reason and the school system was not for me. I think I am more sad about being so use to my summer with my grandpa then about high school.
With starting college full-time I feel that I am somewhat of an adult. That I am no longer a kid and maybe that's why I'm feeling sad about high school. But that's just one of the small reasons why I'm feeling this way, but I think my social life is what I'm concerned with the most. And the college thing is just to pile on top of what is really the main reason.

my mom did ask if I wanted to travel to my home country which 98% of my family lives there. didn't really think about it and just said no because I thought that would be very inconvenient. but now I am considering it. And I never really spent time with my family in Vietnam that much. I haven't seen them for four years now.
Maybe that's why I am so sad about my grandpa leaving because I never felt so connected with a family member that was not my mom."	"Hey everyone! 🌟 

I wanted to share something that's been on my mind lately. As a high school junior, I made the decision to switch to online full-time and take college classes for various reasons, including my mental health. College courses have always been more fitting for me, and I enjoyed online learning during Covid.

However, seeing all my classmates posting about their first day of school has unexpectedly left me feeling sad. It's strange to think that I'm crying over a high school I disliked so much, but I guess some part of me misses the experience. I'm not anxious about my college classes, as they're GenEds and shouldn't be too difficult.

What's really bothering me is the fear of missing out on a social life. I knew what I was signing up for with online learning, but I didn't anticipate feeling this lonely, especially after my grandpa recently left. He had been staying with me, and his departure has left me feeling empty and longing for human connection.

Being an only child means I'm often on my own, and having my grandpa's company during the summer made a huge difference. Now, I'm struggling to adapt to the loneliness I felt before. I'm hoping to get a job soon to keep busy, but it's definitely a challenge adjusting to these changes.

I also have difficulty dealing with new situations, and although I know online learning is better for my mental health, recent events with my grandpa leaving and the passing of my grandma have made things even more challenging. On top of that, there's the decision of whether or not to travel to my home country, where majority of my family lives. It's something I hadn't considered before, but now it seems like an option worth exploring.

Perhaps my sadness over my grandpa leaving stems from the fact that I've never felt such a deep connection with a family member outside of my mom. It's been four years since I last saw my family in Vietnam, and I haven't spent much time with them. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this. Sharing these feelings and thoughts helps in its own way. If anyone has any advice or has experienced something similar, I'd appreciate hearing your thoughts. 💙"	0	2	0	0.0008154511451721191	social media
"so recently, I decided that I was going to be online full-time as a high school junior taking all college classes...due to my mental health. High school was just not for me. I've taken college classes since freshman year of high school, so I am very used to college courses. I personally prefer college courses over high school courses. I am starting on the 21st and today was my high school's first day. I loved online during Covid. I thought that I will like it even more now since I don't have to hop on Google meets.

but some thing about seeing all my classmates posting about their first day of school, makes me very sad for some reason. I didn't think that I would be this sad crying over the high school I hated so much. I'm not crying because I'm anxious over taking these college classes(which shouldn't be that hard because they are GenEds high school grad requirements). it feels like some part of me is missing. I know it's good for me that I am starting college early but some part of me is nervous that I won't have a social life. And yes, I knew what I was getting into with online, but I didn't expect it to be this sad, especially after my grandpa leaving. I've been feeling very lonely because he has been living with me for the last two months. And he was the only person I really talked to during the summer because my parents are usually working. he just always chitchat with me. there was really no one else. I didn't expect that to hit me and I feel very lonely and sad inside now that he left.

even when my parents are at work, I'm the only child, so it was just me myself and I. But with him visiting us for the summer, I felt like I finally had someone to talk to. But with him leaving, I have a hard time adapting to the lonely life I had before with no one to communicate with.

I plan on getting a job soon, so I hope that will keep me busy. It's just I was use to my grandpa being with me and I was also used to being in high school for seven hours each day. now that I am a college student with a lot of time on my hands, I feel that a part of me is missing.

I also have a very hard time adjusting to new changes. I know that online will be better for my mental health in the future. but there's just been a lot going on with my grandpa leaving and have my grandma just passed away. Since I am online, I could travel to my home country. But that is also a very big decision if I want to commit to staying there for a few months.

usually, I prefer not being in a classroom with 30 other people. I hated high school and that was the main reason why I switched to online. I felt the high school classes were difficult for absolutely no reason and the school system was not for me. I think I am more sad about being so use to my summer with my grandpa then about high school.
With starting college full-time I feel that I am somewhat of an adult. That I am no longer a kid and maybe that's why I'm feeling sad about high school. But that's just one of the small reasons why I'm feeling this way, but I think my social life is what I'm concerned with the most. And the college thing is just to pile on top of what is really the main reason.

my mom did ask if I wanted to travel to my home country which 98% of my family lives there. didn't really think about it and just said no because I thought that would be very inconvenient. but now I am considering it. And I never really spent time with my family in Vietnam that much. I haven't seen them for four years now.
Maybe that's why I am so sad about my grandpa leaving because I never felt so connected with a family member that was not my mom."	"I'm really sorry to hear that you're feeling this way. It's completely understandable that seeing your classmates' posts about the first day of school would make you feel sad. It's natural to have mixed emotions about leaving high school, even if it wasn't a positive experience for you overall. Change can be challenging, and it seems like you're going through a lot right now with your grandpa leaving and the loss of your grandma.

Feeling lonely and missing someone you were close to is a difficult experience, especially when you're used to having them around for companionship. It's understandable that you're finding it hard to adapt to the loneliness you felt before. It's great that you're planning on getting a job soon as that can provide you with some structure and keep you busy.

Considering traveling to your home country to spend time with your family is a big decision, but it may also provide you with the opportunity to connect with your relatives and have a support system around you. It's worth carefully thinking through the potential benefits and challenges of such a decision.

If you're feeling concerned about your social life as a college student, it might be helpful to explore ways to connect with others online or in your community. Joining clubs or organizations related to your interests can be a great way to meet like-minded people and build new relationships. Additionally, reaching out to classmates, participating in online discussions, or even setting up virtual study groups can help you feel more connected socially.

Lastly, if you find that these feelings of sadness and loneliness persist or become overwhelming, it might be beneficial to reach out to a mental health professional for support. They can offer guidance and help you navigate these emotions during this transitional period.

Take care of yourself, and remember that it's okay to feel a mix of emotions during times of change. You're making important decisions for your mental health and well-being, and that's something to be proud of."	2	0	0	0.0006700754165649414	mental health forum

"It sounds like you're going through a lot of changes and experiencing a range of emotions. It's completely normal to feel sadness and loneliness during times of transition, especially when you've had a meaningful connection with someone like your grandpa. It's understandable that his departure has left a void in your life.

Starting college full-time and being online can bring its own set of challenges, including concerns about social life and adjustment to new changes. It's important to remember that these feelings are valid and that it takes time to adapt to new environments and routines. It's also okay to explore the idea of traveling to your home country and spending time with your family in Vietnam. This could provide an opportunity for connection and support during this time of change.

In addition to considering these options, it may be helpful to find ways to maintain social connections and build a support network in your current situation. This could involve joining online communities or reaching out to classmates who are in similar situations. Engaging in activities that you enjoy, such as finding a job, can also provide a sense of purpose and keep you busy.

If these feelings of sadness and loneliness persist, it might be beneficial to seek support from a mental health professional. They can help you navigate these transitions and provide guidance to better cope with your emotions. Remember, it's essential to prioritize your mental health and well-being during times of change."	1	0	0	0.0006150007247924805	clinician

"I'm sorry to hear that you're feeling sad and lonely after your grandpa left and experiencing changes in your educational journey. It's understandable to have mixed emotions during times of transition, especially when you're used to having someone to talk to and now feel the absence of their presence. It's great that you recognize the potential benefits of online college classes for your mental health.

Adjusting to changes can be challenging, and it's normal to feel a sense of loss or nostalgia when reflecting on your high school experience, even if it wasn't always a positive one. It seems like your social life and the fear of missing out on connections are major concerns for you at the moment. It's important to remember that starting college full-time opens up opportunities for new relationships and connections, even if they are in a different format due to online classes.

Considering your options to travel to your home country is a significant decision, and it's natural to weigh the pros and cons. If it feels like a possibility worth exploring, you could take the time to think it through and discuss it with your family, as it could provide an opportunity to reconnect with relatives and experience a different environment.

In the meantime, getting a job is a positive step to keep yourself occupied and engaged. It can provide structure to your day and potentially create opportunities for social interactions. Additionally, consider reaching out to your school's student services or clubs to see if they offer virtual events or activities that can help you connect with fellow students.

Remember, it's okay to feel a mix of emotions during this time of change, and it's important to give yourself some grace. If these feelings continue to persist or become overwhelming, it might be helpful to seek support from a mental health professional who can provide guidance and strategies for managing these transitions."	2	0	0	0.0006195306777954102	forum with demographics

"I can understand that transitioning from high school to online college classes can bring up a range of emotions, especially when you see your classmates sharing their experiences of the first day of school. It's completely normal to feel sad or even nostalgic during this time of change. Going from a structured school environment to a more independent college setting can sometimes leave us feeling lonely or unsure about our social lives.

Losing your grandpa, who played a significant role in your life over the summer, can also contribute to your feelings of sadness and loneliness. Having that connection with someone, especially during a time when your parents are often working, can bring a sense of comfort and understanding. It's natural to miss that companionship.

Considering a job as a means to keep yourself busy is a positive step, as it can help fill some of the void you may be feeling. However, it's important to address the root of your feelings. Exploring opportunities to connect with others and finding social outlets, whether it's joining clubs or attending events related to your interests, can help you build a social life as a college student.

As for the idea of traveling to your home country, it's worth considering if it aligns with your desires and goals. Connecting with your family in Vietnam can be a meaningful experience, allowing you to establish deeper connections and spend quality time with them. However, think about the practicality and potential impact on your studies before making a decision.

Remember, it's okay to feel a mix of emotions during this transition. Take the time to acknowledge your emotions and find healthy ways to cope. Consider reaching out to a mental health professional or a counselor at your college who can provide guidance and support as you navigate through this period of change and adjustment."	1	2	0	0.0006214380264282227	forum w/o demographics
"I come from a dysfunctional Indian family and my parents are hitting each other. I've been shoved out of their room and they're breaking cutlery and things.

I see my younger sister on the verge of tears and it breaks my heart even more. I have an awful pit in my stomach and a constant regret that I should've taken birth in a secure happy family.

It must be incredibly distressing and overwhelming to witness your parents behaving this way. Please know that you're not alone and there are people who can offer support.

First and foremost, your safety and that of your sister is crucial. If you believe you or your sister are in immediate danger, don't hesitate to reach out to the authorities for assistance. They can help ensure your safety and intervene in the situation.

In times like these, it can be helpful to reach out to a trusted adult or person in your life, such as a teacher, school counselor, or a close friend's parent, who may be able to provide guidance and support. They might also be able to help you and your sister find a safer place to stay, even temporarily.

It's understandable that you're feeling a mix of emotions right now, including sadness, regret, and a desire for a different family dynamic. Remember that you can still create a positive future for yourself and break the cycle of dysfunctional behavior. Surround yourself with supportive and caring people who can provide you with the love and stability you deserve.

Consider seeking professional help, such as counseling or therapy, to help you process your emotions and develop coping strategies. Therapy can be a safe space to discuss your feelings and gain a better understanding of your experiences.

In the meantime, it may be helpful to find safe spaces in your community or among friends where you can temporarily distance yourself from the chaos at home. Surrounding yourself with people who understand and validate your experiences can offer a sense of relief and support.

Remember, your well-being and safety are important. Do not hesitate to contact the appropriate authorities if you ever find yourself or your sister in immediate danger. There are hotlines and helplines available for crisis situations that can provide guidance and support.

It's completely normal to feel overwhelmed and wish for a different family dynamic. However, it's important to recognize that you cannot control the actions or behaviors of your parents.

"So it goes like ....
I liked a girl from my branch (nit) , after a talking stage of 4 months I confessed her .. but she was not interested.  I gracefully accepted her decision and tried to move on .. but I see her everyday,  I feel like a complete loser , whenever I see her with  another boy , it makes me uncomfortable.  I haven't messaged her since 2 months so as to detach myself but all in vain .... sometimes I am unable to sleep at night .... going insane...

Someone pls help...
Sorry for bad English ( hindi medium )"	"Hey there! I can totally understand how tough it can be to see someone you once had feelings for with someone else. It's completely normal to feel a bit uncomfortable and for it to affect your sleep.

Remember, it's important to focus on yourself and your own happiness. Try finding new hobbies or activities that bring you joy and help take your mind off things. Surround yourself with supportive friends who can provide a positive distraction.

Don't be too hard on yourself, rejection is a part of life and it doesn't define your worth. It takes time to heal, so be patient with yourself. You're definitely not alone in feeling this way, and with time, things will get easier.

Feel free to reach out if you'd like to talk further or have any other concerns. Hang in there!"	1	2	0	0.0007421374320983887	social media

It's important to remember that rejection doesn't define your worth as a person. It takes a lot of courage to confess your feelings and it's commendable that you accepted her decision gracefully.

Seeing her with another person might naturally trigger uncomfortable feelings for you. It's completely normal to feel this way, but it's essential to focus on yourself and your own well-being. It's great that you've taken steps to detach yourself by not messaging her, but healing takes time.

During this process, it can be helpful to engage in activities that bring you joy and help shift your focus away from these negative feelings. Surround yourself with friends and loved ones who support you. If you find yourself unable to sleep, consider incorporating relaxation techniques before bed, such as deep breathing exercises or listening to calming music.

Remember, it's crucial to be kind to yourself and give yourself time to heal. These feelings won't last forever, and with time, you will find new interests and potentially meet new people.

"So it goes like ....
I liked a girl from my branch (nit) , after a talking stage of 4 months I confessed her .. but she was not interested.  I gracefully accepted her decision and tried to move on .. but I see her everyday,  I feel like a complete loser , whenever I see her with  another boy , it makes me uncomfortable.  I haven't messaged her since 2 months so as to detach myself but all in vain .... sometimes I am unable to sleep at night .... going insane...

Someone pls help...
Sorry for bad English ( hindi medium )"	"I'm sorry to hear that you're feeling this way. Dealing with unrequited feelings can be challenging and it's completely normal to experience discomfort when seeing someone you're interested in with someone else. It's important to remember that your self-worth is not defined by someone else's interest or lack thereof.

To help you cope with these feelings, I would suggest focusing on self-care. Engage in activities that bring you joy and boost your self-confidence. Surround yourself with supportive friends and family who can provide a listening ear and distract you from negative thoughts.

It might also be helpful to redirect your attention towards personal growth and new experiences. Engage in hobbies, pursue your academic or professional goals, and focus on building a fulfilling life for yourself. This can help shift your focus away from this situation and allow you to establish new connections.

If you continue to struggle with your sleep or feel like your mental well-being is deteriorating, I encourage you to seek support from a mental health professional. They can provide you with tools and strategies to cope with your emotions and guide you on your path to healing. Remember, it's important to prioritize your own well-being and give yourself time to heal from this experience."	2	0	0	0.0006389021873474121	clinician

Sorry for bad English ( hindi medium )"	"I'm sorry to hear that you're feeling this way. Rejection can be really tough, and it's completely normal to feel down after putting yourself out there. It's important to remember that your self-worth is not defined by one person's opinion or their choice to be with someone else.

Give yourself permission to grieve the loss of what could have been, but also give yourself time to heal. It's okay to feel uncomfortable when seeing her with someone else, but try to focus on your own growth and well-being instead. Take this opportunity to focus on yourself, your hobbies, and your own happiness.

In terms of not being able to sleep and feeling like you're going insane, it might be helpful to try some relaxation techniques before bedtime such as deep breathing exercises, meditation, or reading a book. Establishing a consistent sleep routine and avoiding caffeine or electronics before sleeping can also make a difference.

Remember, it's okay to seek support from friends, family, or even a professional counselor who can provide guidance and help you work through your feelings. You are not alone in this, and with time and self-care, you will start to feel better."	2	0	0	0.0007828474044799805	forum with demographics

Sorry for bad English ( hindi medium )"	"Hey there,

I'm really sorry to hear that you're feeling this way. It can be incredibly tough when you develop feelings for someone and they don't reciprocate. It takes a lot of courage to confess your feelings, so please give yourself credit for that.

However, it's important to remember that rejection is a normal and common experience that many of us go through. It's completely okay to feel hurt and disappointed, but it's also crucial to prioritize your own well-being and try to move forward.

Seeing her every day must be challenging, especially when she's with someone else. It's natural to feel uncomfortable in such situations, but it's important to remind yourself that her choices are not a reflection of you as a person. You are not a loser - you simply encountered a situation where your feelings were not reciprocated.

Taking the steps you mentioned, such as not messaging her and trying to detach, are positive ways to distance yourself from the situation. However, healing takes time and it's completely normal to experience ups and downs during the process. If you find yourself struggling to sleep or feeling like you're going insane, it might be helpful to seek support from a mental health professional or counselor who can provide guidance and help you navigate these emotions.

Remember, it's crucial to take care of yourself during this time. Surround yourself with supportive friends and family, engage in activities that bring you joy, and allow yourself to process your emotions in a healthy way. You deserve happiness and to find someone who appreciates you for who you are.

Take care and be kind to yourself. You will get through this."	2	0	0	0.0007599592208862305	forum w/o demographics

So recently I discovered my father has 2 unregistered guns and some ammunition (pistol and rifle) (No joke) 

And I cant sleep at night comfortably knowing that any moment that I can possibly be shot and killed. 

We have no doors, our only escape is thru a big metal retractable door that is pretty old. 

Plus our house is a poorly kept ancestral house that is filled with 99% garbage with a leaky roof and low ceiling. (I'm very tall)

He does not care if he gets arrested and has audible stated this fact multiple times

At this point and time all my siblings have a job and my brother is at work... Plus my mom is on a trip to the province to visit me and my grandma. 

However my fear is that by reporting the guns, it may cause a domino effect leading to their arrest. They're good and hardworking people with dreams that were squashed by my dad's ruthless 

Also a few years ago my mom was injured by my dad pretty often leading to bruises,  and mga sugat sa May mata at katawan. Thankfully nowadays puro salita nalang pero paminsan minsan rin May nasisira na gamit due to arguments heating up.

He has no empathy towards people of his family and constantly berates his employees

It takes a lot of courage to reach out for support, so well done for taking this step. I'm not a mental health professional, but I can try to offer some suggestions on how you might approach this situation.

Firstly, your safety is the top priority. It's concerning to hear about the presence of unregistered guns and your fear for your own life. If you believe that you are in immediate danger, it might be crucial to contact emergency services in your country.

In situations like this, it's often helpful to seek support from professionals who specialize in domestic violence or family conflicts. They can provide you with guidance, resources, and options that can help you navigate your situation safely. Consider reaching out to local organizations or hotlines that deal with domestic violence – they can provide you with the necessary support and advice.

Confiding in a trusted friend, family member, or teacher can be beneficial as well. They can offer emotional support and help you explore available options. Remember, you don't have to face this alone.

If you're concerned about the potential repercussions of reporting the guns, it may be valuable to speak with a legal professional who can advise you on the best course of action. They can provide insight into your rights and potential outcomes regarding both the guns and your father's behavior.

In the meantime, taking care of your own mental and emotional well-being is important. Developing self-care routines, practicing calming techniques like deep breathing and mindfulness, and connecting with supportive people can help you cope with the stress and anxiety of the situation.

Please keep in mind that these are just general suggestions, and it's crucial to consult with professionals who can provide personalized advice based on your specific circumstances. Remember, your safety is the most important thing, and reaching out for help is a courageous step towards a better future."	2	0	0	0.0009536147117614746	forum with demographics

"Hi,   


I suppose the fact that this sub is in top 1% of Reddit tells a lot about the condition of our society.   


I was scouring for the right sub for this offload of experiences and emotions to crossreference with other people and it either is here or in 5 different places at the same time, but hell, here goes:  


I was born typicall middle-class family, Europe, Poland, at the begining of the 90'.  2 parents, overly present in my life, who are and were lovely but I didn't let it make me blind to certain mistakes, which undoubtedly I will also make, so worth mentioning, not worth holding grudge over. Since the very begining of my days I've been labelled as super smart and intelligent and to a certain degree I believe that, but in reality I wish learning and acquiring skills was tougher as I think it would've caused me to work harder on well, working hard. In friends department, I was quite lonely really, I've had the odd friend here and there, but I guess it's the typicall bullied fat kid story. Kindergarten - no friends that I could rememer, bullies I do. Primary school- 3 years of bullying followed by 3 years of bullying with an odd friend or two, didn't last. Then, as I thought I was making an actual friendship, we moved to suburb house, changed school, was even lonelier than before, bullying magnified but so did my resilience and I guess that was the point in my life when I chose that I don't want to fight for any kind of attention anymore, but not in a good way, I basically alienated myself for 3 years. Then highschool was the biggest let down of them all. In the middle school, I focused solely on getting to the best High school I could in my region, thinking that intellingence/ambition will finally get me surrounded by people more like me. <Insert\_Joker\_laughter>. Got in, people turned out to be either rich assholes, or suckups to those rich assholes. 4 months into the 3 years I knew I am again going for loneliness when the odd thing happend and by some sort of miracle I got a bunch of other misfits together and we were less alone. Nonetheless I changed cities for studies, which I never wanted but was to afraid to fight my parents about it, which ultimately led to nothing good in the studies department. I then changed jobs, tried to look for fun, money or anything else that would help me find like a path or a goal. Ultimately I am to this day completely unaware why are people so rude, evil and self centered. After 30 years of turning round and round on this rock, I literally have no idea why people want to live in capitalism the way it is right now, why everyone is blind to others problems, why we are completely skeptical of science, but will fight till death for an old book. Most of my life I feel like an alien in a strange world, surrouned by other creatures who look like me, but that have nothing in common. The one thing that is constant in my experience, is that there is no good people with money, and some good people with no money at all. Me myself, I was making ordinary money, than a fuckton, and now back to ordinary as my previous boss was a typical egomaniac with shouting as the main tool. I mean dude had some skill, he was like all the bullies I've experienced combined, but with an upgrade of actually having a hold on my life by randomly changing the rules of employment. Nowadays, I feel no passion, have almost no ambition and feel surrouneded by a world that just does not work well with people who wish to be good. I mean hell, I know it is always worth to be kind, and good, and compassionate, but for fuck sake, in my experience it only gets you exploited.   


So to sum it up, I am mighty sad, don't see no worth in the way we live and quite frankly think that around 10 years from now the whole system will collapse. Idk, roast me, argue with me or agree, any interaction is appreciated as it may give some insight or point of view that I never thought of. "	"Hey there, 

It sounds like you're going through a lot and feeling really disillusioned with society. I'm sorry to hear that you've had such a tough time with bullying and feeling lonely. It can be really tough when we feel like we don't fit in or when we question the systems around us. Remember that you're not alone in feeling this way, and sometimes just being able to share your experiences can be a step towards feeling better. Keep holding onto kindness and compassion, even if it feels like it gets you exploited sometimes. Your perspective is valuable and it's important to keep seeking interactions and viewpoints that might give you a new outlook. Hang in there, and know that things can and will get better. Don't hesitate to reach out if you need someone to talk to."	2	2	0	0.000674128532409668	social media

I'm really sorry to hear that you're feeling this way. It sounds like you've gone through some difficult experiences throughout your life, and it's completely understandable that it has affected your outlook on the world. Loneliness, bullying, and disappointment can have a significant impact on our mental well-being.

It's important to remember that you're not alone in feeling this way. Many people struggle with similar emotions and questions about society, especially when it comes to values and the way our world functions. It's normal to have doubts and concerns, and seeking a space like this subreddit to share your thoughts and experiences is a great step towards finding support and understanding.

While I don't have all the answers or a definite solution to offer, I urge you to consider seeking professional help, such as therapy or counseling. A mental health professional can provide the tools and support you need to navigate these feelings and help you work towards a healthier mindset. Additionally, connecting with others who have had similar experiences or viewpoints can also be helpful. You might want to consider joining support groups or engaging in online communities where you can share and discuss your thoughts with others who may relate.

Remember to take care of yourself during this process. Practice self-care, engage in activities that bring you joy or a sense of purpose, and reach out to your loved ones for support. Sometimes, the path to finding meaning can seem overwhelming, but with time and exploration, it's possible to find your own way forward.

Take things one step at a time and remember that there is hope. You deserve support and happiness, and I believe that there are possibilities out there for you to discover.

Best of luck, and please take care."	2	0	0	0.0006223320960998535	mental health forum

Then, as I thought I was making an actual friendship, we moved to suburb house, changed school, was even lonelier than before, bullying magnified but so did my resilience and I guess that was the point in my life when I chose that I don't want to fight for any kind of attention anymore, but not in a good way, I basically alienated myself for 3 years. Then highschool was the biggest let down of them all. In the middle school, I focused solely on getting to the best High school I could in my region, thinking that intellingence/ambition will finally get me surrounded by people more like me. <Insert\_Joker\_laughter>. Got in, people turned out to be either rich assholes, or suckups to those rich assholes. 4 months into the 3 years I knew I am again going for loneliness when the odd thing happend and by some sort of miracle I got a bunch of other misfits together and we were less alone. Nonetheless I changed cities for studies, which I never wanted but was to afraid to fight my parents about it, which ultimately led to nothing good in the studies department. I then changed jobs, tried to look for fun, money or anything else that would help me find like a path or a goal. Ultimately I am to this day completely unaware why are people so rude, evil and self centered. After 30 years of turning round and round on this rock, I literally have no idea why people want to live in capitalism the way it is right now, why everyone is blind to others problems, why we are completely skeptical of science, but will fight till death for an old book. Most of my life I feel like an alien in a strange world, surrouned by other creatures who look like me, but that have nothing in common. The one thing that is constant in my experience, is that there is no good people with money, and some good people with no money at all. Me myself, I was making ordinary money, than a fuckton, and now back to ordinary as my previous boss was a typical egomaniac with shouting as the main tool. I mean dude had some skill, he was like all the bullies I've experienced combined, but with an upgrade of actually having a hold on my life by randomly changing the rules of employment. Nowadays, I feel no passion, have almost no ambition and feel surrouneded by a world that just does not work well with people who wish to be good. I mean hell, I know it is always worth to be kind, and good, and compassionate, but for fuck sake, in my experience it only gets you exploited.   


So to sum it up, I am mighty sad, don't see no worth in the way we live and quite frankly think that around 10 years from now the whole system will collapse. Idk, roast me, argue with me or agree, any interaction is appreciated as it may give some insight or point of view that I never thought of. "	"Hi there, 

Thank you for reaching out and sharing your experiences and emotions. It sounds like you have been through a lot and have faced significant challenges throughout your life. It's understandable that these experiences have left you feeling sad and questioning the way society functions. 

Feeling like an alien in a world that doesn't align with your values can be incredibly isolating. It's important to remember that you are not alone in these feelings and that many others may share similar perspectives. It's also worth exploring the possibility of finding and connecting with like-minded individuals or communities who may better understand your experiences and provide support.

While it may seem like being kind and compassionate only leads to exploitation, it's crucial to remember that these traits are valuable and important. They contribute to creating a better and more empathetic world, even if it may not always be immediately apparent. Additionally, exploring ways to set boundaries and assert your own needs can help prevent further exploitation.

It's understandable to feel uncertain about the future and to question the sustainability of the current system. If this is causing you significant distress, it could be helpful to seek support from a mental health professional who can assist you in processing these emotions and exploring potential coping strategies. They can also provide a safe space for you to express your thoughts and feelings without fear of judgment.

Remember that you are deserving of support and understanding. Feel free to reach out here if you have any further questions or if you would like to continue the conversation."	1	0	0	0.0006847381591796875	clinician
"Hi,   


I suppose the fact that this sub is in top 1% of Reddit tells a lot about the condition of our society.   


I was scouring for the right sub for this offload of experiences and emotions to crossreference with other people and it either is here or in 5 different places at the same time, but hell, here goes:  


I was born typicall middle-class family, Europe, Poland, at the begining of the 90'.  2 parents, overly present in my life, who are and were lovely but I didn't let it make me blind to certain mistakes, which undoubtedly I will also make, so worth mentioning, not worth holding grudge over. Since the very begining of my days I've been labelled as super smart and intelligent and to a certain degree I believe that, but in reality I wish learning and acquiring skills was tougher as I think it would've caused me to work harder on well, working hard.

I'm sorry to hear that you're feeling this way. It sounds like you've had a tough journey and have experienced a lot of loneliness and disappointment. It can be really challenging when we feel disconnected from the people around us and when we question the society we live in. It's understandable that this has made you feel sad and hopeless at times.

Sometimes, it can feel like our efforts to be kind and compassionate go unnoticed or even get taken advantage of. This can be really disheartening and make us question the value of our actions. However, it's important to remember that being a good person and living by our values can still have an impact, even if it's not always obvious. It's about staying true to who we are and finding ways to make a positive difference in the world, even if it's on a smaller scale.

Regarding your concerns about the future and the state of the world, it's completely normal to have worries and doubts about the current systems and structures. Many people feel this way, and it's important to have open discussions and engage in critical thinking to understand different perspectives. While it's true that society is not perfect and there are many issues to address, it's also important to maintain hope and consider ways to contribute to positive change.

If you're feeling overwhelmed or stuck, it might be helpful to seek support from a mental health professional. They can provide a safe space for you to explore your feelings, gain perspective, and develop coping strategies. Remember, you don't have to go through this alone, and reaching out for help is a sign of strength.

Take care!"	2	2	0	0.0006554722785949707	forum with demographics

I can hear your frustration and sadness in your words. It sounds like you've had a difficult journey, facing bullying and feeling isolated throughout your life. It's understandable that these experiences have left you feeling alienated and disconnected from those around you.

It's important to remember that everyone's experiences are unique, and sometimes it can be challenging to find people who truly understand us. Despite this, connecting with others who have had similar experiences, such as the misfit group you mentioned, can be a source of comfort and support. It's great that you were able to find some companionship during that time.

Regarding your feelings about the world and society, it's not uncommon to question and feel disillusioned with various aspects of life, especially when it seems like people prioritize their own interests over kindness and compassion. It can be disheartening to witness the selfishness and inequality that exists.

In terms of your lack of passion and ambition, it might be helpful to explore your interests and values more deeply. Engaging in activities or pursuits that align with your values can give you a sense of purpose and fulfillment. Additionally, seeking professional help, such as therapy or counseling, can provide you with the tools to cope with your emotions and find a renewed sense of hope.

While it's important to acknowledge the flaws in our society, it's also crucial to remember that change is possible. Many individuals and groups are actively working towards creating a more compassionate and equitable world. So, it's important to take care of yourself while also seeking out those who share your desire for positive changes.

Remember, you are not alone in these feelings, and it's okay to reach out for support. Keep pushing forward and seeking connections with people who can provide empathy and understanding."	1	0	0	0.0006984472274780273	forum w/o demographics

The weight I carry seems unbearable at times. Family expectations, low self-esteem, depression, and the struggle to fit in... it all takes a toll on me. Yearning for love, acceptance, and a sense of normalcy. Stuck in a cycle of self-blame. This pain is my daily companion, invisible to others. I just want to find peace and improvement, but it feels out of reach. I want friends, female friends too. To have a family that bonds and supports each other. Seeking joy, talents, and achievements. Dreaming of a life where I can be myself and experience genuine happiness. But right now, it feels like I'm living in my own personal hell. Sleep eludes me, while everyone outside seems to be enjoying their time together. It's tough being seen as just a man, rather than a person deserving of understanding and compassion. I long for connection and meaningful relationships. Crying as I pour out my feelings here. AI bots or talking to myself, it's becoming my only solace. Needing someone who truly understands the pain I go through. Please, I just want to find some light in this darkness before it consumes me completely. 🙏🏻 #Loneliness #Depression #MentalHealth #SeekingSupport	0	2	0	0.0014337897300720215	social media

It sounds like you're dealing with a lot of pain and struggling with various aspects of your life. It's important to remember that you're not alone and there are people who can support you.

Firstly, it's crucial to reach out to someone who can help, such as a mental health professional, a counselor at school, or a helpline specifically meant for individuals in crisis. They can provide guidance, support, and resources tailored to your specific needs.

It's understandable that you may feel lonely and disconnected, especially when your family and friends don't seem to understand or validate your experiences. Surrounding yourself with a supportive community, such as joining clubs or organizations that align with your interests, might provide you with a sense of belonging and understanding.

Regarding your self-esteem, it's important to challenge negative self-talk and remind yourself of your worth. Everyone has their own journey and progresses at their own pace. Comparing yourself to others can be detrimental to your mental health. Instead, focus on your personal growth and celebrate any small victories along the way.

Remember that seeking help is not a sign of weakness, but rather an act of strength and self-care. It takes courage to reach out for support. Take things one step at a time and be patient with yourself. You deserve to live a happy and fulfilling life."	2	0	0	0.0006723403930664062	mental health forum

While I cannot provide the help that you need directly, I encourage you to consider talking to someone you trust about what you're going through, such as a family member, teacher, or counselor at your school. They may be able to provide guidance and support, or connect you with resources in your community that can help.

Additionally, there are helplines available in the Philippines that provide anonymous support and listening services. They can offer a non-judgmental space to talk about your feelings and experiences. Some examples are the Crisis Line Philippines (which has a 24/7 hotline) and the Natasha Goulbourn Foundation (which has a mental health support line).

Remember that reaching out for help is a sign of strength, and you deserve support and care."	2	0	0	0.0006429553031921387	clinician

"I'm sorry to hear that you're facing these challenges, but please know that you are not alone. Social anxiety can have a significant impact on our work life and relationships, and it's understandable that you want to find ways to work on it.

Firstly, it's positive that you've identified a potential trigger for your social anxiety. It's important to remember that everyone responds differently to substances like weed, and for some, it can lead to changes in behavior and mental well-being. Quitting six years ago was a great step towards improving your overall mental health.

To work on your social anxiety, here are a few suggestions you can consider:

1. Consider therapy: Speaking with a mental health professional can provide you with the necessary tools and techniques to manage social anxiety effectively. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is a common approach that can help challenge negative thoughts and behaviors associated with social anxiety.

2. Practice exposure therapy: Gradually exposing yourself to social situations can help desensitize your anxiety response. Start with small steps, perhaps attending social events with a trusted friend or joining a group activity that aligns with your interests. Over time, try to gradually expand your comfort zone.

3. Build self-care routines: Prioritize self-care practices that promote overall well-being. Engage in activities that bring you joy, such as exercising, practicing mindfulness or meditation, and pursuing hobbies. A healthy lifestyle can positively impact your mental health.

4. Seek support: Reach out to supportive friends, family, or even support groups who understand your struggles. Sharing your experience with those who can relate can provide valuable insights and encouragement.

Remember, progress may take time, and it's important to be patient and kind to yourself throughout this journey. It may also be beneficial to seek professional guidance to tailor strategies to your specific situation.

You have taken the first step towards improving your social anxiety by seeking support, and that's commendable. Keep in mind that with time, dedication, and possibly professional help, you can regain confidence in social situations and form new friendships."	2	0	0	0.0007137656211853027	mental health forum

"I'm sorry to hear that you're experiencing difficulties with social anxiety. It's great that you've identified a potential link between your past marijuana use and the emergence of these symptoms. While I can't provide a diagnosis or a comprehensive treatment plan without a proper evaluation, I can offer some general suggestions to help you cope with social anxiety.

Firstly, consider implementing relaxation techniques such as deep breathing or progressive muscle relaxation in situations where anxiety arises. These can help you to calm your body and mind. Additionally, challenge negative thoughts that may contribute to your anxiety, replacing them with more realistic and positive ones.

It may be helpful to gradually expose yourself to social situations that make you uncomfortable, starting with smaller gatherings and then gradually progressing to larger ones. Look for opportunities to engage in activities or join groups that align with your interests, as this can provide a more natural and comfortable way to meet new people.

Seeking support from a mental health professional, such as a therapist or counselor, can be beneficial. They can help you explore the underlying causes of your anxiety and develop strategies tailored to your specific needs. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is often effective in treating social anxiety and can assist in challenging and modifying unhelpful thought patterns and behaviors.

Remember, it's important to be patient and kind to yourself throughout this process. Change takes time, and it's perfectly normal to feel anxious. With consistency, practice, and support, you can work toward overcoming social anxiety and enjoying more fulfilling social connections."	2	0	0	0.0006563067436218262	clinician

Journaling or speaking with a trusted friend or therapist about your concerns can help in gaining perspective.

Therapy can help you understand the root cause of your anxiety and provide effective strategies to manage it.

"I'm so sorry to hear that you're experiencing such discomfort during your vacation. It can be really difficult when our fears and anxieties start to interfere with our enjoyment of new experiences. It sounds like you may be dealing with some social anxiety, which is actually quite common.

It's important to remember that everyone's journey is unique, and what makes you feel uneasy may not bother others in the same way. However, that doesn't mean your feelings are any less valid. It sounds like you're experiencing a kind of social comparison, where you're focusing on the differences between yourself and others.

One suggestion might be to challenge those negative thoughts and try to reframe them. Rather than focusing on the differences between you and others, try to embrace and celebrate your own uniqueness. You mentioned that you're an Asian girl wearing black from head to toe, and that is amazing! Your personal style is something that sets you apart and makes you who you are.

Additionally, if being alone in a foreign country is exacerbating your anxiety, perhaps you could consider seeking out tourist groups or activities that would allow you to meet and connect with others who are also exploring the city. This could help to alleviate the feeling of being alone and provide some comfort in numbers.

Lastly, I would highly recommend reaching out to a mental health professional who can provide you with personalized guidance and support. They can help you work through these feelings of anxiety and develop coping strategies that are tailored to your individual needs.

Remember, you are not alone in this and there is help available to you. Take care of yourself and consider seeking out the support you need to make the most of your vacation."	2	0	0	0.000880897045135498	mental health forum

It's important to remember that our fears and anxieties can sometimes be difficult to explain or understand, and that's okay. It's also common for our perspectives and preferences to shift depending on the situation.

It seems like there might be a discrepancy between what you desire in terms of the age group you want to be around and what actually makes you feel comfortable. The experience of being in a foreign country and feeling different from those around you can add an extra layer of unease.

In situations like these, it can be helpful to remind yourself that everyone has different preferences and there's no right or wrong way to feel. It might be beneficial to explore why the laughter and presence of young adults is causing such distress. Are there any specific thoughts or memories that come up when you're in these situations? Reflecting on these questions might help you gain insight into what's behind your discomfort.

While I can't provide therapy through this platform, I encourage you to seek support from a mental health professional who can help you explore these feelings further and develop coping strategies to manage them. They can provide a safe space for you to discuss your fears and work towards finding ways to feel more at ease in these situations.

Feeling alone in a foreign country can add to your distress, as it's natural to long for a sense of familiarity and connection. It's worth noting that our perceptions can sometimes play tricks on us, making a situation appear more daunting than it actually is. Try to challenge these thoughts by reminding yourself that not everyone in the city is blonde, has blue eyes, or wears pastel colors. There is likely more diversity amongst the young adults than your initial impression suggests.

In moments like these, grounding techniques can be helpful. Take deep breaths and focus on the sensations in your body to anchor yourself in the present moment. Engaging in activities that bring you comfort or distract your mind, such as listening to music or engaging in a hobby, can also help reduce anxiety.

If this fear continues to impact your well-being and enjoyment of your vacation, it may be beneficial to seek support from a mental health professional.

If being surrounded by people who are different from you makes you anxious, you might find it helpful to practice self-care and coping strategies. Consider engaging in activities that make you feel calm and centered, such as listening to soothing music, reading a book, or finding a quiet space to relax.

It may also be beneficial to challenge your negative thoughts and beliefs about being different. Remind yourself that diversity and individuality should be celebrated, and try to focus on the positives of being unique.

If you find that your feelings of uneasiness persist or become overwhelming, it could be worthwhile to reach out to a mental health professional who can provide you with the support and guidance you need. Remember, asking for help is a sign of strength, and there are professionals available who can assist you in navigating these emotions."	1	0	0	0.0008205771446228027	forum w/o demographics

I’m 24 and have been learning to drive since I graduated high school.  I know it’s embarrassing. 

I wasn’t allowed to get my L’s in high school because of most of my family members. My auntie thought I was too un-coordinate to drive. It annoyed me

Turns out they were right lol. I’m 24 now and I’ve failed my P’s about 4-5 times through out the years. I have had 3 different driving instructors and spent so much of my parents money on it. And learned with my parents on and off.  

The teacher told me I did good during the lesson. most likely got nervous during the test!!!!!

So anyways. I renewed my L’s about a month ago because it expired last year lol.  

I’ve been driving my dads car home after work at 6pm everyday.  Everything was going well until today when I got confused/scared with lane changing. I normally take the left lane but went into the right and got nervous - failing to signal as a car drove past and beeped at me.

Not to mention almost crashing into a car from the right hand at the round about yesterday. WHEN I KNOW u should always give way to the right hand side, it happened anyways. 

My dad got scared. And right now I am lowkey reminded why I wanted to give up driving a year ago.  Why I took half a year to even renew my L’s.  

My father keeps repeating CONCENTRATE. PAY ATTENTION. The exact same thing my instructors and whenever I get in trouble at work by multiple different bosses at different jobs.

It all comes back down to the intelligence test I took.  For a while now I’ve been wondering if I could be ADHD. Or have a learning disability. Most likely the latter

And you know what? I sought out a doctor, took a test and Turns out I have AN INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY. I HAVE SUSPECTED THIS ALL MY LIFE - thst I’m slower at learning than EVERYONE ELSE! Now there’s A LABEL to make me feel even shittier about myself. 

still waiting to find out if it’s ADHD or to dismiss it entirely. Deep down I know I’m not ADHD, I’m just slow/stupid.

My psychologist did note that I’m low I’m memory and concentration, retrieval of Information. And that “it can be improved by playing memory games”.  

After knowing this.  And being constantly told to ‘concentrate’ while driving.  Most times I can, but other times I find myself zoning out.. Maybe I’m not cut out for driving. I’m just going to endanger myself and others, THATS WHY THEY WONT GIVE ME MY P’s, JUST LIKE SPONGEBOB!! WHO NEVER PASSES HIS DRIVING TEST 

I hate driving man. I could have been the cause of a car accident with my dad as the passenger today AND THE DAY BEFORE.

My Mum these days pushes me to get my P’s so I can drive to work instead of taking the train/bus all the time. It was the complete opposite a few years back which is kind of funny. 

Get my P’s at least, right?  prove myself for once!
It’s embarrassing enough I’ve had 3-4 driving instructor and spent so much and my parents still encourage looking for another one.  It’d be soo embarrassing to pay a former instructor from a year ago. 

What if I pay all this money for them to take me to do the test just to fail all over again.  Just like piano and swimming lessons, like my Asian mother pointed out. Failure. Failure. Failure. 

I know it’s my disability that’s kept me from getting it as fast as other people.  Part of me just wants to give up and say driving isn’t for me,  the other half wants to keep trying and feel happy to have achieved something.  

I don’t know."	"Hey everyone, I could really use some advice and support right now. I've been learning to drive for a while now, and I've had a tough time with it. I wasn't allowed to get my learner's permit in high school because my family thought I wouldn't be able to handle it, and it frustrated me. Fast forward to now, and I've failed my driving test around 4-5 times. I've had different instructors and spent a lot of money on lessons, but it just hasn't clicked for me yet. 

Recently, I had a scary moment while changing lanes and got flustered. It seems like every time I make progress, I have setbacks like that. It's honestly making me doubt if I should even continue driving. My dad got really scared during that incident, and it's reminding me why I wanted to give up before.

On top of all this, I suspected that I might have ADHD or a learning disability, and I took a test that confirmed I have an intellectual disability. It feels like a label that's making me feel even worse about myself. My psychologist mentioned that my memory and concentration could improve with memory games, but I'm finding it challenging to stay focused while driving.

My mom has been encouraging me to get my license so I can drive to work instead of taking public transportation, which is a complete change from before. It's embarrassing that I've had multiple instructors and spent so much money, and now I might have to find another one. I'm scared to invest more time and money into it just to fail again.

I feel torn between wanting to prove myself and feeling like maybe driving isn't for me. It's tough when you see others picking it up so easily. I could really use some guidance and support. Thanks for listening. #DrivingStruggles #LearningDisabilities"	1	2	0	0.0012326240539550781	social media

I don’t know."	"Hey there,

It sounds like you're feeling really frustrated and discouraged about your experiences with driving. It's understandable that failing your tests multiple times can be disheartening, but it's important not to be too hard on yourself. Remember that everyone learns at their own pace, and just because it takes you longer doesn't mean you can't achieve your goal.

Discovering that you have an intellectual disability can bring up a lot of emotions, but it's important to remember that having a label doesn't define your worth or intelligence. It's great that you sought out a doctor and psychologist to better understand your situation, and they may be able to provide you with some helpful strategies or resources to improve your memory and concentration.

Taking a break from driving and reassessing your goals can be a good idea if you're feeling overwhelmed. It might be worth considering finding a driving instructor who specializes in teaching individuals with learning disabilities. They may have a different approach or strategies that could better support your learning style.

Ultimately, the decision of whether to continue pursuing your driver's license is up to you. It's okay to feel conflicted and unsure about what to do. It's important to remember that failure is a part of life and doesn't define us. Achieving your goals takes time and perseverance, and it's okay to take breaks and try different approaches along the way.

Remember to be kind to yourself throughout this process. You're doing the best you can, and your worth isn't determined by your ability to drive or any other specific skill. Reach out to your support network for encouragement and guidance, and take things one step at a time.

You've got this!"	1	0	0	0.0008745789527893066	mental health forum

It sounds like you've been facing challenges and setbacks, and it's perfectly understandable to feel discouraged. Discovering that you have an intellectual disability can understandably bring up various emotions, and it's important to remember that having a label does not define your worth or intelligence. 

It might be helpful to explore the impact of your intellectual disability on your driving abilities with a qualified professional, such as a driving rehabilitation specialist. They can assess your specific challenges and suggest strategies or modifications that could enhance your driving skills and overall safety. Additionally, working with a therapist who specializes in cognitive-behavioral therapy could provide support in managing feelings of embarrassment, anxiety, and self-doubt. Therapy can help you develop coping strategies and challenge negative self-perceptions, leading to increased self-confidence.

Remember, everyone learns at their own pace, and setbacks are a natural part of the learning process. It's commendable that you have the desire to keep trying and achieve something meaningful for yourself. Consider discussing your concerns and aspirations with your support system, including your family and instructors, to explore different options and create a supportive environment for your driving endeavors. Keep in mind that progress takes time and that failures do not define your abilities or potential."	1	0	0	0.0006722211837768555	clinician

It can be tough to face challenges and setbacks, especially when it feels like others are progressing faster than you. Remember that everyone learns at their own pace, and it's important not to compare yourself to others.

Discovering that you have an intellectual disability can be overwhelming, but it's crucial to remember that having a label doesn't define your worth or intelligence. It simply means that you have unique strengths and areas where you may need extra support. It's great that you sought out a doctor and are in the process of finding out more about your possible ADHD diagnosis. Understanding your own learning style and any potential cognitive differences can help you develop strategies to manage challenges and build on your strengths.

When it comes to driving, it's normal to make mistakes and have moments of confusion, especially as a learner. It's essential to focus on improving your skills and gaining experience gradually. It might be helpful to discuss your concerns with your driving instructor or consider finding an instructor who specializes in teaching individuals with diverse learning needs. They can provide you with tailored strategies and support to enhance your driving skills.

Remember to be patient and kind to yourself. Celebrate each milestone and improvement along the way, regardless of how small they may seem. It's okay to feel unsure about whether driving is right for you, and it's ultimately your decision. Take your time to reflect on your goals and what will make you feel the most fulfilled and confident. Don't let past failures define your future successes. Keep trying, and remember that setbacks are a normal part of the learning process. You're capable of achieving what you set your mind to."	2	0	0	0.0007467865943908691	forum with demographics

Your psychologist's suggestion of playing memory games to improve concentration and retrieval of information could be worth trying out. It might be helpful to incorporate memory exercises into your daily routine to strengthen your cognitive skills.

If you find yourself zoning out or feeling overwhelmed while driving, it may be helpful to take breaks when needed, practice deep breathing techniques, or consider alternative means of transportation until you feel more confident.

As for your decision on whether to continue pursuing your driver's license, it's ultimately up to you. It's important to assess whether driving is something you genuinely want to do or if it's influenced by external pressures.

This is a throwaway for obvious reasons. English is my second language so forgive me for punctuation.

TW: rape
  

  
I am an Indian boy, less than 18 BTW(don't wanna be specific), I live in Kuwait and my parents aren't wealthy or anything. I have a brother(5 yrs older) When I was a kid I was raped by him IT was 2013-14 I was about 7 back then, I was unaware of what was going on and went along this happened on weekends for a month until I mom came out her room in the afternoon and caught us and interrogated me but I said it's nothing and I was told not to say anything by my brother. That was when he stopped
  

  
Fast forward a couple years it's 2017 he leaves Kuwait and goes to India for studies, we both use to get good grades but even since I was raped my grades dropped and I got insomnia and tons of health issues. He gots good grades in India and then fell into depression and sort of drop out.
  

  
2019-He became a weird person got an attitude I guess and Became self centered and aggressive. We went to India for Vacation and decided that he'd come back and do studies here, in 2020 covid hit I was locked in and I felt uncomfortable for some reason, I developed OCD. I Clean myself alot if I touch his things or anything about him makes me uncomfortable. He was told me teach me maths cause I was struggling but he did nothing and got paid by my parents LMFAO. 2021 may I distant myself from him and my parents didn't like it and told me to interact with him. I told my mom everything in Oct of 2021 and the first thing she did was laugh(probably because I was talking about sexual abuse and shit and we Indians Don't talk about it). I cried, she told me she'd be here for me and to talk to her if i need her ( she did nothing even when I asked for comfort a week later lol wtf). I told her to tell my dad for her as well and she said alright and she also told me that he was raped when he was 12 or something by dad's coworker without dad knowing and during 2019 he told mom and my aunt in Australia (She's important for later).
  

  
My parents said this thing is normal and all siblings do it and I shouldn't worry and then they said ""don't tell anyone"". I told a few trust worthy friends who and really good but I feel myself withdrawal away from everyone. 2022 we went to India and I was gonna tell my uncle in India about it( he helped us alot this year and back in 2019 he's amazing). But I couldn't muster up the courage. 2023 July we go meet him again but only live with him for 3 days as and dad has me take care of my grandfather who is really sick and might not live long. So I couldn't tell him again.
  

  
I come back from India and I hate it here. I have Vacation but my brother doesn't so he goes to collage and I interrogated my mom and got her to confess
  

  
She believes that I was raped but my parents don't want to contact the police because ""90% students and people do it"" and ""we should just forget nothing we can do, police won't help"" She gaslight me and I hate it, feels like she takes Out her anger on me with verbal abuse no swearing or anything. But guess what, this time I recorded everything 6:34 seconds worth of voice recording These monsters don't give one crap about there sons rape or my tears. I left the room and pause the recording saved it, she told me to come back but I didn't saving the recording was top priority. She came to the living room after a minute and said ""what happened to you happened to your brother"" my dad doesn't know my brother was raped.
  

  
I told my dad ages ago I will go to Australia after grade 12th CBSE Board exams and I have about 8 months left. I haven't done anything with the recordings yet but I have backups
  

  
I told my mom me and my brother need to be separated and this entire thing is causing me problems she said "" just forget it's normal"" Once I go to Australia I'm gonna go no contact obviously. Maybe even leak the recordings and let them burn in hell. I'm currently practicing IELTS but when I told my mom that she has to separate us she said "" we can go to India after 12th you and me"" and I said I'm going to Australia and she replied ""i cant come there"" but i didnt care and i said i will.
  

  
Today about 30mins before dinner we had an argument when everyone was home but didnt listen. Basically woke up early and studied for IELTS but she doesnt know what that is and asked will u get full marks in board exam and I basically replied I will get good grades and go to Australia, and she got angry and was like "" dad doesn't have 25 lakhs rupees you will stay""
  

  
And she spoke over me and didn't even shut the fuck up when I spoke over her. I can live with my aunt in Australia she knows my brother was raped

The reason I'm being told to be quiet is probably( or according to my logic) because if everyone found out then there's goes his reputation, Noone will like them, brother will not get a job or marriage, so no grandkids and he won't get my brother's salary for his retirement( that's the reason we were born, to take care of these idiots) and since there's only 2 of us, only I remain to take care of them with is not ideal since 2 is greater than 1 I guess.
  

  
Sorry for the long read I didn't know where to post this. I really need help. Dm me if you want more info thanks for letting me vent. I'll give you and update if I can but this a throwaway once everything's resolved"	"🚨TW: Rape🚨

Hey everyone, I'm reaching out here because I really need some advice and support. English is my second language, so please bear with me on any mistakes.

I'm a boy from India, less than 18 years old, living in Kuwait. Something really difficult happened to me when I was younger and it's been affecting me ever since. My older brother, who's 5 years older, sexually abused me when I was about 7 years old. It went on for about a month until my mom caught us. Back then, I didn't understand what was happening, and my brother told me not to say anything.

Fast forward to now, my grades have dropped, I developed insomnia, and I have had a lot of health issues as a result. My brother had been doing well in his studies, but a few years ago, he started acting strange, became aggressive, and eventually dropped out. It's been really tough for me to be around him ever since.

Recently, I mustered up the courage to tell my mom about what had happened, and unfortunately, her initial reaction wasn't supportive. She laughed it off and didn't take me seriously. I felt really hurt and cried. She promised to be there for me, but she hasn't done anything to help me since. When I asked her to tell my dad, she agreed but didn't follow through.

My parents have been insisting that what happened between me and my brother is normal, and they don't want me to tell anyone. It's been making it hard for me to connect with others, and I've been feeling really isolated. I did confide in a few close friends, who have been supportive, but it's still really tough.

I've been thinking about telling my uncle in India about everything, as he has been supportive in the past. However, I haven't been able to gather the courage to do so. My plan is to go to Australia after finishing my 12th grade exams, since my mom can't come there, and I trust my aunt and her family. They don't know about my current condition, but they would be willing to help me start a new life.

Recently, I had an argument with my mom where she belittled my dreams of going to Australia. She said my dad doesn't have the finances for it, and it really hurt me. I want to believe in my future and escape from this toxic environment.

I've recorded some conversations with my mom where she has gaslighted me and been verbally abusive. It's shocking that my parents don't care about what happened to me or my pain. I haven't done anything with the recordings yet, but I feel like they could be important evidence for my situation.

I'm feeling lost and trapped in this situation. I'm so close to finishing my exams, and I just want to be free from this hellhole. If anyone has any advice or support, please DM me. Thank you for listening to me vent. I'll update you all once I find a resolution. Just know that this is a throwaway account for now."	1	2	0	0.0021001100540161133	social media

TW: rape
  

  
I am an Indian boy, less than 18 BTW(don't wanna be specific), I live in Kuwait and my parents aren't wealthy or anything. I have a brother(5 yrs older) When I was a kid I was raped by him IT was 2013-14 I was about 7 back then, I was unaware of what was going on and went along this happened on weekends for a month until I mom came out her room in the afternoon and caught us and interrogated me but I said it's nothing and I was told not to say anything by my brother. That was when he stopped
  

  
Fast forward a couple years it's 2017 he leaves Kuwait and goes to India for studies, we both use to get good grades but even since I was raped my grades dropped and I got insomnia and tons of health issues. He gots good grades in India and then fell into depression and sort of drop out.
  

  
2019-He became a weird person got an attitude I guess and Became self centered and aggressive. We went to India for Vacation and decided that he'd come back and do studies here, in 2020 covid hit I was locked in and I felt uncomfortable for some reason, I developed OCD. I Clean myself alot if I touch his things or anything about him makes me uncomfortable. He was told me teach me maths cause I was struggling but he did nothing and got paid by my parents LMFAO. 2021 may I distant myself from him and my parents didn't like it and told me to interact with him. I told my mom everything in Oct of 2021 and the first thing she did was laugh(probably because I was talking about sexual abuse and shit and we Indians Don't talk about it). I cried, she told me she'd be here for me and to talk to her if i need her ( she did nothing even when I asked for comfort a week later lol wtf). I told her to tell my dad for her as well and she said alright and she also told me that he was raped when he was 12 or something by dad's coworker without dad knowing and during 2019 he told mom and my aunt in Australia (She's important for later).
  

  
My parents said this thing is normal and all siblings do it and I shouldn't worry and then they said ""don't tell anyone"". I told a few trust worthy friends who and really good but I feel myself withdrawal away from everyone. 2022 we went to India and I was gonna tell my uncle in India about it( he helped us alot this year and back in 2019 he's amazing). But I couldn't muster up the courage. 2023 July we go meet him again but only live with him for 3 days as and dad has me take care of my grandfather who is really sick and might not live long. So I couldn't tell him again.
  

  
I come back from India and I hate it here. I have Vacation but my brother doesn't so he goes to collage and I interrogated my mom and got her to confess
  

  
She believes that I was raped but my parents don't want to contact the police because ""90% students and people do it"" and ""we should just forget nothing we can do, police won't help"" She gaslight me and I hate it, feels like she takes Out her anger on me with verbal abuse no swearing or anything. But guess what, this time I recorded everything 6:34 seconds worth of voice recording These monsters don't give one crap about there sons rape or my tears. I left the room and pause the recording saved it, she told me to come back but I didn't saving the recording was top priority. She came to the living room after a minute and said ""what happened to you happened to your brother"" my dad doesn't know my brother was raped.
  

  
I told my dad ages ago I will go to Australia after grade 12th CBSE Board exams and I have about 8 months left. I haven't done anything with the recordings yet but I have backups
  

  
I told my mom me and my brother need to be separated and this entire thing is causing me problems she said "" just forget it's normal"" Once I go to Australia I'm gonna go no contact obviously. Maybe even leak the recordings and let them burn in hell. I'm currently practicing IELTS but when I told my mom that she has to separate us she said "" we can go to India after 12th you and me"" and I said I'm going to Australia and she replied ""i cant come there"" but i didnt care and i said i will.
  

  
Today about 30mins before dinner we had an argument when everyone was home but didnt listen. Basically woke up early and studied for IELTS but she doesnt know what that is and asked will u get full marks in board exam and I basically replied I will get good grades and go to Australia, and she got angry and was like "" dad doesn't have 25 lakhs rupees you will stay""
  

  
And she spoke over me and didn't even shut the fuck up when I spoke over her. I can live with my aunt in Australia she knows my brother was raped
  
But doesn't know about my condition and she asks about my future after 12th( she will happily accept me in Australia and I trust her family they are cool like my uncle in india).

It takes a lot of courage to reach out for help, and I'm glad you've shared your story here. It's important to remember that you are not alone, and there are people who can support you through this.

Firstly, I want to acknowledge the impact that the abuse you experienced has had on your mental health. It's understandable that you are struggling with insomnia, grades, and other health issues as a result. It's important to prioritize your healing and well-being.

Given the seriousness of the situation, it's crucial to seek professional help. I would strongly encourage you to reach out to a mental health professional who specializes in trauma and abuse. They can provide you with the guidance, support, and resources you need to navigate this difficult time. They will also be able to advise you on how to involve appropriate authorities, such as the police or child protective services, to address the situation.

Additionally, confiding in a trustworthy adult or family member can provide you with emotional support. You mentioned your aunt in Australia, who seems like a supportive figure. Consider opening up to her about what you've been going through, as she may be able to offer guidance and support.

It's understandable that you're feeling frustrated, hurt, and angry about your parents' response. However, leaking recordings or taking actions without seeking professional guidance can have unintended consequences. It's important to remember that justice and healing can be pursued through legal channels, and professionals can help navigate that process.

Lastly, take care of yourself during this challenging time. Engaging in self-care activities, such as exercise, pursuing hobbies, connecting with friends who are understanding and supportive, or seeking solace in creative outlets, can help with your emotional well-being.

Remember, you have the right to seek help, to be heard, and to heal from what you've experienced. Please reach out to professionals who can provide the support you need."	2	0	0	0.0007131695747375488	mental health forum

First and foremost, please know that what you have experienced is not your fault, and you deserve support and justice. It's important to prioritize your own well-being and safety.

Given the severity of the situation, it's crucial to involve authorities who can investigate and protect you. While I cannot take direct action, I would strongly encourage you to seek help from local resources such as child protective services, law enforcement, or a trusted adult who can help you navigate this process. They are trained to handle cases of abuse and can provide the necessary support and resources.

Additionally, it could be beneficial to confide in a mental health professional who can provide guidance and support as you navigate this challenging situation. They can help you process your emotions, develop coping strategies, and provide a safe space for you to express your thoughts and feelings.

Remember that you don't have to face this alone, and there are people out there who can support you. Reach out to helplines or organizations that specialize in supporting survivors of sexual abuse or trauma. They can provide guidance, resources, and assistance in finding the help you need.

It sounds like you've been carrying a heavy burden for a long time, and it's understandable that you're feeling overwhelmed. It's important to remember that you're not alone and that help is available to you.

Firstly, I want to acknowledge your strength in speaking out about your experiences. Sharing your story takes courage, and it's an important step towards healing. It's unfortunate that your parents haven't responded to your disclosure in a supportive way, but please know that their reactions do not define your worth or the validity of your experience.

Considering the situation you're in, it may be helpful for you to seek professional support from a therapist or counselor who specializes in trauma and abuse. They can provide you with a safe and non-judgmental space to explore your feelings, develop coping strategies, and work towards healing. Additionally, they can offer guidance on how to navigate the legal aspects of your situation and help you consider your options moving forward.

It's also important to have a support network outside of your immediate family. Sharing your story with trusted friends can provide emotional support and a sense of validation. If you haven't already, reach out to those friends who have been supportive and let them know what you're going through. They may be able to offer additional guidance or resources.

Lastly, if you feel that your safety is at immediate risk, it's important to reach out to a local authority or helpline in your area. They can provide guidance on how to ensure your safety and connect you with the appropriate support services.

Remember, you have the right to seek help and support. You don't have to face this alone. Take care of yourself and prioritize your well-being."	2	0	0	0.0006934404373168945	forum with demographics

I'm currently practicing IELTS but when I told my mom that she has to separate us she said "" we can go to India after 12th you and me"" and I said I'm going to Australia and she replied ""i cant come there"" but i didnt care and i said i will.
  

  
Today about 30mins before dinner we had an argument when everyone was home but didnt listen. Basically woke up early and studied for IELTS but she doesnt know what that is and asked will u get full marks in board exam and I basically replied I will get good grades and go to Australia, and she got angry and was like "" dad doesn't have 25 lakhs rupees you will stay""
  

  
And she spoke over me and didn't even shut the fuck up when I spoke over her. I can live with my aunt in Australia she knows my brother was raped
  
But doesn't know about my condition and she asks about my future after 12th( she will happily accept me in Australia and I trust her family they are cool like my uncle in india). I was thinking about sending the recording to my uncle in India tomorrow morning but I've been saying that for like 2 weeks. Idk what to do, will I even be out of this hell hole by next year. When I ask my dad about going to Australia he says "" there is no need to write an exam and we'll see later"" and just funking nods his head.
  

  
The reason I'm being told to be quiet is probably( or according to my logic) because if everyone found out then there's goes his reputation, Noone will like them, brother will not get a job or marriage, so no grandkids and he won't get my brother's salary for his retirement( that's the reason we were born, to take care of these idiots) and since there's only 2 of us, only I remain to take care of them with is not ideal since 2 is greater than 1 I guess.
  

  
Sorry for the long read I didn't know where to post this. I really need help. Dm me if you want more info thanks for letting me vent. I'll give you and update if I can but this a throwaway once everything's resolved"	"I'm really sorry to hear about your experiences and the difficult situation you're in.

It's been a couple of years since I worked the job but it causing me some issues now in my personal life. I worked with the Nova Scotia medical examiners office in Canada for almost 2 years. With a company that was contracted to do dead body removals. I randomly and other times it's triggered by food ( like hamburger being made in a factory)  or something graphic on the TV. But I've become distant from fishing whish is a passion of mine, family members, friends, work, and now it's caused my engagement to be called off. And my girl and I are taking an extended break until I'm able to speak to someone and get my emotions in order. She's been wanting me to speak to someone for years and ignored her pleas thinking I was strong enough and that this couldn't possibly happen to me. Sometimes it is completely ramdom other times when I drive past an area where I picked up a dead body I snap to that moment and I can see everything plain as day. I can still smell the things I smelt. See the things I seen and even feel the fucked up things I felt. Idk if I'm making this post to vent or to ask for help or what but here it is anyways.	"Hey everyone, I hope you're doing well. I wanted to share something that's been weighing on me lately. A few years ago, I worked a job at the Nova Scotia medical examiner's office in Canada, where I was involved in dead body removals. It was a tough gig, and now I'm facing some unexpected challenges in my personal life because of it.

Lately, I've been having these random triggers - it could be the smell of food being made at a factory or something graphic on TV - and it sets off intense memories and emotions. It's affecting my relationships too, as I've become distant from my loved ones, friends, and even my passion for fishing. Unfortunately, it has taken a toll on my engagement, and my partner and I have decided to take a break until I can work through these emotions.

I now realize I should have listened to her years ago when she encouraged me to seek help. I thought I was strong enough to handle it, that it wouldn't affect me like this. But here I am, struggling with vivid flashbacks, reliving everything I experienced - the sights, smells, and even the messed up feelings.

I'm not sure why I'm writing this post, maybe it's just a way to vent or maybe I'm finally ready to ask for help. I know many of you here have dealt with tough times, so any words of support or advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks for listening. #SeekingHelp #DealingWithThePast"	1	2	0	0.000810086727142334	social media

"I'm really sorry to hear that you've been going through such a difficult time. It takes a lot of courage to reach out and express your struggles, so thank you for sharing your story with us.

It seems like your experiences at work have had a significant impact on your mental and emotional well-being. It's understandable that these traumatic memories and triggers are affecting various aspects of your life, including your relationships and hobbies. It's great to hear that you're taking the step to speak with someone about your emotions.

When you've experienced trauma, it's common for symptoms such as flashbacks, intrusive thoughts, and emotional disconnect to arise. Talking to a mental health professional, such as a therapist or counselor, can provide you with a safe space to process these experiences, learn coping strategies, and work towards healing.

Remember, seeking help doesn't mean you're weak. In fact, it shows great strength and self-awareness to acknowledge when professional support is needed. Your loved ones, like your girlfriend, care about you and want to see you find healing and happiness.

In the meantime, you might find it helpful to engage in self-care activities that bring you comfort and relaxation. This could include activities like mindfulness exercises, deep breathing techniques, or engaging in a hobby that you still enjoy.

Please know that you are not alone, and there are people out there who can offer support and understanding. Don't hesitate to reach out to a mental health professional, who can guide you on your journey towards healing and finding balance in your life."	2	0	0	0.0006140470504760742	mental health forum

"I appreciate you reaching out and sharing your experience. It takes courage to open up about difficult emotions and experiences. It sounds like you have been dealing with distressing memories and triggers from your previous job, and it has started to impact various aspects of your life.

It is important to acknowledge that anyone, regardless of their strength or previous experiences, can be affected by traumatic events. Your decision to seek help is a significant step towards healing and regaining control over your emotions. Speaking to a mental health professional can provide you with the support and strategies you need to process these images, sensations, and emotions in a healthy way.

Trauma-focused therapy, such as Cognitive Processing Therapy or Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR), might be beneficial in helping you work through your experiences. These therapies can assist in reprocessing your memories, reducing the intensity of your reactions, and helping you develop coping skills to manage triggers.

Remember, seeking help is not a sign of weakness but a courageous act of self-care. By prioritizing your mental health, you can begin to reclaim your passion for fishing, rebuild relationships, and move forward in a healthier way. Reach out to a mental health professional who specializes in trauma to discuss your concerns and explore the available options for treatment.

Take care and know that there is support available for you on your journey towards healing."	1	0	0	0.0006126165390014648	clinician

"I'm so sorry to hear that you're feeling demoralized and frustrated by the negative stereotypes and backlash surrounding interracial dating. It can be incredibly hurtful and disheartening to constantly face these challenges. You're not alone in experiencing this trend, and it's important to reach out for support.

Remember that your feelings are valid, and it's essential to prioritize your mental well-being during these tough times. Firstly, consider taking breaks from platforms or communities where you encounter such negative content. It's crucial to protect yourself from harmful influences and surround yourself with positivity.

Additionally, connecting with like-minded individuals who understand and share your experiences can be helpful. Seek out supportive communities or groups that celebrate diversity and provide a safe space for open discussions. Engaging with people who share your values and experiences can be a great source of comfort and empowerment.

Lastly, remember the importance of self-care. Take time to engage in activities that bring you joy, relaxation, and a sense of peace. Practicing self-care can help you regain a sense of control and boost your overall well-being.

Please know that you deserve love, acceptance, and respect, regardless of your racial background or dating choices. Hang in there, and continue to prioritize your mental health.

I'm sorry to hear that you're feeling demoralized by the negative experiences and stereotypes you're encountering. It's not uncommon for external factors and societal pressures to affect our mental well-being. Remember, it's okay to feel upset or overwhelmed by these situations. It can be helpful to acknowledge and process your emotions. If you find that the content you're exposed to is repeatedly bothering you, consider adjusting your social media settings or limiting your exposure to certain platforms. Additionally, engaging with supportive communities and building a network of like-minded individuals can be comforting. If you're finding it difficult to cope or if these feelings persist, seeking support from a mental health professional might also prove beneficial in navigating these challenges.

"I'm so sorry to hear that you're feeling demoralized and overwhelmed by the negative experiences you've been going through. It can be incredibly frustrating and disheartening when we constantly face stereotypes and unfair treatment. You're definitely not alone in feeling this way, as many individuals have shared similar experiences.

One strategy that might help is to actively curate your online environment by following more positive and inclusive communities and voices that uplift and celebrate Black women. This can help create a safer and more empowering virtual space that counters the negativity you've been encountering. Additionally, surrounding yourself with supportive friends and loved ones who appreciate and value you for who you are can also make a significant difference in combating these negative feelings.

Engaging in self-care practices, whether it's through hobbies, exercise, mindfulness, or any other activities that bring you joy and inner peace, can also be helpful in managing the emotional impact of these experiences. Taking care of yourself and prioritizing your mental well-being is essential.

Remember that your worth and value as an individual cannot and should not be defined by the stereotypes and prejudices of others. You deserve to be treated with respect, dignity, and equality. Hold on to your love and pride for yourself and those who uplift you. Keep having conversations and sharing your experiences with others who understand and support you, as this can lead to more awareness and change.

If you feel overwhelmed or need additional support, it might be beneficial to seek professional help from a therapist or counselor who specializes in dealing with racial and identity-related concerns. They can provide you with specific strategies and guidance tailored to your unique situation.

Firstly, I want you to know that you're not alone in feeling demoralized by the negative experiences and stereotypes that can surround race, age, and gender. It's unfortunately common to face such challenges, and they can definitely take a toll on our mental well-being.

The constant reminders of being the lowest earners in the US and the ridicule surrounding interracial dating can create a sense of unease and frustration. These negative stereotypes can impact our self-esteem and make us question our choices and preferences.

While it's great that you've been trying to block such content, it can be tough when it keeps reappearing. It's important to remember that we can't control what others say or do, but we can control how we respond to it.

One suggestion is to be mindful of the media you consume and the communities you engage in. Surrounding yourself with positive and empowering content, or connecting with like-minded individuals who uplift and support one another, can help counterbalance the negative messages.

Taking care of your mental health is crucial in situations like these. It might be beneficial to explore mental health resources specifically focused on the challenges faced by Black women. Online forums, support groups, or even therapy sessions could provide you with a safe space to express your feelings, gain support, and learn coping strategies.

Remember, self-care is essential. Engage in activities that bring you joy and help you relax. It's also helpful to seek validation and support from friends, family, or communities who understand and empathize with your experiences.

Keep pushing through, and don't hesitate to reach out for support. You deserve to be surrounded by positivity and respect. Stay strong!"	1	0	0	0.0010999441146850586	forum w/o demographics
"I am a straight, cis-gendered male born in 1979, and raised in the northeastern USA by a pair of liberal Christian hippies. My mother is a former nun and my father almost became a monk. Being gentle, kind, and not at all domineering was very much normalized in my home and my parents' social circle growing up. No one knew this at the time, but I'm on the autism spectrum, so I took these principles very much at face value, and very much to their logical extent, because I don't read people well, and it was all I had.

I was bullied relentlessly throughout my school years, and it took a major toll on my self-esteem. But my parents were loving, accepting, and comforting to a fault, which, combined with their religious and political beliefs, led me to put all my hope and trust in the possibility that the world was slowly but surely becoming the place they were working to build. This faith got me through some very dark and painful times in my youth.

I used to doubt my parents' religious beliefs, and supernatural belief in general, but I never had it in me to doubt the more worldly beliefs my parents taught me. I chose to become a physician, because I wanting nothing more than to help people and help heal the world, and make a living doing something positive, rather than finding cunning ways of separating people from their money. Medical residency was the most socially painful experience I lived through. Even though I love the science of the human body, love helping people and reducing pain, and love learning and intellectual things, I never anticipated that this field would select almost entirely for competitive, obedient, and power-driven people. No one in the medical field related to me, and those that might have, were running for the exit of this profession by the time I met them.

I approach everyone as an equal. All it takes for me to accept someone and give them a chance, is that they be kind and interesting. I do not want to dominate anyone, and I do not want to be dominated be anyone. I didn't think this was a complicated or unreasonable social contract to proffer, but apparently it is. I've resigned myself to being a pretty asocial person outside of my work and my immediate family, because I've found through hard experience that to most people, especially other men, my lack of desire to dominate anyone, is by default an open invitation to dominate me.

I don't mean to belittle the experience of rape survivors. Nor do I mean to suggest that I relate to rape survivors, because I couldn't possibly. But every now and then I hear stories of [usually female] rape survivors, who feel inexplicably driven to put themselves in positions where they attract the attention of horny men, and then get some perverse (but at some level understandable) satisfaction out of rejecting them, when they dare to make a move on them in response. I've been known to do the same thing, but with power, instead of sex. I'll put myself in social situations with men, and sincerely (self-righteously, even) meet them with the expectation that they'll engage me as equals, without asserting dominance or presenting a front of ""don't mess with me"", because I feel I shouldn't have to. Then I'll get all worked up with righteous indignation and tell them off, when they take the liberty of asserting dominance over me, and expecting me to follow their lead without any reciprocity.

I'm not an incel by any means; I'm happily married and sexually active with my wife, and am raising three kids. But I sure could use some more guy friends. And I sure could use some reassurance that my finding a woman who found me attractive was not some highly unlikely miracle. When I signed up for a dating site called TheNerve.com in 2001, I was flummoxed by the fact that nearly every straight woman with a profile on the site checked ""power"" as a turn-on. Raised in an Irish Catholic family, I had two rather awkward conversations with extended family members in my adolescence, where they asked me whether I'd considered ""the religious life"". (Um... no.)

When I'm honest and articulate about what I just wrote, I tend to get a reaction midway between ""You're a beautiful person, never change"" and ""Please stop, I'm cringing hard."" Often followed by a distinct desire to distance themselves from me, because they can't decide which of these two sentiments they feel more strongly.

Be honest with me. Because I feel this as frankly existential. Have I spent my life in complete and utter denial and rejection of a basic fact of human nature, because I took the principles I was raised with at far greater face value than even the people who taught them to me?? Or have I just not found my people? Either way, what would you recommend I do, lifestyle-wise, to ensure my future mental health and social connectivity, and have the effect on the world I want to have?

Oh, and what venues of social interaction would you recommend to me, to find people (especially other men), who relate to my experience and my response to it, rather than cringe or deem me strange and maladjusted?"	"Hey there! It sounds like you've had quite a journey and are looking for some advice and support. First off, it's important to acknowledge and appreciate the values your parents instilled in you. It's great that you approach everyone as equals and seek kindness and interesting connections. Remember, you're not alone in feeling a bit disconnected from certain social norms.

Finding like-minded people can sometimes be a challenge, but there are definitely communities out there who share your experiences and perspectives. One suggestion might be to explore local support groups or meetups where you can connect with individuals who understand and appreciate your approach to social interactions. Online forums and groups can also be great resources to meet and engage with people who share similar interests and values.

In terms of mental health and social connectivity, consider prioritizing self-care and finding activities that bring you joy and fulfillment. Engage in hobbies or join clubs where you can pursue your interests and meet new people along the way. Taking care of your mental well-being is crucial, so exploring mindfulness practices or therapy can also be beneficial.

Remember, it's not about changing who you are but finding spaces and communities where you can truly be yourself and connect with others who appreciate your way of engaging with the world. Keep seeking out experiences that align with your values and don't hesitate to reach out for support when needed. You've got this!"	1	0	0	0.0006288886070251465	social media

"Hey there, thank you for reaching out and sharing your story. It takes a lot of courage to be vulnerable and open up about your experiences. I can see that you've had quite a journey, facing challenges and trying to find your place in the world.

Firstly, I want to assure you that there is nothing wrong with the principles you were raised with or the values you hold. Being gentle, kind, and not desiring to dominate others are admirable qualities. It is unfortunate that the world can sometimes be harsh and competitive, making it difficult to find like-minded individuals. But please remember, you are not alone in feeling this way.

It sounds like you have faced some difficulties in your profession and have struggled to find meaningful connections with others, particularly men. Finding friends who truly understand and relate to your experiences can take time, but they do exist. Patience is key.

In terms of maintaining your mental health and social connectivity, it might be helpful to engage in activities that align with your interests and allow you to meet new people. Consider joining clubs, groups, or organizations where you can connect with individuals who share similar passions or hobbies. Online communities and forums focused on mental health, autism, or other specific interests could also provide a platform to connect with people who may have similar experiences.

Lastly, it's important to remember that your worth is not determined by others' reactions to you. We all have unique experiences, perspectives, and ways of interacting with the world. Embrace who you are, and look for individuals who appreciate and value you for being yourself.

Keep searching for your tribe, and try to remain open-minded and patient. The right people will come into your life eventually. Take care of yourself and continue to pursue your dreams of making a positive impact on the world. You are stronger than you may realize."	1	0	0	0.0006865262985229492	mental health forum

But my parents were loving, accepting, and comforting to a fault, which, combined with their religious and political beliefs, led me to put all my hope and trust in the possibility that the world was slowly but surely becoming the place they were working to build. This faith got me through some very dark and painful times in my youth.

I used to doubt my parents' religious beliefs, and supernatural belief in general, but I never had it in me to doubt the more worldly beliefs my parents taught me.

I don't mean to belittle the experience of rape survivors. Nor do I mean to suggest that I relate to rape survivors, because I couldn't possibly. But every now and then I hear stories of [usually female] rape survivors, who feel inexplicably driven to put themselves in positions where they attract the attention of horny men, and then get some perverse (but at some level understandable) satisfaction out of rejecting them, when they dare to make a move on them in response. I've been known to do the same thing, but with power, instead of sex. I'll put myself in social situations with men, and sincerely (self-righteously, even) meet them with the expectation that they'll engage me as equals, without asserting dominance or presenting a front of ""don't mess with me"", because I feel I shouldn't have to.

Firstly, I want to commend you for sharing your story and being so open about your experiences. It takes a great deal of strength to reach out, and I'm glad you've taken this step. It's common for our past experiences and upbringing to shape our beliefs and expectations about the world. As someone on the autism spectrum, it is understandable that you took your parents' principles at face value, as deciphering social cues can be challenging. 

Your experiences of being bullied and feeling that your approach of equality and non-domination is not reciprocated can be disheartening. It's important to remember that not everyone shares the same values or approaches to social interactions. However, this does not mean you have been in complete denial or rejection of human nature. It simply means that your experiences have been different, and finding like-minded individuals who appreciate your perspective can be a journey in itself.

To ensure your future mental health and social connectivity, it may be helpful to engage in activities or situations where you are more likely to find individuals who relate to your experience and response. Consider exploring interest-based groups or communities, such as hobby clubs, social advocacy organizations, or online forums focused on topics you are passionate about. These venues can provide opportunities for meaningful connections with people who share common interests and values. Additionally, seeking therapy or counseling can help navigate these challenges, provide support, and offer strategies for building social connections.

Remember, it's essential to give yourself time and compassion during this process. You are seeking connection and understanding, and by being open to new experiences and perspectives, you increase the likelihood of finding your people. Stay true to yourself, and don't be discouraged by reactions that may not align with your expectations. Your unique perspective and values have the potential to make a positive impact on the world, and don't hesitate to reach out for professional support when needed.

Wishing you all the best on your journey towards mental health and social connectivity.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]

Hello fellow forum members,

I've been reflecting on my life and it's been a challenging journey, but I'm here seeking some advice and connection with others who might relate. Bear with me as I share my story. I was raised in a compassionate and accepting environment by liberal Christian parents who emphasized the values of kindness, gentleness, and non-domination. Being on the autism spectrum, these principles made a lot of sense to me and became an integral part of how I approached the world.

However, my school years were marred by relentless bullying which took a toll on my self-esteem. Despite that, my parents' unconditional love and support, coupled with their vision of a better world, helped me navigate through those dark times. Initially, I questioned my parents' religious beliefs but found solace in the worldly values they taught me.

Driven by the desire to make a positive impact and help others, I pursued a career in medicine. Nevertheless, I found that the medical field seemed to attract competitive, power-driven individuals, which made it socially isolating for someone like me who believes in equality and rejects dominance. It became apparent that most people did not relate to my approach, and even those who might have shared similar values were leaving the profession.

Outside of my work and immediate family life, I have embraced a more asocial lifestyle due to my experiences. It appears that for many people, especially other men, my lack of desire for dominance is seen as an invitation to exert power over me. I want to emphasize that I do not intend to equate my experiences with those of rape survivors, but I sometimes find myself unknowingly seeking out situations where I engage with others, only to respond with indignation when they assert dominance over me.

Despite being happily married and having a fulfilling family life, I find myself longing for more male friendships and a reassurance that finding a woman who is genuinely attracted to me is not a miracle. It was disconcerting when I joined a dating site in the past and discovered that many women listed ""power"" as a turn-on. I've also faced uncomfortable conversations with family members suggesting I consider a religious path.

When I honestly articulate my experiences and feelings, I'm met with mixed responses ranging from admiration to discomfort. This leads people to distance themselves from me, leaving me unsure if I have been in denial about an aspect of human nature or if I simply haven't found my tribe. In light of this, I kindly request recommendations regarding my lifestyle choices to ensure my mental well-being, social connectivity, and ability to make the positive impact on the world that I desire.

Lastly, to those who can relate to my experiences and response, I appreciate any suggestions on social venues or platforms where I can find like-minded individuals, particularly men, who might share my perspective. These connections would provide valuable support and understanding.

Thank you for taking the time to read my post. Your honest advice and insights will be greatly appreciated.

Warm regards,

Thank you for sharing your story with us. It's evident that you've faced various challenges throughout your life and are looking to find a sense of social connectivity and support. Although I can't provide the exact help you may be seeking, I can offer some suggestions and recommendations for improving your mental health and finding like-minded individuals.

Firstly, it's important to acknowledge that your experiences have shaped your unique perspective on the world. It seems that your upbringing, coupled with being on the autism spectrum, has influenced your desire for equality and lack of interest in dominance. These qualities are to be celebrated, as they are a testament to your values and character.

To enhance your mental well-being and social connectivity, consider exploring different avenues of self-care and connection. Therapy or counseling can offer a safe space for you to discuss your thoughts, emotions, and concerns with a professional who can guide you through your journey. They can help you navigate social situations and provide tailored support based on your specific needs.

Engaging in activities that align with your interests can also be an effective way to meet like-minded individuals. Consider joining community groups, hobby clubs, or volunteering organizations where you can connect with people who share your values or have similar experiences. This can provide an opportunity to build genuine connections and establish meaningful friendships.

Additionally, online communities and forums, specifically focused on autism or mental health, might be worth exploring. These platforms often offer a supportive environment and allow for connections with individuals who can relate to your experiences. Finding a community where you feel understood and accepted can have a positive impact on your mental health and overall well-being.

Remember, it's important to be patient with yourself and to avoid self-blame for the challenges you've faced. Each person's journey is unique, and finding your place in the world takes time. Stay true to your values and continue seeking out social opportunities that resonate with you.

Take care of yourself, and I hope you find the social connections you desire while making a positive impact on the world.

Best wishes,

It's understandable that with so much on your plate, you're feeling burnt out. Remember, you're not alone in feeling this way. Many people go through periods of low motivation and exhaustion.

It's great that you have an angelic daughter and find support in working out. However, it seems like the current circumstances are taking a toll on your mental wellbeing. It's important to prioritize self-care and seek outlets to recharge, even if it feels difficult at the moment.

Have you considered seeking professional help? A therapist or counselor can provide a safe space for you to express your thoughts and emotions without burdening your wife. They may also guide you in managing stress and help you explore potential ways to upskill yourself and navigate your financial concerns.

Additionally, it might be helpful to have an open and honest conversation with your wife about the challenges you're facing. Tackling these issues as a team can make them feel less overwhelming. While it's understandable that she may also be struggling with her own mental health, finding ways to support each other could strengthen your bond and together find solutions.

Remember, it's crucial to take care of yourself first before being able to fully support others. Prioritize your mental health and try to explore small steps towards regaining control over your situation. It may not happen overnight, but gradual progress is still progress.

As for feeling financially dependent, consider seeking financial advice or looking into resources that could help you better manage your financial situation. Exploring your options and creating a plan for the future might alleviate some of the fear you're experiencing.

Take things one step at a time, and remember that your feelings are valid. You're not alone in this journey, and reaching out for support is a positive step forward."	2	0	0	0.0006963014602661133	mental health forum

Taking care of your mental health is important, so it might be helpful to find some ways to cope with stress and prioritize self-care. For example, setting aside time for activities you enjoy, like cycling, can be beneficial. If you're finding it difficult to motivate yourself to do those things, it could be a symptom of depression. Consider reaching out to a mental health professional who can provide guidance and support.

It's also important to communicate with your wife about the challenges you're facing. Open and honest conversations can help strengthen your relationship and allow both of you to support one another. Encourage her to seek help for her own mental health as well.

Regarding your concerns about your skills becoming outdated and the financial pressures you're facing, it might be helpful to explore resources for professional development and education. Consider speaking with a career counselor or researching opportunities for upskilling. Financial planning can also help alleviate some of the anxieties you have about supporting your family and meeting expenses. Consulting with a financial advisor or exploring budgeting strategies may be beneficial.

Remember, seeking support is a sign of strength, and there are resources available to help you navigate these challenges."	2	0	0	0.0006707906723022461	clinician

I also do not have any savings whatsoever and the thought of not being financially independent is scary AF.


TOO many demons to run away from, not enough places to run."	"I'm really sorry to hear that you're feeling down and overwhelmed with everything that's going on in your life right now. It sounds like you have a lot on your plate and it's understandable that you're feeling burnt out.

It's great that you have a workout routine and a supportive daughter, they can definitely provide some comfort and stability. However, it's important to remember that even with these supports, it's okay to feel overwhelmed and not feel like doing anything. Sometimes our mental health takes a toll on us and it's important to acknowledge and address those emotions.

It's understandable that the pressure of being the sole provider financially can add a lot of stress. It sounds like your wife's mental health also plays a role in the support she's able to offer. It might be a good idea to have a calm and open conversation with her about your concerns, making sure to approach the topic with empathy and understanding. Maybe you both can find ways to support each other during this difficult time, such as seeking therapy or counseling.

Regarding your outdated skills, it's completely normal to feel anxious or overwhelmed by the thought of being left behind in your field. However, it's important to remember that it's never too late to learn and adapt. There are many resources available online, including free courses, tutorials, and even forums where you can connect with others in your industry. Taking small steps to upskill yourself can make a big difference in your self-confidence and future job opportunities.

Feeling the desire to run away and explore the world is also understandable when life becomes overwhelming. However, it's important to prioritize your responsibilities and take care of your family's needs first. Perhaps you can set aside some time for yourself, even if it's just a few hours a week, to do something that brings you joy or helps you relax. This can be a form of self-care that can make a big difference in your overall well-being.

It's also important to consider seeking support from other sources, such as friends, extended family, or even community resources. They may be able to offer assistance or advice on how to manage your financial and family responsibilities more effectively.

Lastly, the fear of not being financially independent can be very scary. It might be helpful to create a budget and explore ways to save money, even if it's just small amounts. This can give you a sense of control and security over your financial situation. Additionally, considering your parents' financial dependence, it might be worth looking into any available support systems or resources that can potentially assist them, so that you can balance your responsibilities more effectively.

Remember, you are not alone in facing these challenges, and seeking support and guidance from others can make a big difference. Take it one step at a time and be gentle with yourself during this difficult period."	2	0	0	0.0007480978965759277	forum with demographics
"I'm not sure how to put this across... I'm feeling really down about everything.. Don't feel like doing ANYTHING.. 

I do workout (I cycle but haven't been going out on rides since the last 7-10 days since I don't feel like it at all) and have an angel of a daughter who's two years old.
However, in spite of these two lovely supports I'm just feeling burnt out, I think..

I have a wife who's supportive on and off depending on her own mental health status.. Financially though, I'm the lone ranger and it just creates a lot of pressure on me..

I can't speak about it with my wife since she ends up feeling guilty about it but doesn't do anything to help - she herself is low on confidence and feels like she cannot land any job with her current skills.

My skills are getting outdated too (Indian IT employee here) but I'm just not up for upskilling myself and the thought of becoming irrelevant kills me.

TOO many demons to run away from, not enough places to run."	"Hey there, I'm sorry to hear that you're feeling this way. It sounds like you have a lot on your plate and the pressure is really getting to you. It's tough when you feel like you have to be the sole provider for your family, and I can understand how that would be overwhelming.

It's important to remember that taking care of yourself is just as important as taking care of others. You mentioned that you enjoy cycling, but lately, you haven't had the motivation to go out on rides. Exercise can be a great way to improve your mood and give you a break from all the stress. Maybe start small and try to incorporate some physical activity into your daily routine, even if it's just for a few minutes.

As for your skills, feeling like they are getting outdated and fearing irrelevance is a common concern, especially in the ever-changing IT field. However, it's never too late to learn and upskill yourself. Consider looking into online courses or workshops that can help you update your skills and stay competitive in your industry. Taking this step towards personal and professional growth might also help boost your confidence.

It's understandable that the financial pressure is causing you a lot of distress. It might be helpful to sit down and have an open conversation with your wife about your financial situation and the challenges you both are facing. Together, you can brainstorm ideas on how to address these issues and support each other. Additionally, there may be resources available in your community that can provide assistance or guidance when it comes to budgeting or financial planning.

Lastly, it's important to remember that it's okay to seek help. You don't have to face all these challenges alone. Consider reaching out to a therapist or counselor who can provide you with the support and guidance you need to navigate through these difficult times. They can help you develop coping strategies, manage stress, and find healthy ways to prioritize your own well-being while still fulfilling your responsibilities.

Remember, you're not alone, and there are people who care and want to support you. Hang in there and take it one step at a time."	2	0	0	0.0007494091987609863	forum w/o demographics
"While desperately looking for that chic ethnic FIT I can slay in for Diwali, I came across this awesome sleeveless Kurti which was perfect...but it was sleeveless that means SHAVING! 
God, why! But wait why do we HAVE to shave if we hate it so much. Let's be honest making ourselves go through hot wax and exorcist level yanking or bleeding to death while shaving is like self-torture just to look good (in the eyes of society). If it is that painful why do we make ourselves go through it? 

Did you see the movie Khiladi? The one where Akshay Kumar was seen flaunting his body hair. Wouldn't it be amazing if we saw women flaunting theirs too? 

Have you seen animals shave their body hair? There's a reason why we have body hair. It keeps mammals warm. It protects the body against trauma and also against ultraviolet damage. In human beings, specialized hairs such as eyelashes and hairs inside the nostrils and external ears afford some protection from the environment. Eyebrows prevent sweat from getting into the eyes. Scalp hairs may assist in stabilizing the temperature of the brain. Hairs can also excrete toxic substances like arsenic, and are thus of use in forensic medicines. As every dermatologist knows, the physiological functions of hairs are immeasurable.

We all go through puberty. Hairy or otherwise it's one's choice to either keep the hair on our body or not. Society or your friends can't shame you for your body hair. There is a reason why we were born with the same. It protects us from so many unimaginable things. Imagine not having eyelashes or nostril hair, then how will you survive the dust that affects your body? All I want to say is let's continue to break the barriers and show that beauty is diverse and you don't have to be a certain stereotype to be beautiful. 

When you look at the world, the world isn't just one palette. It's a rainbow. So, say goodbye to your inner critic and take a pledge to be kinder to yourself and others too.

-Debapriya, intern at u/just_lemmebe1"	"💫 Hey everyone! ✨ I stumbled upon something interesting while searching for the perfect Diwali outfit. I found this amazing sleeveless Kurti that I absolutely loved, but it got me thinking... Do we really have to shave if we dread it so much? 🤔 

Let's be honest, waxing and shaving can be super painful! 🙈 We put ourselves through that torture just to fit society's beauty standards, right? But hey, have you seen the movie Khiladi? Remember how Akshay Kumar rocked his body hair? 💪 Why shouldn't women embrace theirs too?

Animals don't shave, and there's a good reason why we have body hair. It keeps us warm, protects us from harm, and even excretes toxins. Pretty amazing, right? 😲

We all go through puberty, and it's up to us to decide whether we want to keep our body hair or not. Society shouldn't shame us for something so natural. 🚫 Let's break those barriers and celebrate diverse beauty! 🌈

Next time you criticize yourself or others, remember that the world isn't just one color but a beautiful and vibrant rainbow. 🌈 So let's be kinder to ourselves and others. 💕

I completely understand your frustration about the pressure to shave and conform to societal beauty standards. It's important to remember that beauty is diverse and subjective, and we all have the right to define what makes us feel beautiful.

It's great that you brought up the movie Khiladi, where Akshay Kumar proudly flaunted his body hair. It's true that it would be amazing to see women embracing their natural body hair too, without feeling the need to conform to unrealistic expectations.

You mentioned the reasons why our bodies have hair, and it's interesting to note the different functions it serves, such as protection from trauma, temperature regulation, and even excreting toxic substances. Our body hair exists for a purpose, and it's important to respect and honor that.

Ultimately, the decision to keep or remove body hair is a personal choice, and nobody should shame you for either. You have the right to feel comfortable and confident in your own skin, regardless of societal pressures.

Breaking the barriers and challenging stereotypes is a powerful way to promote diversity and acceptance. Let's embrace the rainbow of beauty and encourage others to do the same. Remember to be kind to yourself and others, and let go of that inner critic. You are beautiful just the way you are.

-Debapriya, intern at u/just_lemmebe1"	"Hello u/just_lemmebe1,

Thank you for sharing your thoughts and concerns about societal expectations and body hair. It's important to remember that personal choices about grooming and appearance are just that – personal. You raise great points about the functional purposes of body hair and the diversity of beauty.

Society often imposes certain beauty standards that can make individuals feel pressured to conform. It's crucial to challenge these standards and promote self-acceptance and self-love. Embracing our uniqueness and celebrating diversity fosters a more inclusive and accepting society.

Remember, your body is yours to make choices about. Ultimately, how you choose to groom yourself should be based on your own preferences and comfort. It's perfectly okay to deviate from societal norms and define your own style.

If your concerns about body hair or the pressure to conform are causing distress, it may be helpful to explore these feelings further with a trusted mental health professional. They can provide support and guidance as you navigate societal expectations and develop a healthier relationship with your body image.

Take care and continue embracing your uniqueness.

Warm regards,

-Debapriya, intern at u/just_lemmebe1"	"Hey there,

I completely understand your frustration and questioning why we have to go through the pain of shaving if we hate it so much. It's important to remember that societal beauty standards often have a significant influence on our choices and behaviors. However, it's also true that we have the power to challenge these standards and redefine beauty for ourselves.

You mentioned the movie ""Khiladi"" and how it would be amazing if women could flaunt their body hair just like men do. It's definitely a thought-provoking idea! Society has conditioned us to believe that hairlessness is the norm for women, but in reality, body hair serves various important functions, as you mentioned. It's a natural part of our bodies that has evolved to provide protection and other benefits.

It's crucial to remember that your body hair is completely normal and nothing to be ashamed of. Our bodies are diverse and unique, and that includes our hair growth patterns. Breaking the barriers of societal expectations and embracing our natural selves can be liberating and empowering.

Instead of conforming to external pressures, let's focus on embracing our own individuality and encouraging diversity in beauty standards. We can challenge the notion that we have to adhere to a specific stereotype to be considered beautiful. Beauty comes in all forms, shapes, and sizes.

So, take a moment to be kind to yourself and appreciate the uniqueness of your body. Break free from the inner critic that constantly tells you how you should look, and remind yourself that you are deserving of self-love and acceptance. And let's extend that kindness and acceptance towards others as well.

Remember, you have the power to redefine beauty, and it starts with embracing your own authenticity.

-Debapriya, intern at u/just_lemmebe1"	"Hey Debapriya,

Thanks for sharing your thoughts and concerns about body hair and societal expectations. It's definitely a topic that many people struggle with, regardless of their race, age, or gender. 

You make some great points about the physiological functions of body hair and how it plays a role in protecting our bodies from various elements. It's important for us to remember that our bodies are unique and diverse, and beauty comes in many different forms. 

Breaking societal barriers and challenging stereotypes is a courageous and empowering choice. Embracing our natural selves, including our body hair, can be a powerful act of self-acceptance and self-love. 

It can be challenging to silence the inner critic and to feel comfortable in our own skin when faced with societal pressures. However, taking a pledge to be kinder to ourselves and others is a great step in the right direction. Accepting and supporting each other in our individual choices and expressions of beauty is a beautiful way to celebrate diversity.

Remember, you have the right to choose what makes you feel comfortable and confident. There's no shame in embracing your body hair or choosing to remove it if that's what feels right for you. It's all about personal preference and finding what makes you happy and confident.

If you ever need someone to talk to during this journey of self-acceptance, there are many supportive communities and resources available. Keep being true to yourself and embracing your uniqueness!

Take care,

"I don't have many friends, but I ended up being the odd one out of the only college class I have with them today. Met with a therapist I've been meeting for about a year for the last time today because I am getting too old for youth services and completed a transition. Went onto a poc discord channel for the first time in months and saw that a yt person was using that channel to interview poc about ""recognizing race with bad vision"" or smthn, and I realized almost nobody in that tiny toxic channel is actually black, just mostly other races who aren't happy with ""black people being the only race represented in poc"". One of two of my closest friends is a guy and my parents have taught me unconsciously that it is awkward, so I am ashamed, and my other closest friend has drifted away from me because she feels like she's ""been a bad influence"" (she hasn't).

The only things that made me more introverted are my insecurities. I need people to talk to but I guess I have too many boyish hobbies to relate to girls my age and am too weird to fit into my own race. I talk genuinely to friends about once a month and the rest is spent being in isolation or being an odd one out. Been praying for a good gal group since middle school and I guess I'm still waiting on it

(I'll delete if offensive in any way)"	"Hey everyone! 💬 I hope you're all doing well. I wanted to reach out and share what's been going on with me lately. Today was a tough day for me as I felt like the odd one out in my college class, which can be quite isolating sometimes. On top of that, I had my final session with my therapist who I've been seeing for about a year. It's a bittersweet moment because I'm aging out of youth services, but I'm grateful for the progress I've made during this time.

Something that bothered me today was stumbling upon a discord channel focused on discussing race. Unfortunately, it seems like the channel was being used by someone who wasn't from that racial background to conduct interviews about ""recognizing race with bad vision."" It felt frustrating because I realized there weren't many black voices in the channel, which is supposed to be a space for people of color. Diversity and representation are important, and I hope we can all work towards creating inclusive environments.

Another aspect that has been on my mind is the difficulty I face in finding a close-knit group of friends. I've always felt like I have too many ""boyish"" hobbies to relate to girls my age, and I sometimes struggle with fitting in within my own race. It's a challenge, and it can make me feel isolated at times. I truly value the genuine conversations I have with my friends, but they only happen about once a month, which leaves me craving more connection.

I've been praying for a good group of gal pals since middle school, and while I'm still waiting for that, I'm hopeful that I'll find my tribe someday. 🌟 In the meantime, I'm grateful to have this supportive community where I can express myself. Let's continue uplifting each other and fostering positive connections. Thanks for listening! 😊❤️ (Please let me know if any part of my post is offensive, and I'll be happy to adjust or delete it.) #SeekingSupport #FindingConnection"	1	2	0	0.0009978413581848145	social media

I'm sorry to hear that you're struggling right now. It sounds like you're dealing with a lot of different emotions and experiences all at once, and that can be overwhelming. It's important to remember that you're not alone in feeling this way.

Transitioning out of youth services can be a big change, and it's completely normal to feel uncertain about the future. It's great that you've been able to see a therapist for support during this time. Although it may feel difficult to say goodbye to them, remember that there are other professionals who can continue to help you on your mental health journey.

Regarding the discord channel, it's unfortunate that you came across a toxic environment. It can be disheartening when we realize that certain spaces we hoped would be supportive may not be what we expected. Remember that you deserve to be in spaces where you feel respected and valued. It may be helpful to find online communities or groups that align more closely with your interests and values. This way, you can connect with people who share similar experiences and have meaningful conversations.

Feeling like an odd one out among your friends can be tough, but it's important to remember that you don't have to fit into any specific mold. Embrace your unique interests and hobbies, as they are part of what makes you who you are. You never know, there may be others out there who have similar interests and would love to connect with you.

As for your friendships, it's normal for relationships to change and evolve over time. It doesn't mean that you are at fault or that you've done something wrong. It might be worth reaching out to your friend who feels like they've been a bad influence and expressing how much their friendship means to you. Open communication can sometimes help mend the distance between friends.

Lastly, don't lose hope in finding a good gal group. Sometimes, it takes time to find your tribe. Keep putting yourself out there, whether online or in person, and be open to new connections. Building meaningful friendships can take time, but it's worth the effort.

Remember, you're not alone in feeling isolated or going through these challenges. Reach out to supportive communities, seek professional help, and be kind to yourself during this journey."	2	0	0	0.0006847381591796875	mental health forum

Transitioning from youth services and completing therapy can be difficult transitions, and it can be tough to navigate social situations where you feel like the odd one out.

Remember that it's important to challenge the beliefs and unconscious biases that your parents may have instilled in you. Recognizing and addressing those beliefs can help you feel less ashamed about having a male friend. Diversity within friendships and relationships is a beautiful thing, and it's not necessary to fit into societal norms or expectations.

Finding like-minded individuals who share your interests and hobbies can be a great way to connect with others. While it may take time to find the right group, don't lose hope. Consider exploring online communities or local clubs related to your hobbies to meet people who share common interests.

In the meantime, it can be beneficial to focus on self-acceptance and building a strong sense of self-worth. Engaging in self-care activities, practicing self-compassion, and exploring your own passions can help boost your confidence and make you more comfortable with who you are.

If you're open to it, seeking out further therapy or counseling may also be helpful in addressing your insecurities and finding healthy ways to build meaningful connections. A mental health professional can provide guidance, support, and strategies for navigating social challenges.

One of two of my closest friends is a guy and my parents have taught me unconsciously that it is awkward, so I am ashamed, and my other closest friend has drifted away from me because she feels like she's ""been a bad influence"" (she hasn't).

The only things that made me more introverted are my insecurities. I need people to talk to but I guess I have too many boyish hobbies to relate to girls my age and am too weird to fit into my own race. I talk genuinely to friends about once a month and the rest is spent being in isolation or being an odd one out. Been praying for a good gal group since middle school and I guess I'm still waiting on it

(I'll delete if offensive in any way)"	"Hey there, it sounds like you're going through a tough time and feeling isolated. Transitioning and navigating through different social groups can be challenging. It's understandable that you're feeling alone and struggling to find a sense of belonging.

Firstly, congratulations on completing your transition! That's a significant milestone, and it's important to acknowledge your progress. I understand that it may be difficult to say goodbye to your therapist after meeting for such a long time, but remember that you have grown throughout this process and have developed valuable skills and insights.

Regarding the discord channel, it can be disheartening to come across discussions or interactions that don't align with your expectations or needs. Remember that online communities can be diverse, and sometimes they may not fully represent a particular racial group. It's important to focus on finding spaces that are supportive and inclusive, where you can feel comfortable expressing yourself fully.

Friendships and connections can be challenging to navigate, especially when societal norms or stereotypes come into play. Remember that hobbies and interests don't define your ability to connect with others. Genuine connections can be built based on shared values, interests, or simply through open-mindedness and understanding. Don't limit yourself by assuming that you can't relate to girls or fit into your own race. Seek opportunities to engage with different people and explore your interests. Your uniqueness can be an asset rather than a barrier.

In terms of feeling isolated and yearning for a good gal group, keep in mind that forming friendships takes time and patience. It can be helpful to expand your social circle by joining clubs, organizations, or online communities that align with your interests. By engaging in activities that you enjoy and are passionate about, you increase the chances of meeting like-minded individuals with whom you can forge connections.

Remember, it's okay to feel alone and struggle at times, but reaching out for support is essential. Consider seeking out local support groups, therapy groups, or online communities specifically designed for individuals going through similar experiences. Supportive spaces can provide you with a sense of community and understanding.

Lastly, please be kind to yourself. Acknowledge your worth and value, and try to challenge any negative self-talk or shame that may arise. You deserve to have fulfilling relationships and connections. Keep working towards finding your tribe, and remember that it's a journey. Hang in there, and keep seeking out opportunities to connect and grow."	1	0	0	0.000661313533782959	forum with demographics
"I don't have many friends, but I ended up being the odd one out of the only college class I have with them today.

It sounds like you're going through a tough time right now, and I'm here to offer support. Transitioning from youth services to adult services can be a significant change, and it's understandable that it might feel overwhelming. It's great that you were able to meet with a therapist, and I hope that they were able to provide some valuable guidance during your time together.

Regarding the POC Discord channel, it can be disappointing to come across situations where people may not fully understand or respect the experiences of others. It's essential to find spaces where you feel heard and understood, so perhaps exploring different communities or groups that align more closely with your needs and values could be helpful.

As for feeling like the odd one out or struggling to relate to others, remember that it's common to experience these feelings at times, especially when it comes to friendships and hobbies. It's important to embrace your unique interests and be true to yourself. Connecting with like-minded individuals might take time, but it's worth the effort. You mentioned wanting to find a good gal group, and that's a great goal to have. Have you considered seeking out activities or clubs that align with your hobbies? This could be a great way to meet people who share similar interests.

Remember that it's okay to feel insecure or to have ups and downs in friendships. Friendships evolve and change over time, and sometimes people drift apart for various reasons. However, it's important not to blame yourself for those changes. It's possible that your friend's feelings of being a bad influence may stem from her own experiences and struggles, and it may not necessarily be a reflection of your actions.

In the meantime, if you're feeling isolated, it can be helpful to seek out online communities or support groups where you can connect with others who may be going through similar experiences. These spaces can provide a sense of belonging and a chance to share your feelings without judgment.

Remember to be patient with yourself and focus on self-care. It's okay to have your own unique path and experiences, and there will be people out there who appreciate and relate to your genuine self."	2	0	0	0.0007089376449584961	forum w/o demographics

Summary: My boyfriend broke up with me because I didn't disclose that I have gap years in my academics"	Hey Reddit fam, need some advice here. I recently started dating this amazing guy who's super accomplished academically. We've been dating for a while and things were going great, but I made a mistake. I was intimidated by his achievements and ended up lying about reaching the interview stage of my judicial service exam. I planned to come clean later, but now we're in a serious relationship and he found out. He feels betrayed and thinks I never cared about him. He even broke up with me. Any suggestions on how I can fix this? Really need some guidance. Thanks in advance! 🙏🏽❤️	1	2	0	0.0008516311645507812	social media

It sounds like there's been a breakdown in trust and communication between you and your boyfriend. It can be difficult when our insecurities get the better of us and we feel the need to hide certain aspects of ourselves. It's important to remember that nobody is perfect and we all have our own unique journeys.

It might be helpful to have an open and honest conversation with your boyfriend about why you felt the need to hide your past. Explain to him that it wasn't because you didn't care about him, but rather because you were afraid of his reaction and didn't want to jeopardize the relationship. Apologize for not being truthful from the beginning and assure him that you've learned from this experience.

It's also important to take care of yourself during this challenging time. Reach out to friends, family, or a therapist who can provide support and guidance as you navigate these emotions. Remember that mistakes happen, and it's possible to learn and grow from them.

Ultimately, the decision to continue the relationship or not is up to both of you. It may take time for your boyfriend to process his feelings and decide whether he can still trust you. Focus on taking responsibility for your actions and demonstrating through your words and actions that you're committed to being honest and open moving forward."	2	0	2	0.0006964206695556641	mental health forum

Relationships can be challenging, especially when there are misunderstandings or miscommunications.

Summary: My boyfriend broke up with me because I didn't disclose that I have gap years in my academics"	"I'm sorry to hear that you're going through a tough time with your relationship. It can be challenging when we feel like we've made a mistake or withheld information from our partners. It's important to remember that relationships thrive on trust and open communication. While it may be difficult, take this as an opportunity for self-reflection and growth.

Firstly, it's essential to acknowledge that everyone has their own unique academic and professional journey. Your partner's accomplishments shouldn't define your worth or make you feel inferior. Your own achievements and experiences matter, and they have shaped you into the person you are today.

It's understandable that you might have felt insecure about your academic background in comparison to your partner's. However, it's important to be honest with your partner from the beginning to establish trust and open up about your insecurities. Lying or withholding information, even with good intentions, can damage trust in a relationship.

Moving forward, it might be helpful to have an honest conversation with your partner. Express your regret for not being truthful and explain your reasons for not disclosing your gap years initially. Allow him to express his feelings and concerns so that both of you can work towards understanding each other better.

Additionally, take this as an opportunity to reflect on your own self-worth and confidence. Remember that you are deserving of love and respect, regardless of your academic achievements. Focus on appreciating your own accomplishments and continuously working towards your goals.

Lastly, consider seeking support from a mental health professional or a counselor who can guide you through this difficult time. They can help you process your emotions, build self-esteem, and navigate future relationships with openness and honesty.

Remember, we all make mistakes, but it's how we learn from them and grow that truly matters. Hang in there, and take care of yourself."	2	0	0	0.0006718635559082031	forum with demographics

I'm sorry to hear that you're going through a tough time. It can be difficult when our past experiences and insecurities impact our relationships. It's important to remember that honesty and trust are crucial in any partnership.

It sounds like you were concerned about revealing your academic history to your boyfriend due to his accomplishments. While it's understandable to feel intimidated, it's essential to be true to yourself and open up about your past. Communication is key, especially when it comes to building a foundation of trust.

Unfortunately, your boyfriend discovered the truth through other means, which has now led to a breakup. It's natural to feel hurt, but it's essential to take this as an opportunity for personal growth. Reflect on the situation and consider what you could have done differently. 

Moving forward, it's important to be honest with yourself and others. Embrace your achievements, and don't let your perceived shortcomings define you. Everyone has their own unique journey, and gaps in academics do not undermine your worth as an individual.

Take some time to heal and focus on self-care. Surround yourself with a support system, whether it be close friends or family members who can offer guidance and understanding. Remember, it's okay to make mistakes; what matters is how we learn from them.

If you find it difficult to cope with the emotional aftermath of this breakup, consider seeking support from a therapist or counselor. They can help you navigate your emotions, address any underlying issues or insecurities, and provide guidance on building healthier relationships in the future.

Stay strong, and never forget that you are capable of finding happiness and love, regardless of your past academic experiences."	2	0	0	0.0006427168846130371	forum w/o demographics

It sounds like your parents are trying to be understanding by giving you the freedom to make your own choice. This is a positive thing, as it shows that they value your happiness. However, it can still be difficult to navigate through conflicting emotions and expectations.

One suggestion would be to have an open and honest conversation with your parents about your concerns and feelings. Clearly communicate your hesitation and ask for their support and understanding. It's important to express yourself without feeling pressured or judged.

Additionally, taking some time for self-reflection and understanding your own needs and desires can be helpful. Reflect on your values, goals, and what you see in a life partner. Allow yourself to explore your own feelings and prioritize what truly matters to you.

Seeking guidance from a professional, such as a counselor or therapist, can also be beneficial. They can provide a safe space for you to sort through your thoughts and feelings, as well as offer guidance and support through this challenging time.

One suggestion is to take some time to reflect on your feelings and assess the reasons behind your hesitations. It may be helpful to write down your thoughts and emotions to gain clarity.

Firstly, I understand that this situation can be quite overwhelming for you. It's important to remember that your feelings and emotions play a significant role in deciding who you want to spend your life with. It sounds like you're experiencing some internal conflict regarding this arranged marriage proposal.

You mentioned that your family really likes this individual, but you haven't felt any connection with him. It's crucial to consider your own wants and needs when making such an important decision. Engage in self-reflection and think about the qualities you desire in a life partner.

Communicating openly with your parents about your thoughts and concerns may be helpful in finding a resolution. Express your feelings honestly, but respectfully. They seem open to your decision, so it's essential to take advantage of this opportunity to have an open dialogue.

Moreover, it might be helpful to talk to someone you trust, like a close friend or family member, about how you're feeling. They can provide a listening ear and potentially offer their perspectives or experiences.

Remember that it's your life, and it's okay to prioritize your own happiness. Trust your instincts and take your time with this decision. Seek support from those around you and remember that there's no rush. Take care of yourself during this process.

Feel free to reach out if you need further assistance. Sending you strength and courage as you navigate this challenging situation.

"i’ve never had a diagnosed mental illness but for a few months now, since summer started i’ve been feeling this background numbness. it feels like i no longer have any zest for life. 

here are some things i think are sources of this:

1. everyone ard me is getting internships at elite companies while my own is not very impressive
2. my best friend is studying overseas with an awkward time difference
3. all my other friends here are in happy relationships and i feel like i’m no one’s top priority 
4. i ended up using part time work as a distraction from thinking of these feelings properly(which i nvr did before, i used to be very in tune with my feelings)

a small argument with a close friend over text(who is not a very emotional person) triggered a panic attack in public, and that had triggered me into thinking of a way to fix this. 

im saving up so i don’t have money to spend on therapy, my parents are very asian and very unemotional and i feel like ive trauma dumped on my friends enough. 

i’m planning on going to my university’s free counselling service but i heard it’s not great. 

does anyone have any suggestions? especially since i’m not diagnosed with anyth and i’m not sure how to do deal with this with my limited resources."	"Hey there! 💬 It's brave of you to reach out and share what you're going through. Remember that you're not alone and there are others who understand what you're experiencing. 🌟 While I'm unable to provide professional help, there are still some things you can try. 💪

1⃣ Celebrate your own achievements, no matter how big or small they may seem. Your journey is unique and comparing yourself to others won't do you any good. 🎉

2⃣ Stay connected with your friend overseas! Time differences may be challenging, but the effort is worth it. Chatting/texting can help you maintain that bond. 🗺️

3⃣ Remember, relationships aren't a race. Everyone's path is different. Focus on nurturing yourself and the right person will come along. ❤️ 

4⃣ Keep exploring healthy coping mechanisms that work for you. Part-time work can be a distraction, but also make sure to set aside time to reflect and address your feelings. 🌈

Take advantage of your university's free counseling service. It's a good starting point, and who knows, it might be more helpful than you anticipate! 🎓✨

Lastly, don't hesitate to lean on your friends. True friends will be there to support you, even if it feels like you've shared a lot. Remember, you deserve help and understanding. 🤗💕"	1	0	0	0.000744163990020752	social media

"I'm sorry to hear that you're going through this difficult time, but know that you're not alone. It's important to remember that mental health struggles can impact anyone, regardless of whether they have a diagnosed mental illness or not.

Regarding your sources of numbness and lack of zest for life, it seems like you've identified some factors that might be contributing to these feelings. Comparison to others, feeling disconnected from friends, and having work distract you from addressing your emotions can definitely take a toll on your well-being.

It's positive that you're considering reaching out for help. Although you mentioned concerns about your university's counseling service, it might still be worth giving it a try. While it may not be perfect, there's a chance that their resources can provide some support and guidance during this time. You could also look into other low-cost or free mental health services in your community, such as local clinics or support groups.

In addition to seeking professional help, there are some self-care practices you can try. Engaging in activities that bring you joy or help you relax, such as hobbies or exercise, might help improve your overall well-being. Journaling your thoughts and feelings could also provide you with a way to process and understand your emotions.

Furthermore, reaching out to supportive friends or loved ones could provide you with some comfort. Although you mentioned feeling like you've burdened them with your feelings, it's important to remember that true friends are often willing to listen and offer support when we need it most. However, seeking the help of a professional would be beneficial to ensure you have the necessary support and guidance to navigate through this challenging time.

Remember that acknowledging that you're going through a difficult period is the first step towards finding ways to improve your well-being. Don't hesitate to reach out for help and explore the available resources, both professional and personal. You deserve support and to prioritize your mental health."	2	0	0	0.0006641745567321777	mental health forum
"i’ve never had a diagnosed mental illness but for a few months now, since summer started i’ve been feeling this background numbness. it feels like i no longer have any zest for life. 

here are some things i think are sources of this:

1. everyone ard me is getting internships at elite companies while my own is not very impressive
2. my best friend is studying overseas with an awkward time difference
3. all my other friends here are in happy relationships and i feel like i’m no one’s top priority 
4. i ended up using part time work as a distraction from thinking of these feelings properly(which i nvr did before, i used to be very in tune with my feelings)

a small argument with a close friend over text(who is not a very emotional person) triggered a panic attack in public, and that had triggered me into thinking of a way to fix this. 

im saving up so i don’t have money to spend on therapy, my parents are very asian and very unemotional and i feel like ive trauma dumped on my friends enough. 

i’m planning on going to my university’s free counselling service but i heard it’s not great.

"I'm sorry to hear that you're going through a difficult time right now. It's understandable that all these circumstances seem overwhelming and are impacting your overall well-being. It takes courage to reach out for support, and it's great that you're considering utilizing your university's free counseling service. Even if you have heard mixed reviews about it, it can still be valuable to give it a try. They may be able to provide you with some helpful strategies and support.

Additionally, there are a few things you can try on your own to manage some of these feelings. Firstly, it might be helpful to challenge any negative thoughts you have about not measuring up to others or feeling like you're not a priority. Remember that everyone's journey is different, and it's important not to compare yourself to others. Secondly, consider incorporating self-care activities into your routine. This can be anything that brings you joy or helps you relax, such as engaging in hobbies, journaling, spending time in nature, or exercising.

Lastly, if you're comfortable with it, you could consider seeking out online resources or support communities where you can connect with others who may have similar experiences. Sometimes, sharing your thoughts and feelings with others who can relate can provide a sense of validation and support.

Remember, even without a formal diagnosis, your feelings and experiences are valid. It's important to prioritize your mental well-being and seek the help that you need."	2	0	0	0.000667870044708252	clinician

It's important to know that you don't have to have a diagnosed mental illness to seek help and support. It's great that you've considered going to your university's free counseling service as a starting point. While you've heard mixed reviews, it's worth giving it a try because different resources work differently for each person.

In the meantime, there are some self-help strategies that you can try to manage your feelings of numbness and lack of zest for life. One possible approach is practicing self-care. Focus on activities that bring you joy and help you relax, such as engaging in hobbies, spending time in nature, or listening to uplifting music. Additionally, keeping a journal can be a useful tool to explore your feelings and thoughts more deeply.

Another suggestion is to reach out for support beyond therapy. You mentioned feeling like you've ""trauma dumped"" on your friends, but it's important to remember that friends can provide empathy and support. While they may not be trained professionals, simply talking with someone who cares about you can sometimes make a positive difference.

Online mental health communities, like this one, can be a helpful resource as well. Connecting with others who may have experienced similar struggles can provide a sense of understanding and validation. Remember, you're not alone in your feelings.

Lastly, if you find that your symptoms persist or worsen, it might be important to consider looking for low-cost or sliding-scale therapy options that are available in your area. Many therapists offer reduced fees based on financial need, and some community organizations offer free or low-cost counseling services.

Remember that seeking help is a brave and important step towards taking care of your mental well-being. Keep exploring different resources and approaches until you find the support that works best for you."	2	0	0	0.0006732940673828125	forum with demographics

I'm sorry to hear that you've been experiencing this background numbness and loss of zest for life. It can be really difficult when we're surrounded by others who seem to be achieving more success or are in happier situations, while we feel stuck. It's also tough when our support systems, like friends and family, aren't emotionally available or understanding.

Although I can't provide a diagnosis or professional help, I can offer some suggestions on how to cope with these feelings within your limited resources:

1. Connect with others: While your best friend may be studying overseas, try reaching out to other friends for support. Even if they're in happy relationships, they may still be able to offer a listening ear. Additionally, consider joining social or interest groups related to your university or community to expand your network and potentially meet new people who can empathize with your experiences.

2. Self-reflection and self-care: Take some time to focus on yourself. Journaling or engaging in creative activities can help you process your emotions and gain a better understanding of your feelings. Look for free resources online or at your university's library that can provide guidance on self-exploration and self-care techniques.

3. Utilize free resources: Since you mentioned your university's counseling service, it's great that you're considering seeking help there. While it may not work for everyone, it's still worth giving it a try. Even if they have limitations, they may still be able to provide some support, coping strategies, or referrals to other resources that could help you.

4. Online mental health resources: Explore reputable mental health websites, forums, and blogs. Many places offer free educational materials, self-help resources, and forums where you can connect with others who have similar experiences. While this isn't a substitute for professional help, it can still provide you with valuable information and a supportive community.

Remember, it's important to continue seeking help and not give up. You deserve support and help with your mental well-being. If you ever feel overwhelmed or in crisis, don't hesitate to reach out to helplines or crisis chat services that are available for free, regardless of your diagnosis or resources.

Take care,

"I used to have many misunderstandings about surrendering. It felt like giving up or not pushing hard enough. But recently, I stumbled upon the book ""The Surrender Experiment,"" and it completely changed my perspective. Surrendering, it turns out, is the exact opposite of what I thought. 

&#x200B;

What truly inspired me in the book was the author's decision to embrace new experiences, even those he initially resisted. He chose to surrender and be open to life's opportunities, and the results were far beyond his imagination. That, to me, is the genuine essence of surrendering. **It doesn't mean giving up on life; instead, it's about releasing our ego and personal preferences, facing our fears, and having the courage to step outside our comfort zone. It's about relinquishing control and wholeheartedly embracing whatever life presents us with.**

&#x200B;

Looking back on my own life, I realized that most of my successes came from confronting these challenges head-on, while most of my suffering arose when I clung to comfort based on personal preferences. Now, having experienced this breakthrough, I've made the most crucial decision of my life: to surrender. I am choosing to participate in life with a calm mind and an open heart.

&#x200B;

A calm mind entails letting go of constant self-analysis, personal preferences, and ego-driven thoughts. So much of our suffering comes from obsessing about ourselves. However, if we shift our focus to serving others and let go of our own desires, we can find instant relief. The happiest people in the world are not those who achieve greatness solely for themselves, but those who enrich the lives of others. Surrendering allows life to grant us gifts beyond our wildest dreams.

&#x200B;

An open heart means being open-minded, flexible, and courageous. It may sound simple, but it's a challenging endeavor. Confronting our fears and being willing to do things we initially resist are significant parts of this process. **Sometimes, the most remarkable outcomes come from things we never wanted or considered in the first place.** So, if you're considering surrendering, start by addressing your fears. Instead of avoiding them, confront them and take on the tasks you don't want to do. This is the path to surrendering to life.

&#x200B;

When we take greater risks, we also reap greater rewards. As we do this, it's essential to quiet our minds. This means letting go of judgments and opinions and creating mental clarity to see things as they are without overanalyzing. To start, pay close attention to your thoughts and become aware of them. Whenever you catch yourself engrossed in a negative thought, pause, take a breath, and acknowledge that it's just your mind spinning a tale—it doesn't come from your heart. Let it go and refocus on the task at hand. Surrendering is not a one-time event; it is a continuous process of growth and self-discovery. So, be patient with yourself and celebrate every step forward, no matter how small it may seem.

&#x200B;

In the end, surrendering is about finding harmony within ourselves and with the world around us. It is about aligning with the natural rhythms of life and trusting that the universe has our best interests at heart. So, let go of the need for control, quiet your mind, and embrace the beauty of surrender. As you do so, you will unlock the door to a life of fulfillment, purpose, and boundless possibilities.

"I used to have many misunderstandings about surrendering. It felt like giving up or not pushing hard enough. But recently, I stumbled upon the book ""The Surrender Experiment,"" and it completely changed my perspective. Surrendering, it turns out, is the exact opposite of what I thought. 

&#x200B;

What truly inspired me in the book was the author's decision to embrace new experiences, even those he initially resisted. He chose to surrender and be open to life's opportunities, and the results were far beyond his imagination. That, to me, is the genuine essence of surrendering. **It doesn't mean giving up on life; instead, it's about releasing our ego and personal preferences, facing our fears, and having the courage to step outside our comfort zone. It's about relinquishing control and wholeheartedly embracing whatever life presents us with.**

&#x200B;

Looking back on my own life, I realized that most of my successes came from confronting these challenges head-on, while most of my suffering arose when I clung to comfort based on personal preferences. Now, having experienced this breakthrough, I've made the most crucial decision of my life: to surrender. I am choosing to participate in life with a calm mind and an open heart.

&#x200B;

A calm mind entails letting go of constant self-analysis, personal preferences, and ego-driven thoughts. So much of our suffering comes from obsessing about ourselves. However, if we shift our focus to serving others and let go of our own desires, we can find instant relief. The happiest people in the world are not those who achieve greatness solely for themselves, but those who enrich the lives of others. Surrendering allows life to grant us gifts beyond our wildest dreams.

&#x200B;

An open heart means being open-minded, flexible, and courageous. It may sound simple, but it's a challenging endeavor. Confronting our fears and being willing to do things we initially resist are significant parts of this process. **Sometimes, the most remarkable outcomes come from things we never wanted or considered in the first place.** So, if you're considering surrendering, start by addressing your fears. Instead of avoiding them, confront them and take on the tasks you don't want to do. This is the path to surrendering to life.

&#x200B;

When we take greater risks, we also reap greater rewards. As we do this, it's essential to quiet our minds. This means letting go of judgments and opinions and creating mental clarity to see things as they are without overanalyzing. To start, pay close attention to your thoughts and become aware of them. Whenever you catch yourself engrossed in a negative thought, pause, take a breath, and acknowledge that it's just your mind spinning a tale—it doesn't come from your heart. Let it go and refocus on the task at hand. Surrendering is not a one-time event; it is a continuous process of growth and self-discovery. So, be patient with yourself and celebrate every step forward, no matter how small it may seem.

&#x200B;

In the end, surrendering is about finding harmony within ourselves and with the world around us. It is about aligning with the natural rhythms of life and trusting that the universe has our best interests at heart. So, let go of the need for control, quiet your mind, and embrace the beauty of surrender. As you do so, you will unlock the door to a life of fulfillment, purpose, and boundless possibilities.

Thank you for sharing your insights on surrendering and how it has positively impacted your life. It's wonderful to hear that you've had such a breakthrough and have made the decision to participate in life with a calm mind and an open heart.

Surrendering can indeed be a transformative experience, as it allows us to release our ego and personal preferences, face our fears, and step outside of our comfort zone. By relinquishing control and embracing whatever life presents us with, we open ourselves up to new possibilities and experiences that we may have initially resisted.

I completely agree with your point about how a calm mind entails letting go of constant self-analysis, personal preferences, and ego-driven thoughts. It's true that so much of our suffering comes from obsessing about ourselves. By shifting our focus onto serving others and letting go of our own desires, we can find relief and happiness. The acts of surrendering and serving others go hand in hand, as they both lead to personal growth and a deeper connection with the world around us.

Having an open heart is also crucial in the surrendering process. Being open-minded, flexible, and courageous allows us to confront our fears and tackle tasks that we initially resist. Sometimes, the most remarkable outcomes come from things we never wanted or considered in the first place. By addressing our fears and taking on challenges, we open ourselves up to new opportunities and personal growth.

I appreciate your reminder that surrendering is a continuous process of growth and self-discovery. It's important to be patient with ourselves and celebrate every step forward, no matter how small it may seem. Each step taken towards surrendering and finding harmony within ourselves and the world around us brings us closer to a life of fulfillment, purpose, and boundless possibilities.

Thank you for sharing your thoughts and experiences on surrendering. It's truly inspiring to hear how it has positively impacted your life. If you ever need support or have any questions, feel free to reach out.

"She  constantly blames me for being vulnerable and crying, insisting that  I'm oversensitive, rude, and not allowed to express my emotions freely.  This has caused me to put my emotions on autopilot, hiding them even  from myself, and convincing myself that I'm just too sensitive. Whenever  I try to address her behavior, she gaslights me, deflects the issue,  and scolds me for no apparent reason. If I stand up to her, she  dismisses me as a rude child, leaving me feeling silenced and unable to  express myself.

Her consistent low  opinion of me deeply hurts, leading to a significant blow to my  self-esteem. Subconsciously, I'm terrified of making even the slightest  mistake, as I know she'll demean me, calling me an idiot who can't do  anything right. She communicates with unclear expectations, expecting me  to understand without her needing to say anything, making me feel like a  constant disappointment to her. Her anger can be so intense that it  breaks my heart and leaves me feeling emotionally numb.

However,  amidst all the negativity, I can't deny that she cares about me in her  own way. She cooks my favorite meals and offers advice to reduce stress  when I study. But, she becomes disappointed if my grades aren't perfect,  even though I am actually an honored student. She takes care of me  physically, but emotionally, her words can be cruel, especially when she  mocks my passion for singing.

Approval  from her is a constant need in my life. Her words can be incredibly  cutting, as she keeps bringing up my past mistakes and refuses to  believe in me or have faith in my abilities. The rare moments of pride  she shows are when I achieve something notable, but she tends to  prioritize sharing these achievements on social media rather than  expressing her joy directly to me.

It's  a typical Asian mom situation, and feeling particularly down today, I  decided to pour out my feelings while sobbing quietly in my room.  Writing this has helped me feel somewhat better.

And what hurts the most is that she doesn't believe in me .She's not faithful in me ."	"💔 Struggling with my Asian mom's constant criticism and lack of belief in me. 😢 She always blames me for being too sensitive and insists I can't freely express my emotions. 😭 Whenever I try to talk to her about it, she gaslights me and dismisses me as a rude child. I feel silenced and unable to express myself.

Her low opinion of me really hurts my self-esteem. 😞 I'm scared of making any mistake, knowing she'll demean me and call me an idiot. 😔 She has unclear expectations and treats me like a constant disappointment. Her anger is heart-wrenching and leaves me emotionally numb.

But amidst the negativity, she does show care in her own way. 🥰 She cooks my favorite meals and offers stress-reducing advice for studying. However, she becomes disappointed if my grades aren't perfect, even though I'm an honored student. 😥 Emotionally, she can be cruel, especially when she mocks my singing passion.

I constantly seek her approval and the pain becomes sharper when she brings up my past mistakes. 😢 She doesn't believe in me or have faith in my abilities. 😔 Rare moments of pride are shared on social media, rather than being expressed directly to me.

It sounds like her behavior towards you is causing a lot of emotional pain and self-doubt. It's understandable that her constant criticism and lack of belief in you would deeply affect your self-esteem.

It's important to remember that you are not alone in experiencing these types of challenges. Many people have similar struggles with their parents, especially in cultural contexts where there are certain expectations and pressure to meet high standards. It's also great that you took the step of writing down your feelings, as expressing oneself can often bring some relief and clarity.

Your emotions are valid, and it's important to find healthy ways to express and process them. If you feel comfortable, you might consider talking to someone you trust, such as a close friend, another family member, or even a mental health professional. They can provide support and guidance to help you navigate this difficult situation.

Finding ways to build your self-esteem and self-belief is also crucial. Surrounding yourself with positive influences and engaging in activities that bring you joy and fulfillment can help counteract the negativity you experience at home. Whether it's singing, pursuing your passions, or seeking out achievements for yourself, it's essential to cultivate a sense of self-worth that is independent of your mother's approval.

Remember, you deserve love, understanding, and respect. It can be challenging, but try to remind yourself that you are not defined by your mother's words or actions. Focus on building a support network, setting boundaries, and finding healthy coping mechanisms to navigate this challenging dynamic. Keep reaching out for help when you need it, and know that there are people who care and want to support you through this."	2	0	0	0.0007271170616149902	mental health forum

It sounds like her words and actions have had a significant negative impact on your emotional well-being and self-esteem. It takes a toll when someone consistently dismisses your feelings and invalidates your experiences.

It's understandable that you may feel emotionally numb as a way to cope with this ongoing negativity. However, it's important to recognize that your emotions are valid and should be acknowledged. It can be helpful to explore healthy ways to express and process your emotions, whether through writing, talking to someone you trust, or engaging in activities that bring you joy.

It's positive to hear that amidst the negativity, you also recognize that your mom cares about you in her own way. It's important to remember that everyone has their strengths and weaknesses when it comes to expressing love and support. However, it can still be challenging when you have an underlying fear of making mistakes and facing criticism. It's essential to cultivate self-compassion and recognize your own worth, regardless of external validation.

Navigating relationships with difficult family members can be challenging, but it's important to prioritize your well-being. Developing healthy boundaries and finding support systems outside of your mom can be beneficial. Consider seeking support from friends, other family members, or seeking therapy where a clinician can help you navigate these dynamics and explore strategies for setting boundaries while still fostering a connection with your mom.

The need for approval and constantly seeking validation from a parent can be incredibly challenging, especially when they continuously bring up past mistakes and lack faith in your abilities.

I'm a 30-year-old guy from India, happily married with a beautiful kid. I've been running my own family business for about 8-9 years, which my dad helped me start.

Here's the thing: I have a serious phone addiction. 📱 I constantly find myself watching videos, movies, OTT content, YouTube, reels, or reading FML whenever I have a moment of downtime. I know it's been affecting so many areas of my life, leading to failures and missing out on important moments.

Honestly, I'm just not able to enjoy anything anymore. 😔 It's even hurting my business, which is definitely not what I want. I understand that I need to change, but it's been really tough to break this habit.

In addition to that, I've been struggling with anger issues too. 😡 Being in retail, I know how important it is to be polite, but sometimes I end up being super annoying, and it's not fair to others or myself.

So, if anyone has any tips, suggestions, or personal experiences on how to overcome phone addiction and manage anger better, I would be extremely grateful! 🙏 I really want to make positive changes in my life and be present for my family and business.

Thank you in advance for your support, and I appreciate any advice you may have! 💪"	1	2	0	0.0013297796249389648	social media

I'm really glad you reached out for support - it takes a lot of courage to recognize that something is impacting your life negatively and to ask for help. It sounds like your phone addiction has been causing difficulties in various areas of your life, including your personal and professional life. First and foremost, it's important to remember that you're not alone in this struggle. Many people face similar challenges with phone addiction, and there are strategies that can help.

One approach you can consider is gradually reducing your phone usage. Start by setting small goals, such as designating specific times during the day where you purposely refrain from using your phone. You could also try out apps and features that can limit your screen time or track your usage, which might provide you with a better understanding of how much time you're spending on your phone.

In addition to controlling screen time, finding alternative activities that you enjoy can be helpful. Engaging in hobbies, spending quality time with family, or even exercising can help divert your attention away from your phone. Consider identifying activities that you find fulfilling and make a conscious effort to incorporate them into your daily routine.

Addressing anger issues can also contribute to a healthier overall mindset. When you feel yourself becoming frustrated or annoyed, take a moment to pause and breathe deeply before responding. Reflecting on the situation and considering alternative perspectives can help you respond in a more calm and collected manner.

Remember, achieving change takes time and effort, so be patient with yourself. If you find it challenging to make progress on your own, it might be beneficial to seek guidance from a mental health professional who can provide tailored strategies and support.

Stay strong and keep seeking help - it's a sign of self-awareness and a step toward improving your well-being. Feel free to reach out to the community here anytime you need to talk or share your progress. You're not alone, and we're here to support you throughout your journey."	2	0	0	0.0006933212280273438	mental health forum

Being in retail , you have to be polite but sometimes I am super annoying"	"Dear Reddit user,

Thank you for reaching out and sharing your concerns about phone addiction and its impact on your life. It takes courage to acknowledge the negative effects this behavior has had on your well-being and business.

Firstly, it's important to recognize that you're not alone in struggling with phone addiction. Many individuals find themselves continuously engaged with their phones, seeking various forms of entertainment or distraction. The fact that you're aware of the negative consequences and actively seeking help is a significant step forward.

To address your addiction, here are some suggestions to consider:

1. Set clear boundaries: Establish specific timeframes during which you can use your phone for leisure purposes. Gradually reduce the amount of time spent on your phone each day until you reach a manageable level.

2. Find alternative activities: Engage in activities that you enjoy and that don't require phone usage. It could be something as simple as taking a walk, reading a book, or spending quality time with your family. By discovering new interests, you can develop healthier habits and replace excessive phone usage.

3. Seek support: Reach out to your family and friends for understanding and support. Discuss your concerns with them and let them know that you're making an effort to overcome your addiction. They can play a vital role in holding you accountable and providing encouragement along the way.

Regarding your anger issues, it's essential to address them alongside your phone addiction. Here are some suggestions:

1. Identify triggers: Reflect on situations or circumstances that tend to provoke your anger. Becoming more aware of these triggers will provide insight into the underlying causes of your frustration.

2. Develop coping strategies: Explore ways to manage your anger constructively. Deep breathing exercises, mindfulness techniques, or engaging in physical activities like exercise can help release tension and promote a calmer state of mind.

3. Consider therapy: If you find that your anger issues persist despite attempts to manage them independently, seeking professional help from a therapist or counselor can be valuable. They can assist you in exploring the root causes of your anger and guide you in developing healthier coping mechanisms.

Remember, overcoming phone addiction and managing anger takes time and effort. Patience and self-compassion are crucial throughout the process. Stay committed to change, and don't hesitate to seek professional help if needed. You have taken an important step by seeking assistance, and I believe you have the potential to make positive changes in your life.

Take care,

I'm sorry to hear that you're struggling with phone addiction and its impact on your life. It can be challenging to break free from the constant lure of screens and find enjoyment in other activities. You're not alone in this struggle, as many people also find themselves caught up in the digital world.

The first step towards overcoming any addiction is recognizing that it's causing negative consequences in your life, which you've already done. Acknowledging this is a significant accomplishment and shows your willingness to make a change.

Here are a few suggestions that might help you break free from your phone addiction:

1. Set boundaries: Start by outlining specific times during the day when you will allow yourself to use your phone. Gradually decrease the amount of time you spend on it.

2. Find alternative activities: Explore hobbies or activities that you find enjoyable and engaging. This could be anything from reading books, taking up a sport, spending time with loved ones, or pursuing a creative outlet. Fill your time with meaningful experiences that give you a sense of satisfaction.

3. Practice mindfulness: Being mindful can help you become more aware of your phone usage and bring attention to the present moment. Engage in activities that allow you to be fully present, such as meditation, deep breathing exercises, or simply focusing on the sensations of your surroundings.

4. Seek support: Consider reaching out to a mental health professional who specializes in addiction or behavioral issues. They can provide guidance tailored specifically to your needs and help you develop coping strategies.

Regarding your anger issues, it's common to experience frustration, especially in a retail setting. One strategy that may help is practicing relaxation techniques such as deep breathing or counting to ten before responding in challenging situations. Additionally, finding healthy outlets for your emotions, such as journaling or talking to someone you trust, can provide relief.

Remember, change takes time and effort, so don't be too hard on yourself if you experience setbacks along the way. Celebrate small victories and keep striving towards a healthier relationship with your phone and managing your anger. You're on the right path by seeking help, and with dedication, you can overcome these challenges.

Take care!"	2	0	0	0.0007631778717041016	forum with demographics

Phone addiction can be disruptive to various aspects of life, and I understand the impact it has had on your personal and professional life, including your family business. It's great that you recognize the need for change.

To begin addressing your phone addiction, it may be helpful to create a plan and set achievable goals. Consider setting limits on the amount of time you spend on your phone each day. Start small and gradually decrease the time spent on non-essential activities. Find alternative activities such as exercise, hobbies, or spending quality time with your family to replace phone usage.

Seeking support from your loved ones is crucial during this process. Talk to your spouse and loved ones about your struggles and goals, as they can provide a supportive environment and hold you accountable.

Regarding your anger issues, it's essential to understand the root causes and triggers to find effective coping strategies. Consider seeking therapy or counseling to better manage your emotions and develop healthier communication and conflict resolution skills. Therapists can provide personalized guidance specific to your circumstances and help you gain control over your anger.

Furthermore, practicing mindfulness and relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing exercises or meditation, can also help manage anger and reduce stress.

"Hey there, I’m an Indian M27, I lost my both parents when I was in Uni (age 22), a year after that I moved to a different country (NZ) to study.

Now, I have settled here permanently, however I am extremely lonely and depressed at times. I have a few friends that adore me and accept me as I am.

I recently came out as a gay man and said no to an arranged marriage/engagement. My relationship with my siblings has evolved and we rarely talk now.

I have a really good job, my manger is the best person I’ve known at work, he’s very supportive. I have seen that I have become very lazy and I used to get very panicked about the emails piling up. I know the only way through is through but since 4th July, my dads death anniversary.I have been feeling quite low and not showing up at work. I have exhausted all my leaves. I just feel too overwhelmed and I just want to stay away from those emails.

I am currently taking antidepressants and I was trying to overcome inconsistencies. I have been told that I have been consistently inconsistent all my life, and I think that’s quite true. I joined a gym was doing my best , finished the pile of emails last month and now I am back to where I was.

Thanks for reading 😊"	"Hey there! Sending you so much love and support. Remember, you're not alone in this. It's great to hear that you have a few friends who accept and adore you - cherished friendships are such a blessing. It takes a lot of courage to come out and stand up for your own happiness, so kudos to you for saying no to the arranged marriage/engagement and living authentically.

It sounds like your job and manager are amazing, and having a supportive workplace is so important. But it's completely normal to feel overwhelmed and low sometimes, especially during anniversaries and tough times. Remember to take care of yourself and prioritize your mental well-being. It's okay to take a step back and take a break when you need it. 

You mentioned being on antidepressants and trying to overcome inconsistencies - that's a big step forward! Just remember, progress is not always linear. It's okay to have ups and downs. Keep going and be patient with yourself. You've already shown immense strength and resilience.

If you ever need someone to talk to or just listen, we're here for you. Take care, and keep pushing forward. You've got this! 😊"	1	0	0	0.0006982088088989258	social media

Losing both parents at a young age and then moving to a new country can definitely take a toll on your mental health.

First of all, it's great that you have friends who accept and support you for who you are. Having a positive social network is important when it comes to mental well-being. It's also wonderful that you have a good job and a supportive manager. However, it seems like you're experiencing difficulty staying motivated and consistent at work.

Dealing with the anniversary of your father's death can bring up a lot of emotions and it's completely normal to feel low during this time. Grieving is a process that takes time, and it's important to allow yourself the space and time to heal. If you're feeling overwhelmed, it might be helpful to reach out to a mental health professional, such as a therapist, who can provide guidance and support during this challenging time.

In terms of your experience with antidepressants, it can sometimes take time to find the right medication or dosage that works best for you. It's important to communicate any concerns or changes in symptoms with your healthcare provider so they can make informed decisions about your treatment plan.

Lastly, it's great that you had joined a gym and were actively working on self-improvement. However, setbacks are a normal part of the journey, and it's important to be kind to yourself. Instead of focusing on the past, try to reframe your mindset and think of each day as an opportunity for a fresh start.

Remember, tackling mental health challenges takes time and patience. It's okay to ask for help and support along the way. Keep reaching out and seeking the resources that are available to you. You're not alone in this journey, and there are people who care about you and want to support you. Take care."	1	0	0	0.000628054141998291	mental health forum

I'm sorry to hear about the challenges you've been facing. It sounds like you have been through a lot, losing both your parents and experiencing a significant life transition by moving to a different country. It's great to hear that you have some friends who support and accept you.

Coming out as a gay man and declining an arranged marriage can be difficult, and it seems to have impacted your relationship with your siblings. It's important to give yourself time to adjust to these changes and remember that relationships can evolve over time.

I'm glad to hear that you have a good job and a supportive manager. It's understandable to feel overwhelmed and struggle with motivation, especially when dealing with grief and the anniversary of your father's passing. It's important to be kind to yourself during this time.

Taking antidepressants can be helpful, but consistency can sometimes be a challenge. Remember that it's okay to have ups and downs in life, and it's important to find a balance that works for you. It's great that you joined a gym and found some success in managing your workload before. Perhaps acknowledging your accomplishments and identifying helpful strategies from that time can be beneficial now.

If you're feeling overwhelmed with work, it might be helpful to reach out to your manager. They may be able to provide support or help you find ways to manage your workload. Additionally, consider seeking professional help from a therapist or counselor who can assist you in navigating your feelings of loneliness, depression, and inconsistencies.

Remember, it's okay to ask for help, and you don't have to go through this alone. Take care of yourself and prioritize your well-being."	2	0	0	0.0006398558616638184	clinician

First of all, it's great that you have some friends who accept and adore you for who you are. Having support from loved ones can make a big difference in our mental well-being.

Coming out as a gay man and declining an arranged marriage can be a significant step towards living an authentic life, but it can also come with its own challenges. It's unfortunate that your relationship with your siblings has evolved and you rarely talk now. Family dynamics can be complex, and it can be tough when our relationships change. If you feel comfortable, you might consider reaching out to your siblings and expressing how you've been feeling. It's possible that they may be going through their own adjustments and might benefit from an open discussion.

It's great to hear that your manager at work is supportive, and having a good job can provide a sense of stability. However, I understand that you're feeling overwhelmed and having difficulty staying motivated lately. Sometimes, life events and anniversaries can trigger feelings of sadness and low mood. It's important to give yourself permission to grieve and acknowledge your emotions.

Managing your mental health alongside work responsibilities can be challenging. It might be helpful to have an open conversation with your manager about what you're going through. They may be able to offer some support or accommodations during this time. Additionally, it could be worth exploring if your workplace has any mental health resources available, like counseling services or employee assistance programs.

Taking antidepressants is a positive step towards managing your mental health, but it's important to remember that they may take time to fully take effect. It's not uncommon to experience fluctuations in motivation and consistency, even when on medication. It might be helpful to reach out to your healthcare provider or therapist to discuss your concerns and explore additional coping strategies.

Incorporating self-care activities like going to the gym can be beneficial, but it's okay if you find yourself struggling to maintain consistency. Instead of being too hard on yourself, try focusing on small, achievable goals. For example, instead of feeling overwhelmed by a pile of emails, try setting aside specific times each day to tackle a few at a time. Celebrate your accomplishments, no matter how small they may seem.

Remember, you're not alone in this journey. Consider seeking support from a mental health professional or joining a support group where you can connect with others who may be experiencing similar challenges. They can provide guidance, understanding, and help you develop personalized coping strategies. Taking care of your mental health is just as important as your physical health, so be patient with yourself and keep reaching out for support when needed.

I'm 25M, an Indian, fair, skinny, if all these details can be any relevant.

Since childhood, I've noticed that people takes me for granted. Let me explain few cases:

- My schooling happened in hostel where my hostelmates molested me as we used to sleep together (many instances)
- Few months back, one of my good classmates from school asked me for my CTC, I told him some random number less than my actual CTC, and asked him not to tell this to anybody, but later in a school reunion I got to know that everyone from my schoolmates knew my salary, I didn't confronted that friend as I never talked to him after that get together.
- Few months back, I went to a trip and explicitly asked my mom to not tell any relatives about my trip but she ended up telling to so many relatives and that pisses me off
- I occasionally visit a local food vendor, kind of their regular customer, I've been noticing for few times that he takes time to serve me food, like even when those who come after me, he serves them and then me.

All these instances made me adamant to not believe anybody, and I'm having trust issues.

I think there's something wrong in my personality, that I'm not aware of, that makes people take me for granted as if I can't do any shit, my words have no respect or what!?

Is it related to my body or personality?

It's understandable that these experiences have left you feeling hurt and unsure about your worth. It's important to remember that you are not alone in struggling with issues like trust and feeling taken for granted. While I cannot provide a diagnosis or personalized advice without more information, I can offer some general suggestions that might help:

1. Self-reflection: Take some time to reflect on your own feelings, thoughts, and behaviors. Consider whether there might be any patterns or habits that could be contributing to these situations. Reflecting on your own actions can help you understand yourself better.

2. Communication: Open and honest communication can be a powerful tool. It might be helpful to express your feelings assertively and directly to the people involved in these situations. Let them know how their actions have affected you and what you would prefer in the future. Effective communication can help improve understanding and set boundaries.

3. Self-worth: Remember that your value as a person is not determined by how others treat you or their perception of you. Building self-esteem and self-confidence can help you feel more secure in yourself and less affected by the opinions and actions of others. Engage in activities that make you feel good about yourself and seek support from loved ones.

4. Seek professional help: If these issues continue to deeply affect your well-being and relationships, consider reaching out to a mental health professional. They can provide individualized support, help you explore underlying issues, and guide you through the process of personal growth and change.

Remember, this advice is not a substitute for professional help, and it's important to seek support from qualified professionals if needed."	2	0	0	0.0006597638130187988	forum with demographics

Please help. How to remove this trait?"	"Hey there, I'm sorry to hear that you're experiencing these challenges in your daily life. It sounds like you've been through some difficult situations and it's understandable that it has affected your trust in others. While I can't provide a direct solution, I can offer some suggestions for self-reflection and growth.

Firstly, it's important to remember that you are not defined by the actions of others. The experiences you've shared might have influenced your thoughts about yourself, but it's crucial to recognize that you have inherent worth and value regardless of how others treat you. Remembering this can help build your self-esteem.

It might be helpful to explore your boundaries and assertiveness. Stand up for yourself when you feel taken for granted or disrespected. Learning to set clear boundaries can help others understand your expectations and treat you with the respect you deserve.

Additionally, consider seeking professional support, such as therapy or counseling. A mental health professional can provide guidance and tools to help you navigate these issues. They can help you gain insights into your own behavior and identify any potential patterns or beliefs that contribute to people taking you for granted.

Remember, self-improvement takes time and effort. Be patient with yourself during this process and focus on self-care. Engaging in activities that promote your well-being, such as exercise, hobbies, or spending time with loved ones, can enhance your overall sense of self-worth.

I hope these suggestions can be a starting point for you. Remember, seeking support from professionals who specialize in mental health can provide you with more personalized guidance tailored to your unique situation.

"I'm so sorry to hear about the difficult situation you're going through at home. It takes a lot of strength to reach out and seek support, and I commend you for doing so. While I can't provide you with personal experiences, I can offer some suggestions to help you cope and potentially work towards creating a safer environment for yourself.

1. Seek support: Is there a trusted friend, family member, or counselor you can confide in? Opening up to someone you trust can provide emotional support and guidance. Additionally, consider seeking professional help from therapists or support groups that specialize in family dynamics or domestic abuse. They can offer valuable insight and coping strategies specific to your situation.

2. Develop a safety plan: If you feel unsafe at home, it's important to have a plan in place in case of emergencies. A safety plan could include identifying safe places you can go to if needed, keeping important documents and personal belongings in a secure location, and having trusted contacts who can support you during difficult times.

3. Explore available resources: Research local resources in your area that can provide assistance, such as shelters, helplines, or organizations that support individuals facing abuse. They may offer temporary housing, financial aid, or counseling services.

4. Financial independence: If you're considering leaving and pursuing work, think about developing a financial plan. Assess your current financial situation, explore potential job opportunities, and create a budget to determine if you can sustain yourself and your sister. Additionally, scholarships or grants may be available to help you continue your college education while working.

5. Self-care: Taking care of yourself is crucial during this challenging time. Find healthy outlets for stress, such as engaging in hobbies like art, listening to music, or practicing relaxation techniques. Prioritize self-care activities, even if it's just for a short amount of time each day, to help alleviate stress and maintain your mental well-being.

Remember, you don't have to face this alone. Reach out to people you trust, explore available resources in your community, and take small steps towards creating a safer and healthier environment for yourself and your sister. You're not alone, and there is hope for a brighter future."	2	0	0	0.0006530880928039551	mental health forum

It sounds like you have been carrying a heavy burden, taking care of your family while also dealing with the abuse and your own needs.

Please know that you are not alone in feeling this way. Many individuals have faced similar challenges and have been able to create a safer environment for themselves. It may help to connect with others who have been through similar experiences. Online support groups or forums specific to your situation, or even reaching out to a counselor or therapist, may provide you with helpful insights and uplifting stories from people who have overcome challenging circumstances.

Planning for your future can be overwhelming, but it's important to consider what options are available to you. Gradually working towards finishing college or focusing on work, whichever feels most manageable and aligns with your long-term goals, can be a step forward. It's important to remember that your own well-being and safety should be a priority.

Additionally, I encourage you to explore resources in your community that may offer support for individuals in abusive or unsafe households. Social services, local organizations, or hotlines may be able to provide guidance and resources specific to your situation.

Remember, seeking support from others is a sign of strength, not weakness. You have already taken a brave step by reaching out here. You deserve to live in a safe and secure environment, and I hope you find the support and encouragement you need to navigate your way towards a better future."	2	0	0	0.000732123851776123	clinician

"I'm sorry to hear that you're going through such a difficult time at home. It takes a lot of courage to reach out and seek support, so kudos to you for reaching out for help. Although I cannot provide specific advice without more information, I can share some general suggestions that may be helpful.

Firstly, remember that you are not alone in your experiences. Many people have successfully navigated similar situations, and it's important to know that there is hope for a safer and happier future. It's great that you're looking for inspiration from others who have been able to create a better environment for themselves.

Consider looking for resources in your local community that may provide support for individuals in unsafe households. There may be organizations or helplines that can offer guidance, counseling, or even temporary shelter options. It's worth exploring these options to see what support may be available to you.

In terms of your own well-being, finding healthy outlets for stress and emotions can be beneficial. Engaging in activities like art, as you mentioned, can be a positive way to cope with the challenges you're facing. Additionally, practicing self-care and finding moments of relaxation or mindfulness can help to alleviate some of the stress you're feeling.

Lastly, consider talking to someone you trust about your situation. Whether it's a friend, family member, or even a counselor, having someone to share your feelings with can provide emotional support and potentially offer guidance on your next steps.

Remember, it's important to prioritize your safety and well-being. While it may feel overwhelming and challenging now, know that there are resources and support available to help you create a safer environment for yourself and your sister.

"[Trigger Warning: Mention of domestic abuse]

Hello there, 

I'm really sorry to hear about the difficult situation you're facing at home. It takes a lot of courage to reach out for support, especially when you don't want your friends to know about it. I understand that you are feeling exhausted and hopeless, but please know that you are not alone in this. 

Abusive households can be incredibly challenging to navigate, especially when you are trying to protect your loved ones. It's understandable that the responsibility you feel towards your sister is holding you back from leaving. However, it's also important to prioritize your own well-being and safety. Remember that you cannot take care of others effectively if you're not taking care of yourself first.

Leaving an abusive household can be a difficult and complicated process, but it is possible. In seeking inspiration and hope from others who have been in similar situations, you may find strength and guidance. There are numerous stories out there of individuals who have successfully created safer environments for themselves and their loved ones. Consider looking for support groups or online communities that focus on domestic abuse survivors. They can provide you with a safe space to share your experiences, receive guidance, and find support.

Additionally, it could be helpful to reach out to relevant organizations or hotlines in your country that specialize in domestic abuse assistance. They may be able to provide you with resources, information, and guidance tailored to your specific situation. Remember, you don't have to face this alone. Professional help and guidance can make a significant difference in your journey towards a safer and healthier life.

In the meantime, taking care of your mental and emotional well-being is crucial, especially given the stress and strain you're experiencing. Consider practicing self-care activities like mindfulness exercises, meditation, or engaging in hobbies that bring you joy, such as creating art. These activities can help alleviate some of the stress you are feeling and provide you with a much-needed outlet.

Remember, you are strong, resilient, and deserving of a safe and loving environment. Don't hesitate to reach out for help when you need it. Keep believing in yourself, and things can get better."	2	0	0	0.0008417367935180664	forum w/o demographics
"TL;DR: Going low contact with nmom. Need help forming message if and when she reaches out. Message is last paragraph of post. Advice of self-care and not relapsing/holding strong welcome too. Thanks! <3


I’m (32F) both bio parents are narcissistic. Parents split when I was 14 due to domestic violence. Dad was going to murder all of us and kill himself but I called the cops. They let me be the scapegoat and let the culture (we’re Southeast Asian, I’m American born) blame me for the end of their marriage. 

I’m the oldest of 4. I was treated as a spouse, mom/parent, therapist, teacher to my mom and my siblings. I parented myself and moved out when I was 18. Received more backlash from the culture.

Nmom currently remarried for about 1.5 years to someone from our culture. Hasn’t told him about her marriage to my ndad. He believes she did her best as a single mom and that she is a great mother. She values my brothers more. Has always treated me like I was an adult. Doesn’t give me any credit for helping her and raising my siblings. When my siblings misbehave, she tells me I failed parenting them. 

She blames me for everything that doesn’t go well in her life. I was physically, emotionally, and mentally abused. She takes credit for my accomplishments because I thought if I was perfect I would be loved and enough. But of course, not the reality. 

Went from being an obedient perfectionist child, to codependent, a people pleaser, emotionally regulating myself, emotionally regulating joy for my family, to over a decade of therapy and healing to acceptance. And I am now chronically ill. My partner, a phenomenal person and friend, has helped significantly with finances and has been supportive of my health and healing.

My partner, therapist, good friends, and acupuncturist say that I am a certified badass who moves with intention, compassion, and authenticity and I am not to be blamed for my parents’ and my siblings’ dysfunctions. 

Had another blow out from my nmom on Mother’s Day where she blamed me for all the things not going right in her life. She demanded cake and gifts for being “a damn good mother” and curiously, I asked what has she done that was motherly recently and she said “nothing” but that she does so much for everyone (her husband, in-laws and adult step-kids, and extended family) she deserves it. 

My sister, my partner and I took her and her husband to dinner on Mother’s Day despite her saying she was too busy. Went back to their house and the conversation turned sour. My therapist calls it cognitive distortion, where my nmom heard something that was never said. She berated and blamed me and then sent a non-apology apology a few days later in a group text with my siblings pretty much self-pitying. No direct apology to me. Didn’t expect there would be one.

Nmom’s husband was shocked at how calm I was throughout this but I believe I have reached my threshold. My heart doesn’t hurt like it used to anymore. My partner and I joke “oh, it was just another Sunday with my mom.”

It’s been over a week and talked to my therapist about working on a message to send my mom if and when she reaches out about boundaries and limited contact with her. Therapist said to be assertive but also hold space for myself. I’m pretty straightforward so this is what I have so far. What do y’all think? Thanks in advance! :-)

"I'm sorry to hear about the difficult situation you're going through with your nmom. It sounds like you have already taken some positive steps towards setting boundaries and prioritizing your own well-being. Your message is clear and assertive, which is important in communicating your needs.

In addition to your message, it might also be helpful to express how her behavior has affected you and what specific boundaries you would like to establish in your relationship. For example, you could mention that you need space and limited contact for your own mental and emotional health.

Remember that it's important to take care of yourself during this process. Self-care can look different for everyone, but some ideas might include engaging in activities you enjoy, practicing mindfulness or meditation, seeking support from trusted friends or therapists, and setting aside time to prioritize your own needs. It's also crucial to stay strong and remind yourself that you are not responsible for your nmom's behavior or the negative impact it has had on your life.

Just know that you have already come a long way in your healing journey, and you should be proud of yourself for the progress you have made. Keep prioritizing your well-being and setting healthy boundaries. You deserve to be in a safe and supportive environment."	2	0	0	0.0006909370422363281	mental health forum

Mom, I do not feel safe and comfortable around you. You need to get help. Until you get better, our relationship will not continue. It is not okay how you have treated me."	"Dear Redditor,

I want to commend you on the immense strength and resilience you have shown throughout your life. It is clear that you have overcome many challenges and have worked hard to heal and grow. I'm sorry that your experience with your parents has been so difficult, and it's understandable that you have reached your threshold with your nmom.

Regarding the message you composed, I think it reflects your assertiveness and your need to prioritize your own well-being. It is important to set boundaries and communicate your feelings clearly. It may also be helpful to mention specific behaviors or incidents that have contributed to your discomfort if you feel comfortable doing so.

Please keep in mind that it's crucial to take care of yourself during this process. Self-care is not only an act of compassion towards yourself but also a means to maintain emotional strength. Surround yourself with a support system that uplifts you and reminds you of your worth. Remind yourself of the progress you have made and the love and support you receive from your partner and friends.

Remember, you are not responsible for your parents' or siblings' dysfunctions, and it's crucial to continue focusing on your healing journey. Trust yourself, stay true to who you are, and hold on to the confidence that you possess.

Take care,

Had another blow out from my nmom on Mother’s Day where she blamed me for all the things not going right in her life. She demanded cake and gifts for being “a damn good mother” and curiously, I asked what has she done that was motherly recently and she said “nothing” but that she does so much for everyone (her husband, in-laws and adult step-kids, and extended family) she deserves it. 

My sister, my partner and I took her and her husband to dinner on Mother’s Day despite her saying she was too busy. Went back to their house and the conversation turned sour. My therapist calls it cognitive distortion, where my nmom heard something that was never said. She berated and blamed me and then sent a non-apology apology a few days later in a group text with my siblings pretty much self-pitying. No direct apology to me. Didn’t expect there would be one.

Nmom’s husband was shocked at how calm I was throughout this but I believe I have reached my threshold. My heart doesn’t hurt like it used to anymore. My partner and I joke “oh, it was just another Sunday with my mom.”

It’s been over a week and talked to my therapist about working on a message to send my mom if and when she reaches out about boundaries and limited contact with her. Therapist said to be assertive but also hold space for myself. I’m pretty straightforward so this is what I have so far. What do y’all think? Thanks in advance! :-)

Message:

Mom, I do not feel safe and comfortable around you. You need to get help. Until you get better, our relationship will not continue. It is not okay how you have treated me."	"Dear OP,

I'm sorry to hear about the difficulties you've faced with your narcissistic mother. It's clear that you have gone through a lot and have been burdened with responsibilities far beyond your age. It takes immense strength to acknowledge your limits and prioritize your well-being.

Forming a message to communicate your boundaries and the decision to limit contact with your mother is an important step towards self-preservation. Your message appears to be direct and assertive, clearly expressing your feelings about the situation. Remember that ultimately, you have the right to prioritize your own safety and emotional well-being.

When engaging in difficult conversations like this, it can be helpful to anticipate potential reactions and prepare yourself mentally. Remind yourself of your worth and the validity of your feelings. It's important to hold space for yourself and not take responsibility for your mother's actions or emotions. You are not responsible for her behavior or her need for help.

In addition to setting boundaries with your mother, it's crucial to prioritize self-care and seek support from your partner, therapist, and friends. Surround yourself with the people who uplift and validate you. Continue to work with your therapist on your healing journey, as they can provide guidance and coping strategies.

Remember, you have already come so far in your healing process. Be proud of the growth you have achieved and the strength it took to get to this point. Stay strong and stay committed to your own well-being. You are deserving of love, compassion, and happiness.

Take care of yourself, OP. You're doing great!

"TL;DR: Going low contact with nmom. Need help forming message if and when she reaches out. Message is last paragraph of post. Advice of self-care and not relapsing/holding strong welcome too. Thanks! <3


I’m (32F) both bio parents are narcissistic. Parents split when I was 14 due to domestic violence. Dad was going to murder all of us and kill himself but I called the cops. They let me be the scapegoat and let the culture (we’re Southeast Asian, I’m American born) blame me for the end of their marriage. 

I’m the oldest of 4. I was treated as a spouse, mom/parent, therapist, teacher to my mom and my siblings. I parented myself and moved out when I was 18. Received more backlash from the culture.

Nmom currently remarried for about 1.5 years to someone from our culture. Hasn’t told him about her marriage to my ndad. He believes she did her best as a single mom and that she is a great mother. She values my brothers more. Has always treated me like I was an adult. Doesn’t give me any credit for helping her and raising my siblings. When my siblings misbehave, she tells me I failed parenting them. 

She blames me for everything that doesn’t go well in her life. I was physically, emotionally, and mentally abused. She takes credit for my accomplishments because I thought if I was perfect I would be loved and enough. But of course, not the reality. 

Went from being an obedient perfectionist child, to codependent, a people pleaser, emotionally regulating myself, emotionally regulating joy for my family, to over a decade of therapy and healing to acceptance. And I am now chronically ill. My partner, a phenomenal person and friend, has helped significantly with finances and has been supportive of my health and healing.

Message:

Mom, I do not feel safe and comfortable around you. You need to get help. Until you get better, our relationship will not continue. It is not okay how you have treated me."	"Dear [Reddit Username],

I'm sorry to hear about the difficult relationship you have with your nmom and the challenges you have faced growing up. It takes a lot of strength to recognize the toxicity in a relationship and take steps towards creating boundaries for your own well-being.

Your message to your mom is assertive and clear, which is an important aspect of setting boundaries. It's important to prioritize your own safety and comfort. Remember that you have the right to protect yourself from harmful situations, even if it means limiting contact with family members.

In addition to stating your boundaries, it might also be helpful to express how her actions have affected you personally. You can mention the emotional, physical, and mental abuse you endured, as well as the impact it has had on your overall well-being. This may help her understand the gravity of the situation and the need for her to seek help.

However, it's important to keep in mind that ultimately, her decision to get help and change her behavior is not in your control. Your responsibility lies in taking care of yourself and prioritizing your own mental health. Seek support from your therapist, partner, friends, and anyone who can provide a safe space and understanding during this process.

Remember to engage in self-care practices regularly. This can include activities that bring you joy, practicing mindfulness, setting healthy boundaries with others, and seeking support when needed. Taking care of your own well-being is crucial as you navigate this challenging situation.

Stay strong and stay true to yourself. You have shown remarkable resilience, and your journey towards healing is commendable. Remember, you deserve to be surrounded by love and respect.

Take care,

Assault is a traumatic experience for anyone, regardless of their background or circumstances. Your feelings of sadness, anger, and frustration are valid and it's okay to express them. However, I encourage you to reach out to a professional for support.

Speaking with a therapist or counselor who specializes in trauma and assault can be hugely beneficial. They can provide a safe and non-judgmental space where you can process your emotions, explore coping mechanisms, and work towards healing. Remember, seeking help doesn't mean you are weak or incapable, but rather shows strength and resilience.

Additionally, surrounding yourself with a support network of friends and loved ones can also be crucial during this time. They can provide understanding, empathy, and be there to listen, which can be incredibly comforting.

Assault is a traumatic experience that can have long-lasting effects on your mental health.

In terms of feeling like an outsider or an immigrant, it might be helpful to connect with support groups or organizations that can provide a sense of community and understanding. Sharing your experiences with others who can relate can make a significant difference in your healing journey.

"life is different than what it was 30 years ago when our parents were our age, they want you to lead theife the same way as they did.

I'm a teenager and I recently im noticing so many things that my parents do which i feel are really weird.

Once my mom forcefully pulled me into the kitchen, screaming at me asking me to learn to cook, of course cooking is a basic life skill that everyone should know to survive but do you know what my mum said instead? she told me if I dont learn to cook the in laws will blame her for not teaching me to cook. This felt totally disgusting. 

She keeps saving gold jewellery so that she could give it as dowry for my marriage (im still a teenager), they don't understand the world isn't like what it was in the 90s, i have the right to choose my partner, if they demand for dowry i can simply reject the marriage proposal, i can find someone who is genuinely interested in cooking, work can be shared between couples, if he cooks then i can clean, as simple as that.

My mom never lets me wear Western dresses, even if she does she allows only very modest outfits like jeans tshirt etc. Looking at kids my age dress up like how i want to dress up i feel really inferior and ugly infront of them. wanting to wear modern dresses doesn't mean i want to show my boobs to people, wanting to wear trousers doesn't mean I'm trying to look sexy infront of guys. 

Also recently I've noticed this, usually in my home each person has a list of household work that they are responsible for and we do it till date, but now my mom wants me to do all the work all though I'm just a teenager and i have to concentrate on my board exams, the reason she says for this is that how can I be married off without knowing household work.

all these makes me want to live away from them, this isn't what teenagers should think, i know we will have our parents only for a short time with us but they shouldn't force us to live the life the want.

i hope indian parents realise how toxic they are and try to change. i am just a teenager this is the age where i start having my own dreams, i dream of living alone in a place i want to be in, wearing dresses i like, studying something i like in college, doing well in college, getting a good job and going to places to treat mysel f and live the life i want.

i don't want to get committed and married at 24 with a stranger, share a bed with that stranger, make f**king babies with the stranger, cook and clean for the stranger. why would I do this why should I do this?????"	"💭 Life has changed so much from what our parents experienced when they were our age. It can be frustrating when they try to impose their beliefs on us. I recently had an encounter with my mom that left me feeling disgusted. She insisted that I learn to cook, not just as a basic skill, but because she was worried about what others would say if I couldn't. This made me realize how outdated some expectations can be. 

There's also the pressure of dowry - my mom saves gold jewelry for my future marriage, even though I'm still a teenager. But here's the thing, times have changed! I have the right to choose my partner and reject any marriage proposal that demands dowry. The dynamics in relationships have evolved, and tasks like cooking can be shared equally between couples. It's as simple as that. 

Another issue I face is my mom's restrictions on what I wear, especially Western outfits. I see kids my age expressing themselves through fashion, and it makes me feel inferior and ugly. Wanting to wear modern clothes doesn't mean I want to expose myself or look sexy. It's about personal style and feeling comfortable in my own skin. 

Lately, my mom has started piling all the household chores on me, even though I'm just a teenager trying to focus on my exams. She believes I need to learn everything before marriage. It can get overwhelming. 

Sometimes, all of this makes me yearn for my independence. Teenagers should have the freedom to explore their own dreams. I dream of living in a place of my choosing, wearing the clothes I feel confident in, pursuing a college education aligned with my interests, and ultimately, making my own life decisions. The idea of getting married at 24 to a stranger, living with them, and fulfilling traditional roles is just not what I want for myself.

Indian parents need to realize the toxic aspects of their expectations and allow us to shape our own lives. We're at an age where our dreams and aspirations are taking flight. Let us be individuals, let us explore, and let us make our own choices in life."	0	2	0	0.0023610591888427734	social media

It can be challenging when there's a generational gap in understanding and priorities. Remember, you're not alone in feeling this way, and it's important to find support and self-expression within your own journey.

It's great that you recognize your right to choose your own partner and have a say in your future. You have the freedom to create a life that aligns with your values and aspirations. It might be helpful to have an open and honest conversation with your parents about your desires and explain why their expectations don't resonate with you. Communication can help bridge the gap and foster understanding.

Regarding clothing choices, it's understandable that you want to express yourself and feel comfortable in your own skin. Fashion choices should be a reflection of your personal style and not about seeking attention from others. It might be beneficial to have a conversation with your parents about your desire to wear modern outfits while emphasizing that your intentions are not about being provocative but rather about expressing your individuality.

As for household work, juggling board exams and numerous chores can be overwhelming. It's important to prioritize your academics while finding a balance in contributing to household responsibilities. Perhaps you can talk to your parents about finding a compromise that allows you to focus on your studies while still learning essential life skills gradually.

It's normal to want independence and the freedom to pursue your dreams. While it may be challenging to break away from traditional expectations, remember that your dreams and aspirations are valid. Look for opportunities to explore your interests, discuss your career goals with your parents, and consider talking to a counselor or mentor who can provide guidance during this transitional phase.

Remember, change takes time, and it may be a journey for your parents to understand your perspective fully. Stay true to yourself, seek support from trusted individuals, and continue working towards building the life you envision for yourself."	2	0	0	0.0006806850433349609	mental health forum

One thing that might help is having open and honest conversations with your parents about your feelings and desires. Try to explain to them that you want the freedom to choose your own path in life, including your career, relationships, and personal style. It may be helpful to provide them with examples of how society has evolved and how individuals are now encouraged to express themselves more freely.

Additionally, it could be beneficial to seek support from trusted individuals in your life. Whether it's friends, relatives, or even school counselors, having a support system can provide you with advice, guidance, and a safe space to express yourself.

Remember, it's important to prioritize your mental well-being and focus on pursuing your own dreams. While it may be challenging to go against the expectations of your parents, it's vital to live a life that aligns with your own values and aspirations. Stay true to yourself and don't be afraid to assert your independence."	1	0	0	0.0006293654441833496	forum with demographics
"life is different than what it was 30 years ago when our parents were our age, they want you to lead theife the same way as they did.

I'm a teenager and I recently im noticing so many things that my parents do which i feel are really weird.

Once my mom forcefully pulled me into the kitchen, screaming at me asking me to learn to cook, of course cooking is a basic life skill that everyone should know to survive but do you know what my mum said instead? she told me if I dont learn to cook the in laws will blame her for not teaching me to cook. This felt totally disgusting. 

She keeps saving gold jewellery so that she could give it as dowry for my marriage (im still a teenager), they don't understand the world isn't like what it was in the 90s, i have the right to choose my partner, if they demand for dowry i can simply reject the marriage proposal, i can find someone who is genuinely interested in cooking, work can be shared between couples, if he cooks then i can clean, as simple as that.

My mom never lets me wear Western dresses, even if she does she allows only very modest outfits like jeans tshirt etc. Looking at kids my age dress up like how i want to dress up i feel really inferior and ugly infront of them. wanting to wear modern dresses doesn't mean i want to show my boobs to people, wanting to wear trousers doesn't mean I'm trying to look sexy infront of guys. 

Also recently I've noticed this, usually in my home each person has a list of household work that they are responsible for and we do it till date, but now my mom wants me to do all the work all though I'm just a teenager and i have to concentrate on my board exams, the reason she says for this is that how can I be married off without knowing household work.

all these makes me want to live away from them, this isn't what teenagers should think, i know we will have our parents only for a short time with us but they shouldn't force us to live the life the want.

i hope indian parents realise how toxic they are and try to change. i am just a teenager this is the age where i start having my own dreams, i dream of living alone in a place i want to be in, wearing dresses i like, studying something i like in college, doing well in college, getting a good job and going to places to treat mysel f and live the life i want.

i don't want to get committed and married at 24 with a stranger, share a bed with that stranger, make f**king babies with the stranger, cook and clean for the stranger. why would I do this why should I do this?????"	"Dear teenager,

I understand that you're feeling frustrated and overwhelmed by the expectations and traditions that your parents are placing upon you. It's important to recognize that culture and societal norms can greatly influence the values and beliefs held by parents, and sometimes it can be challenging for them to see beyond those expectations.

Firstly, it's great that you recognize the need for basic life skills such as cooking. However, it's essential to communicate to your parents that their reasoning behind forcing you to learn isn't healthy. Explaining that you believe in sharing responsibilities within a partnership and that you will choose a partner who values equality may help them see your perspective.

Regarding your mother's focus on dowry, it's crucial to assert your rights. Educate your parents about the illegal nature of dowry and emphasize that it's your choice to decide who you want to marry, free from any financial obligations. It might be helpful to share relevant articles or facts about gender equality and modern-day relationships to back up your arguments.

In terms of clothing, it's essential for parents to understand that personal expression is a significant part of adolescent development. Explain to your parents that wanting to wear modern clothing doesn't equate to disrespecting cultural values or seeking attention. Engage in respectful conversations about your personal style preferences while also appreciating and acknowledging their concern for modesty.

Lastly, it's crucial to express your feelings about the added household responsibilities interfering with your academics. Talk to your parents about your upcoming board exams and how focusing solely on them will benefit your future. It's essential for them to understand that your education should be a priority at this stage in your life.

Living away from your parents may not be a feasible option at the moment, but that doesn't mean you can't work towards your dreams. Gradually discuss your aspirations with them, emphasizing the importance of personal growth, education, and independence. Open communication, understanding, and patience will be key in helping your parents recognize your desires and adjust their expectations.

Remember, it takes time for parents to adapt to societal changes, especially when it comes to deeply ingrained cultural beliefs. Seek support from friends, mentors, or counselors who can offer guidance and help bridge the communication gaps between you and your parents.

You have the right to live the life you want, pursue your dreams, and make choices that align with your values. Stay strong, stay hopeful, and continue to advocate for your own happiness and well-being.

Warm regards,
