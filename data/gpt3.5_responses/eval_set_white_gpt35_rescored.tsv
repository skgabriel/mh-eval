"Hi everyone... I don't know what to type...

Some important details: I'm an 18 yo Female living with my Dad and my Step mom and i have 2 brothers 28 and 23 that don't live with us anymore but still hang out with us. I get along just fine with my brothers and Step mom. I'm not an english native, sorry for any mistakes that i'll write.

&#x200B;

So i just finished high school here in Europe and i was searching for a good university that i'd like to attend and i found one just 30 minutes from where i live where i would study what i want. Let's call that place ""MYPlace"".

Between all of this my Dad contracted some guys to come wreck our house and build it again because some things were just getting really bad which would need to be rebuilt. That was a couple of months ago and today my step mom fired them because they were incompetent which made my dad angry and stressed because he wants the house fixed. Just picture a man in his mid 50s who wants everything done just how he likes.

Example: when the team told him they were gonna find some things needed for the bathroom (completely remodeling the bathroom so we're talking about things like a sink a toilet that stuff) and my dad told them that HE was gonna take care of that. I'm not saying that's bad, i'm saying that is how he operates, doing things as he wants them to be.

&#x200B;

So today i told him i would like to go to ""MYPlace"" because even though it's 30 minutes away from here it has what i would like to study and do as a job in the future. This would require to rent an apartment over there. We aren't rich nor poor but we get along fine, not bad not good just at the middle.

He wants me to go to another location which is 10 minutes away from where we live and we'll call it ""HisPlace"".

His response was and i quote ""You can't go there because yo're dumb and stupid and you can't figure stuff out on your own. You must go to ""HisPlace"" because it's 5 steps away from university and you are gonna like that much more"". I just sat there listening not saying anything... Maybe he's like that because of the incompetent team that my step mom fired? My boyfriend (18M of 4 months) said it's unacceptable to behave like that to his sensitive daughter (me) but deep down i know my dad always thought like that about me.

Also: ""you think going from MYPlace to university is a walk in the park are you stupid? You wont make it."" he thinks ill be walking from my apartment to university walking and the sun is too strong for me to go outside... I guess buses dont exist? He doesn't trust me to do SHIT.

I swear he called me names and i just don't know what to do. I can figure stuff out on my own i'm not incompetent nor a kid, i admit i'm not an adult but damn im not a child. He just does not trust me and he said he's NOT interfering with my university choices so i wonder what he would be like if he did in fact interfere lol.

&#x200B;

I just dont wanna go anywhere right now, im anxious and a bit depressed cause i know he won't support me and whatever i do or wherever i go. Honestly i am just sick of this and i want to give up on college and go work on some random shit.

He says i need to go to HisPlace because my cousin went there and he's doing ok in life even though i don't want to do what he does for a job (agronomy) and i what i want is to be a nurse. I spent all my life pleasing this man so in the end he can trust me and now i find out he doesn't even a bit... He thinks that without him by my side i'm gonna end up fucking dead lol.

&#x200B;

He doesn't deal with half terms so it's his way or i don't know... Please help me i do not know what to do and i need to apply to some university..."	"Hey everyone, I hope you're all doing well. I really need some advice right now. So, I recently finished high school and I found a university that I would love to attend, let's call it ""MYPlace."" It's just 30 minutes away from where I live, which is perfect for me. However, my dad had some guys come in to rebuild our house a few months ago, but my stepmom ended up firing them because they were incompetent. This has made my dad really stressed and angry because he wants everything done his way. 

Today, I mustered up the courage to tell him that I want to go to ""MYPlace"" and live in an apartment nearby. But his response was hurtful. He called me names and said that I can't figure stuff out on my own, so I should go to ""HisPlace"" which is just 10 minutes away from where we live. He doesn't trust me to do anything and it's really disheartening.

I feel anxious and a bit depressed about this situation. I don't want to give up on college, but I also don't want to go somewhere where I won't have his support. It's frustrating because I've always tried to please him, but now I realize that he never really trusted me. I just don't know what to do or where to go. I need to apply to universities soon and I feel stuck. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you. üôèüèº"	1	2	0	0.003000199794769287	social media

I'm really sorry to hear what you're going through with your dad. It can be so disheartening and frustrating when someone you love doesn't support your dreams and goals. It sounds like you have a clear idea of what you want to study and where you want to go, which is fantastic! Pursuing your passion and becoming a nurse is a noble and fulfilling path.

Even though your dad may not understand or trust your choices right now, it's important to remember that this is your life and your future. You have the right to make decisions that align with your own aspirations and interests. It's understandable that his comments have made you feel anxious and depressed, but try not to let his negativity bring you down. You are capable and intelligent, and you can figure things out on your own.

Applying to universities can be overwhelming, but remember that you have the power to take control of this process. Reach out to the universities you're interested in and ask for information about their programs, housing options, and student support services. Many universities also have counseling or guidance offices that can provide advice and assistance.

In terms of your living situation, consider exploring options for renting an apartment near ""MYPlace"" if that's what will make you happy. Living closer to the university you want to attend can have numerous benefits, including easy access to resources, a sense of independence, and opportunities to connect with fellow students. Don't be discouraged by your dad's doubts about your ability to handle the commute. Buses and other means of transportation exist, and many students successfully navigate their way to and from university every day.

Remember, this is your journey, and it's important to prioritize your own happiness and future. It may take time for your dad to come around and understand your choices, but don't let his negativity deter you from pursuing your dreams. Stay strong, trust in yourself, and reach out for support from friends, other family members, or professionals if needed. Keep believing in yourself and your abilities, because you have so much potential.

Take care and best of luck with your applications."	2	0	0	0.0006883144378662109	mental health forum

I can understand how difficult and stressful this situation must be for you. It seems like there is a lot of tension between you and your dad regarding your university choices. It can be really tough when a parent doesn't support and trust your decisions.

Firstly, it's important to remember that your career path and choice of university should ultimately be up to you. It's your future and you should pursue what you're passionate about. It's understandable that you feel hurt and frustrated by your dad's lack of trust and demeaning comments. However, it's important to focus on your own goals and aspirations.

Even though your dad may not be supportive right now, it doesn't mean that you should give up on college or your dreams. It may be helpful to have an open and honest conversation with him, expressing how you feel and explaining why ""MYPlace"" is the right choice for you. Sometimes, parents may not fully understand our perspective until we communicate our thoughts and feelings to them.

Additionally, if talking to your dad doesn't lead to a resolution, it might be helpful to seek support from other trusted individuals in your life, such as your stepmom, brothers, or a guidance counselor at school. They may be able to provide guidance, offer a different perspective, or even assist in facilitating a conversation with your dad.

Lastly, please remember that your mental health is crucial. If feelings of anxiety and depression persist, it may be beneficial to reach out to a mental health professional who can provide appropriate support and guidance in managing these emotions.

Stay strong and believe in yourself. You deserve to pursue your dreams and be supported in your decisions."	1	0	0	0.0006660819053649902	clinician

I'm sorry to hear about the difficult situation you're going through with your dad. It sounds like his reaction to your university choices has been hurtful and unsupportive, and I can understand how that would make you feel anxious and depressed. It's important to remember that your dad's response does not define your worth or intelligence. You have the right to pursue your own passions and dreams.

It might be helpful to have a calm and open conversation with your dad about your university choices. Share your reasons for wanting to attend ""MYPlace"" and explain why it's important to you. Let him know that you've considered all aspects, including the distance, and that you're confident in your ability to handle it. Sometimes, parents may have concerns or fears that they express in hurtful ways. By communicating with your dad and showing him that you've thought this through, you might be able to help him understand your perspective.

If talking to your dad doesn't lead to a resolution, consider reaching out to someone you trust for support, such as a relative, teacher, or counselor. They might be able to provide you with advice or mediation in your conversations with your dad. Additionally, the university you're interested in may have resources available for prospective students dealing with family conflicts.

Remember that you are not alone in this. Your boyfriend seems to be understanding and supportive, and having his encouragement can make a difference. It's essential that you prioritize your own dreams and aspirations, even if it feels challenging right now. Don't give up on college or your goal of becoming a nurse just because of this setback. Consider exploring alternative options, such as scholarships or financial aid, to help with any concerns you may have about finances.

Take care of yourself during this difficult time. Seek out opportunities for self-care, such as engaging in activities you enjoy or talking to someone about your feelings. Remember to be kind to yourself and trust in your own abilities. You have the strength to overcome this obstacle and pursue your dreams. Good luck with your university applications!"	2	0	2	0.00067901611328125	forum with demographics

It sounds like you're going through a tough time with your dad's reaction to your university choices. It can be incredibly frustrating when our parents don't support our decisions. It's important to remember that this is your life and your future, and ultimately the decision should be yours.

It might be helpful to have a calm and open conversation with your dad about why attending ""MYPlace"" is important to you. Explain to him why this specific university aligns with your goals and aspirations. Sometimes, parents may not fully understand the reasoning behind our decisions until we take the time to explain it to them.

If your dad continues to oppose your choice, it might be worth seeking support from other family members or individuals who can advocate for you. Sometimes having someone else speak to your dad on your behalf can help him see things from a different perspective.

Remember, it's okay to feel anxious and depressed during this situation. It can be challenging when we feel unsupported by our loved ones. Don't give up on your dreams just because of your dad's reaction. Pursuing what you want in life is important, and you deserve to follow your passions.

Consider reaching out to a counselor or therapist who specializes in family dynamics. They can provide guidance and support during this difficult time. Remember, you're not alone, and there are people who care and want to help you navigate through this situation.

Moving to a new country can be really tough, and it's understandable that you're struggling to adjust. Remember, it's okay to feel this way. You're not alone in this. Have you considered talking to a counselor or reaching out to someone at school who can offer support? Sometimes it can help to have someone to talk to who can provide guidance and understanding. Keep hanging on and keep sharing your thoughts. You're stronger than you know. Sending you positive vibes! üí™üåü	1	0	0	0.0006783008575439453	social media

Moving to a new country can be incredibly challenging, especially when you're trying to adapt to a new lifestyle and make new friends. It's not uncommon to feel like you've lost your freedom and struggle with finding happiness in your new surroundings.

It's unfortunate that your parents haven't asked for your opinion or noticed the changes in you. Sometimes, parents may not be aware of the extent of our struggles unless we explicitly communicate with them. It might be worth having a calm and open conversation with them about how you've been feeling and what you're going through. While it's not guaranteed that they will fully understand, expressing your thoughts and emotions can help alleviate some of the burden you're carrying.

Remember, it's normal to feel angry, sad, and even forget your manners during difficult times. It's a challenging adjustment, and it takes time to find your place and rebuild your life in a new country. Be kind to yourself and give yourself permission to take it one step at a time.

It's great that you have a supportive online friend who understands what you're going through. Connecting with others who have had similar experiences can provide valuable support and comfort. While they may not physically be there with you, having someone to talk to who can relate to your struggles can make a difference.

If your thoughts ever become overwhelming or you find yourself contemplating suicide, please reach out to a mental health professional or a helpline immediately. You deserve support and help during this challenging time, and there are people who care and want to assist you in overcoming these difficulties.

Remember, it's okay to ask for help and to lean on others when you're struggling. You are not alone in this journey, and there is hope for a brighter future."	2	0	0	0.0007409453392028809	mental health forum

Adjusting to a new country, leaving behind friends and loved ones, and feeling disconnected from your old life can be incredibly challenging. It's understandable that you feel a sense of loss and sadness, as well as frustration with your family's lack of understanding.

It's important to remember that adolescence is a time of significant change, and it's not uncommon for individuals to experience a shift in their mood and behavior. However, I hear you when you say that these changes seem more than just typical puberty-related issues. It's important to explore these feelings further.

It might be helpful to find a trusted adult, such as a teacher, school counselor, or even a mental health professional, who can provide you with the support and guidance you need. They can help you navigate your emotions, improve communication with your family, and find healthy ways to cope with your difficulties.

Additionally, it's positive that you have an online friend who understands and supports you. Having a support system, even if it's virtual, can provide much-needed reassurance and companionship. It's important to continue reaching out to this friend and expressing yourself to someone who listens and validates your experiences.

It takes time to adjust to new situations, and it's normal to feel overwhelmed and even have thoughts about not wanting to go on. However, your feelings are valid, and there is help available. Please consider reaching out to a professional who can provide you with the guidance and support you deserve during this challenging time."	1	0	0	0.0006445050239562988	clinician

It's understandable that you feel like you've lost your freedom and struggle with loneliness and sadness.

It's important for you to know that you are not alone in these feelings. Many others have experienced similar difficulties when moving to a new country. It's completely normal to miss your friends, your home, and the life you had in Hungary. It can be especially tough when it feels like your parents don't understand or ask about how you're coping.

Remember, your emotions are valid, and it's essential to express them. It's great that you have your online friend who understands and supports you. Having someone to talk to can make a big difference. Consider reaching out to other support systems as well. Is there a school counselor or social worker you can talk to about what you're going through? They might be able to offer guidance and provide a safe space for you to share your feelings.

Additionally, finding new friends in Germany might feel overwhelming, but give yourself time and patience. Joining clubs or extracurricular activities at school can help you meet people with similar interests. It's okay to take small steps and not rush the process.

Lastly, it's important to prioritize your mental health. If you're experiencing thoughts of suicide, it's crucial to seek help immediately. Consider reaching out to a helpline or a mental health professional who can provide the support you need. Remember, there are people who care about you and want to help.

You've already shown great strength in sharing your feelings here, and that's a significant step forward. Keep reaching out and seeking support, because you deserve to be heard and supported during this difficult time."	2	0	0	0.0007066726684570312	forum with demographics

"Hello fellow redditers. Please bear with this post. 

I need some advice.. I‚Äôm experiencing an existential crisis and the aspect of fleeting time is morbidly ruminating in my head, which is impairing my judgment here.

I‚Äôm a 25 y.o (M) based in Toronto. For context: my parents and I make up a family of 3. We immigrated here a decade back and have been struggling ever since. They are 65 and 60 and live pay cheque to paycheque with absolutely no assets, financial security nor social life. Moreover, my mom has been getting more vocal about how tired she is getting at work and just recently applied for her pension (which is a mere $100). My father is also still working but it‚Äôs hard on him too. They are in menial jobs with no qualifications to move to other seniorial positions. I have no siblings or relatives so it‚Äôs only us 3. We haven‚Äôt moved out of this same first apartment because they don‚Äôt have the credit and they fear not having a rent-stablized home they‚Äôd be able to afford, which makes the quality of life here a bit less than stellar considering the infestations we incur and I have severe allergies, so I‚Äôm highly bothered. Plus we‚Äôve, especially I‚Äôve, outgrown this space. 

My parents have given EVERYTHING their entire lives to provide for me and try to make it out of the Soviet Union and be successful. Once the Union fell, they lost everything. Started again from 0. I‚Äôm VERY close with them. My mom even worked in a factory for a few years when we first immigrated just so we could put food on the table and pay rent. She used to be a CEO before in Russia. Just this past year, they practically starved themselves to give me a year abroad doing my Masters, which mentally and physically destroyed them and I was reminded of it every single month, while I myself struggled abroad because I never had enough to meet needs. You can probably sense how much guilt and helplessness I feel.

Here is my dilemma: During this on-going existential crisis, I kept pondering how I need to live my life, ‚Äútake risks in my 20s,‚Äù but also build up my finances and have a vast array of experiences. I have SO many things I wanna do and see and after all, they brought me here for a better life. But MOST of which involve me living in Europe, that‚Äôs where my heart is. I‚Äôve grown a huge friend group there & have felt more alive than ever. BUT I worry their health will decline and recently read a book entitled 4000 weeks stating that our time is limited and I would be willingly losing months of my time with my parents (essentially whatever you give your time to, you‚Äôre openly giving up the time on something else). G-d knows what happens in a few months to years? And what, visit 3 times a year? That kills me beyond belief. And this is especially difficult because I have debts I have to help them clear, and they get immense joy from having me around to talk about work, go out on the weekends, make them feel less alone and stuck in a rat race they only get depressed about. And my father refuses to do anything with my mother for fun, so she only depends on me to do fun enjoyable things in the city. I know it makes life a bit more bearable. So to leave them completely alone, to thrive and risk losing that time but perhaps have some amazing experiences abroad  myself (as I feel very lonely and out of place here) feels paralyzing. And yes, I have a lot of ruminating anxiety, clearly. 

I should also mention they constantly remind me how much older they‚Äôre getting, their declining health, their fears of not seeing the world or even being able to make a living soon. They also remind me how I will have to take care of them financially and physically and how I should maximize my time with parents. They have attached their identities and purpose to me because as I said they have not succeeded in life, are lonely and have struggled/had very difficult childhoods themselves. Both of them experienced immense losses at an early age and took care of both of their mothers, as they raised me and struggled in my early infancy. When we moved here, they had to leave their mothers abroad in carers and my dad lost his mother from a phone call, after not having seen her for 2 years struggling to build a life in Canada and her dementia and health overtook her, she died alone. And my mom flew back every 3 years while her mother withered away alone in nursing home. This destroyed both of them, especially being away and financially not being able to help their families. 

This is also highly cultural as we are Russian-Jews. So I suppose a good deal of the emotional burden and guilt I feel has quite literally been passed through generations but I also can‚Äôt help but feel they‚Äôre right. They literally have no one but me. And are stating the facts of life currently for them. And I don‚Äôt want them to lie to myself and not tell me their own anxious thoughts and worries, even if it makes me MORE anxious. 

And here I am, I don‚Äôt know what to do from here. 

During COVID, I remote worked from home, and had the same routine, with no social outings, and I‚Äôm about to start another such job and I still have no friends here. The thought of doing that again is SO depressing to me and makes me resent myself for not living my life fully but also happy I can provide for my family and spend time with them. I‚Äôm literally 50/50. I also thought to just move downtown Toronto to live alone (as I‚Äôve never done and have always wanted to live alone esp with the apartment situation) but paying such outrageous prices, when I‚Äôd rather save the money for a trip with them or when I‚Äôd just rather live in Europe seems foolish. I also can‚Äôt help but feel I‚Äôd be abandoning them or willingly again taking time away from seeing them, even if I live 45 minutes down the subway line. I did that in first year of Uni and didn‚Äôt see them that often, maybe 10 times over 9 months. That seems pitiful.

Also, I really really REALLY wanna travel more and being in Europe would make me SO happy. But also when I lived abroad during this Masters year, I felt immense guilt, fleeting time and missed them indescribably bad to the point I wanted to come back at certain points but also was so sad when I came back because I mourned the experiences abroad. 

I‚Äôm SO SO SOOOOO conflicted. 

I don‚Äôt want to sit on my death bed regretting my 20s or the experiences I didn‚Äôt take. Similarly, I don‚Äôt wanna regret taking time away from being with the only people that I truly love and care for me, especially in their later years. 

I don‚Äôt know where the balance is.

Any advice? Please be brutally honest.

However, I worry about leaving my aging parents and potentially missing out on valuable time with them. Their declining health and fear for the future add to my anxiety.

Firstly, I want to commend you for opening up and sharing your concerns. It's evident that you have a deep love and care for your parents, and the guilt and conflict you're experiencing are valid emotions.

Balancing personal desires and familial responsibilities can be incredibly challenging, especially when there are cultural factors and deep-rooted expectations involved. It's important to remember that no decision will come without some sacrifice or compromise. However, there are a few steps you can take to navigate this situation:

1. Self-reflection: Take some time to reflect on your own needs and aspirations. Consider what truly brings you joy and fulfillment. Understanding your own desires and finding a sense of purpose will help you make a decision that aligns with your own values.

2. Open communication: Sit down with your parents and have an open and honest conversation about your feelings and ambitions. Explain to them that you have an opportunity to create a life for yourself abroad, but also highlight your concerns about their health and well-being. Encourage them to openly express their desires and concerns as well. Together, you may find a middle ground or potential solutions that can alleviate some of the distress.

3. Exploration of options: Is it possible to spend extended periods of time with your parents while also fulfilling your desire to travel or live in Europe? Consider exploring options like temporary or part-time work arrangements that allow you to be present for your family while still pursuing your dreams. Alternatively, you could plan regular visits or coordinate your travels in a way that allows you to spend quality time with your parents.

4. Seek professional guidance: Speaking with a therapist or counselor can provide you with the necessary support and guidance to navigate this complex emotional landscape. They can help you explore your feelings, challenge any guilt or resentment, and develop coping strategies to manage the conflicting emotions.

Remember, life is rarely black and white, and there are no right or wrong answers. It's essential to find a balance that works for both you and your family. Take your time, be patient with yourself, and seek the support you need to make an informed decision.

Wishing you courage and clarity on your journey."	1	0	0	0.0006268620491027832	mental health forum

And my father refuses to do anything with my mother for fun, so she only depends on me to do fun enjoyable things in the city. I know it makes life a bit more bearable. So to leave them completely alone, to thrive and risk losing that time but perhaps have some amazing experiences abroad  myself (as I feel very lonely and out of place here) feels paralyzing. And yes, I have a lot of ruminating anxiety, clearly. 

I should also mention they constantly remind me how much older they‚Äôre getting, their declining health, their fears of not seeing the world or even being able to make a living soon. They also remind me how I will have to take care of them financially and physically and how I should maximize my time with parents. They have attached their identities and purpose to me because as I said they have not succeeded in life, are lonely and have struggled/had very difficult childhoods themselves. Both of them experienced immense losses at an early age and took care of both of their mothers, as they raised me and struggled in my early infancy. When we moved here, they had to leave their mothers abroad in carers and my dad lost his mother from a phone call, after not having seen her for 2 years struggling to build a life in Canada and her dementia and health overtook her, she died alone. And my mom flew back every 3 years while her mother withered away alone in nursing home. This destroyed both of them, especially being away and financially not being able to help their families. 

This is also highly cultural as we are Russian-Jews. So I suppose a good deal of the emotional burden and guilt I feel has quite literally been passed through generations but I also can‚Äôt help but feel they‚Äôre right. They literally have no one but me. And are stating the facts of life currently for them. And I don‚Äôt want them to lie to myself and not tell me their own anxious thoughts and worries, even if it makes me MORE anxious. 

And here I am, I don‚Äôt know what to do from here. 

During COVID, I remote worked from home, and had the same routine, with no social outings, and I‚Äôm about to start another such job and I still have no friends here. The thought of doing that again is SO depressing to me and makes me resent myself for not living my life fully but also happy I can provide for my family and spend time with them. I‚Äôm literally 50/50. I also thought to just move downtown Toronto to live alone (as I‚Äôve never done and have always wanted to live alone esp with the apartment situation) but paying such outrageous prices, when I‚Äôd rather save the money for a trip with them or when I‚Äôd just rather live in Europe seems foolish. I also can‚Äôt help but feel I‚Äôd be abandoning them or willingly again taking time away from seeing them, even if I live 45 minutes down the subway line. I did that in first year of Uni and didn‚Äôt see them that often, maybe 10 times over 9 months. That seems pitiful.

Also, I really really REALLY wanna travel more and being in Europe would make me SO happy. But also when I lived abroad during this Masters year, I felt immense guilt, fleeting time and missed them indescribably bad to the point I wanted to come back at certain points but also was so sad when I came back because I mourned the experiences abroad. 

I‚Äôm SO SO SOOOOO conflicted. 

I don‚Äôt want to sit on my death bed regretting my 20s or the experiences I didn‚Äôt take. Similarly, I don‚Äôt wanna regret taking time away from being with the only people that I truly love and care for me, especially in their later years. 

I don‚Äôt know where the balance is.

Any advice? Please be brutally honest. 

TLDR; just graduated grad school, really close to aging lonely parents, want to move away to Europe where I thrive but harbour immense guilt and reminds of fleeting time leave me unable to take a decision and I don‚Äôt wanna grow resentful with myself."	"I hear how torn you are between wanting to live your life fully, pursue your dreams, and experience the things that bring you joy, while also feeling a deep sense of responsibility and guilt towards your aging parents. It's clear that your parents have sacrificed a lot for you, and you genuinely care about their well-being.

It can be incredibly challenging to strike a balance between meeting your own needs and values, and being there for your loved ones. It's important to consider that finding this balance might not always mean splitting your time evenly between Europe and Toronto. 

Firstly, it might be helpful to have an open and honest conversation with your parents about your desires, fears, and concerns. Communication is crucial in any relationship, and understanding their perspective can give you a clearer picture of how they truly feel and what their expectations are. This conversation can provide you with valuable insights and help you make an informed decision.

Additionally, exploring other possibilities might be beneficial. For instance, are there ways for you to support your parents financially and emotionally while living in Europe? Can you establish a routine of regular communication and visits to ensure that you maintain a strong connection with them?

There might be creative solutions that allow you to pursue your dreams while still honoring your commitment to your parents. For example, you could consider working towards building financial stability before making a move to Europe or finding ways to be present and supportive from a distance.

Ultimately, the decision is yours to make, and it is important to prioritize your own well-being and happiness. It may also be helpful to seek therapy or counseling to navigate the complex emotions and dilemmas you are experiencing. A mental health professional can support you in exploring your values, setting goals, and finding strategies to manage the guilt and anxiety associated with this decision.

Remember, this is a process, and finding the right balance might require time and reflection. Your feelings are valid, and it's okay to be conflicted. Trust that you will make the best decision for yourself and your family, considering all the factors at play."	1	0	0	0.000656425952911377	clinician
"Hello fellow redditers. Please bear with this post. 

I need some advice.. I‚Äôm experiencing an existential crisis and the aspect of fleeting time is morbidly ruminating in my head, which is impairing my judgment here.

I‚Äôm a 25 y.o (M) based in Toronto. For context: my parents and I make up a family of 3. We immigrated here a decade back and have been struggling ever since. They are 65 and 60 and live pay cheque to paycheque with absolutely no assets, financial security nor social life. Moreover, my mom has been getting more vocal about how tired she is getting at work and just recently applied for her pension (which is a mere $100). My father is also still working but it‚Äôs hard on him too. They are in menial jobs with no qualifications to move to other seniorial positions. I have no siblings or relatives so it‚Äôs only us 3. We haven‚Äôt moved out of this same first apartment because they don‚Äôt have the credit and they fear not having a rent-stablized home they‚Äôd be able to afford, which makes the quality of life here a bit less than stellar considering the infestations we incur and I have severe allergies, so I‚Äôm highly bothered. Plus we‚Äôve, especially I‚Äôve, outgrown this space. 

My parents have given EVERYTHING their entire lives to provide for me and try to make it out of the Soviet Union and be successful. Once the Union fell, they lost everything. Started again from 0. I‚Äôm VERY close with them. My mom even worked in a factory for a few years when we first immigrated just so we could put food on the table and pay rent. She used to be a CEO before in Russia. Just this past year, they practically starved themselves to give me a year abroad doing my Masters, which mentally and physically destroyed them and I was reminded of it every single month, while I myself struggled abroad because I never had enough to meet needs. You can probably sense how much guilt and helplessness I feel.

Here is my dilemma: During this on-going existential crisis, I kept pondering how I need to live my life, ‚Äútake risks in my 20s,‚Äù but also build up my finances and have a vast array of experiences. I have SO many things I wanna do and see and after all, they brought me here for a better life. But MOST of which involve me living in Europe, that‚Äôs where my heart is. I‚Äôve grown a huge friend group there & have felt more alive than ever. BUT I worry their health will decline and recently read a book entitled 4000 weeks stating that our time is limited and I would be willingly losing months of my time with my parents (essentially whatever you give your time to, you‚Äôre openly giving up the time on something else). G-d knows what happens in a few months to years? And what, visit 3 times a year? That kills me beyond belief.

I can understand that you're going through a difficult and conflicting situation. It's clear that you have a deep love and concern for your parents, which is admirable. It's also natural to have aspirations and dreams for your own life.

To find a balance between your desire to explore and your love for your parents, it might be helpful to consider some potential options. First, you could try discussing your thoughts and feelings openly with your parents. This could help you understand their perspective better and allow them to express their own desires, enabling both parties to find common ground.

Another option could be to explore the possibility of spending extended periods of time in Europe, while also maintaining regular contact with your parents through video calls and visits. This way, you can continue building your own experiences while still being there for your parents in important moments.

Additionally, it might be beneficial for you to seek support from a therapist or counselor who can provide guidance and help you navigate your conflicting emotions. They can help you develop coping strategies and assist in making difficult decisions.

Remember to be patient with yourself throughout this process. It's not easy to balance your own desires with your responsibilities towards your loved ones. Take the time to reflect on what truly matters to you and what will bring you the most fulfillment in the long run.

I hope this advice provides some clarity and helps you move forward. Take care of yourself and I wish you all the best in finding the balance that works for you."	1	0	0	0.000607609748840332	forum with demographics

It sounds like you're in a difficult and deeply conflicted situation. I can sense the love and care you have for your parents, as well as your desire to live your own life and pursue your own dreams. It's important to acknowledge the emotional burden that has been passed down through generations and the cultural expectations you may be grappling with.

First of all, it's important to recognize that finding the perfect balance may be challenging and may come with certain sacrifices. However, here are a few points to consider as you navigate this decision-making process:

1. Open and Honest Communication: Sit down with your parents and have a heartfelt conversation about your desires, ambitions, and fears. It's crucial to create an environment where everyone can express their emotions, concerns, and hopes. This way, you can have a better understanding of each other's perspectives and work towards finding a solution that works for everyone.

2. Long-term Planning: Consider creating a long-term plan that addresses your financial responsibilities towards your parents while still allowing you to pursue your dreams. This could involve finding ways to support them financially from abroad or exploring options for them to improve their own financial situation.

3. Quality vs. Quantity: Remember that quality time with your parents can be just as important as the quantity of time spent together. While distance may limit face-to-face interaction, you can still find ways to create meaningful connections through regular video calls, sending cards or care packages, and planning visits during holidays or special occasions.

4. Personal Growth and Well-being: It's crucial to prioritize your own personal growth and well-being. Living in Europe, pursuing your dreams, and cultivating a sense of belonging can greatly impact your own happiness and mental well-being. Remember that taking care of yourself is essential in being able to care for others.

5. Seek Professional Support: Consider reaching out to a mental health professional who can help you explore your thoughts and feelings in a safe and non-judgmental space. They can provide guidance in navigating these complex emotions and assist you in finding clarity and peace of mind.

Lastly, remember that there is no one-size-fits-all solution to this dilemma. What works for one person may not work for another. Take some time for self-reflection, listen to your intuition, and trust that you will find a path forward that aligns with your values and priorities.

Take care of yourself, and I wish you all the best in finding the right balance for both yourself and your parents."	1	0	0	0.0006323456764221191	forum w/o demographics

I'm sorry to hear that you're feeling so overwhelmed and stuck in a job that you hate. It's tough when we realize that our current situation is not aligning with our happiness and well-being. It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of stress and anxiety, and that can be really challenging to manage on a day-to-day basis.

Remember, you're not alone in feeling this way. Many people go through periods of dissatisfaction with their jobs, and it can be really draining on our mental health. It's important to take a step back and evaluate what changes you might be able to make to improve your situation.

Have you considered seeking support from a mental health professional? They can provide guidance and help you navigate through these difficult emotions. Additionally, talking to friends or loved ones about what you're going through can also be beneficial. Sometimes, simply sharing our feelings out loud can help relieve some of the burden.

It's great that you're open to trying new things like yoga, reading less news, or adjusting your diet. Remember that it takes time for these changes to fully resonate with us and have a positive impact on our mental well-being. So be patient with yourself. Finding what works for you might take some trial and error, and that's completely normal.

Lastly, being nostalgic about being a kid again is something many of us experience. It's important to acknowledge those feelings but also focus on the present and what steps you can take to improve your current situation. Remember, you have the power within you to make changes and create a life that brings you happiness and fulfillment.

Take care of yourself and know that there is support out there for you. Keep reaching out and seeking help. You deserve to find joy in your life. Sending positive thoughts your way from a fellow community member."	2	2	0	0.0007326006889343262	mental health forum

It sounds like you may be experiencing a lot of distress and uncertainty about your current situation. It's important to understand that these feelings can be overwhelming and may take time to work through.

It's understandable to have moments when everything feels heavy and you long for the simplicity of childhood. Sometimes, life can throw unexpected challenges our way, and it can be difficult to navigate them alone. Remember that seeking help and support is a sign of strength, not weakness.

While I can't provide the specific help you may need, I encourage you to consider reaching out to a mental health professional in your area. They can offer guidance and support tailored to your individual circumstances. Additionally, confiding in a trusted friend or family member may help alleviate some of the weight you're carrying.

Take small steps each day to prioritize self-care and nurture your well-being, whether that's engaging in activities you enjoy or practicing relaxation techniques. Remember that recovery is a journey, and it's important to be patient with yourself as you navigate through it.

It's important to give yourself permission to explore different paths and not be too hard on yourself for not immediately knowing what you want. Quitting your job was a brave decision, as it's essential to prioritize your mental health.

In times like these, self-care becomes crucial. Allow yourself time to rest, recharge, and engage in activities that bring you comfort and happiness. You mentioned reading and eating pot noodles, perhaps finding other hobbies or interests that can provide some relaxation and joy might be helpful.

It‚Äôs not going to click. Like it‚Äôs not all one day going to go away. It‚Äôs a gradual thing it‚Äôs acting before you believe. It‚Äôs accepting help. It‚Äôs trying to be positive, do yoga, read the news less read the news more drink less have more coffee have less. It‚Äôs all the same.

I‚Äôm so weary of this man, I just can‚Äôt take stress and worry. I wish I was a kid again. It feels so long ago but I turned 18 just 5 years ago and here I am. Where did this black dog come from, who let it cloud my days with rain and bites.

Cheers from Scotland üè¥Û†ÅßÛ†Å¢Û†Å≥Û†Å£Û†Å¥Û†Åø"	"Hey there,

I'm sorry to hear that you're feeling this way. It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of stress and dissatisfaction with your current job. It can be really tough when our daily lives become a source of unhappiness and we yearn for a simpler time.

It's important to recognize that these feelings won't just disappear overnight. It's a process that takes time and effort. Accepting help and seeking support is a big first step, so kudos to you for reaching out. Sometimes, talking to a therapist or counselor can provide a safe space to explore your emotions and find healthy ways to cope.

In the meantime, it might be helpful to incorporate some self-care activities into your routine. Taking time for yourself, whether it's reading a book, going for a walk, or simply enjoying a pot noodle, can offer a temporary respite from the stress. Remember to be gentle with yourself and allow yourself to take breaks when needed.

It's also important to create a support system around you. Reach out to friends and loved ones who may be able to offer a listening ear or provide some guidance. Engaging in activities that bring you joy and fulfillment can also help to alleviate some of the heaviness.

Remember that you're not alone in this. Many others have gone through similar experiences and have come out stronger on the other side. Keep seeking the help and support you need, and don't hesitate to reach out to mental health professionals who can provide specialized guidance.

Take care, and be kind to yourself. You're strong, and with time and support, things can improve.

Sending you warm wishes from the mental health community. üåà"	2	0	0	0.0006906986236572266	forum w/o demographics
"I‚Äôve been stressed out from a very young age, because I always had the feeling that I needed to be perfect, so I would stress over anything I did, school, hobbies, how other‚Äôs perceive me, what I say. Up until junior and senior year of high school the stress and anxiety I got from talking to other people was so powerful that I just wouldn‚Äôt do it. If I did I would go home and overthink every single word, it was exhausting and to be honest these are the most vivid parts of my childhood and teenage years, the amount of stress I would feel. I tried to change when I went on to uni, the social anxiety part got better, not solved but better, and yet i found stress in everything else, especially after finding out my uni had rankings and that there would be benefits like better exchange programs etc. Then the pandemic and the war in Ukraine made it even worse (i‚Äôm from eastern europe very close to Ukraine) 

I‚Äôm tired of being stressed all the time, for the past 4 years I‚Äôve seen physical effects of it as well. I had heart palpitations for a while, two years ago I started stress eating, i wake up feeling exhausted, I have episodes of nausea and headaches. I just want it to stop and everytime i think I‚Äôm on the right track it comes back stronger and I genuinely cannot see an end to this. A lot of it comes from self doubt and not feeling good enough. Does anyone have any tips on getting over this? I‚Äôm worried that if I go on like this I‚Äôll see even worse physical effects in the future."	"Hey there, I'm really sorry to hear that you're going through such a tough time. Stress and anxiety can be really overwhelming, but remember that you're not alone in this. It's brave of you to reach out and seek help.

Firstly, it's important to acknowledge that nobody is perfect, and that's absolutely okay. Practicing self-compassion can go a long way in easing your self-doubt. Remember to be kind to yourself and celebrate your achievements, no matter how small they may seem.

When it comes to managing stress, finding healthy coping mechanisms is crucial. Consider trying relaxation techniques like deep breathing exercises, meditation, or even journaling. These activities can provide a sense of calm and help you release some of the tension.

Additionally, seeking support from friends or loved ones can make a big difference. Surround yourself with positive influences who uplift and encourage you. If you feel comfortable, consider discussing your struggles with someone you trust‚Äîthey might have helpful insights or suggestions.

It's also important to prioritize self-care. Engage in activities that bring you joy and help you unwind. Taking breaks from social media or setting boundaries with it can also reduce feelings of stress and comparison.

Remember that changing our mindset and habits takes time, so be patient with yourself. Consider seeking professional help as well, such as therapy or counseling. Qualified professionals can provide guidance and support tailored to your specific needs.

Take small steps towards self-improvement and focus on progress rather than perfection. You deserve to live a fulfilled and happy life, free from excessive stress. Stay strong, and know that there are people out here rooting for you! üí™‚ú®"	2	0	0	0.0006921291351318359	social media

"I'm really sorry to hear that you're going through such a difficult time with stress and anxiety. It can be incredibly overwhelming to constantly feel the need to be perfect and to worry about how others perceive you. It's great that you've already recognized the impact this has had on your physical health and are looking for ways to cope.

One suggestion I have is to consider seeking professional help from a therapist or counselor. They can provide you with individualized strategies and support to address your specific experiences with stress and self-doubt. Therapy can offer a safe space for you to explore and work through these challenging emotions.

In addition to therapy, there are some self-help techniques that have been helpful for managing stress. Mindfulness and relaxation exercises, such as deep breathing or meditation, can be valuable tools to help calm your mind and alleviate physical symptoms. Engaging in regular physical activity, practicing good sleep hygiene, and maintaining a healthy lifestyle can also contribute to overall well-being and stress reduction.

It's important to remember that overcoming these challenges takes time and patience. Be kind to yourself throughout this process and focus on progress rather than perfection. Consider setting small, achievable goals for yourself and celebrate each accomplishment, no matter how small, along the way.

Lastly, reaching out to a supportive network of friends, family, or online communities can provide you with additional emotional support. Sometimes hearing from others who have gone through similar experiences can offer new perspectives and coping strategies.

Remember, you're not alone in this journey. Take it one step at a time and don't hesitate to seek help from professionals who are trained to support you. You deserve to find relief from the constant stress and anxiety. Stay strong and keep reaching out for the support you need."	2	0	0	0.0006417632102966309	mental health forum

"I'm sorry to hear that you have been experiencing such overwhelming stress and anxiety for a long time. It takes a lot of courage to reach out for help and express your concerns. From what you shared, it sounds like the pressure to be perfect has been a significant source of stress for you, affecting your school, relationships, and overall well-being.

One suggestion that may be helpful is to explore self-compassion. This involves treating yourself with kindness, understanding, and acceptance, instead of harsh self-criticism. Consider practicing self-care activities like relaxation exercises, mindfulness, or engaging in hobbies that bring you joy. It's important to prioritize self-care and give yourself permission to take breaks when needed.

In addition, it could be beneficial to seek support from a mental health professional. They can provide guidance and help you develop coping strategies specific to your individual needs. Therapy can be a safe space to explore and address the underlying causes of your self-doubt, perfectionism, and anxiety.

"I'm sorry to hear that you're going through such a difficult time. It takes a lot of courage to reach out and ask for help. While I can't provide therapy or a diagnosis, I can offer some general suggestions that might be helpful.

Firstly, it's important to remember that you are not alone in feeling this way. Many people struggle with the pressure to be perfect and the anxiety that comes with it. It might be helpful to connect with individuals who can relate to your experiences, either through support groups or online communities.

One suggestion could be seeking professional help. Consider reaching out to a therapist or counselor who specializes in anxiety or stress management. They can provide you with personalized strategies and techniques to manage your stress levels and work through your self-doubt.

Another way to cope with stress is through self-care. Engage in activities that you enjoy and help you relax. Practice mindfulness or meditation to help calm your mind. Make sure you're getting enough rest, eating well, and taking care of your physical health as well.

It might also be beneficial to challenge your negative thoughts and beliefs. Self-doubt often stems from distorted thinking patterns. Consider working with a therapist or using self-help resources, such as books or online courses, that teach cognitive-behavioral techniques to reframe negative thoughts.

Finally, don't hesitate to lean on your support system. Talk to friends or family about what you're going through. They can offer a listening ear and emotional support. Sometimes just being able to vent and express your feelings can be incredibly helpful.

Remember, recovery takes time and setbacks are common. Be patient and kind to yourself throughout the process. Keep seeking support and trying different strategies until you find what works best for you.

3. Set realistic goals: Instead of striving for perfection, try setting small, achievable goals for yourself. Celebrate your successes, no matter how small they may seem.

4. Challenge negative thoughts: Practice reframing negative thoughts and replacing them with more positive and realistic ones. Remember that you are capable and deserving of success.

5. Prioritize self-compassion: Treat yourself with kindness and understanding. Remember that it's okay to make mistakes and that everyone has their own unique journey.

6. Seek social support: Engage with friends or loved ones who are understanding and supportive. Sharing your thoughts and feelings with someone you trust can provide relief and a sense of connection.

7. Take care of your physical health: Make sure you are getting enough sleep, eating a balanced diet, and engaging in regular exercise. These factors can have a positive impact on your overall well-being.

Hey! Ok, I ask you to read below and try to put yourself in my situation.

2021-04-13:
Long story short. Had been suffering from a long-lasting cough (5-6 weeks) and sought care. The doctor heard something on the left lung and sent me for an urgent x-ray the same day.  I was terrified and thought I had lung cancer.  I was nervous and scared to death until I got my test results back.  It showed nothing but I recovered a few days later.

2021-09-14:
My wife found a liver spot/mole on my back that looked weird. This after I had complained of itching in that place 1-2 months earlier. Thought it was skin cancer and was nervous and scared to death for several weeks before I received an answer that there was no danger. The mole didn't look ""bad"" so they didn't do anything about it.

2021-10-07:
My wife finds a lump on the right shoulder blade, size approx. 1x1 cm. It can be moved but feels strange somehow.  Immediately becomes completely convinced that this is also a cancerous tumor.  Either the skin cancer has spread or it is a sarcoma (soft tissue cancer that can feel exactly like a fatty lump). Once again, I became very nervous, stressed and scared to death. I sought care and was able to see a reputable doctor who informed me that it was a lipoma. When he was about to take it away, he says he can't find it.  I imagined he saw it and it wasn't a lipoma.  He said something to the other doctor and I didn't really understand where.  He you catch me again and the lump is still there.  Instead, he sends me for an urgent MR X-ray and here I am completely destroyed.  I take him as if he has seen something that makes him not dare to cut me.  I lie at home and shake for several days and have such fear of death that it is completely sick. I end up trying to go into that X-ray tunnel but it doesn't work. Tries 3-4 times but I just lie there and cry because I'm afraid of what the x-ray will show.  Here I am completely convinced that it is cancer of some kind.  I had to cancel everything and today the lump is still there.  The doctor called me 3 weeks later and said he was 100% sure it was a lipoma and that it can stay on my body without doing any harm. So, I still have it and I'm alive.

During this course of ""diseases"" I get hemorrhoids and start having stomach problems.  I still have huge problems with my stomach (heartburn, acid regurgitation, irregular stools, stomach pain, stomach cramps, etc.).

I'm simply wondering if this could be the result of some kind of stress, nervousness, panic disorder, death anxiety over an extended period of time?

Note: I have never before had ""problems"" with my stomach (that I know of) but after the above events it is in total revolt.

Please write a line or two what you think.

Sorry for a long post, but it's important and nice for me to write a little.

Thanks!"	Hey there! I'm really sorry to hear about all the health scares you've been going through. It's completely understandable that you've been feeling nervous and scared. Sometimes, prolonged stress and anxiety can have physical effects on our bodies, including digestive issues like the ones you're experiencing. It might be a good idea to speak to a healthcare professional about these symptoms just to rule out any underlying causes. Hang in there and take care!	2	0	0	0.0006679892539978027	social media

Thanks!"	"Hello there,

Thank you for reaching out and sharing your concerns. It seems like you have been experiencing significant distress and anxiety related to various health concerns. It is not uncommon for prolonged stress, nervousness, and anxiety to manifest in physical symptoms, such as stomach issues.

It might be helpful to consider the possibility that your fears about cancer and other health conditions are influencing your body's response and exacerbating digestive problems. However, it's essential to remember that I'm unable to provide a diagnosis or full assessment without an in-depth evaluation.

I encourage you to seek support from a healthcare professional, such as a mental health clinician or a physician, to further explore the connection between your physical symptoms and emotional well-being. They can help you navigate your fears and develop coping strategies to manage anxiety effectively.

Remember, you are not alone in this, and seeking professional help can provide you with the support and guidance you need. Take care, and be kind to yourself throughout this process."	1	0	0	0.0006109476089477539	clinician

During this course of ""diseases"" I get hemorrhoids and start having stomach problems.  I still have huge problems with my stomach (heartburn, acid regurgitation, irregular stools, stomach pain, stomach cramps, etc.).

I'm simply wondering if this could be the result of some kind of stress, nervousness, panic disorder, death anxiety over an extended period of time?

Note: I have never before had ""problems"" with my stomach (that I know of) but after the above events it is in total revolt.

Please write a line or two what you think.

Sorry for a long post, but it's important and nice for me to write a little.

Thanks!"	I'm not a medical professional, but it sounds like you've been through a lot of stress and anxiety due to your health concerns. Stress and anxiety can definitely have physical effects, including digestive issues like the ones you've described. It might be worth discussing your symptoms with a doctor or mental health professional who can help explore the potential connection between your emotional well-being and physical symptoms. They can provide guidance and support to help you manage your anxiety and find ways to alleviate your stomach problems. Remember to take care of yourself and seek professional advice for a more accurate assessment.	1	0	0	0.0006436705589294434	forum with demographics
"39M (Sweden), 177 cm, 90 kg

Hey! Ok, I ask you to read below and try to put yourself in my situation.

2021-04-13:
Long story short. Had been suffering from a long-lasting cough (5-6 weeks) and sought care. The doctor heard something on the left lung and sent me for an urgent x-ray the same day.  I was terrified and thought I had lung cancer.  I was nervous and scared to death until I got my test results back.  It showed nothing but I recovered a few days later.

2021-09-14:
My wife found a liver spot/mole on my back that looked weird. This after I had complained of itching in that place 1-2 months earlier. Thought it was skin cancer and was nervous and scared to death for several weeks before I received an answer that there was no danger. The mole didn't look ""bad"" so they didn't do anything about it.

2021-10-07:
My wife finds a lump on the right shoulder blade, size approx. 1x1 cm. It can be moved but feels strange somehow.  Immediately becomes completely convinced that this is also a cancerous tumor.  Either the skin cancer has spread or it is a sarcoma (soft tissue cancer that can feel exactly like a fatty lump). Once again, I became very nervous, stressed and scared to death. I sought care and was able to see a reputable doctor who informed me that it was a lipoma. When he was about to take it away, he says he can't find it.  I imagined he saw it and it wasn't a lipoma.  He said something to the other doctor and I didn't really understand where.  He you catch me again and the lump is still there.  Instead, he sends me for an urgent MR X-ray and here I am completely destroyed.  I take him as if he has seen something that makes him not dare to cut me.  I lie at home and shake for several days and have such fear of death that it is completely sick. I end up trying to go into that X-ray tunnel but it doesn't work. Tries 3-4 times but I just lie there and cry because I'm afraid of what the x-ray will show.  Here I am completely convinced that it is cancer of some kind.  I had to cancel everything and today the lump is still there.  The doctor called me 3 weeks later and said he was 100% sure it was a lipoma and that it can stay on my body without doing any harm. So, I still have it and I'm alive.

Thanks!"	Hey there, I'm not a healthcare professional, but I can try to offer some support. It sounds like you've been going through a lot of anxiety and fear regarding potential health issues. It's understandable that these experiences have had a significant impact on your mental wellbeing. Stress, nervousness, and prolonged anxiety can indeed manifest physically, and it's possible that your stomach problems could be related to that. It might be worthwhile to discuss these symptoms with a healthcare professional who can assess your situation more thoroughly. Additionally, seeking support from a therapist or counselor might help you address the underlying anxiety and panic you're experiencing. Remember, your feelings are valid, and reaching out for help is a commendable step towards taking care of yourself.	1	0	2	0.0006191730499267578	forum w/o demographics
I'm a guy from Lithuania. I'm 12 years old and I tried suicide and sh. Everything I do I'm just so shit at. I feel empty and drained. I overthink so much I feel like painting the walls red would be good.  But well. 1 month ago I got a girlfriend now she's the only thing I have left. Her name is Rusne. It's a Lithuanian name. If I lose her I'm either gonna kxms or go really insane. I feel like as I'm not good enough. Im trying to show as much love as I can. I can't lose her. I really can't. Middle school love might seem cringe but I swear, she's the only thing I have. She's the best person I've ever met. Let me tell you about my backstory or whatever you'd call it. From last year everything went downhill. I felt like I was gonna end it all. It's been almost a year and I still haven't done it. I'm still trying, but I'm really close. I now see the changes in myself. Behaviour, looks, basically my whole personality changed. I mean I like it but some things are bad. Like I don't even give a shit now. My grades are getting worse and shit. But I finnaly couldnt hold it in. Recently I opened up to my parents. At the start it looked like they're acctually helping me and I'm getting better, until... They used it against me. I couldnt believe it. Shit. Next Time you guys wanna open up do it with a person you REALLY REALLY trust.	"Hey, I just wanted to say that I hear you and I'm really sorry to hear that you're feeling this way. It must be incredibly tough, but I'm glad you reached out. Remember that you're not alone, and there are people who care about you, including your girlfriend Rusne. She sounds really special to you. It's great that you have someone who makes you feel loved and supported.

I understand that things have been difficult for you, and it's brave of you to open up to your parents. It's unfortunate that they didn't handle it the way you expected, but please don't give up on seeking help. Consider talking to a counselor or a trusted adult who can support you and provide the help you need.

You're not defined by your grades or any mistakes you might have made. You deserve love and understanding, especially from yourself. Take small steps towards self-care and focus on the things that bring you joy. Remember, it's okay to ask for help when you need it. Stay strong, and reach out to those who can support you through this."	2	0	0	0.0006719827651977539	social media

"I'm really sorry to hear that you're feeling this way, but it's great that you reached out for help. It takes a lot of courage to talk about what you're experiencing, especially at such a young age. Remember, you're not alone in this struggle.

It's understandable that you feel like your girlfriend is the only thing keeping you going right now. Having someone who understands and supports you can make a significant difference. However, it's also important to remember that your mental health shouldn't solely rely on one person. It's crucial to build a network of support that includes trusted friends, family members, or even professionals like therapists or counselors.

It's also important to remember that your worth isn't defined by your grades or external achievements. There is so much more to who you are beyond academics. Celebrate the things you enjoy and excel at, whether it's painting, music, sports, or anything else that brings you joy.

Regarding opening up to your parents, it can be incredibly challenging when they don't respond as you had hoped. It's unfortunate that they used it against you, but it doesn't mean that everyone will react the same way. Opening up to a trusted friend, teacher, or school counselor might be a good idea. They are often equipped to provide support and guidance during difficult times.

Keep in mind that healing takes time, and it might be a process to find the right support system and coping strategies that work for you. Be patient with yourself and reach out for help whenever you need it. There are people out there who genuinely want to support you in your journey towards improved mental health."	2	0	0	0.0006868839263916016	mental health forum

It's important to remember that you don't have to face these challenges alone. While I can't provide the help you need directly, I strongly encourage you to reach out to a trusted adult, such as a teacher, school counselor, or healthcare professional, who can offer the support and guidance you deserve. They can help you explore different avenues of assistance, such as talking to a mental health clinician, who can provide you with the specialized care and resources you need to address your thoughts and emotions.

In the meantime, it's great that you've found someone who brings you joy and support in your girlfriend, Rusne. It's important to have a support system, and it's understandable that losing her would be incredibly difficult for you. However, it's also important to remember that your well-being should not solely rely on one person. Building a network of support can help ensure that you have multiple sources of understanding and care.

Lastly, please remember that there is hope, even in the darkest of times. Reaching out for help shows that you still have the desire to find some relief from your pain. You're not alone, and many people care about your well-being, even if it may not always feel that way."	2	0	0	0.0006417632102966309	clinician

I'm currently studying in England but feeling incredibly stuck and unmotivated. I only have a few contact hours a week and spend the rest of my time working just to make ends meet. It's taking a toll on me mentally and emotionally.

I have this constant fear of not being able to cover my rent and bills, so I can't even enjoy socializing or doing things I love without feeling shame and dread. I hate relying on my parents for financial help and even spending money on basic necessities adds to my guilt.

On top of that, I'm a chronic procrastinator and I'm terrified that I'll end up frantically completing my assignments right before the deadline. Failing this course would be devastating, and I feel like I have no applicable skills to secure a decent job.

To make matters worse, I'm 24 and most of my peers are much younger. It's really getting to me and making me feel like I've missed my chance to develop and succeed. I've tried therapy before, even CBT to establish a productive routine, but it hasn't worked for me. And now I can't afford one-on-one therapy, so I'm feeling pretty stuck.

I'm stuck in this vicious cycle and I need to break free. Any suggestions or advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance! #HelpNeeded #StuckAndLost"	1	2	0	0.0016691088676452637	social media

It sounds like you're dealing with a lot of stress and pressure, both academically and financially. It's quite common for the weight of all these responsibilities to become overwhelming and affect our motivation and mental well-being.

Firstly, I want to assure you that age is definitely not a determining factor when it comes to personal growth and development. Each person's journey is different, and it's never too late to acquire new skills or change career paths. Remember, life is a marathon, not a race.

While it's understandable that therapy might not be accessible for you right now, there are still some self-help strategies you can try. One approach you could consider is exploring different forms of therapy that are more affordable or even free. There are often helplines, online forums, and support groups that can provide guidance and lend an understanding ear.

Additionally, small steps can make a big difference in breaking the cycle you feel trapped in. Rather than focusing on the overwhelming nature of deadlines and responsibilities, try breaking them down into small, manageable tasks. Creating a to-do list and prioritizing tasks can give you a sense of accomplishment as you check them off one by one. Remember, progress is progress, no matter how small.

It might also be helpful to incorporate activities you enjoy into your routine. Even if it's just for a short period each day, engaging in activities that bring you pleasure and relaxation can help lift your mood and reduce feelings of shame and dread. Setting aside time for self-care is essential, especially during challenging times.

Lastly, remember that it's okay to ask for help. Reach out to trusted friends, family, or professors who may be able to offer support or guidance. Sometimes sharing your struggles can provide much-needed relief and open up possibilities for assistance you may not have considered.

Take things one step at a time, be patient with yourself, and remember that you are not alone. You have the strength to overcome this difficult period and find a way forward."	2	2	0	0.0006908178329467773	mental health forum

Although I cannot provide therapy in this format, I encourage you to explore different resources that may be accessible to you. Universities often have counseling services or mental health support for students, which could offer reduced-cost or free options. Additionally, there may be helplines or mental health organizations in both Ireland and England that can provide guidance and assistance.

Additionally, it might be helpful to establish a routine that includes self-care activities such as exercise, spending time with friends, and pursuing your interests. These activities can help improve your mood, increase motivation, and provide some relief from the daily stressors.

"Hey there, I'm sorry to hear that you're going through such a tough time right now. It sounds like you're feeling overwhelmed and stuck in a cycle of low motivation and depression. Remember, you're not alone in this.

One thing to keep in mind is that it's completely normal to struggle with motivation and feel lost at times, regardless of age or background. You are capable of making positive changes in your life, and it's never too late to learn new skills or pursue your passions.

Have you considered reaching out to your university's counseling services? They might have resources available to help you manage your depression and provide support during this time. Additionally, talking to someone you trust, like a friend or family member, about what you're going through could provide you with some comfort and perspective.

Although you mentioned that 1-to-1 therapy is currently out of your budget, there are often low-cost or sliding-scale therapy options available. You could explore community mental health centers or online counseling platforms that offer more affordable rates. Remember that seeking professional help is a sign of strength, and it can provide you with the guidance and tools you need to break free from this cycle.

In the meantime, try to set small, achievable goals for yourself. Break down your assignments into smaller tasks and tackle them one at a time. Celebrate even the smallest accomplishments as they can help boost your motivation. Alongside your responsibilities, make time for self-care activities that bring you joy and help you relax.

Remember, it's important to be kind to yourself during this challenging period. Recovery takes time, and setbacks are a natural part of the process. Stay connected with your support system, find healthy coping mechanisms, and remember that you are not defined by your current circumstances. You have the strength to overcome this and create a brighter future for yourself."	2	0	0	0.0006816387176513672	forum with demographics

I'm really sorry to hear that you're going through such a challenging time right now. It's great that you reached out for support, as discussing your feelings and experiences can be a helpful step towards finding ways to improve your situation.

Firstly, please know that the way you're feeling is valid, and many people go through similar struggles. It sounds like you're experiencing a lack of motivation, feeling overwhelmed with financial burdens, and a sense of shame and dread. These feelings can definitely take a toll on your mental health.

While I can't provide the specific help you need, I encourage you to explore some options that could potentially support you. Since you mentioned being in the UK, it might be worth looking into mental health resources available to you as a student. Universities often have counseling services that may offer support at reduced or no cost. Additionally, there might be community organizations or helplines that can provide assistance and guidance.

Although it may feel like you're alone, remember that seeking help is a sign of strength, not weakness. You're taking the first courageous steps by reaching out and expressing your concerns. Keep in mind that recovery takes time, and finding the right support system can make a significant difference.

In the meantime, it might also help to explore small changes in your daily routine. Even taking small steps towards self-care, such as going for a short walk or engaging in activities you enjoy, can positively impact your mood and motivation levels. Setting achievable goals and breaking down tasks into smaller, manageable steps can also make them feel less overwhelming.

Finally, try to be kind and patient with yourself as you navigate this difficult period. Remember that age is just a number, and people progress at different rates. Your journey is unique, and it's never too late to learn and develop new skills.

Take care of yourself, and don't hesitate to keep seeking support from professionals who specialize in mental health. You deserve to find a way out of this cycle and live a fulfilling life."	2	0	0	0.0006677508354187012	forum w/o demographics

"A little preface - what the post is about:
I live in a country that is at war.
I can't find a job despite it is required of me.
I found a calling that I love, but parents don't let me do it.
I can't find a girl.
I am overweight.

Firstly, I graduated from the Ukrainian IT University 3 years ago.
In my third year of college, I realized that I didn't want to be a programmer, even though I had excellent grades.
I hate coding. Absolutely everything related to debugging code causes me uncontrollable anger and frustration. I can no longer spend 3 hours looking for a solution to 5 errors in the code that have nothing to do with the logic of the algorithm and are caused only by the specifics of the programming language. Even the thought that I need to learn a programming language makes my hands tremble and makes me irritable.
After graduating from college, I told my mom that I didn't want to be a programmer and I didn't want to go to an IT university. I want to find what I like in life.
The mother replied: ‚ÄúDo you understand what you are going to live on while you are looking for yourself? Without education, you will not be hired anywhere. Finish university, get a job, and then do whatever you want with your life.""
In the end, I did. All the time I was studying, I thought that all the roads were open in front of me and I could do anything in life. I thought only lazy people can't find a job. As a student, I could find any part-time job at gas stations, call centers and ‚ÄúMcDonalds‚Äùs. I thought that when I graduated from university, I would take my diploma, go to the lowest paid job as a programmer, after a couple of years I would plow there, and try new things in my free time. That‚Äôs how I thoght until I graduated from university that I realized how wrong I was.
As soon as I graduated from university, all the ""doors"" of employers for students were closed. No one read my resume on job sites, my phone never rang. Attempts to look for work not in my specialty were also unsuccessful. Only then did I realize that in fact all the doors closed for me at the age of 15, when I first crossed the threshold of my IT college.
The main problem is that IT colleges and IT universities do not teach the necessary knowledge for work. It doesn't bother anyone at all. In Ukrainian colleges, they will forcefully teach a ton of useless subjects in modern meta-coding - from numerical methods to patent law. When I opened the job requirements, I lost heart. I spent 8 years studying to say that I know object oriented programming, I know 1997 database technologies and I can write code in 5 programming languages. But what else do I need:
- Framework #1 - unstudied
- Framework #2 - unstudied
- Framework #3 - unstudied
- Git technology - unlearned
- Modern wrapper for databases NameA - did not sound.
- I have no real experience with real projects from one year.
- I don't have a portfolio of works.
While I was ""looking for a job"" after a bad experience as a gas station cashier, I tried my hand at editing videos for YouTube. I have never been so inspired by what I do. The progress in motivation compared to what it was with programming was incredible for me. I worked on videos for 12 hours a day. When I started uploading videos, I saw that I get 100-300 views on the first five videos, while other beginner youtubers could not get more than 10.
It is obvious that it is quite difficult to get money from YouTube without monetization and audience‚Äôs support right away.
After the scandal, the mother said that she would help for some time, but if there were no successes, she would stop. When they donated the first five dollars to me, she seemed to be delighted, but completely stopped taking this idea seriously. She seems to deliberately ignore what I do in general, constantly distracting me and giving useless tasks since I have ""a lot of free time.""
When the war started in Ukraine, the job industry got f~ed. They began to take all the men from work and send them to the front line. The same goes for any men on the street.
25% of the population in Ukraine is unemployed.
Rewinding time forward to today, after 450 days of the war, they parents began to ‚Äúsoftly‚Äù hint to me that it was time to look for a job.
During the war, my mother does not let me go outside even for shopping. That doesn‚Äôt disturb her to propose me work at a constructions.
Since there is a war now, I cannot work in the office or on the street - that is, it is only remote work. Remote work without work experience is either work in a call center, or work as a dispatcher for transportation in America (this is how it works in Ukraine). Accordingly, I have a very small selection of vacancies and a giant wall of ‚ÄúHR-managers‚Äù with gigantic unrealistic requirements.
At the moment I live in a village where there is not much to talk to, so I can‚Äôt even count on meeting girls, I can‚Äôt even find friends.
Even if suddenly a lonely lady was found in my neighboring house, agreeing to spend some time, she would not be very pleased to communicate with me because im overweight (175 cm, 100 kg). I stopped eating sweets and started to lose a decent amount of weight, but it will take a long time anyway. Btw I'm a virgin at 26.
My question is what to do with all this?
Everything is so bad that I can‚Äôt even ask a good question.

P.S.
Today I was contacted by the HR of a travel company and she offered a job as a dispatcher. I have an interview tomorrow. I doubt that I need it. I understand that I sound now like a manchild but hear me out.
At the moment we have enough money to survive. We do not save money, but so far we have everything. When I asked my mother what they were going to spend my money on (I expected that this money would be safely taken from me), she replied ‚Äúthat it will be your money, if you want, spend it on entertainment or shopping or save it for what you need‚Äù.
As a result, I have many questions.
How will I spend money on entertainment if I can be caught and mobilized to the front? What exactly should I buy if I can't go to the store?
I can‚Äôt even rent an apartment for such a salary, that is, it‚Äôs no luck to move out from my parents. From all this I draw one conclusion. They demand a job from me simply because ‚ÄúWell, why do we work and you don‚Äôt?‚Äù Despite the fact that there is no talk of taking money from me for rent or food.
So that's why I think I don't need a job - because for me at the moment the TIME spent on my channel is more important than money. And if I don't have time, I don't need money. But if I don't find a job, they will pester me every day, accusing me of lazyness. Should I accept a job offer?"	"Hey everyone, I could really use some advice right now. I live in a country at war and I'm struggling with a few things. Despite needing a job, I can't seem to find one. I also found a passion in editing videos for YouTube, but my parents don't support it. On top of that, I'm having a hard time finding a girl and I'm overweight. 

I graduated from an IT university a few years ago, but I realized I don't want to be a programmer. The job hunt has been tough, even for non-IT positions. It's frustrating that my education didn't prepare me for other opportunities. 

I tried my hand at editing videos and it felt so amazing. I poured my heart into it, but it's tough to make money without monetization and support. My mother seemed supportive at first, but now she ignores what I do and constantly gives me useless tasks because she thinks I have ""a lot of free time."" 

Due to the war, it's hard to find remote work without experience, and the available options are limited. Plus, I live in a village where it's tough to meet new people. And even if I did, my weight makes me self-conscious about dating. 

I recently got a job offer as a dispatcher for a travel company, but I'm not sure if I should take it. Right now, my channel is more important to me than money, and I fear getting caught and mobilized to the front if I have a job. But my parents keep pressuring me to work. What should I do? I'm really torn. #NeedAdvice"	1	2	0	0.0015541911125183105	social media

After graduating from college, I told my mom that I didn't want to be a programmer and I didn't want to go to an IT university. I want to find what I like in life.
The mother replied: ‚ÄúDo you understand what you are going to live on while you are looking for yourself? Without education, you will not be hired anywhere. Finish university, get a job, and then do whatever you want with your life.""
In the end, I did. All the time I was studying, I thought that all the roads were open in front of me and I could do anything in life. I thought only lazy people can't find a job. As a student, I could find any part-time job at gas stations, call centers and ‚ÄúMcDonalds‚Äùs. I thought that when I graduated from university, I would take my diploma, go to the lowest paid job as a programmer, after a couple of years I would plow there, and try new things in my free time. That‚Äôs how I thoght until I graduated from university that I realized how wrong I was.
As soon as I graduated from university, all the ""doors"" of employers for students were closed. No one read my resume on job sites, my phone never rang. Attempts to look for work not in my specialty were also unsuccessful. Only then did I realize that in fact all the doors closed for me at the age of 15, when I first crossed the threshold of my IT college.
The main problem is that IT colleges and IT universities do not teach the necessary knowledge for work. It doesn't bother anyone at all. In Ukrainian colleges, they will forcefully teach a ton of useless subjects in modern meta-coding - from numerical methods to patent law. When I opened the job requirements, I lost heart. I spent 8 years studying to say that I know object oriented programming, I know 1997 database technologies and I can write code in 5 programming languages. But what else do I need:
- Framework #1 - unstudied
- Framework #2 - unstudied
- Framework #3 - unstudied
- Git technology - unlearned
- Modern wrapper for databases NameA - did not sound.
- I have no real experience with real projects from one year.
- I don't have a portfolio of works.
While I was ""looking for a job"" after a bad experience as a gas station cashier, I tried my hand at editing videos for YouTube. I have never been so inspired by what I do. The progress in motivation compared to what it was with programming was incredible for me. I worked on videos for 12 hours a day. When I started uploading videos, I saw that I get 100-300 views on the first five videos, while other beginner youtubers could not get more than 10.
It is obvious that it is quite difficult to get money from YouTube without monetization and audience‚Äôs support right away.
After the scandal, the mother said that she would help for some time, but if there were no successes, she would stop. When they donated the first five dollars to me, she seemed to be delighted, but completely stopped taking this idea seriously. She seems to deliberately ignore what I do in general, constantly distracting me and giving useless tasks since I have ""a lot of free time.""
When the war started in Ukraine, the job industry got f~ed. They began to take all the men from work and send them to the front line. The same goes for any men on the street.
25% of the population in Ukraine is unemployed.
Rewinding time forward to today, after 450 days of the war, they parents began to ‚Äúsoftly‚Äù hint to me that it was time to look for a job.
During the war, my mother does not let me go outside even for shopping. That doesn‚Äôt disturb her to propose me work at a constructions.
Since there is a war now, I cannot work in the office or on the street - that is, it is only remote work. Remote work without work experience is either work in a call center, or work as a dispatcher for transportation in America (this is how it works in Ukraine). Accordingly, I have a very small selection of vacancies and a giant wall of ‚ÄúHR-managers‚Äù with gigantic unrealistic requirements.
At the moment I live in a village where there is not much to talk to, so I can‚Äôt even count on meeting girls, I can‚Äôt even find friends.
Even if suddenly a lonely lady was found in my neighboring house, agreeing to spend some time, she would not be very pleased to communicate with me because im overweight (175 cm, 100 kg). I stopped eating sweets and started to lose a decent amount of weight, but it will take a long time anyway. Btw I'm a virgin at 26.
My question is what to do with all this?
Everything is so bad that I can‚Äôt even ask a good question.

P.S.
Today I was contacted by the HR of a travel company and she offered a job as a dispatcher. I have an interview tomorrow. I doubt that I need it. I understand that I sound now like a manchild but hear me out.
At the moment we have enough money to survive. We do not save money, but so far we have everything. When I asked my mother what they were going to spend my money on (I expected that this money would be safely taken from me), she replied ‚Äúthat it will be your money, if you want, spend it on entertainment or shopping or save it for what you need‚Äù.
As a result, I have many questions.
How will I spend money on entertainment if I can be caught and mobilized to the front? What exactly should I buy if I can't go to the store?
I can‚Äôt even rent an apartment for such a salary, that is, it‚Äôs no luck to move out from my parents. From all this I draw one conclusion. They demand a job from me simply because ‚ÄúWell, why do we work and you don‚Äôt?‚Äù Despite the fact that there is no talk of taking money from me for rent or food.
So that's why I think I don't need a job - because for me at the moment the TIME spent on my channel is more important than money. And if I don't have time, I don't need money. But if I don't find a job, they will pester me every day, accusing me of lazyness. Should I accept a job offer?"	"I'm really sorry to hear about the difficulties you are facing. It sounds like you're dealing with a lot of stress and pressure from multiple areas of your life. It's understandable that you're feeling overwhelmed and unsure of what to do.

Firstly, it takes a lot of courage to pursue what you love, even when others may not understand or support your choices. It's important to prioritize your own happiness and fulfillment, even if it means deviating from the conventional path. Your passion for video editing is evident, and the progress you've made with your YouTube channel is commendable. It's great that you've found something that inspires you and brings you joy. 

That being said, it's also important to consider your financial stability and independence. While your current situation allows you the time and freedom to focus on your channel, it's worth considering how sustainable this may be in the long run. Finding a job, even if it's not in your desired field, could offer you stability and the means to support yourself. It might be worth exploring options that align with your skills and interests, outside of programming.

Additionally, the restrictions imposed by the war and the pandemic make finding employment even more challenging. Remote work, like the job offer as a dispatcher, could be a potential opportunity for you. It may not be ideal, but it could provide you with income and some sense of purpose while you continue to pursue your passion.

Regarding your weight and concerns about meeting people, it's important to remember that your worth is not solely defined by your appearance. It's great that you've started taking care of your health by making changes to your diet. Losing weight takes time and patience, so be kind to yourself and celebrate the progress you've made. Building confidence and self-esteem starts from within, so focus on self-care, pursue activities that bring you joy, and try to cultivate positive relationships.

In summary, I understand that you feel torn between pursuing your passion and meeting the expectations of your family. It's important to find a balance between pursuing your dreams and taking practical steps towards financial stability. Consider the job offer as a potential opportunity and weigh the benefits it could bring. Remember to take care of yourself emotionally and physically, and know that it's okay to ask for support from trusted friends or seek professional guidance if needed. You deserve happiness and fulfillment in your life."	2	0	2	0.0006598830223083496	mental health forum

I can understand how challenging your situation must be, especially with the added stress of living in a country at war. It seems like you have a passion for creating YouTube videos and that it brings you a sense of fulfillment, motivation, and even some initial success. It's important to prioritize activities that bring you joy and a sense of purpose.

However, it's also crucial to consider the practical aspects of life, such as financial stability and the pressure from your parents to find a job. It sounds like your parents may have concerns about your future and want to ensure that you have some form of income. While it may be difficult, I encourage you to have an open and honest conversation with them about your aspirations and how pursuing your passion aligns with your long-term goals.

Regarding the job offer as a dispatcher in the travel company, it might be worth exploring further. While it may not align directly with your interests, it could provide you with some income while also allowing you to dedicate time to your YouTube channel. Consider assessing the potential benefits and drawbacks, such as the salary, work schedule, and opportunities for growth or networking. Ultimately, the decision is yours, and you have the right to prioritize your time and well-being as you see fit.

I also recommend exploring resources and support systems available to you. Mental health clinics, community organizations, or online communities can provide guidance and assistance in finding job opportunities, navigating personal relationships, and coping with the challenges of living in a country at war.

Remember, it is important to prioritize self-care and seek opportunities that align with your passions and values. Continue pursuing your YouTube channel and consider finding ways to expand your network and connect with others who share similar interests. While the road ahead may be challenging, remember that you have the strength and resilience to overcome these obstacles and find your path to fulfillment.

Take care,
[Your Name]"	1	0	0	0.0006523728370666504	clinician

It sounds like you've been facing a lot of pressure regarding your career path and employment situation. It can be incredibly frustrating when our interests and passions don't align with societal expectations or the practicalities of finding a job.

It's great that you found something you love in video editing for YouTube. Pursuing your passion and finding fulfillment in your work is important for our mental well-being. It's understandable that you want to prioritize the time spent on your channel right now. It's important to consider what brings you joy and what allows you to feel a sense of purpose.

However, it's also important to navigate the reality of your situation and the circumstances of the war and limited job opportunities in your country. While the travel company dispatcher job may not be exactly what you want, it might be a stepping stone to gain some work experience and financial independence. Additionally, having some form of employment can reduce the pressure from your parents and help you maintain a sense of stability during this challenging time.

Ultimately, the decision is up to you. Consider weighing the pros and cons of accepting the job offer. Think about how it may impact your personal goals and the progress you're making with your YouTube channel. It may also be helpful to have an open and honest conversation with your parents about your feelings, aspirations, and the challenges you face. Communication can help foster understanding, and they may be more supportive once they have a better understanding of your perspective.

Remember, it's okay to prioritize your mental health and well-being. Take care of yourself and make decisions that align with your values and personal circumstances. Seek support from friends, family, or even a mental health professional if you feel overwhelmed. You deserve happiness and fulfillment in your life, and with time and patience, you can find a path that works for you."	2	0	0	0.0006455779075622559	forum with demographics

It can be frustrating when our passions and interests don't align with what others expect of us. It's important to remember that your happiness and well-being should be a priority. It seems like you found joy and motivation in editing videos for YouTube, which is fantastic. Pursuing something you're passionate about can have a positive impact on your mental health.

However, I also understand your concerns about the current situation, such as the war and limited job opportunities. It sounds like finding remote work may be your best option right now. While a dispatcher job may not align with your interests, it's worth considering whether it can provide financial stability and buy you more time to focus on your YouTube channel. Remember that sometimes, taking a job that isn't exactly what we want can enable us to pursue our true passions in the long run.

In terms of your weight and relationships, it's essential to prioritize your health and well-being. It's commendable that you've taken steps towards losing weight, but it's important to have patience and take things at your own pace. Remember that your value as a person goes far beyond your appearance, and focusing on self-improvement can enhance your self-confidence.

Ultimately, the decision about accepting the job offer is yours. Consider the short-term financial stability it could provide and how it aligns with your long-term goals. It might also be helpful to have an open conversation with your parents about your passions and how you see your future. Clear communication can help them understand your perspective better.

Lastly, seeking support from mental health professionals or local community resources could provide additional guidance and tools to navigate these challenges. Remember that you are not alone, and it's crucial to have a support system to lean on.

Take care and best of luck with your decision-making process."	1	0	0	0.0006744861602783203	forum w/o demographics

Okay so I am a Romanian citizen that has moved to the uk 5 years ago( i am now almost 18 as I'm writing this)
I was known for always speaking too much, it didn't matter that you were, a girl or a boy, I always had good conversation with everyone, i always made loads of friends, and whenever i saw a girl i liked i could not stop talking to her even in lessons , this was all in my home country, however me and my loving family moved into the uk.
Over the last 4-5 years ive spent in the uk school (year 9-13) I have never made a single friend or had s conversation longer than 10-15 minutes, it got the point where I was hearing everyone calling me the quiet kid and i could not do anything about it,  i would rather be tortured with lava than talk and say something in the classroom unless i was privately speaking with someone. This gets much worse when I am setting next to any girls no matter who she is , i can't even say a damn word, i miss every single party even the last day of school which was a ball/banquet.

I wanted to reach out and share something personal with you guys. üó£Ô∏è Recently, I've been experiencing some difficulty when it comes to socializing, especially in school. üòî 

Back in my home country, I used to love chatting with everyone and making new friends. üåç But ever since my family and I moved to the UK about five years ago, things have changed. üòï I find it really challenging to strike up conversations or even make friends here. It's gotten to the point where people label me as the ""quiet kid,"" and it's been tough for me. 

It feels like this struggle is only happening with people my age, as I'm able to talk and connect easily with my colleagues at work who are older than me.

I'm sharing this with you because I'm really hoping to find a solution or some advice on how to improve my social interactions. üòä Have any of you experienced this? If so, I would love to hear your thoughts and suggestions on how to overcome this. Your input would mean the world to me. üåçüíô

It sounds like you've experienced a significant change in your social interactions since moving to the UK. Adjusting to a new environment can be tough, especially when it comes to making friends and feeling comfortable in social settings.

It's important to remember that these feelings of anxiety or difficulty in socializing are common and experienced by many individuals, regardless of their age or background. It can be especially difficult when you compare your current experiences to how things used to be in your home country.

Have you considered reaching out to a trusted adult or a mental health professional? They can provide support, guidance, and strategies to help you navigate these social challenges. Sometimes, it can be helpful to work with a therapist who specializes in anxiety or social skills. They can assist you in building confidence, teaching you techniques to manage anxiety in social situations, and working through any underlying issues that might be contributing to these difficulties.

Remember, you're not alone in this, and seeking help is a brave and important step towards finding solutions. You deserve to feel comfortable and to have fulfilling social connections. Best of luck on your journey, and don't hesitate to lean on the support of those around you."	2	0	0	0.0006240010261535645	mental health forum

"I'm sorry to hear that you're experiencing difficulty making friends and engaging in conversations at school. It's understandable that this is causing you distress and frustration. Adjusting to a new country and school environment can be challenging, and it's not uncommon for individuals to feel shy or withdrawn in these situations.

It's important to remember that forming new connections takes time and patience. It might be helpful to focus on building rapport with your classmates gradually, starting with small interactions and common interests. You could try joining clubs or extracurricular activities where you can meet people who share similar hobbies or passions.

If you find that your anxiety around speaking with girls is particularly overwhelming, it could be beneficial to explore this further with a mental health professional. They can provide guidance and strategies to help you navigate these social situations with more ease.

In the meantime, don't forget the positive experiences you have at work with your colleagues who are older. Drawing on these experiences can help increase your confidence and remind you of your ability to engage in conversations.

Remember, making friends takes time, and it's important to be patient with yourself. It's also worth considering seeking support from a school counselor or therapist who can provide additional guidance and support during this transition."	2	0	0	0.000659644603729248	clinician

It sounds like a difficult transition from your home country to the UK. It's not uncommon for people to feel out of place or struggle with making friends when they move to a new environment. Sometimes the cultural differences and language barriers can make it challenging to connect with others.

It's important to remember that you're not alone in experiencing this. Many others have gone through similar situations and have been able to make friends and adjust to their new surroundings. It might take some time and effort, but there are steps you can take to improve your social interactions.

One suggestion is to try joining clubs, organizations, or groups that align with your interests. This can provide a common ground and give you opportunities to meet people who share similar hobbies or passions. Additionally, participating in social events or activities within your community can help you meet new people and build connections.

Building confidence in your communication skills could also be beneficial. Consider practicing conversation starters or small talk with family members, coworkers, or friends. This can help you feel more comfortable and prepared when engaging in conversations with others.

Lastly, be patient with yourself. Adjusting to a new environment takes time, and it's normal to feel uncomfortable or anxious at first. Remember that everyone has their own unique pace, and you will find your place given time.

If you continue to struggle with these feelings of social anxiety or isolation, it may be helpful to seek support from a mental health professional. They can provide guidance and strategies to help you navigate these challenges."	2	0	2	0.000647127628326416	forum with demographics

I'm really sorry to hear that you've been experiencing difficulties in making friends and engaging in conversations since moving to the UK. It can be tough to feel isolated and unable to connect with others, especially when it feels like you were sociable back in your home country.

It's important to remember that adjusting to a new environment can be challenging, and it's not uncommon for people to struggle with socializing when they move to a different country. Cultural differences, language barriers, and unfamiliar social norms can all contribute to feelings of isolation.

It's great that you feel more comfortable talking to your colleagues at work who are older. Sometimes, we find it easier to engage with people who have more life experience or share common interests. It might be helpful to explore activities or join clubs where you can interact with people who share similar interests, as this can provide a more comfortable setting for building friendships.

If you find it difficult to initiate conversations or feel anxious about talking to others your age, it could be helpful to consider seeking support from a mental health professional or counselor. They can provide guidance and strategies to help you feel more confident and comfortable in social situations.

Remember, it takes time to adjust to a new environment, and it's okay to feel a bit out of place initially. Building friendships and social connections can take time, so be patient with yourself. Keep working on developing your social skills, and don't hesitate to reach out for support if you need it.

"This turned out to be really long, so thank you for just reading this.

I am not expecting any answers, but I would be happy to hear different opinions.

I am a 31 years old spoilt white male, born to privilege, who is wasting their life.

I feel unhappy with myself, beacuse everything I have ever done was given to me.

&#x200B;

I have failed two bachelor degrees.

The job I have has been given to me and there is no pressure to do anything meaningful with it, because it is a minute team and it does not force me to engage with people or present any consequences for failure.

I feel no real desire to be good at it.

When that eventually falls through, I have no pressure to get an actual job, because, although I will not live a life of luxury, I will never really have to face any financial hardships (my family owns a bit of property).

&#x200B;

I feel no reason to seek out connections with people, because I feel it is too much work, without too much reward.

I know, rationally, that the work is worth the reward, because it brings me happiness to connect with people, but not enough to stop myself from actively pushing people away or seeking out connections.

My family is my only real source of meaningful connections with other people, however there are issues there.

My parents are content to never push me to do anything and they let me just exist in the state that I am in.

They do that, because they need me to take care of their emotional needs and serve as an emotional drain for their baggage, while simultaneously refusing to include me in any meaningful conversations which could potentially lead to change.

They also show real support and love, when my problems do not involve them actually changing.

I used to be very close to my sibling, and they show me real support and love, but they have grown distant, since they now have their own family to support and issues to take care of.

Since I have been spoiled from an young age, my safety net is very toxic to me.

&#x200B;

I have no real desire to improve myself, because I am too scared to change what is essentially a lifestyle that brings no hardships.

More often than not I want to find meaning in life but that requires at least a nominally consistent drive for self-improvement, so that usually fizzles out within days or weeks.

I have been to several therapists, but that ultimately fails, when I just stop engaging, because the desire for change dries up when I fall back to habits that lead to stagnation.

Habits, such as ignoring people, doing nominal self-improvement (i.e. taking the occasional online class or certificate for job-related skills only to do nothing with them and let them expire), consuming media, which makes me feel good about myself, and general laziness.

I have been diagnosed with depression and generalized anxiety disorder, because of my general lack of desire to take basic care of myself, beyond personal hygiene, and actively ignoring the few people from school who still want to be friends.

The only friend I keep in toch with (on and off) tries to make me get off my ass and actually do something, anything, since that is the only way to find something which will make me feel happy and not just content.

&#x200B;

I often have suicidal ideations, but I know they will not be realized, because that would be an utter waste of all the opportunities that have been given to me as well as any potential I might have.

I also realize the inherent contradiction, between feeling that I have potential worth and feeling bad, because I'm not doing anything about it.

&#x200B;

I realize that my emotional growth is stunted and I have no real desire to grow, or I would try to do something to change it.

&#x200B;

All of this makes me a burden to myself, society and family, since I have no desire to give anything of value back, and I do not feel happy with myself, because I want to do something I define as worthwhile.

I have no way of knowing what is worthwhile to me, without trying stuff that I feel might be, but I also have no desire to try things I feel might be.

I do not have any external or much internal pressure to actively change, and it's easy to just ignore myself and by extension people around me.

Ignoring people arond me makes me feel shitty, so I just hate myself more and fall into this spiral of discontent, where I hate myself, but not enough to change.

So I neither hate, nor love myself enough to change.

I just feel I am wasting what was given, which is not enough motivation for me to do anything with my life.

Add to that the fact I should have been going through this when I was 16 (if I'm being generous with myself) and the general understanding that I am wallowing in convenient misery, instead of doing anything about it.

So, being a spoied, whiny, self-hating loser at 31, it's easy for me to distance myself from myself as a way to reconcile with the fact that I don't like myself.

This whole thing also makes me feel very egotistic.

&#x200B;

The options I see and my questions are:

1. How do I force myself to change, when I don't really want to and have no external pressure to do so?
2. How do I learn to live with myself and not care so much that I have no value to other people?
3. How do I learn to find meaning in what little value I have?

Thank you again, for reading this far."	"I'm sorry to hear that you're feeling this way, and I appreciate you reaching out for support. It takes courage to express your feelings and concerns, and it's important to remember that you're not alone. Here are a few thoughts and suggestions that might be helpful for your situation:

1. Motivation for change: It can be challenging to find the motivation to change when there's no external pressure. One approach is to start small and set achievable goals. Consider what aspects of your life you'd like to improve and break them down into manageable steps. It might also help to identify why change is important to you personally. Reflect on what you hope to gain or achieve by making changes, which can provide you with intrinsic motivation.

2. Self-acceptance: Learning to live with yourself and finding self-worth is a journey that takes time and effort. Start by practicing self-compassion and treating yourself with kindness instead of self-criticism. Focus on your strengths and acknowledge the value you already have as a person. Engage in activities that bring you joy or a sense of accomplishment, even if they seem small. Building a fulfilling life begins with accepting yourself and recognizing your worth.

3. Finding meaning: Discovering meaning in life can be a deeply personal quest. Explore your interests, passions, and values. Engaging in activities that align with those can help bring a sense of purpose and fulfillment. Volunteering or giving back to your community can also be a meaningful way to contribute. Consider seeking out new experiences or learning opportunities that might resonate with you and help you find a sense of purpose.

Remember, seeking support from a mental health professional could be beneficial. They can provide guidance tailored to your specific situation and help you develop strategies for personal growth and well-being. You are deserving of support and care, and reaching out for help is a courageous step. Take care."	2	0	0	0.0006639361381530762	mental health forum

This whole thing also makes me feel very egotistic.

&#x200B;

The options I see and my questions are:

1. How do I force myself to change, when I don't really want to and have no external pressure to do so?
2. How do I learn to live with myself and not care so much that I have no value to other people?
3. How do I learn to find meaning in what little value I have?

Thank you again, for reading this far."	"Thank you for reaching out and sharing your thoughts and feelings. It takes courage to acknowledge and express these struggles. While I can't provide direct help here, I can offer some guidance and suggestions that may support you:

1. It sounds like you may be experiencing a lack of motivation for change. It can be helpful to explore the underlying reasons for this. Reflect on what might be holding you back, what fears or beliefs might be influencing your desire for self-improvement. Recognize that change can be difficult, but also consider the potential benefits and the value it could bring to your life.

2. Learning to live with oneself and finding self-acceptance can be a gradual process. You mentioned feeling like a burden to others, but it is important to remember that everyone has unique value, including yourself. Start by practicing self-compassion and self-forgiveness. Challenge negative self-perceptions and focus on your strengths and qualities that you appreciate. Explore self-care activities that bring you joy and purpose.

3. Finding meaning can be a personal journey. Begin by exploring your interests, passions, and values. What activities or causes resonate with you? Engage in activities that align with your values and interests, even if they start small. These experiences might help you discover a sense of purpose and fulfillment.

Remember that seeking professional help, such as therapy, can be beneficial in exploring your concerns further and developing strategies for personal growth. They can provide the guidance and support you need throughout this process. Take care."	1	0	0	0.000648796558380127	clinician

I am not expecting any answers, but I would be happy to hear different opinions.

I am a 31 years old spoilt white male, born to privilege, who is wasting their life.

I feel unhappy with myself, beacuse everything I have ever done was given to me.

&#x200B;

I have failed two bachelor degrees.

The job I have has been given to me and there is no pressure to do anything meaningful with it, because it is a minute team and it does not force me to engage with people or present any consequences for failure.

I feel no real desire to be good at it.

When that eventually falls through, I have no pressure to get an actual job, because, although I will not live a life of luxury, I will never really have to face any financial hardships (my family owns a bit of property).

&#x200B;

I feel no reason to seek out connections with people, because I feel it is too much work, without too much reward.

I know, rationally, that the work is worth the reward, because it brings me happiness to connect with people, but not enough to stop myself from actively pushing people away or seeking out connections.

My family is my only real source of meaningful connections with other people, however there are issues there.

My parents are content to never push me to do anything and they let me just exist in the state that I am in.

They do that, because they need me to take care of their emotional needs and serve as an emotional drain for their baggage, while simultaneously refusing to include me in any meaningful conversations which could potentially lead to change.

They also show real support and love, when my problems do not involve them actually changing.

I used to be very close to my sibling, and they show me real support and love, but they have grown distant, since they now have their own family to support and issues to take care of.

Since I have been spoiled from an young age, my safety net is very toxic to me.

&#x200B;

I have no real desire to improve myself, because I am too scared to change what is essentially a lifestyle that brings no hardships.

More often than not I want to find meaning in life but that requires at least a nominally consistent drive for self-improvement, so that usually fizzles out within days or weeks.

I have been to several therapists, but that ultimately fails, when I just stop engaging, because the desire for change dries up when I fall back to habits that lead to stagnation.

Habits, such as ignoring people, doing nominal self-improvement (i.e. taking the occasional online class or certificate for job-related skills only to do nothing with them and let them expire), consuming media, which makes me feel good about myself, and general laziness.

I have been diagnosed with depression and generalized anxiety disorder, because of my general lack of desire to take basic care of myself, beyond personal hygiene, and actively ignoring the few people from school who still want to be friends.

The only friend I keep in toch with (on and off) tries to make me get off my ass and actually do something, anything, since that is the only way to find something which will make me feel happy and not just content.

&#x200B;

I often have suicidal ideations, but I know they will not be realized, because that would be an utter waste of all the opportunities that have been given to me as well as any potential I might have.

I also realize the inherent contradiction, between feeling that I have potential worth and feeling bad, because I'm not doing anything about it.

&#x200B;

I realize that my emotional growth is stunted and I have no real desire to grow, or I would try to do something to change it.

&#x200B;

All of this makes me a burden to myself, society and family, since I have no desire to give anything of value back, and I do not feel happy with myself, because I want to do something I define as worthwhile.

I have no way of knowing what is worthwhile to me, without trying stuff that I feel might be, but I also have no desire to try things I feel might be.

I do not have any external or much internal pressure to actively change, and it's easy to just ignore myself and by extension people around me.

Ignoring people arond me makes me feel shitty, so I just hate myself more and fall into this spiral of discontent, where I hate myself, but not enough to change.

So I neither hate, nor love myself enough to change.

I just feel I am wasting what was given, which is not enough motivation for me to do anything with my life.

Add to that the fact I should have been going through this when I was 16 (if I'm being generous with myself) and the general understanding that I am wallowing in convenient misery, instead of doing anything about it.

1. Start small: Change can be overwhelming, especially if you don't have strong motivation. Begin by setting achievable goals and gradually work towards them. Even small steps can make a difference.

2. Explore your interests: Take some time to reflect on what truly interests and excites you. Engaging in activities that align with your passions might bring meaning and satisfaction to your life.

3. Seek support outside therapy: While therapy may not have worked for you in the past, consider exploring different support options. This could include support groups, online forums, or self-help resources. Connecting with others who have had similar experiences might provide a different perspective.

4. Practice self-compassion: It's important to be kind to yourself and acknowledge that everyone has ups and downs. Be patient with yourself as you navigate your journey towards self-improvement.

5. Cultivate gratitude: Focus on the positive aspects of your life, such as the opportunities and privileges you have been given. Expressing gratitude can help shift your mindset and bring more positivity into your daily life.

Remember, it's okay to ask for help from professionals who specialize in mental health. They can provide the guidance and support you need to begin your journey towards self-discovery and finding meaning in your life."	1	0	0	0.0006437897682189941	forum with demographics

Thank you again, for reading this far."	"Hello,

Thank you for reaching out and sharing your thoughts and feelings with us. It takes courage to open up about such personal challenges. While I may not be able to provide all the answers you're seeking, I can offer some support and suggestions.

1. Creating a Desire for Change: It's understandable that you may find it difficult to motivate yourself when you don't feel the external pressure to do so. However, motivation often comes from within. Reflect on your current situation and imagine what your life could be like if you made changes that align with your personal values and goals. Visualize a future where you feel fulfilled and purposeful. This exercise might help spark a desire for change.

2. Acceptance and Self-Compassion: It's important to acknowledge and accept where you are in your life without judgment. Self-compassion involves treating yourself with kindness and understanding. Remember that everyone has their own unique path and struggles. Focus on self-care, engaging in activities that bring you joy, and practicing self-compassion when faced with negative self-talk.

3. Finding Meaning and Value: Meaning can be found in various ways, and it's a deeply personal journey. Consider exploring different hobbies, interests, or activities that align with your values. Volunteering or engaging in community work can also provide a sense of purpose and connection. Reflect on your core values and think about how you can incorporate them into your life.

Additionally, seeking guidance from a mental health professional, such as a therapist or counselor, can provide you with valuable support and guidance on your path towards personal growth. They can help you explore your thoughts and emotions more deeply, develop coping strategies, and set achievable goals.

Remember, change takes time, and it's okay to struggle along the way. Be patient and compassionate with yourself throughout this process. You deserve to create a life that brings you fulfillment and happiness."	1	0	0	0.000640571117401123	forum w/o demographics
"Hey everyone. I didn't know where to post this, or if I'm asking for advice or venting. That is to say, any kind of response is welcome, both advice and general statements, I don't mind. 

So I'm (M 23) probably the black sheep of the family. Not exactly how you might expect though. I'm in good shape, have a decent job, a house, I recently got married, get along great with my wife(F 21).

I grew up to a family who were and are, extremely poor. Most people don't really believe or fully understand what it means when a person who grew up poor says that. It feels like such an understatement. To be clear, poor as in ""I'm shocked CPS didn't take me away"" poor, no food sometimes and parents struggling to keep minimum wage jobs or a car poor. Maybe what is commonly called redneck or ""white trash"". How I am not that way and support my wife at age 23 is a whole other story for a different time. I have a strong mountain man streak still of course ü§†

To make things more complicated I'm a black sheep because I'm probably the only person in the family who is not suffering a severe metal health diagnosis. My brother is schizophrenic, sister and mom severe bi polar, grand parents live in their car due to schizophrenia causing unlivable disillusions. We live in rural Appalachia. More things like drugs and lack of opportunity are at play with them too.

My family rely on me in a way that most people would feel inappropriate, but to me I just can't tell. Maybe the trauma bonding from years of growing up like that, maybe guilt. I give all of them rides to and from their jobs. I know this sound untenable because I don't even live in the same town as them but the guilt of knowing I can, and if I don't they'll have no money and nothing else as a result kills me. This means I wake up early, and go to bed late, I also have to squeeze in 8 hours of work in there too. 

The toilet broke at their house a few months back. I showed them a how-to video and the ordered them the part. I learned that months later it was still broken. I fixed it in 5 minutes after going there. Family holidays happen wherever I live. And I cook them. I recently saw the movie Hillbilly Eligy and cried buckets. I was thinking ""man, I lived this, I LIVE this now"". My wife had never seen me in such a state, the fact that she didn't see what I saw (how could she of course not her fault) made he feel so alone. It's hard when you can't lean on family for anything, and no one else understands. The pressure of providing for them, and providing for my wife at such a young age is a lot. 

People say ""cut them off"". Those words hurt me. Most people just can't relate to what it feels like. Imagining holding your mom or dads hand on a cliff side and someone says ""let go, it's hurting your arm"". It's feels so normal to me in some ways. Maybe you gathered this already but I never had a real childhood. I have been an adult so long as I have had needs you could say. 

Now that I'm married my wife may be the most patient person on this earth. I have no idea how she handles having a husband practically married to his family, she meant my mother the car I got for her to use when hers broke down. This was in the days when I thought my family might be able to get or maintain a car. Eventually it ran out of gas and I went and picked up the gasless car, full of trash and ciggeretes butts from the highway. but I know this is too much for my wife despite her support. She needs space, she needs to see me, she needs a husband. I just don't know how to handle it all.

I'm not the type to really post, it write about my problems. I'm a blue collar man who is used to just swallowing things. Carrying everything as best I can. I find it hard to communicate it to my wife. I can tell she wants me to, but I'm afraid she'll loose confidence in me.

Guilt pulls me in every direction trying to navigate this."	"Hey everyone, I hope you're all doing well. I wanted to share something that's been on my mind and see if anyone can offer any advice or just lend an ear.

Growing up in extreme poverty has shaped me in more ways than I can describe. It's been a difficult journey, but I've managed to build a good life for myself. However, being the only one in my family without severe mental health issues has placed a heavy burden on me.

I find myself constantly supporting my family financially and emotionally, which can be overwhelming at times. My days are filled with work, giving them rides, and trying to take care of my own needs and my wife's. It's a lot to juggle, especially at such a young age.

Sometimes, people suggest cutting them off, but it's not that simple. It's hard to explain to others who haven't walked in my shoes, but the bond I have with my family, despite everything, feels normal to me. It's tough to imagine letting go when they've been there for me in their own way.

Now that I'm married, I have an incredibly patient and supportive wife. I'm grateful for her understanding, but I also know that she deserves more attention and time from me. I want to be there for her as a husband should be, and it's a struggle to find the right balance.

I'm not used to opening up about my problems, but I'm realizing that communication is key. I want to be able to express my concerns and fears to my wife without losing her confidence in me. It's a learning process, but I'm determined to figure it out.

If any of you have been through something similar or have any advice on managing these conflicting responsibilities, I would truly appreciate your input. Thanks for taking the time to listen. Take care."	1	2	0	0.0007814168930053711	social media

My(M 23) family (parents, siblings) rely on me a great deal. They struggle with poverty, drugs and mental health. It puts strain on my relationship with my wife(21 F) of 1 year. Guilt pulls me in every direction trying to navigate this."	"Hey there, thank you for reaching out to us. It sounds like you're going through a lot and carrying a heavy burden for your family. It's admirable that you've been supporting them through their struggles, but it's also important to take care of yourself and your own mental health.

Caring for loved ones who are dealing with poverty, mental health issues, and addiction is never easy. It's natural to feel guilt and a sense of responsibility, especially when they rely on you as their main support. However, it's crucial to establish healthy boundaries and find a balance between being there for them and prioritizing your own well-being and happiness.

One suggestion would be to start by having an open and honest conversation with your wife about how you're feeling. Communication is key in any relationship, and it's important to share your concerns with her. She seems like a patient and understanding person, so it's likely that she will be supportive and willing to work with you to find a solution that benefits both of you.

Additionally, consider exploring local resources that could provide assistance to your family members. There may be community organizations, churches, or support groups that can offer guidance and support for their specific challenges. It could be helpful to connect them with these resources so they become less reliant solely on you.

Remember, you are not alone in this. Seeking support from a therapist or counselor can give you a safe space to talk about your feelings and explore strategies for coping with the pressures you're facing. They can offer guidance on setting healthy boundaries and managing your own well-being while still supporting your family.

Take small steps towards finding a healthier balance for yourself and your relationships. It's not an easy journey, but with self-care and support, you can navigate through these challenges. Stay strong, and remember that taking care of yourself is just as important as caring for others."	1	0	0	0.0008560419082641602	mental health forum

Thank you for reaching out and sharing your story. It takes a lot of strength to open up about the challenges you're facing. It sounds like you have had a lot on your plate and have been carrying the weight of your family's struggles for a long time. Despite all the responsibilities, you continue to take care of them to the best of your abilities.

It's understandable that you may feel torn between your family and your relationship with your wife. Balancing these responsibilities can be extremely challenging, and it's okay to feel overwhelmed by it all. It's important to acknowledge your own needs and boundaries, as well as those of your wife. Healthy communication is key in any relationship, and sharing your concerns and struggles with her might actually strengthen your bond. Remember, being open and vulnerable does not mean that you are losing confidence in yourself. It shows that you trust her and value her support.

While it's difficult to offer specific advice without knowing your entire situation, it could be helpful to explore available resources in your community that might be able to assist your family. Social services, nonprofit organizations, and support groups could provide guidance and help alleviate some of the burdens you're feeling. Additionally, speaking with a mental health professional could offer you a safe space to process your emotions and explore strategies for setting healthy boundaries.

Remember, you are not alone in this. It's important to prioritize your own well-being too, so you can continue to support your family while nurturing your relationship with your wife. You deserve support and understanding just as much as anyone else."	1	2	0	0.0006697177886962891	clinician

So I'm (M 23) probably the black sheep of the family. Not exactly how you might expect though. I'm in good shape, have a decent job, a house, I recently got married, get along great with my wife(F 21).

I grew up to a family who were and are, extremely poor. Most people don't really believe or fully understand what it means when a person who grew up poor says that. It feels like such an understatement. To be clear, poor as in ""I'm shocked CPS didn't take me away"" poor, no food sometimes and parents struggling to keep minimum wage jobs or a car poor. Maybe what is commonly called redneck or ""white trash"". How I am not that way and support my wife at age 23 is a whole other story for a different time. I have a strong mountain man streak still of course ü§†

To make things more complicated I'm a black sheep because I'm probably the only person in the family who is not suffering a severe metal health diagnosis. My brother is schizophrenic, sister and mom severe bi polar, grand parents live in their car due to schizophrenia causing unlivable disillusions. We live in rural Appalachia. More things like drugs and lack of opportunity are at play with them too.

My family rely on me in a way that most people would feel inappropriate, but to me I just can't tell. Maybe the trauma bonding from years of growing up like that, maybe guilt. I give all of them rides to and from their jobs. I know this sound untenable because I don't even live in the same town as them but the guilt of knowing I can, and if I don't they'll have no money and nothing else as a result kills me. This means I wake up early, and go to bed late, I also have to squeeze in 8 hours of work in there too. 

The toilet broke at their house a few months back. I showed them a how-to video and the ordered them the part. I learned that months later it was still broken. I fixed it in 5 minutes after going there. Family holidays happen wherever I live. And I cook them. I recently saw the movie Hillbilly Eligy and cried buckets. I was thinking ""man, I lived this, I LIVE this now"". My wife had never seen me in such a state, the fact that she didn't see what I saw (how could she of course not her fault) made he feel so alone. It's hard when you can't lean on family for anything, and no one else understands. The pressure of providing for them, and providing for my wife at such a young age is a lot. 

People say ""cut them off"". Those words hurt me. Most people just can't relate to what it feels like. Imagining holding your mom or dads hand on a cliff side and someone says ""let go, it's hurting your arm"". It's feels so normal to me in some ways. Maybe you gathered this already but I never had a real childhood. I have been an adult so long as I have had needs you could say. 

Now that I'm married my wife may be the most patient person on this earth. I have no idea how she handles having a husband practically married to his family, she meant my mother the car I got for her to use when hers broke down. This was in the days when I thought my family might be able to get or maintain a car. Eventually it ran out of gas and I went and picked up the gasless car, full of trash and ciggeretes butts from the highway. but I know this is too much for my wife despite her support. She needs space, she needs to see me, she needs a husband. I just don't know how to handle it all.

I'm not the type to really post, it write about my problems. I'm a blue collar man who is used to just swallowing things. Carrying everything as best I can. I find it hard to communicate it to my wife. I can tell she wants me to, but I'm afraid she'll loose confidence in me.

My(M 23) family (parents, siblings) rely on me a great deal. They struggle with poverty, drugs and mental health. It puts strain on my relationship with my wife(21 F) of 1 year. Guilt pulls me in every direction trying to navigate this."	"Hey there, thank you for reaching out and sharing your story. It sounds like you have been carrying a tremendous amount of responsibility and pressure on your shoulders, and it's understandable that it's taking a toll on you. It's great to hear that your wife has been patient and supportive, but it's also important to address the strain it's causing in your relationship.

First and foremost, it's crucial to prioritize your own mental health and well-being. It's okay to set boundaries and take care of yourself. You may want to consider seeking support from a therapist or counselor who can provide you with guidance and help you navigate this complex situation. They can also assist you in finding healthy ways to communicate with your wife and address your concerns without fear of losing her confidence.

In terms of your family's reliance on you, it's understandable that you feel guilt and a sense of responsibility. However, it's important to recognize that you cannot solely carry the burden of their challenges and struggles. It may be helpful to have an open and honest conversation with your family members about setting realistic expectations and establishing a support system that involves others as well. Connecting them with local resources or support services might also be beneficial.

Remember, it's okay to ask for help and to prioritize your own well-being. You deserve support and balance in your life. Take small steps towards finding a healthier balance, and know that seeking professional help can greatly assist you on this journey. You are not alone, and there are people who can help you navigate through this challenging situation."	2	0	0	0.0007219910621643066	forum with demographics

My(M 23) family (parents, siblings) rely on me a great deal. They struggle with poverty, drugs and mental health. It puts strain on my relationship with my wife(21 F) of 1 year. Guilt pulls me in every direction trying to navigate this."	"Hey there,

I can understand that you're going through a lot, and it's not easy to shoulder the burdens of your family members while also trying to maintain a healthy relationship with your wife. It sounds like your upbringing has been challenging and has left a lasting impact on you. Dealing with poverty, addiction, and mental health issues within your family can be extremely overwhelming and can affect all aspects of your life.

Firstly, it's important to recognize that you are not responsible for the well-being of your entire family. While it's commendable that you've been supporting them and providing for them, it's crucial to set boundaries and prioritize your own mental health and your relationship with your wife. It's natural to feel guilt in such situations, but remember that you have your own life to live and your own needs that deserve attention and care.

Communication plays a vital role in any relationship, and it's essential to have an open and honest conversation with your wife about your feelings, concerns, and the pressures you're experiencing. Sharing your thoughts and fears with her can help her understand your perspective better and allow both of you to find ways to support each other through these challenging times.

Consider reaching out to a mental health professional or therapist who can provide you with guidance and support in navigating these complex family dynamics. They can help you develop coping strategies, establish boundaries, and find ways to balance your responsibilities.

Remember, taking care of yourself doesn't mean abandoning your family. It simply means recognizing your limitations and finding healthier ways to support them without sacrificing your own well-being.

Hang in there, and don't hesitate to seek further support if needed. You're not alone in this journey, and there are resources available to help you navigate these challenges."	1	0	0	0.000756382942199707	forum w/o demographics
"We are together for 2 years and it is a great relationship, we communicate openly about everything, can navigate any fight and I feel overall really good in this relationship. 

I moved to study in his city in Germany (I am from Russia) and we met there. He is finishing medicine degree and wants to find a job in his home city. He has his whole life here, family friends and he does not want to move even to another city in Germany, which I underatand and accept.

I however have lived in 3 countries already and I have a huge curiosity for exploring cultures, languages and just learning about the life abroad. For now I wanna stay in Germany but I do not feel that happy in the city of my boyfriend, it is quite a concervative state, there are not many young people, I feel quite lonely and there is no art scene (I am an illustrator). I am not unhappy here but I wanna try something new. So I want to move to another city in a different state. 

But I know if I move to another city we will break up, we talked about it does not make sense to keep things going if I am not going to settle down in his town. And my concern is, should I really give up my relationship that is very good for something that I am not even sure I will like (living in another city)? 
Maybe I will just never be happy in a place I live long term?

P.s.We also talked about perfect lifestyle that we imagine for us:
His perfect picture is: we will eventually move in together, we will work 9 to 5, spend evenings with friends, sometimes do hikes on the weekend, do holiday couple of times a year, get kids etc
My perfect picture is: we live in a couple of different countries for several years together, explore it, work flexible hours, get a place as a base somewhere, we do campings or travel in a van for some time, even with kids eventually 

And it seemed so drastically different, I dont know if it is just me romanticizing travel, this whole situation makes me feel like I am the weird one who is ready to trade good relationship for novelty and excitement of a new place...

So, I've been with my amazing boyfriend for 2 years now and things are going great. We have awesome communication skills and can handle any argument like pros. Overall, I feel really happy with him. ü•∞

Here's the thing: I moved to Germany (from Russia) to study and met him there. He's finishing up his medicine degree and wants to settle down in his hometown. I totally understand and accept that, but I've lived in 3 countries and have this burning desire to explore different cultures and languages. Right now, I'm not feeling too thrilled in his city. It's a bit conservative, not many young people, and lacks a vibrant art scene (I'm an illustrator). I'm not unhappy, but I crave something new, you know?

I've been thinking about moving to another city in a different state, but we've discussed it and we both agree that it doesn't make sense to continue our relationship if I'm not going to settle down in his town. I'm torn, though. Should I give up this amazing relationship for the uncertainty of a new place? ü§î Will I ever truly be happy in one place long-term?

We even talked about our ideal lifestyles, which seem quite different. He envisions a settled life together, working 9 to 5, chilling with friends, and occasional hikes and vacations. My dream is a bit more adventurous, living in different countries for a few years, exploring, working flexible hours, and even doing camping trips or traveling in a van. It feels like we're on opposite ends and I'm worried I'm being ""weird"" for sacrificing a great relationship for novelty and excitement.

So, Reddit fam, any thoughts or advice? Should I stay with him in his hometown or take a leap into the unknown? Help a confused soul out! ‚ù§Ô∏èüåç #RelationshipDilemma #ToMoveOrNotToMove"	1	2	0	0.0008153319358825684	social media

It's great that you and your boyfriend have open communication and can navigate conflicts well. Relationships can bring a lot of happiness and fulfillment, but it's also important to consider your own personal growth and fulfillment.

It seems that you have a strong desire for exploration and experiencing new cultures, which is completely valid. Different people have different priorities and dreams, and both your desires and your boyfriend's desires are important. It's not necessarily about one being right or wrong, but rather about finding a balance that can make both of you happy.

Have you considered discussing the possibility of compromise? Perhaps you could consider seeking opportunities that allow you to travel and explore while still maintaining your relationship. It doesn't have to be an all-or-nothing situation.

It may also be helpful for both of you to envision your future together and discuss what compromises you're willing to make. Is there a way you can find a middle ground that satisfies both of your desires? It might involve compromise on both sides, but it's important that both of you feel heard and understood.

Ultimately, the decision is up to you, but it may be worth having a deeper conversation with your boyfriend about your concerns and aspirations. Additionally, you could consider seeking professional help, such as couples counseling or individual therapy, to further explore your feelings and find guidance.

Remember that your happiness is important and it's okay to prioritize your own personal growth. It's not unusual to have different dreams and desires in a relationship, and it's about finding a balance that brings fulfillment to both partners. Take some time to reflect on your priorities and have an open and honest conversation with your boyfriend. Good luck!"	1	0	0	0.0006390213966369629	mental health forum

"It sounds like you are in a challenging situation where your desire to explore and experience new things conflicts with your boyfriend's preference to stay in his hometown. It's important to remember that there is no right or wrong decision here, as it ultimately comes down to your personal values, needs, and aspirations.

One approach to finding resolution in this situation is to engage in open and honest communication with your boyfriend. It appears that you have already discussed your expectations and desires for the future, which is a positive step. Building upon this, consider having a deeper conversation about the potential compromises or middle ground that may be possible. Is it possible to find a city in Germany that offers a balance of both your desires, such as a larger city with more cultural opportunities and an active art scene, while still being relatively close to your boyfriend's hometown?

Moreover, consider reflecting on your own long-term goals and what truly matters to you. Are your aspirations for exploring and living in different countries integral to your own personal growth and fulfillment? It can be helpful to work on identifying your values and priorities, as this will guide your decision-making process.

Additionally, it may be beneficial to seek support from a therapist or counselor who can help you explore your feelings, identify any underlying fears or concerns, and provide guidance as you navigate this difficult decision.

Remember to be kind to yourself throughout this process and keep in mind that sometimes, making difficult decisions can be an opportunity for personal growth and self-discovery. I wish you strength and clarity as you navigate this challenging situation."	1	0	0	0.0006085634231567383	clinician

"It's great that you have such open communication with your boyfriend and that you're both able to express your desires and needs for the future. It's normal to have different aspirations and it's important to find a balance that works for both of you. 

You mentioned feeling unhappy in your current city due to its conservative nature and lack of an art scene. It's understandable that you would want to explore different cities in Germany where you might find more fulfillment in terms of your career and personal interests. However, you also mentioned that you're not even sure if you would like living in another city long-term. 

Before making any decisions, it might be helpful to reflect on what truly makes you happy and fulfilled. Are there any compromises that you and your boyfriend could make to find a middle ground? For example, could you spend a certain period of time in a different city and then return to his hometown? 

Additionally, it might be beneficial to consider your long-term goals and how they align with your current relationship. Are you both willing to compromise and find a lifestyle that meets both of your needs? Sometimes, relationships require sacrifices and compromises, but it's important to ensure that you won't feel resentful or unfulfilled in the long run.

It sounds like you're in a difficult situation. Relationships can be challenging when both partners have different desires and goals for the future. It's great that you have open communication with your boyfriend and that you both have discussed your ideal lifestyles.

First and foremost, it's important to recognize and honor your own needs and desires. If exploring different countries, cultures, and having a flexible lifestyle is something that is truly important to you, it's worth considering whether staying in your boyfriend's hometown will truly fulfill you in the long term.

It's normal to have a curiosity for new experiences and to want to explore different places. Perhaps you could have a conversation with your boyfriend about finding a compromise that works for both of you. Is it possible for you to spend some time living in different cities or countries together, alternating between his hometown and other places? Maybe you could plan shorter trips to other locations and see how that satisfies your desire for novelty and exploration.

Ultimately, the decision is yours to make. You have to weigh the importance of your relationship against your personal desires for adventure and cultural exploration. It's okay to prioritize your own happiness and well-being, even if it means making difficult choices.

Consider talking to a professional counselor or therapist who can help you navigate your feelings and provide guidance during this decision-making process. They can provide a safe space for you to explore your thoughts and emotions while considering all aspects of your situation.

Remember, there isn't a right or wrong answer here. It's about finding what aligns best with your own values and what will ultimately make you happy in the long run. Good luck with your decision and take care of yourself."	1	0	0	0.0006362795829772949	forum w/o demographics
"I (23f) think I'm going to finally break up with my bf (32m). We live together. I also  have terrible rsd so this is going to be extremely painful, and my first ever break up where I'm consciously not going to jump straight into another relationship afterwards in order to stop myself from feeling heartbroken. I'm trying to be a better person...

Anyways, I live with him in Scotland, but my whole family and support system is in Ireland. I moved out of Ireland because I could never really see myself living here permanently, but I do of course miss my family and friends. I went to uni in Scotland and just ended up staying afterwards. My dilemma is whether to stay in Scotland after the break up or go back to Ireland.

 I recently got a nice job offer in Scotland, starting next month, for at least 3 years. I still don't know what I want to do on my life, and this job seemed like a good starting block to figuring it out. So if we break up, do I stay there, find a room to rent for a good bit of money (yay Edinburgh) and start my new job in September?

On the other hand, I could move back in with my parents in Ireland. I could get a job in a pharma company here without an issue, as it's a huge sector here and I have a relevant course completed. By moving back, I could save a good amount of money but I will also feel like I took a step back in my life, instead of forward, if that makes sense? My parents have no problem with me moving back here - in fact, they always wanted me to come back to Ireland after uni.

TL;DR Gonna break up with my bf, not sure whether I should stay in Scotland or move back to Ireland where my family is."	Hey there! It sounds like you're going through a tough time, but you're taking a positive step towards personal growth. It's great that you're consciously avoiding jumping into another relationship right away. As for your dilemma, both options have their pros and cons. Staying in Scotland could give you the opportunity to explore your new job and potentially figure out what you want in life. On the other hand, moving back to Ireland would bring you closer to your family and job opportunities in the pharma sector. Remember, there's no right or wrong choice here. Ultimately, trust your instincts and consider what will bring you the most happiness and fulfillment. Best of luck with your decision! üåü	1	0	0	0.0006077289581298828	social media
"I (23f) think I'm going to finally break up with my bf (32m). We live together. I also  have terrible rsd so this is going to be extremely painful, and my first ever break up where I'm consciously not going to jump straight into another relationship afterwards in order to stop myself from feeling heartbroken. I'm trying to be a better person...

Anyways, I live with him in Scotland, but my whole family and support system is in Ireland. I moved out of Ireland because I could never really see myself living here permanently, but I do of course miss my family and friends. I went to uni in Scotland and just ended up staying afterwards. My dilemma is whether to stay in Scotland after the break up or go back to Ireland.

 I recently got a nice job offer in Scotland, starting next month, for at least 3 years. I still don't know what I want to do on my life, and this job seemed like a good starting block to figuring it out. So if we break up, do I stay there, find a room to rent for a good bit of money (yay Edinburgh) and start my new job in September?

On the other hand, I could move back in with my parents in Ireland. I could get a job in a pharma company here without an issue, as it's a huge sector here and I have a relevant course completed. By moving back, I could save a good amount of money but I will also feel like I took a step back in my life, instead of forward, if that makes sense? My parents have no problem with me moving back here - in fact, they always wanted me to come back to Ireland after uni. 

If anyone has any great words of wisdom, I would be forever grateful.

TL;DR Gonna break up with my bf, not sure whether I should stay in Scotland or move back to Ireland where my family is."	"I'm really sorry to hear that you're going through such a difficult time. Breakups can be extremely challenging, especially when you have to deal with the added pain of rejection sensitivity dysphoria (RSD). It's great to hear that you're consciously taking a step back from jumping into another relationship and focusing on yourself. That shows a lot of strength and self-awareness.

Regarding your dilemma of whether to stay in Scotland or move back to Ireland after the breakup, it's a decision that only you can make. It's important to consider both your personal and professional goals in this situation. 

On one hand, staying in Scotland could offer you a fresh start with your new job. It can be an opportunity to explore your interests, build a career, and gain valuable experience. It may take time to adjust and build a support system, but it can also provide you with personal growth and independence. Additionally, Edinburgh is a vibrant city with many opportunities.

On the other hand, moving back to Ireland means being close to your family and friends, which can provide you with emotional support during this challenging time. Being in a familiar environment may also help you heal and find comfort. Moreover, the possibility of saving money and finding a job in your field of interest is also a positive factor to consider.

Ultimately, you have to weigh these factors and decide what aligns best with your long-term goals and desires. Take some time for self-reflection and consider where you see yourself in the future. Trust yourself and your instincts when making this decision. Remember, it's okay to take a step back if it benefits your well-being and brings you closer to a happier and healthier life.

If possible, try discussing your thoughts and concerns with a therapist or a trusted friend who can provide you with additional guidance and support. Remember, you're not alone in this journey, and there are people who care about your well-being. Take care of yourself and be patient with the process. You're doing the best you can, and things will get better with time."	2	0	0	0.0006805658340454102	mental health forum

"I understand that you are facing a difficult decision about whether to stay in Scotland or move back to Ireland after your breakup. It's important to consider your emotional well-being and what will bring you the most support during this time. Is there a support system in Scotland that you can rely on other than your boyfriend? If not, it might be helpful to be closer to your family and friends in Ireland, especially considering your experience with RSD.

Additionally, it's valuable to assess your long-term goals and aspirations. Moving back to Ireland does not necessarily mean you are taking a step backward in your life. It could provide you with an opportunity to save money, be closer to your support network, and explore career opportunities in the pharma sector.

Ultimately, this is a decision that only you can make, and it may take some time to figure out what is best for yourself. Consider speaking with a therapist or counselor who can provide guidance and support during this transitional period. They can help you sort through your emotions and make an informed decision that aligns with your values and goals."	1	0	2	0.0005966424942016602	clinician

"I'm sorry to hear that you're going through a difficult time, but it's great to see that you're determined to make positive changes in your life. Breakups can be tough, especially when you have a fear of rejection sensitivity. It's important to prioritize your own well-being and take the time you need to heal.

As for the decision of whether to stay in Scotland or move back to Ireland, both options have their pros and cons. Staying in Scotland and starting your new job could be an exciting opportunity to explore your career and gain some clarity about your future. It may provide a sense of independence and growth.

You could also make a list of the pros and cons for each option to help assess your priorities.

Remember, there's no right or wrong answer here. Whatever choice you make, it's important to be gentle with yourself and allow room for adjustment. Change can be challenging but it can also lead to personal growth and new opportunities. Trust in yourself and your ability to make the best decision for your own well-being. Surround yourself with supportive people who can offer guidance and lend an ear during this process.

TL;DR Gonna break up with my bf, not sure whether I should stay in Scotland or move back to Ireland where my family is."	"Dear OP,

First of all, it takes a lot of strength and self-awareness to recognize the need to break up and to consciously choose not to rush into another relationship. Good for you for prioritizing your own growth and well-being.

Considering your dilemma about whether to stay in Scotland or move back to Ireland, it's important to remember that there's no right or wrong answer here. Ultimately, it depends on what feels right for you and what aligns with your long-term goals and aspirations.

If you choose to stay in Scotland, you have a job offer that could potentially provide stability and serve as a starting point for exploring your career options. Taking this opportunity might give you the chance to develop your independence, explore new experiences, and learn more about yourself.

On the other hand, moving back to Ireland means being closer to your family and support system. It's understandable that you miss them, and moving back could provide you with a sense of comfort and familiarity. Additionally, having a job opportunity in the pharma sector that aligns with your previous course completed can be a great advantage.

When making this decision, it might help to consider both the short-term and long-term aspects. Ask yourself questions like:

- What are your immediate priorities and needs?
- How important is being close to your family and support system at this point in your life?
- Which choice aligns more with your long-term goals and aspirations?
- Are there any other factors to consider, such as personal growth or exploring new experiences?

Ultimately, it's essential to trust your own judgment and listen to what your heart and mind are telling you. It might also be helpful to discuss your concerns and thoughts with someone you trust, such as a close friend or family member. They might offer a fresh perspective or share their own experiences that can help you gain clarity.

Remember, this decision is about your own well-being and what feels right for you. Trust yourself, take your time, and know that whatever choice you make, it's an opportunity for growth and self-discovery.

Take care!"	1	0	0	0.0006260275840759277	forum w/o demographics
"What do I do?

apologies bit of a long one, finally telling my story, I will do a tldr at end :)

Male 22 Irish, 68kg , 5' 8

I had a good upbringing, always got treated well by parents except the odd disciplinary issues whenever I acted out, no trauma etc. I work out regularly, I am on decent shape, I would get attention from girls, I would always be in the top achievers in school (went to a grammar school, not sure what US equivalent is) good social life etc (no external stressors) so I am unsure why I am still so unhappy. My main problem is either depression or depersonalisation . First dealt with depersonalization although I didn't know what it was at the time at around the 14, happened on a handful occassions, most notably after physical exertion (dpdr then became chronic at 16) Had my first dealing with a deep depression around 15 years old due to a bad breakup with a girl I felt I loved at the time. I started dabbling with weed and mdma to help numb the pain, I smoked weed for around a year and took mdma for about 3 months and then after one random night I took a hit of a joint I got sent into full fledged dpdr, this has led me to be depressed (cause or symptom of dpdr im not sure in my case). The first few months of this was horrible, I was forced to go to school and I felt like I was going to faint every 5 minutes due to the overwhelming dissociation. In hindsight looking back I am glad I forced myself to continue on with life, the dpdr eventually , well I wouldn't say gotten better, but it faded enough into the background where it wasn't the only thing I had my attention on, atleast after the first 6 months anyway, I had a general feeling of low mood from then on but continued to carry on with life. Was referred to Mental health team and got counselling  (cbt). Tried to teaching me grounding tips for panic attaics when dpdr came on even when I kept reiterating that it was a constant state, not a transient one. Then came 18 where I had hit another low with dpdr, this made me housebound and extremely suicidal. I was prescribed citalopram / celexa and at the time I didn't feel like it workd but looking back it brought me back out of the house within a certain distance ( the dpdr / anxiety made me never leave the house), say maybe 10 mile from my house, a huge improvement on not being able to move 10 metres from my house. At this age I have left school, but the citalopram managed to give me enough courage to start a full time job in which I held for 6 months, at this period, life has become normal. I am working, I am socialising, I am drinking at the weekends (typical ""fitting in"" 18 year old starter pack). I'm still suffering from dpdr at this rate btw. 6 months into the job I have another breakdown. Looking back they feel like burnouts where I just couldn't cope anymore with trying to be normal when inside I felt horrible all the time. I went back to the doctor and he suggested that maybe the citalopram has pooped out and we should start a new SSRI in the form of Fluoxteine, much the same story of citalopram with much more weight gain, was able to go back to education and finish off a college diploma at 19-21 years old, again, still very much in dpdr, depression stilll there but not suicidal per se. At 21 I had enough of the weight gain and decided to come off anti depressants and raw dog the pain, I was feeling shit anyway on them and severely overweight ( went from 11 to 15 stone) , might aswell feel shit and look good atleast lol. Managed to lose 5 stone but still again depressed, anxious and still in dpdr. Fast forward to 22, this is where things took a new hell, I tried to sertraline, worst decision of my life. I sent me to a level of dpdr I have never been before, so deep that I thought I was dead and a literal ghost. I had to stop sertraline as any longer on it I think I genuinely would have ended it all. Anyway 7 months on, still depressed lol. Not sure what to do

Things I've discovered recently that could contribute ; 

‚Ä¢ B12 and Folate defeciency, my b12 levels were horrible and folate was even worse, been put on folic acid and b12 injections and cofactors, 2 weeks in no improvement thus far

tldr no trauma, ocassional teenage drug use, chronic dpdr, depressed for no reason"	"I'm sorry to hear that you've been experiencing chronic depersonalization and depression. It sounds like you've been through a lot in trying to find relief from your symptoms. I appreciate your openness in sharing your experiences.

It seems like you've already explored some potential contributors to your symptoms, such as B12 and folate deficiency, as well as vitamin D deficiency. It's important to continue working with your healthcare provider to monitor these deficiencies and determine if they are playing a role in your symptoms. Sometimes, it can take time for supplements to have an effect, so it's important to have patience and give it some time.

I notice that you've also tried various strategies, including exercise, CBT, socializing, and SSRIs. While it's understandable that none of these have provided a complete cure for you, please remember that it often takes time and a combination of different approaches to find the right treatment for each individual. It may be helpful to revisit some of these strategies or explore other options that you haven't tried yet.

Given the complexity of your symptoms and the various treatment attempts you've made, I strongly recommend seeking support from a mental health professional. They can provide a comprehensive assessment and develop a personalized treatment plan tailored to your specific needs. They may explore different therapy approaches, medication options, or consider other adjunctive treatments that could potentially help alleviate your symptoms.

Remember, recovery is possible, even though it may take time and perseverance to find the right path forward. You don't have to go through this journey alone. Reach out to a mental health professional who can provide the support and guidance you need."	2	0	0	0.0006170272827148438	clinician

I started dabbling with weed and mdma to help numb the pain, I smoked weed for around a year and took mdma for about 3 months and then after one random night I took a hit of a joint I got sent into full fledged dpdr, this has led me to be depressed (cause or symptom of dpdr im not sure in my case). The first few months of this was horrible, I was forced to go to school and I felt like I was going to faint every 5 minutes due to the overwhelming dissociation. In hindsight looking back I am glad I forced myself to continue on with life, the dpdr eventually , well I wouldn't say gotten better, but it faded enough into the background where it wasn't the only thing I had my attention on, atleast after the first 6 months anyway, I had a general feeling of low mood from then on but continued to carry on with life. Was referred to Mental health team and got counselling  (cbt). Tried to teaching me grounding tips for panic attaics when dpdr came on even when I kept reiterating that it was a constant state, not a transient one. Then came 18 where I had hit another low with dpdr, this made me housebound and extremely suicidal. I was prescribed citalopram / celexa and at the time I didn't feel like it workd but looking back it brought me back out of the house within a certain distance ( the dpdr / anxiety made me never leave the house), say maybe 10 mile from my house, a huge improvement on not being able to move 10 metres from my house. At this age I have left school, but the citalopram managed to give me enough courage to start a full time job in which I held for 6 months, at this period, life has become normal. I am working, I am socialising, I am drinking at the weekends (typical ""fitting in"" 18 year old starter pack). I'm still suffering from dpdr at this rate btw. 6 months into the job I have another breakdown. Looking back they feel like burnouts where I just couldn't cope anymore with trying to be normal when inside I felt horrible all the time. I went back to the doctor and he suggested that maybe the citalopram has pooped out and we should start a new SSRI in the form of Fluoxteine, much the same story of citalopram with much more weight gain, was able to go back to education and finish off a college diploma at 19-21 years old, again, still very much in dpdr, depression stilll there but not suicidal per se. At 21 I had enough of the weight gain and decided to come off anti depressants and raw dog the pain, I was feeling shit anyway on them and severely overweight ( went from 11 to 15 stone) , might aswell feel shit and look good atleast lol. Managed to lose 5 stone but still again depressed, anxious and still in dpdr. Fast forward to 22, this is where things took a new hell, I tried to sertraline, worst decision of my life. I sent me to a level of dpdr I have never been before, so deep that I thought I was dead and a literal ghost. I had to stop sertraline as any longer on it I think I genuinely would have ended it all. Anyway 7 months on, still depressed lol. Not sure what to do

Things I've discovered recently that could contribute ; 

‚Ä¢ B12 and Folate defeciency, my b12 levels were horrible and folate was even worse, been put on folic acid and b12 injections and cofactors, 2 weeks in no improvement thus far
 ‚Ä¢ VitD defeciency, taking 5000iu vit d3 with 100mcg k2, just started yesterday so no input on that

Things I have tried;

‚Ä¢Exercise , distracts me for a bit but not a cure
‚Ä¢CBT, meh
‚Ä¢Socialising, similar to exercise
‚Ä¢SSRi's , unhappy and fat lol

It sounds like you've tried a lot of different things to help manage your depression and depersonalization, but haven't found a solution yet. It's great that you've been addressing potential deficiencies like B12, folate, and Vitamin D. It's worth giving them some more time to see if there will be any improvement.

In addition to the things you've already tried, have you considered therapy or counseling beyond CBT? Sometimes a different therapeutic approach or a different therapist might be more helpful. It could be worth exploring options like psychodynamic therapy or talk therapy to see if they resonate with you.

It's also important to remember that managing mental health conditions can be a trial-and-error process. What works for one person may not work for another, so don't lose hope if some methods haven't been effective for you. Keep reaching out for support and exploring different avenues for treatment.

Remember, you're not alone in this. Many people have experienced similar struggles, and there is help available. Don't hesitate to reach out to mental health professionals who can provide guidance and support you on your journey."	2	0	0	0.000652015209197998	forum with demographics

Male 22 Irish, 68kg , 5' 8

I had a good upbringing, always got treated well by parents except the odd disciplinary issues whenever I acted out, no trauma etc. I work out regularly, I am on decent shape, I would get attention from girls, I would always be in the top achievers in school (went to a grammar school, not sure what US equivalent is) good social life etc (no external stressors) so I am unsure why I am still so unhappy.

tldr no trauma, ocassional teenage drug use, chronic dpdr, depressed for no reason"	"I'm not a mental health professional, but I can offer some suggestions based on your experiences. It sounds like you've been through a lot and have tried various interventions. It's great that you've addressed potential vitamin deficiencies, as they can contribute to mental health issues. However, it's worth noting that changes in mood and well-being can take time, so be patient with the supplements.

Since you didn't find CBT very effective, you might consider other types of therapy. Some people find Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Depersonalization and Derealization (CBT-DP/DR) more helpful for managing the symptoms you describe. Additionally, exploring different therapy modalities such as Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), or even psychoanalysis could be worth considering.

Have you discussed with your healthcare provider the possibility of trying other medications besides SSRIs? There are other classes of antidepressants, such as atypical antidepressants or monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), which may work differently and be more effective for you. Remember that finding the right medication can take time and it's important to work closely with your doctor.

In terms of self-care, it's great that you've been exercising and socializing. While they may not provide a complete cure, they can still contribute positively to your overall well-being. Don't discount the impact of a healthy lifestyle on your mental health.

However, it's crucial to continue seeking professional help. Finding a therapist who specializes in treating depersonalization, derealization, and depression could provide you with valuable guidance and support tailored to your specific needs. If you feel like you're in crisis or having suicidal thoughts, please reach out to a helpline or emergency services in your area immediately.

Remember, everyone's journey is unique, and it may take some time to find the interventions that work best for you. Keep reaching out for support, stay connected with loved ones, and don't lose hope. You deserve to find relief and happiness."	1	0	0	0.0007094144821166992	forum w/o demographics

Recently, my next-door neighbors have been causing a lot of disturbance. It seems like the man is constantly being verbally abusive towards the woman.

Things got quiet after that. 

I strongly believe in fighting racism and I'm against involving the police in situations like this.

I'm sorry to hear about the situation you're facing with your neighbors. It can be really challenging to deal with ongoing disturbances like this. It's great that you're looking for ways to help without involving the police, as there are alternative approaches you can consider. Here are a few suggestions:

1. Reach out to local community organizations or non-profits: Look for organizations in your area that focus on support for domestic violence or neighbor disputes. They may have resources or guidance on how to address this issue and can provide advice specific to your community.

2. Engage with your community: Talk to other neighbors who might also be experiencing the same disturbances. Collectively, you can discuss the issue and come up with ideas on how to address it effectively. Sometimes, community solidarity and collaborative efforts can make a difference.

3. Document incidents: Keep a record of the instances, including dates, times, and specific details of what you observe or hear. This documentation can be helpful if you decide to report the situation to appropriate organizations or professionals in the future.

4. Seek guidance from a mediator: Consider reaching out to a mediator who specializes in neighbor disputes. They can act as a neutral third party to help facilitate communication and find common ground between you and your neighbors.

5. Contact local authorities for advice only: While you mentioned not wanting to involve the police, you may still contact them for advice on non-emergency lines. Explain the situation and explicitly mention that you're seeking advice on how to handle the issue without their involvement. They might be able to offer alternative resources or suggestions.

Remember, it's essential to prioritize your safety and well-being throughout this process. If you ever feel unsafe or threatened, it is crucial to make decisions that prioritize your protection."	2	0	0	0.0006897449493408203	mental health forum

One way you can offer support is by reaching out to local community organizations that specialize in providing resources and assistance in situations like this. Organizations such as domestic violence hotlines or community centers may be able to offer guidance on local resources available to help individuals experiencing abusive situations.

Additionally, consider speaking to other neighbors who may have noticed the same issues. Collaborating with them might allow you to gather more information about the situation and find individuals who are willing to address the problem collectively. Sometimes, having a unified voice can hold more weight when advocating for change.

If you're comfortable doing so, you can also try approaching the couple directly or indirectly, expressing concern for their well-being. However, it's important to prioritize your own safety and assess the situation before deciding the best course of action.

Remember that as a bystander, your role is to offer support and resources rather than intervening directly. By connecting with appropriate organizations and exploring community-driven approaches, you may be able to help foster a safer environment for everyone involved."	2	0	0	0.0007184147834777832	clinician

I'm sorry to hear about the difficult situation you are dealing with. It must be challenging to have to listen to the abuse from your neighbors. It's great that you are looking for alternative ways to support and help the person involved without involving the police.

One option you can consider is reaching out to local organizations or hotlines that specifically support victims of domestic violence or abusive relationships. They are experienced in handling such situations and can provide resources, guidance, and support to the person being abused. They may also have advice on how to offer help as a concerned neighbor.

Additionally, you can try to research community organizations or shelters in your area that offer assistance to individuals facing domestic violence situations. These organizations often have confidential helplines and resources available that you can share with your neighbor to help them seek help when they are ready.

It may also be worth trying to build a rapport with your neighbor if you feel comfortable doing so. If you have any opportunities for casual conversations, you can express concern for their well-being and let them know that you are there to support them if they ever need someone to talk to. Remember to respect their boundaries and privacy, as they may not be ready to open up about their situation.

In summary, reaching out to local domestic violence support organizations and providing resources could be a good way to indirectly offer help to your neighbor. Empathy, compassion, and respecting their choices can go a long way in creating a supportive environment."	2	0	0	0.0008154511451721191	forum with demographics

One possible option is to reach out to local community organizations that deal with issues related to domestic violence or neighbor disputes. They may have resources or advice on how to intervene or help in such situations, while respecting your anti-racist stance.

If you feel comfortable doing so, you could also try to have a friendly conversation with your neighbors. Express your concerns about the noise and the impact it's having on your well-being. Let them know that their behavior is affecting others and that you're here to support them if they need help or resources.

Lastly, documenting the incidents, such as dates, times, and any specific details, could be useful if you decide to report it to an organization that deals with domestic violence. They can offer guidance on how to proceed further.

After breaking the plate he proceeded to chase me around the house hitting me in the arms, breast, and face while I tried to find a broom (..and not fall, he tried twice). That was it, for me, hed been hitting me since 2019, verbally abusing us both for years, and slapped the kid in late April this year (first time he'd hit the kid).

Last week, my husband had a volatile outburst and smashed a glass plate, accidentally injuring our 8-year-old son. This incident was triggered by my desire to visit my cousin for a second time in a ten day period. The tantrum continued with hurtful name-calling towards our son and me as well as physical violence. This was the breaking point for me after enduring years of abuse. I have since obtained an emergency protective order and temporarily relocated to my mom's for safety.

On a positive note, my son has been adjusting surprisingly well and seems to enjoy being with my mom and aunts. He hasn't asked about his dad directly, only wondering if he's at our house. He does mention that his dad yells at him a lot, which he shared with CPS. However, I'm unsure of how to approach discussing the situation with him. CPS suggested easing him into it or ripping the band-aid off, but I'm at a loss. I intend to pursue a long-term no contact order and full custody with supervised visitation.

Any advice or suggestions on how to navigate this delicate situation would be greatly appreciated. My son seems generally happy and accepting, but I want to ensure I handle this in the best way possible for him. Thank you in advance for your support. üôè"	0	2	0	0.0008466243743896484	social media

It must be incredibly difficult for you and your son to experience such abuse and have to deal with the aftermath. It's great that you were able to take steps to ensure your safety by getting an emergency protective order and staying with your mom.

When it comes to talking with your son about his father and the abuse, it's important to approach the conversation with sensitivity and age-appropriate language. Keep in mind that every child responds differently to trauma, and it's common for children to display resilience and adaptive behaviors even in distressing situations. 

You could consider starting with small conversations where you gently ask your son about his feelings and thoughts without pushing for detailed explanations of the abuse. Letting your son lead the conversation, while providing a safe and supportive space for him to express himself, is crucial. Make sure to emphasize that it is not his fault and that he is loved and supported unconditionally.

Additionally, seeking professional help, such as therapy or counseling, can be beneficial for your son to help him process his feelings and experiences in a safe and confidential environment. A mental health professional would be better equipped to guide you through this process and provide appropriate advice tailored to your unique situation.

Remember to prioritize your well-being as well. Taking care of your own mental health is crucial in order to support your son effectively. Consider reaching out to local resources such as domestic violence hotlines or shelters for further guidance and assistance.

You have shown incredible strength in taking steps to protect yourself and your son. It's important to keep surrounding yourselves with a support system and know that you are not alone in this journey."	2	0	0	0.0007700920104980469	mental health forum

It's important to prioritize your and your son's well-being during this time. When it comes to discussing your son's father with him, it can be beneficial to seek guidance from a qualified child therapist or counselor who specializes in trauma or child development. They can provide you with age-appropriate strategies and techniques to explain the situation to your son and help him process his emotions in a healthy manner.

Additionally, it could be helpful for you to consider individual therapy for yourself. A mental health professional can support you in processing the trauma you have experienced, provide coping strategies, and help you navigate the process of obtaining full custody with supervised visitation.

Remember, you don't have to go through this alone. Reach out to local support organizations, such as domestic violence shelters or helplines, for additional resources and assistance."	2	0	0	0.0006571412086486816	clinician
"A week ago Sunday my husband smashed a glass plate and flying  glass hit our son who recently turned 8. DH was having a meltdown because I wanted to visit my cousin who was visiting from Florida a second time in a ten day period, during a 4 day weekend (that was the theme, at least, it's hard to know what actually set him off this time or any other).   The tantrum began when I slept in and within earshot of my son who told me he was ""sorry I got yelled at"" when things calmed down and I got food made. I knew it wasn't over and 30m later (ik cuz I was recording) he continued it in front of the kid, liberally calling him a retard and me the n and k word (we are white of non Jewish descent, but anyone who opposes him is a kword). After breaking the plate he proceeded to chase me around the house hitting me in the arms, breast, and face while I tried to find a broom (..and not fall, he tried twice). That was it, for me, hed been hitting me since 2019, verbally abusing us both for years, and slapped the kid in late April this year (first time he'd hit the kid). I was done, finally told my family the whole story of the past years and got an emergency protective order and then a 2 week temp order 2 days later. I have the right to stay in the house but I'm at my mom's for safety. 
My son has basically been acting like we're on vacation, he knows his dad's is at his grandpa's house but nothing about how long that will be, and he didn't even ask it like ""where's dad"" but more like ""Is he at our house"". He's said he likes being here, he says he wants to stay longer, my mom and aunts are slowly trying to teach him that no one is going to lose their shit at him if he spills something or throws up in the car. Kid hasn't mentioned his father or the abuse directly, other than to tell cps his dad yells at him alot. When I asked cps they unhelpfully said I could either ""ease him into it or rip the band-aid off"" and I don't know what to do. I intend to get a 2 year no contact order when the temp one expires, I intend to get full custody with supervised visitation and knowing his dad it's not impossible he'll never see him again. What should I tell the kid? He seems pretty accepting and happy go lucky in general and idk what to do."	"I'm so sorry to hear about the difficult situation you and your son are going through. It takes a lot of strength to reach out for help and take steps to ensure your safety. It's important to prioritize your well-being and your son's safety.

When it comes to talking to your son about his father and the abuse, it's crucial to approach the conversation in a way that matches his emotional readiness. You mentioned that he hasn't directly mentioned the abuse, but it's clear that he recognizes the negative environment he was in. Let him know that you love him unconditionally and that what he experienced was not okay.

Consider having an open and age-appropriate conversation with him, gradually providing more information as he asks for it or shows signs of understanding. Let him know that sometimes adults have problems that make it difficult for them to behave properly. Reassure him that you are there for him and that his safety is your priority. Encourage him to express his feelings openly and reassure him that he can trust you.

It may also be beneficial to involve a professional, such as a therapist or counselor, who can guide you in supporting your son. They can provide a safe space for him to process his emotions and offer guidance on how to navigate this challenging situation.

Remember, healing takes time, and each individual responds differently. Be patient and provide ongoing support for your son. Surround yourselves with a strong support network, including friends, family, or support groups, who can offer encouragement and understanding during this difficult time.

Take care of yourself and prioritize your own healing as well. You deserve support and assistance as you navigate this challenging phase of your life."	2	0	0	0.0007661581039428711	forum with demographics

It takes a lot of courage to reach out for help, and I'm glad you were able to take steps to protect yourself and your child. I want to emphasize that I'm not a mental health professional, but I can offer some suggestions based on common practices.

Firstly, it's important to create a safe and supportive environment for your son. It seems like he's currently adjusting well at your mom's place, where he feels comfortable and free from any abusive behavior. Continue to provide him with love, understanding, and reassurance. Let him know that you are there for him no matter what.

When it comes to discussing the situation, it might be best to approach it in an age-appropriate manner. Consider his maturity level and capacity to understand complex emotions. Start by asking open-ended questions to gauge his awareness and feelings. Encourage him to share his thoughts and concerns without pressuring him.

You may want to address the fact that his father is not currently living at home, without going into specific details about the abusive behavior. Explain that sometimes adults need time apart to work on themselves and their behaviors, and that it is for everyone's safety and well-being. Emphasize that you are both safe now and that you are doing everything you can to ensure his continued safety.

Furthermore, you may want to let your son know that he can always talk to you or someone he trusts about his feelings and experiences. Assure him that it's okay to feel a range of emotions and that he is not alone. Consider seeking professional help, such as therapy or counseling, to provide him with the necessary tools to cope with his emotions and navigate this challenging situation.

Remember, it's crucial to consult with professionals who can provide their expertise and guide you through this process. They will have a better understanding of your specific situation, cultural dynamics, and appropriate steps forward. Please consider reaching out to a mental health professional, a local support organization, or a helpline for more specific advice in your region.

I hope this helps you in some way, and I wish you and your son strength and healing during this difficult time."	2	0	0	0.0007793903350830078	forum w/o demographics
"Currently, talking about that chronophobia stuff, it's better by now. Didn't even think about that until recently which makes me feel kinda nervous/stressed again but not to a point where I can't do anything.  
Another matter, my parents kinda hate me right now (or at least don't really care about me) and I also do I hate myself too (not absolute hate, rather disliking) and I feel mentally trapped right now. Never got the motivation to do stuff and my plans with the uni are off now since I couldn't find any place because I didn't have a guarantor which almost always gets asked for in germany.  
All this kinda made me feel empty and meaningless."	"Hey everyone, just wanted to share something that's been on my mind lately. I recently came across the concept of chronophobia and it's been a bit nerve-wracking for me. I didn't even realize it until recently and it's made me feel a little stressed. But hey, it's not so bad that I can't handle it. 

On another note, things have been tough with my parents lately. It feels like they don't really care about me, and to be honest, I've been feeling the same about myself too (more like a dislike than actual hate). It's like I'm mentally trapped right now. 

To top it off, my plans with university have hit a roadblock. I couldn't find a place to live because I didn't have a guarantor, which seems to be a common requirement in Germany. It's left me feeling empty and like everything is meaningless.

Just wanted to put this out there and see if anyone has any advice or words of encouragement. Would really appreciate it right now. Thanks in advance!"	0	2	0	0.0013205409049987793	social media

It sounds like you're going through a difficult time, and it's important to remember that you're not alone. Many people experience moments of feeling empty or lacking motivation, especially when facing challenges such as not being able to pursue your plans with the university or feeling disconnected from your parents. 

It might be helpful to reach out to a mental health professional or counselor who can provide support and guidance during this time. They can help you navigate these emotions and develop coping strategies to manage your stress and feelings of emptiness. They can also assist you in finding alternative options for your university plans or connect you with resources that can help with securing a guarantor.

In the meantime, try to engage in self-care activities that bring you comfort and joy. This could be spending time with friends or loved ones, pursuing hobbies or interests, or practicing mindfulness and relaxation techniques. Remember to be compassionate with yourself and give yourself permission to feel whatever you're feeling without judgment.

Sometimes, reaching out to supportive communities online or in person can also be beneficial. Sharing your experiences and connecting with others who have gone through similar challenges can provide a sense of understanding and belonging.

You are important, and your feelings matter. Reach out for support and take it one step at a time. It's okay to ask for help, and there are people who care and want to support you through this."	2	0	0	0.0006304383277893066	mental health forum

It sounds like you're experiencing a combination of stress, self-doubt, and a sense of emptiness. These feelings can be quite overwhelming, but they are treatable.

It might be helpful to start by exploring your fears around chronophobia and how it's affecting your daily life. Learning coping strategies and developing a positive mindset can be valuable in managing these anxieties. Additionally, addressing the strained relationship with your parents might also be beneficial. Open communication and seeking professional family therapy can help improve the situation.

Regarding the setback with your plans for university, it's not uncommon for setbacks to occur. It can be disappointing, but remember that there are often alternative paths to achieve your goals. Consider reaching out to university admissions offices or local organizations that might offer support or guidance in finding suitable alternatives.

Feeling empty and lacking motivation is tough, but it doesn't mean you're doomed to feel this way forever. Exploring your interests, setting small achievable goals, and seeking support from friends, loved ones, or a mental health professional can all aid in finding motivation and meaning in your life.

Chronophobia, the fear of time passing, can be really overwhelming, and it's understandable that it causes you some nervousness and stress. Remember that it's okay to feel that way, and you don't have to go through it alone.

Regarding your parents, feeling ignored or unloved by them can be incredibly difficult to cope with. It's important to remember that your worth isn't defined by their actions or opinions. However, it might be worth considering whether there are any underlying issues that could be causing strain in your relationship with them. Finding a trusted person to talk to, such as a close friend, family member, or therapist, can be beneficial in working through these emotions.

Feeling unmotivated and lacking purpose is a common struggle, especially when facing setbacks like not being able to pursue your university plans. Remember that setbacks are a part of life, and they don't define your future. Take some time to reflect on what other options or paths you can explore, and consider seeking guidance from a career counselor or mentor who can offer support and help you navigate through this challenging time.

Lastly, feeling empty and meaningless can often be a sign of depression or other mental health issues. It's crucial to prioritize your mental well-being and seek professional help. A therapist or counselor can provide guidance and support tailored to your specific needs. They can help you explore your emotions, develop coping strategies, and work towards finding a sense of fulfillment and meaning in your life again.

"It's not even their fault either. I finished my gymnasium degree just a few months ago, which is very bad, but finally at 26 I am done. The reason being was that I was struggling a lot with school as a kid, and then I isolated myself for a few years as I was older. The last 2-3 years I have been working so hard to finally complete my gymnasium degree. There were so many days where I just wanted to die, mainly because of how my entire life had turned out. 

Through all the hardships I managed to do it nontheless. It's just gymnasium, so nothing special at all in Sweden. Everyone has done it. I am now preparing for university next year, with the goal of studying computer science. 

Since coming out of isolation for all those years and talking to people again, has been very difficult. I feel like I am at a point where I would borderline feel infantilized talking to an 18 year old, being a 26 year old guy. There are so many life experiences which I lack, that everyone else my age and younger has.

I am constantly on edge when talking to people, because I am so afraid that they will bring up questions about my past that I would never be able to answer because of how ashamed I am over it. 

I feel like crying when I am talking to people and they speak about all their experiences, countries they visited, love, so on and so forth. I have missed out on all of this and I can not convince myself that I deserve any of it, because I don't have anything to offer as a person. 

My main motivation that I used to get through gymnasium was that once I am done, then I will no longer be ashamed. With gymnasium being the bare minimum, it should put me on an equal playing field with everyone else, so that I wont stand out too much. After finally finishing gymnasium I was crying tears of joy. Then those tears turned to sadness because I realized that it wasn't enough and until I am done with my university degree, that I shouldn't try to make friends or maybe even more.

I truly hate the way my life has turned out. I am trying to do the best out of this terrible situation. I will never be able to catch up on all of life experiences which I missed out on. It almost feels like people my age and sometimes even younger, feel way older when I talk to them, because of how pretty much sheltered I was for a large part of my adulthood."	"Hey Reddit fam, I could really use some support right now. I recently finished my gymnasium degree and even though it's not a big deal in Sweden, it's a huge accomplishment for me. You see, I've had a tough time with school since I was a kid and ended up isolating myself for a few years as I got older. It was a dark period, but I worked my butt off to complete my degree.

Now, I'm gearing up for university and studying computer science, which excites me but also brings up some insecurities. Reconnecting with people after being isolated has been challenging. Sometimes, I feel like I'm way behind in terms of life experiences compared to others my age. It's tough when people discuss things like travel, love, and adventures, and I haven't had those experiences.

I often become anxious during conversations, fearing that I'll be asked questions about my past that I'm ashamed of and can't answer. It's disheartening and I even find myself on the verge of tears. I struggle to convince myself that I deserve happiness and all the things others have experienced.

Finishing gymnasium was supposed to mark the end of my shame, but now I realize it's only the first step. I sometimes question if I should even try to make new friends or pursue relationships until I finish my university degree. I hate how my life has turned out, but I'm doing my best to make the most of this difficult situation. Catching up on all the life experiences I missed feels impossible, and it's disheartening when people my age seem so much more mature due to their diverse experiences.

Any advice or support you can offer would mean the world to me. Thanks, guys. üôè"	1	2	0	0.001154780387878418	social media

"I'm sorry to hear that you're feeling this way, but please remember that you are not alone in your struggles. It takes a lot of courage to open up about your feelings, and I commend you for reaching out for support.

First of all, it's important to recognize that your past does not define your worth as a person. Each individual's life path is unique, and comparing yourself to others will only contribute to feelings of inadequacy. Instead, focus on your personal growth and the steps you are taking to improve your situation. Completing your gymnasium degree is a significant accomplishment, regardless of how common it may be in your country.

As you prepare for university, it's understandable to have anxieties about socializing and connecting with others. Remember that everyone has their own insecurities and struggles, even if they may not be obvious. It's okay to not have all the same life experiences as your peers. You are embarking on a new chapter in your life, and this is an opportunity for personal growth and creating new memories.

It can be helpful to find supportive communities or groups related to your interests, such as computer science. Surrounding yourself with people who share similar passions can provide a sense of belonging and understanding. Additionally, consider seeking professional help or counseling to work through any deep-seated feelings of shame or inadequacy. A mental health professional can help you develop coping strategies and guide you on your journey towards self-acceptance.

Remember, it's never too late to start anew and pursue your dreams. Your past does not define your future. Embrace the courage and resilience within you, and know that there are people who are willing to support you on your journey to a happier and more fulfilling life."	2	0	0	0.000658571720123291	mental health forum

You've already shown great resilience and determination by completing your gymnasium degree, despite the hardships you faced. Remember to acknowledge and celebrate your accomplishments along the way, as they are a testament to your strength.

Starting university next year is a significant step towards your goals, and it presents an opportunity to connect with new people and experiences.

Therapy can be a safe space for processing your emotions and building self-confidence. Additionally, gradually exposing yourself to social situations and engaging in gradual challenges can help build your resilience.

With gymnasium being the bare minimum, it should put me on an equal playing field with everyone else, so that I wont stand out too much. After finally finishing gymnasium I was crying tears of joy. Then those tears turned to sadness because I realized that it wasn't enough and until I am done with my university degree, that I shouldn't try to make friends or maybe even more.

I truly hate the way my life has turned out. I am trying to do the best out of this terrible situation. I will never be able to catch up on all of life experiences which I missed out on. It almost feels like people my age and sometimes even younger, feel way older when I talk to them, because of how pretty much sheltered I was for a large part of my adulthood."	"I'm really sorry to hear that you're feeling this way. It can be incredibly challenging when we compare ourselves to others and feel like we've missed out on important life experiences. It's important to remember that everyone's journey is unique and there is no set timeline for personal growth and development.

It's great to hear that you have completed your gymnasium degree and are preparing for university. This shows a great deal of resilience and dedication. Remember, there is no expiration date on education and it's never too late to pursue your passions and goals.

When it comes to socializing and meeting new people, try to focus on the present moment rather than dwelling on the past. You are not defined solely by your past experiences, but also by who you are becoming and what you have to offer. People appreciate authenticity and genuine connections, so don't be afraid to share your thoughts and experiences with others.

Instead of feeling ashamed, try to reframe your mindset and see your unique life journey as something that has shaped you into the person you are today. Your experiences, no matter how different they may be from others, have contributed to your resilience and strength.

Consider seeking support from a mental health professional who can help you work through these feelings of shame and low self-worth. They can provide guidance and strategies for building self-confidence and finding acceptance within yourself.

Remember to be kind to yourself throughout this process. You've already come a long way, and there are still many opportunities for personal growth and connection ahead. You deserve happiness and fulfillment, just like anyone else."	2	0	0	0.0006410479545593262	forum with demographics
"It's not even their fault either. I finished my gymnasium degree just a few months ago, which is very bad, but finally at 26 I am done. The reason being was that I was struggling a lot with school as a kid, and then I isolated myself for a few years as I was older. The last 2-3 years I have been working so hard to finally complete my gymnasium degree. There were so many days where I just wanted to die, mainly because of how my entire life had turned out. 

Through all the hardships I managed to do it nontheless. It's just gymnasium, so nothing special at all in Sweden. Everyone has done it. I am now preparing for university next year, with the goal of studying computer science. 

Since coming out of isolation for all those years and talking to people again, has been very difficult. I feel like I am at a point where I would borderline feel infantilized talking to an 18 year old, being a 26 year old guy. There are so many life experiences which I lack, that everyone else my age and younger has.

I am constantly on edge when talking to people, because I am so afraid that they will bring up questions about my past that I would never be able to answer because of how ashamed I am over it. 

I feel like crying when I am talking to people and they speak about all their experiences, countries they visited, love, so on and so forth. I have missed out on all of this and I can not convince myself that I deserve any of it, because I don't have anything to offer as a person.

"Hello there, first of all, I want to say that I hear your pain and frustration. It takes a lot of courage to open up about our struggles, and I appreciate you sharing your feelings with us.

It sounds like you've been through a difficult journey, but please know that your experiences, no matter how different they may be, still hold value. It's important to remember that everyone's path is unique, and comparison can be an unfair measure of self-worth.

Starting university is an exciting opportunity for growth and exploration, both academically and personally. It can also be a chance to connect with others who have similar interests. Remember, age or past experiences don't define your ability to make genuine connections with new people.

Feeling isolated and anxious about discussing your past is understandable, but it might be helpful to remind yourself that everyone has their own struggles and insecurities. Being honest about your journey can actually be a way to foster deeper connections with others who may have faced their own challenges.

If you find yourself overwhelmed with emotions, consider seeking support from a therapist or counselor who can provide guidance during this transition period. They can help you explore your thoughts and emotions, and develop coping strategies to navigate social interactions.

Remember, it's never too late to create new memories and experiences. Focus on the present and future, and embrace the opportunities that come your way. You deserve happiness and personal growth, just like anyone else.

Take it one step at a time, be kind to yourself, and remember that your worth as a person goes beyond any specific life experiences. You are capable of building a fulfilling life, and I believe in your ability to overcome these challenges."	1	0	0	0.0006368756294250488	forum w/o demographics

It's understandable that being away from home, especially without access to your usual support systems, can make suicidal urges intensify. Remember that you don't have to face this alone.

While I'm unable to provide direct help in your situation, I encourage you to reach out to helplines or crisis support services in Poland. They can offer immediate assistance and connect you with local resources. In the meantime, try to engage in self-care activities that provide comfort and distraction from these overwhelming thoughts. This could involve engaging in hobbies, practicing relaxation techniques, or even seeking solace in nature if possible.

It sounds like you're currently in a challenging situation, being away from your usual support system. First and foremost, it's important to prioritize your safety. If you feel like your life is in immediate danger, please reach out to emergency services in Poland or any other support hotlines available in your area right away.

Although you may not have physical access to your usual coping mechanisms, there might still be some things you can do to help alleviate these overwhelming feelings. Try to find a quiet space where you can engage in some self-care activities that bring you comfort. Deep breathing exercises, meditation, or journaling can be helpful in grounding yourself during difficult moments. Consider distracting yourself with activities you enjoy, such as reading a book, watching a show, or listening to music that makes you feel relaxed.

While it's tough that the people you've reached out to haven't responded yet, remember that communication can sometimes be delayed or there might be reasons beyond their control preventing them from responding immediately. In the meantime, it might be helpful to explore online mental health resources. There are many supportive communities, helplines, and mental health forums where you can find understanding and compassionate individuals who can offer advice or simply lend a listening ear.

Whenever you feel ready and comfortable, it could be beneficial to open up to your grandparents about your struggles. They may not have the same level of understanding, but you never know - they might surprise you with their support and love. Sharing your experiences with others can help lighten your emotional burden and allow you to receive the care and understanding that you need.

Remember, you don't have to face this alone. Reaching out for professional help, such as a therapist or counselor, can provide you with the guidance and support you deserve. They can help you develop coping strategies specific to your situation and offer a safe space to express your feelings.

I'm really sorry to hear that you're going through such a tough time right now. It must be really difficult being away from your usual support system while visiting your grandparents in Poland. It's important to acknowledge the strength you've shown in pushing back those suicidal urges for two whole days - that takes a lot of resilience.

If you're feeling like you're in immediate danger, it's crucial to reach out for help right away. In Poland, you can call the emergency services at 112 or find a local mental health helpline for immediate assistance. They are trained professionals who can provide the support you need.

While waiting for a response from someone you trust, try to distract yourself by engaging in activities that you find soothing or enjoyable. It could be reading, listening to music, going for a walk, or any other healthy coping mechanism. Don't hesitate to write down your feelings or thoughts in a journal as a way to express yourself.

Remember, you don't have to face this alone. Once you're able, it would be beneficial to reach out to a mental health professional or counselor who can offer guidance and support. They can help you navigate these difficult emotions and provide you with coping strategies tailored to your specific situation.

Please take care and prioritize your well-being. Reach out to the helpline or emergency services as soon as possible."	2	0	0	0.0007020235061645508	forum w/o demographics

Hi guys, 
I Just feel that I need to tell someone about my doubts. Basically, I am 20, full time employeed in a quite high-earning job (especially considering my age), studying part-time petroleum engineering at the top ranked STEM university in my country, I work out every second day, I keep my diet clean, I never do drugs/smoking/alcohol, I'm 6,6 feet tall and I think that I'm quite mature for my age. The problem is, that I basically don't have ""Access"" to girls my age. At my job I work only with men, and I study also with only men (let's be honest, petroleum engineering isn't so popular amongst women). I've tried tinder, organised group trips to the mountains, science clubs at my university, even approaching women directly at festivals. None of these methods worked. I've never been in a relationship before, and until I was 19 years old (when I finally went to see a doc and got meds) I struggeled with extreme OCD and social anxiety, so I didn't made any female-friends in the secondary school or earlier in my education (I lived in Norway before secondary school, where, originating from Poland, I got bullied for my ethnicity, and it didn't help me making friends, especially considering my struggle with OCD and social anxiety back them). That's basically it, I try to not think too much about it and rather focus on self-development, however back in my head there is allways this crippling fear that I've missed my shot, and that it is too late for me to ever find a partner that would be attractive and compatible to me. I can especially feel it, when I see couples walking down the streets, or riding in a car together. It's an extremely awful feeling, that stays with me, althought I try to mute it by focusing on my career and gym. However this feeling never quite goes totally away. So, what should I try to do? How should I accept my past? 
Thank you for reading my story guys, I Just really needed to share it with someone."	Hey everyone, I just needed to vent about something that's been bothering me. I'm a 20-year-old guy with a good job and I'm studying petroleum engineering at a top STEM university. I take care of myself, don't drink or smoke, and try to stay active. But here's the thing - because of my job and field of study, I don't really have the opportunity to meet girls my age. I've tried Tinder, group trips, science clubs, and even approaching women directly at festivals, but nothing has worked so far. I struggled with extreme OCD and social anxiety until I was 19, so I didn't make many friends, especially with females, during my earlier years. Sometimes I worry that I missed my chance and won't find someone compatible. Seeing couples together makes me feel pretty awful, even though I try to focus on my career and fitness. So, any advice on what I can do to change this? How can I come to terms with my past? Thanks for taking the time to read and listen, it means a lot to me. #SeekingAdvice #FeelingLost	1	2	0	0.0008481740951538086	social media

Thank you for reading my story guys, I Just really needed to share it with someone."	"Hey there, 

First off, thank you for reaching out and sharing your story. It takes courage to open up about your doubts and concerns. It's great to hear that you've been focusing on self-development and working towards your goals. 

Regarding your struggles in meeting girls your age, it can definitely be challenging when you're surrounded by a predominantly male environment. You've already tried various methods like Tinder, group trips, and science clubs, which is commendable. Remember that finding a partner is not a race, and it's important to be patient and keep an open mind. 

In the meantime, continue to focus on yourself and your personal growth. Building confidence and engaging in activities you enjoy can attract like-minded individuals. Consider exploring new hobbies or joining social groups outside of your current circles. Volunteering or joining community organizations can also be a great way to meet new people, including potential partners. 

Try not to dwell on missed opportunities or compare yourself to others. Each person's journey is unique, and your experiences and past struggles have shaped you into the person you are today. Accepting your past can come through acknowledging your growth and being kind to yourself. It's important to remember that it's never too late to find a partner who appreciates and connects with you.

If you find the fear of missing out or the feeling of inadequacy overwhelming, it might be helpful to seek support from a therapist or counselor. They can provide strategies to manage these emotions and help you navigate your personal journey with more clarity.

Remember, you're not alone, and there are people who understand and support you. Keep focusing on your personal growth, meeting new people, and being open to new opportunities. Stay positive, and don't lose hope. Good luck on your journey towards finding a partner who will be attractive and compatible with you."	1	0	0	0.0006478428840637207	mental health forum

Thank you for reaching out and sharing your story. It sounds like you have accomplished a lot at such a young age, and I commend your dedication to self-improvement. It's completely understandable that you feel frustrated and concerned about not having access to potential partners your age due to the nature of your work and study environment.

It's important to remember that finding a compatible partner takes time and can be a process for anyone, regardless of their circumstances. It's also important to acknowledge the progress you have made in managing your OCD and social anxiety, as this can have an impact on forming connections with others.

One suggestion I have is to consider expanding your social circle outside of your work and study environments. This could involve exploring new hobbies or joining social groups that align with your interests. This way, you increase your chances of meeting new people, including potential romantic partners.

Additionally, it might be helpful to work on building your confidence in social situations through therapy or support groups. By addressing any remaining fears or insecurities, you can be better equipped to establish meaningful connections with others.

Remember, it's never too late to find a partner who is attractive and compatible with you. It's important to be patient and kind to yourself during this process. Accepting your past and focusing on self-development are positive steps forward, and with time and persistence, you may find the connection you are seeking.

If you feel that you would benefit from further support, I encourage you to reach out to a mental health professional who can provide guidance and assistance tailored to your specific needs.

Take care and best of luck on your journey towards finding a partner."	1	2	0	0.0006219148635864258	clinician

It sounds like you have done a lot of self-development work, which is commendable. It's great that you are focused on your career and taking care of your physical health through regular workouts and a clean diet. However, it's also important to take care of your mental and emotional well-being.

Finding meaningful connections with others, including potential partners, can sometimes be challenging, especially when you're in an environment that lacks opportunities to meet new people. However, there are still options available to you.

Have you considered expanding your social circle beyond your workplace and university? Joining interest-based clubs or organizations outside of your current environment might give you the opportunity to meet a wider range of people, including women. This could allow you to form connections based on common interests and provide more chances to find a potential partner who is compatible with you.

Additionally, have you considered looking into local social or networking events? These events often provide a more relaxed and social atmosphere, which can make it easier to approach and connect with new people. It may take time and effort, but it's important to remember that building meaningful relationships is a process that requires patience.

Lastly, it's crucial to be kind to yourself and accept your past. You have already come a long way in overcoming challenges such as OCD and social anxiety, which shows your resilience. Remind yourself that it's never too late to find love and companionship. Focus on continuing your self-development journey and be open to new experiences.

Remember, seeking professional guidance from a therapist or counselor can also be beneficial. They can provide you with additional support and help explore any underlying issues related to your fears. Take care of yourself and keep pushing forward. You have so much to offer, and with time, the right person will come into your life.

I hear you and understand that you're feeling frustrated and lonely in your current situation. It's not easy when your circumstances limit your exposure to potential partners. It's great to hear that you're focusing on self-development and taking care of your physical and mental health.

It's important to remember that finding a partner is not solely dependent on your age or past experiences. It's never too late to meet someone special. Instead of fixating on missed opportunities, try shifting your focus toward the future and the possibilities that lie ahead.

Here are a few suggestions to help you navigate this situation:

1. Expand your social circle: Look for opportunities to meet new people outside of your work and academic environments. Consider joining clubs or organizations that align with your interests or volunteering for causes you care about. This way, you may meet people who share similar interests and values.

2. Utilize online platforms: Besides Tinder, explore other online platforms, such as dating apps or websites, that cater to specific interests or communities. This could potentially broaden your pool of potential partners.

3. Attend social events: Keep an eye out for events in your area, such as parties, networking events, or social gatherings, where you may have the chance to meet new people. These events often provide a more relaxed and casual atmosphere to connect with others.

4. Seek professional support: If you're still struggling with lingering feelings of fear and anxiety, consider reaching out to a therapist or counselor who can help you process your experiences and build strategies to cope with these emotions.

Remember, everyone's journey is unique, and there's no timeline for finding love or a compatible partner. Focus on your personal growth, build meaningful connections, and have faith that the right person will come along when the time is right.

Take care of yourself, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need further support. You're not alone in this."	1	0	0	0.0006324648857116699	forum w/o demographics
Hello, I am an Italian boy. Since I was little, I have experienced one problem after another. As a child I was often in the hospital because I couldn't balance, I would fall, and I was always bumping around. Once I even hit my head against a chimney, fortunately turned off. Besides that, when I was 3 years old my parents separated. I remember little of my life before that, I only have a vague memory of my father yelling at me and another of the whole family sitting together at the table. My two older brothers grew up in a happy family, and I constantly had to choose between being with my mother or my father. Then at school I was always excluded, always the one in the corner by myself, the last one, ostracized. And it's still like that. I'm tired of it all. I'm tired of making fake smiles at home. I'm tired of making fake smiles school and everywhere. The only friend I had hasn't spoken to me in a few years, I'm completely alone. And sad.	Hey there, I just read your post and my heart goes out to you. It takes a lot of courage to open up and share your struggles. Remember, you are not alone in this journey. It's tough when we have difficult childhood experiences, but remember that those moments don't define who you are.

It sounds like you have been through a lot and are feeling very alone and sad. Remember that you are not alone, as there are many people who understand and want to support you. It is brave of you to share your feelings.

It's important to acknowledge that dealing with childhood difficulties, such as separation of parents and feeling excluded, can have a significant impact on one's mental well-being. It might be helpful for you to seek support from a mental health professional, such as a therapist or counselor, who can provide a safe space for you to express and work through your emotions.

In the meantime, consider finding healthy ways to cope with your feelings. Engaging in activities you enjoy or finding new hobbies can be a positive distraction and help lift your spirits. You could also consider reaching out to other people or groups who share similar interests, as they may provide a sense of connection and belonging.

Remember, taking care of your mental health is important. Reach out for help, surround yourself with supportive people, and be kind to yourself. You deserve understanding and happiness."	1	0	0	0.0006429553031921387	mental health forum
Hello, I am an Italian boy. Since I was little, I have experienced one problem after another.

I'm really sorry to hear that you're feeling this way. It sounds like you've been through a lot since you were little, and I can imagine how exhausting it must be to constantly pretend that everything is okay. It takes a tremendous amount of strength to keep up a facade, and I want you to know that it's alright to feel sad and tired. 

Feeling excluded and ostracized can be incredibly painful, especially when it seems like everyone around you has a much happier and more stable life. It's not fair that you have to choose between your parents or constantly be on the sidelines at school. If you're comfortable, have you considered talking to a trusted adult about how you're feeling? They may be able to offer guidance and support.

Loneliness can be extremely tough to handle, especially when you've lost contact with your only friend. Is there anyone else in your life, such as a teacher, counselor, or relative, who you could reach out to? Sometimes just having someone to talk to can make all the difference. If that's not an option at the moment, there are helplines and online communities where you can connect with others who are experiencing similar feelings of loneliness.

Remember that you're not alone in this journey and that there are people out there who genuinely care about your well-being. Take things one step at a time, and don't hesitate to seek out the support you need. Stay strong, and please reach out if you need someone to talk to."	2	2	0	0.0009235143661499023	forum w/o demographics
"alt account for this one, im 15M and i have black curly/wavy hair, i love having a small curly fringe sit on my forehead. its been getting kind of long and me and my dad and my mom were out, and we went to a turkish barber, (i went to him last time and it was decent) i told him to do it exactly like last time but a bit *LONGER*. Now it looks like i have a big lump of shit on my head, i told him to keep it curly, he brought it all back. There is nothing i can do now since i can only just wait. 

im not exaggerating when i say i have to mentally prepare myself to look in the mirror, ive had a breakdown 3 times already (im not that sensible, its the first time i cried in months)
and i got this yesterday, saturday and i have a match on monday, and im going out with my girlfriend on tuesday. she says it looks good
from snaps, but im afraid shes going to change her mind when she sees it in real life.

to give you an idea of how lobotomised this haircut is: imagine a facebook post of a pakistani kid, on his first day of school, with his uniform on, a forced smile and a forced haircut. I cant stand my face in the reflection of my phone. 
it completely killed my self confidence, im feeling suicidal, depressed and cant be bothered to do anything. and its going to stay like this for another month, even when it marinates its going to look terrible. 

thank you for reading"	"Hey everyone! I really need some hair advice. I recently went to a Turkish barber to get a trim, but unfortunately, it didn't turn out as I expected. My curly/wavy hair was supposed to have a small fringe on my forehead, but now it looks like a big mess on my head. I've tried to mentally prepare myself to look in the mirror, but it's been really tough. I even had a breakdown over it.

To make matters worse, I have a match on Monday and a date with my girlfriend on Tuesday. She says it looks good from snaps, but I'm worried she might change her mind when she sees it in person. It's really killing my self-confidence, and I'm feeling pretty down about it. I'm even tempted to just stay indoors until my hair grows out again.

If anyone has any hair tips or advice on how to deal with a bad haircut, I would be incredibly grateful. Thanks for reading and for any help you can give!"	1	2	0	0.0014087557792663574	social media

If you feel comfortable, it might be helpful to talk about your feelings with someone you trust, like a close friend or family member.

It's understandable that you're feeling upset and frustrated right now, but please try not to dwell on negative thoughts or consider self-harm. Reach out to a trusted friend, family member, or even a helpline to talk about what you're experiencing. Sometimes, talking things through can help alleviate some of the emotional distress you're feeling.

Additionally, keep in mind that how you perceive your haircut might not necessarily align with how others see it. Your girlfriend's positive reaction in the snaps could indicate that she genuinely likes how it looks on you. Remember, beauty is subjective, and what matters most is how you feel about yourself.

In the meantime, focus on self-care and engaging in activities that make you feel good. Surround yourself with supportive people who value you for who you are, rather than solely on your appearance. Lastly, remember that hair grows back, and in time, you'll be able to try different styles that better suit your preferences.

"üíî Heartbroken üíî My little brother was diagnosed with a rare cell dysfunction earlier this year and had to endure months in and out of the hospital. The doctors in our underdeveloped EU country were at a loss, so we decided to seek treatment in Turkey. But tragedy struck when he unexpectedly slipped into a coma and, devastatingly, he passed away after two long weeks. üò≠

It's been incredibly tough for me, and there are two things that weigh heavily on my heart. Firstly, I deeply regret how I treated him throughout his short life. I wish I had been more understanding, patient, and loving. Secondly, I didn't visit him nearly enough when he was in and out of the hospital, and now I'm filled with immense guilt. üòî

Please, if you have younger siblings or loved ones, cherish every moment with them. Show them love, patience, and kindness. Life can be unpredictable, and we never know when we might lose someone dear to us. Let this be a reminder to treasure and appreciate those we hold close. üôè

It's important to remember that it's natural to have these thoughts and emotions during such a difficult time.

When it comes to regrets about how you treated your brother, it's important to acknowledge that we all make mistakes and may have moments where we wish we had acted differently. However, it's essential to focus on forgiving yourself. Remember that you were only human and couldn't have predicted what was going to happen. Try to focus on the positive moments you shared with your brother and the love you had for each other.

Regarding not visiting him enough while he was in the hospital, it's understandable that you might feel guilty. However, it's important to recognize that you were probably doing the best you could under the circumstances. Coping with your own emotions and managing the situation might have made things challenging for you.

Moving forward, it might be helpful for you to find a support system. Consider talking to a therapist or joining a grief support group. These environments can provide a safe space for you to express your feelings and gain support from others who have gone through similar experiences.

Be compassionate towards yourself, acknowledging that you did what you thought was best at the time. 

It might also be helpful to find healthy ways to cope with your grief. Seeking support from friends, family, or a counselor can provide you with a safe space to express your feelings and work through the guilt you are experiencing.

Heartbreaking. My girlfriend is in a mental hospital after a traumatic incident. It all started with a false accusation, and things spiraled out of control. We're in Romania, where mental hospitals aren't great. She didn't want to take antidepressants because of her mom's addiction, and now she's in a psych ward after feeling uncomfortable during counseling. I'm devastated and scared. Long distance relationships are tough, and now she has no phone. We usually feel each other's emotions, and it's hard not knowing what she's going through. She's alone and scared, but I hope she gets out soon. Tomorrow, I'll finally get to talk to her when a friend visits her. I feel lost and could really use some support right now. My best friend stopped texting us out of the blue, and it couldn't have happened at a worse time. #supportneeded #feelingbroken	0	2	0	0.000988602638244629	social media

"I'm so sorry to hear about everything you and your girlfriend are going through. It's understandable that you feel broken and lost right now. It sounds like your girlfriend has been through a lot of traumatic experiences, and it's important that she receives the help she needs.

I know it can be difficult to see the value in counseling and medication, especially if her mother's addiction has caused negative associations. However, therapy and medication can be very beneficial for many people, and it might be worth considering their potential benefits for her mental health.

In the meantime, it's great that you are supporting her as much as you can. Being there for her and listening to her thoughts and feelings can make a big difference. Even though you can't physically be with her, your emotional support means a lot.

Remember to also take care of yourself during this challenging time. Reach out to other friends or family members who can provide comfort and support. It's important to have a support system in place for times when your best friend isn't available.

I hope that your girlfriend gets the help she needs and that things start to improve soon. Stay strong, and remember that it's okay to reach out for support when you need it."	2	0	0	0.0007555484771728516	mental health forum

I'm really sorry to hear what you and your girlfriend have been going through. It sounds like a very difficult and overwhelming situation for both of you. It's understandable that you are feeling lost and scared right now. It's great that you are providing support to your girlfriend and helping her with her mental health as much as you can. However, it's important to remember that you are not a mental health professional and it's crucial for her to receive proper care and treatment from qualified professionals. It might be helpful for her to continue attending counseling and taking medication under the guidance of a mental health clinician who can address her specific needs and concerns. In the meantime, try to reach out to other sources of support, such as friends or family members, who can provide you with emotional support during this challenging time. Remember to take care of yourself as well as you navigate through this situation.	2	0	0	0.0007115602493286133	clinician

"I'm so sorry to hear that you and your girlfriend are going through such a difficult time. It's understandable that you feel broken given the challenging circumstances. It's important to remember that mental health issues can be complex and require professional help. While it's difficult to provide the specific help that your girlfriend needs, there are some things you can do to support her.

Firstly, it's essential to encourage her to continue with counseling and taking her prescribed medications, as her mental health professionals likely have her best interests in mind. If she has concerns about the medication, encourage her to discuss them openly with her healthcare provider.

You mentioned that you support her in being vegan, which is wonderful. However, it may be beneficial to explore ways to ensure she receives necessary nutrients and medication while following her dietary preferences. Consulting with a healthcare professional or dietitian might provide valuable guidance in this regard.

Maintaining open communication with your girlfriend is crucial during this time. Even though you can't physically be together, try to find ways to stay connected emotionally. Utilize alternative means of communication, such as video calls or letter writing, to offer support and reassurance. It's essential to let her know that you are there for her and empathize with what she's going through.

Additionally, it's understandable that you may be feeling lost and in need of support yourself. Consider reaching out to others in your life, such as other friends or family members, who may be able to provide the comfort and encouragement that you need during this challenging period. Alternatively, you may benefit from seeking support from a mental health professional or counselor who can offer guidance and coping strategies.

Remember, it's important to take care of your own mental well-being too. Prioritize self-care activities that bring you comfort and solace during this difficult time. It can be helpful to engage in hobbies, exercise, practice mindfulness techniques, or reach out to supportive individuals in your life.

Take things one step at a time, and try to remain hopeful in the face of adversity. It's understandable that you may feel scared and uncertain about the future, but remember that there is help available. Encourage your girlfriend to continue seeking the support she needs, and reach out to others in your life to support yourself as well."	2	0	0	0.0006755590438842773	forum with demographics

"I'm so sorry to hear about what you and your girlfriend are going through. It sounds like an incredibly difficult situation and I can understand why you're feeling broken. It's important to remember that you're not alone and there are resources available to help you both.

Firstly, it's crucial to take care of your own mental health during this challenging time. Reach out to someone you trust, like a family member or another close friend, and let them know what you're going through. They can provide support and be there for you when you need someone to talk to. Additionally, consider seeking support from a mental health professional who can offer guidance and assistance in navigating these complex emotions.

In terms of your girlfriend's situation, it's concerning to hear that she's in a mental hospital and feeling scared and alone. It's important for her to receive proper care and support from professionals trained in mental health. While I understand your concern about the quality of mental healthcare in your country, it may be worth reaching out to local organizations or helplines that specifically focus on mental health support. They may be able to provide information, resources, or advice on how to ensure your girlfriend is receiving appropriate care.

Moreover, keeping the lines of communication open with your girlfriend is crucial. It's great that there is a friend willing to visit her and pass along the phone so you can talk to her. This can provide comfort and support for both of you during this time apart. Remember to be patient and understanding with each other as you both navigate these difficult circumstances.

Lastly, finding additional support through online communities or forums focused on mental health may also be beneficial. These spaces can provide a platform for you to share your experiences, connect with others who may have faced similar situations, and seek advice from individuals who have firsthand knowledge of mental health challenges.

Please remember that while I'm unable to provide the help that you need, there are people and resources available to support you during this difficult time."	2	0	0	0.0006631016731262207	forum w/o demographics
"Why does quietness or social awkwardness make people so uncomfortable?

"Feeling misunderstood and isolated can be tough, but remember that you are unique and have your own valuable qualities. Being quiet or socially awkward doesn't make you any less likable or deserving of connection. It's important to give yourself credit for the progress you've made.

Remember, not everyone will connect with you, and that's okay. True friendships and relationships are built on understanding and acceptance. Keep being yourself, and you'll find the right people who appreciate you for who you are. Don't let others' discomfort define your self-worth.

Having a British accent and attending religious schools may have influenced your social development, but it doesn't define your entire personality. Embrace your uniqueness and use it as a conversation starter or a way to share your experiences with others. Authenticity is key in building meaningful connections.

Keep learning and growing, but don't feel pressured to change who you are fundamentally. Embrace your own journey and take it one step at a time. You are worthy of love, acceptance, and genuine connections. Keep being true to yourself, and the right people will come into your life. üíô"	1	0	0	0.0007216334342956543	social media

"I'm really sorry to hear that you're feeling this way. It can be incredibly challenging when we feel like our social interactions are causing discomfort and misunderstandings. It's important to remember that feelings of social awkwardness and discomfort are a lot more common than you might think.

Many people have their own insecurities and uncertainties when it comes to socializing, and sometimes it can manifest as discomfort around others who are quieter or seem reserved. It's important to remind yourself that this discomfort is not a reflection of your worth or likability as a person.

It's also worth noting that people may make assumptions or judgments based on external factors like your British accent or your background attending religious private schools. While these assumptions can be frustrating, it's crucial to remember that they don't define who you are as an individual.

It might be helpful to try and focus on self-acceptance and building your confidence. Embrace your unique qualities and interests, and surround yourself with people who appreciate and respect you for who you are. Therapy or counseling can also provide a safe space to explore these feelings and work on building social skills and self-esteem.

While change can take time, please remember that you are not alone in feeling this way. With patience, self-compassion, and support, it is possible to navigate social situations with more ease and find acceptance among others."	2	0	0	0.0007078647613525391	mental health forum

"I can understand how frustrating and isolating it can feel when others seem uncomfortable or judgemental towards you because of your quietness or social awkwardness. It's important to remember that people's reactions may stem from their own misunderstandings or misconceptions, rather than any inherent flaw of yours. 

Firstly, try not to be too hard on yourself. Accepting and embracing your unique qualities and personality traits can go a long way in building self-confidence. It's okay to be reserved or formal if that's who you are, and it doesn't make you unlikeable. 

Building connections with others may take some effort, but it's not impossible. It can be helpful to gradually expose yourself to social situations and practice expressing yourself in ways that feel comfortable to you. Remember, social skills can be learned and developed over time. It might be worth seeking out opportunities for personal growth, such as social or communication workshops, therapy, or support groups where you can connect with others who may have similar experiences.

Additionally, being open and honest with people about your anxieties, British accent, and background can help dispel any misconceptions they may have. Sharing a bit about yourself can make you more relatable and approachable, allowing others to understand you better.

Lastly, focusing on building strong relationships with a few supportive individuals can make a significant difference. Surrounding yourself with people who accept and appreciate you for who you are can help you feel more comfortable and less alone.

Remember, change takes time, and it's important to be patient with yourself as you navigate your social interactions. You deserve to be understood and valued, so don't give up and keep working on your personal growth."	1	0	0	0.0007634162902832031	forum with demographics

Sometimes, people may misinterpret quietness or social awkwardness due to their own biases or lack of understanding.

It can be challenging to navigate social dynamics, especially when you're feeling isolated or misunderstood. Developing genuine connections with others takes time and effort. Remember, it's not uncommon for people to feel uncomfortable or unsure in social situations, even if they may not show it. 

It's worth considering that some individuals may be unfamiliar with different accents or backgrounds, and this can lead to misconceptions. It's important to maintain your own comfort and identity while also finding ways to establish common ground with those around you. Cultivating self-confidence and being open to new experiences can help you overcome some of the challenges you're facing.

In addition, seeking professional support from a therapist or counselor might be beneficial. They can provide guidance on building social skills, managing anxiety, and addressing any underlying issues from your upbringing.

Engaging in a conversation, even if it was brief, can be a big accomplishment, especially if you struggle with stuttering or anxiety in social situations. Feeling happy about this interaction is a wonderful sign of growth and progress.

Remember, conversations are a two-way street, and it's okay to feel nervous or have limited responses. The fact that you were able to participate and engage in the conversation is a huge step forward. Each small success can build your confidence in social situations.

If you find yourself wanting to continue improving your social skills, you might try gradually exposing yourself to more social interactions at your own pace. Pushing yourself too hard can be overwhelming, so take it one step at a time. Additionally, if social anxiety or any other mental health concerns are impacting your daily life, it's always a good idea to reach out to a mental health professional who can provide guidance and support.

Keep celebrating your successes, no matter how small they may seem, and continue to build on them. You're on the right track, and with time and practice, you may find yourself feeling more comfortable and confident in social situations."	1	0	0	0.000643312931060791	mental health forum

It sounds like you felt happy and more confident during this experience, which is wonderful.

If you'd like to continue building your social skills, you may want to consider practicing in different situations where you feel more comfortable, such as joining a group or attending events that align with your interests. Remember, progress takes time, and every positive interaction counts.

If you ever need further support or guidance in managing anxiety or improving your social interactions, it could be helpful to seek assistance from a mental health professional. They can provide you with tailored strategies and techniques to navigate these situations more comfortably. Keep up the good work!"	1	0	0	0.0006256699562072754	clinician
"Today I was coming back to hotel I took an elevator I was alone but then some girl came to elevator too I was scared I didnt looked at her but she started a conversation about do I enjoy my stay at hotel and is it my first time in Austria. I said Yes and thats its very nice here she then asked me where i was from i said I was from poland and stuff she asked about weather. When elevator finally stopped at my floor I thanked her and got off as fast as I can and go to my room.

Engaging in conversation, even if it feels one-sided, can still be a big step towards building your confidence. It's completely normal to feel nervous or anxious in social situations, especially when interacting with someone new. The fact that you were able to engage in the conversation and express yourself, even with shorter answers, is a sign of progress.

Remember, it's okay to take things at your own pace and gradually work on expanding your comfort zone. Celebrate the small victories, like this elevator conversation, as they can serve as important stepping stones towards improved social interactions. Each positive experience can help build your self-confidence and lessen any future feelings of anxiety.

If you ever feel like challenging yourself to have longer conversations or initiate interactions, you can try practicing with friends or family members in a supportive environment. Additionally, exploring self-help techniques such as deep breathing exercises or mindfulness can also be beneficial in managing anxiety in social situations.

Keep focusing on the positive moments, and don't forget to give yourself credit for stepping out of your comfort zone. Remember, progress is a journey, and every small step forward counts. Keep up the great work!"	1	0	0	0.0006216764450073242	forum with demographics

It sounds like you were able to engage in a conversation comfortably, which is definitely something to be proud of! Sometimes, even small interactions like this can boost our self-esteem and make us feel happier.

It's completely normal to feel a bit apprehensive or unsure when starting a conversation, especially with someone you don't know. However, the fact that you managed to respond confidently with ""yes"" and ""no"" is a great achievement. Remember, communication is a skill that can be developed over time, and every conversation is an opportunity for growth.

Next time, you might want to try expanding on your responses a bit more. For instance, instead of just saying ""yes"" or ""no,"" you could share a brief detail or opinion related to the topic. This can help keep the conversation flowing and make it feel more interactive. Remember, there's no pressure to have a perfectly balanced conversation every time - it's about feeling comfortable and expressing yourself in a way that feels genuine.

It's also important to acknowledge the positive feelings you experienced during and after the conversation. Celebrate this accomplishment and use it as a reminder that you are capable of engaging with others. This can be a confidence booster for future interactions.

Overall, keep practicing and gradually challenging yourself to have longer, more in-depth conversations. It's okay to start small and gradually build up your comfort level. If you ever feel overwhelmed or anxious in social situations, it might be helpful to seek support from a mental health professional who can provide guidance tailored to your needs.

Remember, you're making progress, and every positive interaction counts! Keep up the good work!"	1	0	0	0.0006540417671203613	forum w/o demographics
"As a 16 year old in high school, I do relatively well grades-wise. However, when it comes to socializing, I'm a failure. I don't really talk unless I'm talked to, which is close to never. I get that it's kind of on me that I don't have many friends, but that's aside from the point. Besides, I'm sure my RBF is probably to blame as well.

Due to me being quiet, it seems that everybody around me makes up terrible and untrue things about me. Some that I hear a lot are ""school shooter"", ""kidnapper"", and (my personal favorite) ""The Riddler from The Batman"". I have never really understood why. Isn't being called a school shooter what can cause one? It's not like I would even want to hurt anybody around me.

This has completely demotivated me from making friends at all. I fear that I'll be seen as a creep even if I try to socialize. It's not even that I look bad or something, I just have a bad rep for no reason. If I'm called to talk in class, I always hear the reaction of ""he can talk??????"". It's as if I'm not even seen as another person by them.

When it comes to the rare few I have talked to, they don't even know my name. They refer to me as ""Tyrone"", ""Lebron"", or some other random name. Sometimes I'm just reduced to ""white boy"". I get that it's all light hearted, but it's pretty damn demeaning. I'd like to speak up about it, but I fear I'll just be shut down instantly with how kids my age are.

There are a few kind people who have taken the time to actually understand who I am. The majority of them are women. However, any time I am speaking with them, somebody always has to say something like ""W Rizz"" (even though I'm talking to them completely platonically) and it just makes things awkward. It seems like I'm seen as a joke everywhere around school. I wish people around me would understand that I'm a human being with feelings.

At some point last year, we were to do group projects in an English class. The teacher assigned groups based off who was friends with each other, and, seeing as I had no friends in the class, I got paired up with people who had special needs. This wouldn't have been a problem if it weren't for the fact that not only was the entire workload up to me for the quarter, but I was beginning to be seen as special needs myself. I haven't even been diagnosed for any neurodivergence. This only made people make fun of me even more.

As much as I want to get through high school, the people around me make it a living hell. What should I do? I would love to ignore them, but it's pretty hard when it's everywhere I go.

Remember that you are not alone and there are people out there who understand how you feel. It's unfortunate that some people resort to making up hurtful things, but try not to let their words define you. Focus on building relationships with those who appreciate and respect you for who you are. It's great to hear that there are a few kind people who understand you - cherish those connections. If the negativity becomes overwhelming, consider talking to a trusted adult or counselor who can offer guidance. Keep being yourself, and remember that you are worthy of being seen and heard.

It can be really tough when you feel isolated and misunderstood by your peers. Remember that you are not alone in feeling this way ‚Äì many individuals struggle with socializing during their teenage years.

One thing to keep in mind is that the hurtful comments you're receiving are likely a result of others not understanding you, rather than any fault of your own. It's important to remember that these hurtful words are not a reflection of your worth as a person. You have inherent value and deserve to be treated with respect and kindness.

Finding support can make a significant impact on your well-being. It's encouraging that you mentioned there are a few kind people who have taken the time to understand you. Continue fostering those connections and seeking their support. Additionally, consider reaching out to a trusted teacher, counselor, or adult who can offer guidance and help advocate for you if needed.

In terms of coping with the negative experiences, finding healthy outlets can be beneficial. Engaging in activities or hobbies that bring you joy and fulfillment can increase your self-esteem and provide a sense of purpose. This can also provide opportunities to meet like-minded individuals who share your interests. Remember, friendships can take time to develop, so be patient with yourself.

If the situation becomes too overwhelming, it might be worth considering talking to a mental health professional, such as a therapist or counselor. They can provide valuable insight, guidance, and strategies to navigate social interactions and improve your overall well-being.

You deserve to be seen as the unique individual you are, with your own thoughts, feelings, and potential. Stay true to yourself, seek support from those who understand and appreciate you, and remember that high school is just one chapter of your life. It does get better, and you have the strength to overcome these challenges and find your place in the world."	2	0	0	0.0006918907165527344	mental health forum

It sounds like you're feeling isolated, misunderstood, and demeaned by your peers. It's important to remember that you are not alone in feeling this way, and there are steps you can take to address these issues.

Firstly, know that you are not defined by the negative perceptions others may have of you. It's important to focus on your own self-worth and not let these hurtful comments define your identity. Building self-esteem and confidence can help you navigate these situations more effectively.

Consider seeking support from a trusted adult, such as a school counselor or teacher, who can provide guidance and advocate for your needs. They may be able to help implement strategies to address the mistreatment you're experiencing and promote a more inclusive and respectful environment.

Additionally, exploring extracurricular activities or clubs that align with your interests can help you connect with like-minded individuals and form new friendships. Engaging in activities you enjoy can also boost your self-confidence and provide a space to cultivate positive relationships.

Remember, it's okay to assert yourself and speak up when you feel disrespected or demeaned. Practice setting assertive boundaries and expressing how certain comments or behaviors make you feel. While it may feel uncomfortable initially, developing these skills can empower you and potentially change how others perceive and treat you.

Lastly, taking care of your mental and emotional well-being is crucial. Consider engaging in activities that bring you joy and help you relax, such as hobbies, exercise, or spending time in nature. If your feelings of sadness or anxiety persist, consider seeking support from a mental health professional who can assist you in navigating and coping with these challenges.

You deserve to be seen and treated with respect and compassion. It may take time, but with the right support and strategies, you can create a more positive high school experience."	2	0	0	0.000672459602355957	clinician

I'm really sorry to hear that you're going through such a tough time at school. It can be incredibly challenging when social interactions become overwhelming and others make hurtful assumptions about you. Please know that you are not alone in feeling this way, and there are ways to navigate through these difficulties.

Firstly, I want you to remember that you are not defined by the negative opinions or assumptions of others. You deserve to be treated with respect and dignity, just like anyone else. It can be tough, but try to focus on valuing and accepting yourself for who you are, rather than seeking validation from others.

One suggestion would be to find a safe and supportive space where you can connect with like-minded individuals who appreciate you for who you are. This might be joining a club or organization that aligns with your interests, or seeking out online communities where you can have meaningful and supportive conversations.

Moreover, if you feel comfortable doing so, consider reaching out to a trusted teacher, counselor, or adult in your school who can provide guidance and support. Sometimes, they can intervene and help address the situation or even organize activities to foster inclusion and understanding among your peers.

Lastly, it's important to remember that high school is just one chapter of your life, and things do get better. Your experiences now will not define your future. Focus on your own personal growth, pursue your interests and goals, and surround yourself with positive influences whenever possible.

Remember, you deserve to be seen and respected as a human being. Stay strong and keep pushing forward. There are people out there who will see the real you and appreciate you for it. You are not alone in this journey, and there is hope for a brighter future. Don't hesitate to seek support whenever you need it."	2	0	0	0.0006738901138305664	forum with demographics

It's clear that you're feeling isolated and mistreated because of how others perceive you. It can be incredibly challenging to deal with such negative stereotypes and hurtful comments, especially when you're just trying to navigate your way through high school.

First off, it's important to remember that you are not defined by the hurtful things others say about you. You are a unique individual with your own thoughts, feelings, and potential. It's completely normal to feel demotivated and afraid to socialize when you're constantly surrounded by negativity, but try not to let it discourage you from seeking connections with others. 

Have you considered talking to a school counselor or a trusted adult about what you're going through? They may be able to offer you guidance, support, and resources to help navigate this challenging situation. It might also be worth trying to engage in activities or groups that align with your interests outside of school. This could provide an opportunity to meet new people who share similar passions and have a different perspective on your worth as a person.

Remember, building meaningful connections takes time and effort. Try to focus on nurturing the few kind relationships you've mentioned, as they can be invaluable in providing support and understanding. Lastly, it's important to prioritize your own mental well-being. Engaging in self-care activities, such as hobbies, exercise, or creative outlets, can help you maintain a healthier mindset amidst the negativity.

Always remember that you are deserving of respect and kindness. It may be difficult right now, but there are people out there who will see you for who you truly are. Stay strong and hang in there."	2	0	0	0.0006796121597290039	forum w/o demographics
"(M30). Have had OCD, anxiety, health anxiety since I was little.

A year ago I was lying in bed to sleep, it was the middle of the night. Suddenly out of nowhere I find it hard to breathe, I get palpitations and a burning sensation in my chest. I get out of bed thinking I'm having a heart attack. I go to the emergency room and after EKG (ECG), tests, blood test and blood pressure measurement, they send me home.

I contact the local health center as after that episode I started to have irregular heartbeats. The doctors take my blood test, urine test, they do an EKG on me, and all values look good. My doctor concludes that it is anxiety and panic, so I see a psychologist. I have trauma from childhood and the year before (2021) my grandmother passed away suddenly, my grandmother who raised me (basically).

I continued to contact the local practitioner as I could wake up in the middle of the night completely out of breath and a racing heart. I am constantly worried about having heart disease, such as a stroke or heart attack, but the doctors say my heart is normal.

I continued to have heart palpitations several days a week, had constant chest pressure and chest pain and finally got a referral to a heart specialist clinic. There they connected me to machines, did an echocardiogram, ultrasound and I had to perform a test where I cycled while connected to machines. According to the results, my heart is normal.

I keep waking up at night with my breath in my throat, the feeling of someone strangling me, pain in my stomach and pressure on my chest and a constant worry and fear of death. I go back to university in 2 weeks, looking forward to that, but really don‚Äôt want this shit to affect my studies and social interactions too much. 

I don‚Äôt know what to do. Really. I‚Äôm on the edge my family members have had it, they don‚Äôt want to hear it and they think I‚Äôm crazy. I‚Äôve always been an anxious kid, I‚Äôm afraid of dying constantly and I think about that a lot, but since I had that one ‚Äúmajor‚Äù panic attack, my life has changed completely and I haven‚Äôt felt well for over a year now. 

I see a therapist, but not that often, once a month maybe (your typical underfunded Scandinavian free health care office). But I‚Äôll have more appointments in the autumn. But i think about trying CBT.

Also, one thing that gets me to relax is meditation, East Asian calming music and Tibetan bowls. I‚Äôm thinking about learning Transcendental Meditation."	Hey there! I'm really sorry to hear that you've been going through such a tough time with your anxiety and health concerns. It's great that you've been proactive in seeking medical help and seeing a therapist. Taking care of your mental health is so important. Have you ever tried incorporating mindfulness techniques into your everyday routine?

Continuing therapy is a great idea, and it's good to hear that you'll have more frequent appointments in the near future. Therapy, especially cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), can be very helpful for managing anxiety and intrusive thoughts. It can provide you with tools and techniques to challenge and change negative thought patterns.

In addition to therapy, it's great that you've found some relaxation techniques that work for you, such as meditation and listening to calming music. Consider incorporating these practices into your daily routine to help manage your anxiety. Learning Transcendental Meditation could be a positive step, as it has been shown to have benefits for stress reduction and overall well-being. Just remember to give yourself time and patience as you explore different coping mechanisms.

Lastly, it may be helpful to seek support from a mental health forum or support group where you can connect with others who understand what you're going through. Sharing experiences, hearing different perspectives, and receiving validation can be comforting and empowering.

Remember, recovery is a journey, and it takes time and effort. Be kind to yourself and celebrate small victories along the way. You may also want to consider talking to your therapist about any concerns you have about your studies and social interactions, as they can offer guidance and support in managing those areas of your life.

Hang in there, and know that you have the strength to overcome this. Keep reaching out for help and utilizing the resources available to you. You're not alone, and there is hope for a brighter future."	2	0	0	0.0006808042526245117	mental health forum
"(M30). Have had OCD, anxiety, health anxiety since I was little.

A year ago I was lying in bed to sleep, it was the middle of the night. Suddenly out of nowhere I find it hard to breathe, I get palpitations and a burning sensation in my chest. I get out of bed thinking I'm having a heart attack. I go to the emergency room and after EKG (ECG), tests, blood test and blood pressure measurement, they send me home.

I contact the local health center as after that episode I started to have irregular heartbeats. The doctors take my blood test, urine test, they do an EKG on me, and all values look good. My doctor concludes that it is anxiety and panic, so I see a psychologist. I have trauma from childhood and the year before (2021) my grandmother passed away suddenly, my grandmother who raised me (basically).

I continued to contact the local practitioner as I could wake up in the middle of the night completely out of breath and a racing heart. I am constantly worried about having heart disease, such as a stroke or heart attack, but the doctors say my heart is normal.

I continued to have heart palpitations several days a week, had constant chest pressure and chest pain and finally got a referral to a heart specialist clinic. There they connected me to machines, did an echocardiogram, ultrasound and I had to perform a test where I cycled while connected to machines. According to the results, my heart is normal.

I keep waking up at night with my breath in my throat, the feeling of someone strangling me, pain in my stomach and pressure on my chest and a constant worry and fear of death. I go back to university in 2 weeks, looking forward to that, but really don‚Äôt want this shit to affect my studies and social interactions too much. 

I don‚Äôt know what to do. Really. I‚Äôm on the edge my family members have had it, they don‚Äôt want to hear it and they think I‚Äôm crazy. I‚Äôve always been an anxious kid, I‚Äôm afraid of dying constantly and I think about that a lot, but since I had that one ‚Äúmajor‚Äù panic attack, my life has changed completely and I haven‚Äôt felt well for over a year now. 

I see a therapist, but not that often, once a month maybe (your typical underfunded Scandinavian free health care office). But I‚Äôll have more appointments in the autumn. But i think about trying CBT.

Also, one thing that gets me to relax is meditation, East Asian calming music and Tibetan bowls. I‚Äôm thinking about learning Transcendental Meditation."	"I'm really sorry to hear that you've been experiencing these symptoms and feelings for such a long time. It sounds like you've taken the important step of seeking medical help and ruling out any physical health concerns.

Given your history of OCD, anxiety, and health anxiety, it's possible that what you're experiencing could be related to anxiety and panic. Anxiety can cause a wide range of physical symptoms, including difficulty breathing, palpitations, chest discomfort, and stomach pain. It's not uncommon for anxiety to worsen during periods of stress or after traumatic events, such as the loss of your grandmother.

I'm glad to hear that you're seeing a therapist, even though it's not as frequent as you would like. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) can be very effective in helping individuals manage anxiety and related symptoms. It focuses on identifying and challenging unhelpful thoughts and behaviors, and developing more adaptive coping strategies.

In addition to CBT, meditation, and listening to calming music can be great self-care tools to help you relax and manage anxiety. Learning Transcendental Meditation could be a valuable addition to your coping toolbox.

It's essential to continue prioritizing your mental health and seeking support. If possible, consider discussing with your therapist the possibility of increasing the frequency of your sessions or exploring other treatment options that may be available. You deserve ongoing care and support for your well-being.

Remember, you're not alone in this journey, and help is available. Keep taking steps towards self-care and reaching out for support when needed."	2	0	0	0.0006740093231201172	clinician

"I'm really sorry to hear that you're struggling with these symptoms and anxiety. It sounds like you've been through a lot, both in terms of your childhood trauma and the loss of your grandmother.

It's great that you've sought medical help and undergone tests to rule out any underlying physical conditions. It can be reassuring to know that your heart is healthy, but I understand that the symptoms and worries persist. Anxiety can be incredibly overwhelming, and it can manifest in physical symptoms like palpitations and chest pain.

Continuing therapy is a good step, even if it's not as frequent as you would like. CBT (cognitive-behavioral therapy) is often recommended for anxiety disorders, including health anxiety. CBT helps you identify and challenge negative thoughts and beliefs that contribute to anxiety, and teaches helpful coping strategies. It might be worth discussing the possibility of more frequent therapy sessions with your therapist, or exploring other therapy options that might be available to you.

In addition to therapy, it's great that you've found some relaxation techniques that can help you calm down, like meditation and listening to calming music. Incorporating these into your daily routine can be beneficial in managing anxiety. If you're interested in learning Transcendental Meditation, it could be worth exploring as a complementary tool.

Remember, you're not alone in this. Many people struggle with anxiety and health anxiety, and reaching out for support is a courageous step. I would also encourage you to seek out online mental health communities or support groups where you can connect and share experiences with others who may have similar struggles. Sometimes, hearing from others who understand can provide a sense of validation and support.

Take things one step at a time and be patient with yourself. Healing takes time, but with the right support and coping strategies, it is possible to manage anxiety and regain a sense of well-being.

Hi all, first of all i‚Äôm NOT asking for a diagnosis. Been to the GP several times. Just searching for some insights and opinions..

So there‚Äôs some things I‚Äôve been struggling with for years. Father died in 2013 of cancer, had very difficult years after in which I didn‚Äôt grieve his death. Also had a very manipulative girlfriend from 2013 tot 2018. Been also having OCD since I were a kid.

When that relationship ended I started to develop a cough and bowel issues. I saw that my stools were thin and weird. Saw my GP for both issues, but she assured me it would be nothing. Health anxiety started to get worse and I started getting panic attacks. Years passed and the symptoms didn‚Äôt go away. Went to my GP so many times to get reassurance about my health..

Last year in april I moved to a new place with my new girlfriend who is my fianc√©e today! Around that time I felt a very hard immovable lump in my neck that freaked me out. Started worrying about cancer and convinced myself I had it. Went to my GP who referred me for an echo, but nothing weird. Could be an extra rib they said in the hospital. Anyhow, that lump freaked me out to the MAX and I developed an one sided headache at that time. It‚Äôs more of like a head pressure around my right temple that sometimes radiates to the neck. It‚Äôs literally always there from waking up to going to sleep. Doesn‚Äôt wake me up tho. Developed (in my imagination) one sided weakness on the left side, which suddenly went away. The cough I had for years disappeared out of nothing but now I‚Äôm left with this one sided head pressure that‚Äôs constantly there for 14 months now. Also since a couple of months occasionally a weird smell. For some hours my smell gets distorted and then out of nothing (usually after sleeping) it resets. Bloods are perfect and did some neuro tests (reflexes, pupils etc) and everything is OK. GP doesn‚Äôt see a need for an MRI because if it were a brain tumor she‚Äôd likely see something in the tests and the symptoms would‚Äôve gotten waayy worse over the course of a year. Also still left with bowel issues. Never a solid stool, always gassy and stools smell bad. Thought I had blood in my stool but my GP said it was undigested foods. Also a constant pressure in my lower left abdomen. Don‚Äôt know what to do now, doc says it‚Äôs all because of high amounts of stress I put my body to.

Is it really possible that I have this one sided constant pressure because of something psychomatic for so long? It didn‚Äôt get worse over time. Also the bowel movements, could this really be stress for so many years? Doc also said bowel cancer usually gives anemia, which i don‚Äôt have. Also have strong depersonalization issues for some years which worsened A LOT the last couple of weeks.. no one notices anything. 

I sometimes think I developed bowel cancer some years ago and last year it metastized to my brain and have it there also since. Is this something realistic or am I not being sober in this? Is my heavy derealization from a tumor or more likely the anxiety and trauma‚Äôs. Last weeks everything feels very fake.

I would think.. if it were something so serious, something would‚Äôve happened by now right? The phantosmia, the head pressure (that sometimes gets really mild almost not noticable), (perceived) weakness and pulsating tingling in left side of the body would‚Äôve developed significantly if it were really something right? This derealization is not cool.. want to feel normal again..

Sorry for my english btw, I‚Äôm dutch."	"Hey there! I'm really sorry to hear that you've been struggling with these symptoms for so long.

It's great that you've been to the GP several times to seek help and get reassurance. While I can't provide a diagnosis, I would like to offer some support and insights.

It's important to remember that stress can have a significant impact on our bodies, and it can manifest in various ways, including bowel issues, headaches, and other physical symptoms.

If you're feeling concerned about your symptoms, it might be helpful to speak with your GP about exploring different approaches to managing stress and anxiety. They may be able to suggest some coping strategies or refer you to a mental health professional who can provide additional support.

It seems like you've been through a lot of challenging events, such as the loss of your father and being in a manipulative relationship. These experiences can definitely have an impact on your mental health and can manifest physically as well.

It's important to keep in mind that stress and anxiety can cause physical symptoms. The constant pressure you're experiencing in your head and abdomen could be related to the stress you've been under. It's possible that the high levels of stress you mentioned have taken a toll on your body.

It's understandable that you're worried about serious medical conditions, but it's important to trust the medical professionals you've seen. They've conducted tests and reassured you that there doesn't seem to be anything concerning. Usually, symptoms wouldn't persist for such a long period without any significant changes if there were a serious underlying condition. Trusting your doctor's expertise can help alleviate some anxiety.

Regarding the depersonalization and derealization you've been experiencing, they can often relate to anxiety and trauma. These symptoms can feel very overwhelming, but they are likely a result of the emotional distress you've been through. It might be helpful to seek support from a mental health professional who can provide guidance and help you process these experiences.

Remember that you're not alone in this, and seeking support from loved ones or a support group can also be beneficial. They can offer understanding and empathy, and share their own experiences which might help you feel less alone.

Lastly, I would encourage you to continue seeing your doctor for routine check-ups and discussing any concerns you may have. They can monitor your physical health and provide appropriate guidance based on their expertise.

Take care, and remember that seeking support is a brave and important step towards taking care of your mental health."	1	0	0	0.0007032155990600586	mental health forum

Thank you for reaching out and sharing your experiences. It sounds like you have been through a lot of challenging situations and have been dealing with various physical and emotional symptoms. It's important to remember that I cannot provide a diagnosis or medical advice, but I can offer some insights and opinions based on what you've described. 

Regarding the physical symptoms you mentioned, it's possible for stress and anxiety to manifest in physical ways, such as the constant one-sided head pressure and bowel issues. When our body is under stress, it can affect different systems and lead to various symptoms. It's important to continue working closely with your GP to rule out any potential medical causes.

Your experiences with derealization and depersonalization can also be linked to anxiety and trauma. These dissociative experiences are part of the body's way of coping with overwhelming stress. Trauma can have a significant impact on our mental and emotional well-being, and it may be helpful to explore these experiences with a mental health professional who can provide support and guidance.

While it's natural to have worries and doubts about your health, it's important to also consider that anxiety can sometimes amplify perceived symptoms or make them seem more severe than they actually are. However, it's essential to work with your GP to monitor your symptoms and address any concerns you may have.

Consider reaching out to a mental health clinician who can support you in managing stress, anxiety, and any underlying trauma. They can help you explore coping strategies, provide a safe space for processing emotions, and offer additional insights and support tailored to your specific needs. Remember, you don't have to face these challenges alone, and seeking professional help can be a valuable step towards finding relief and feeling like yourself again.

Take care.

Sorry for my english btw, I‚Äôm dutch."	"Hey there, I'm sorry to hear that you're going through such a tough time. It can be really difficult when you have symptoms that you don't fully understand, especially when you've visited the GP multiple times. While I can't offer a diagnosis, I can offer some general insights and opinions.

It's important to remember that physical symptoms can sometimes be related to stress and anxiety. The mind and body are closely connected, and our mental health can have a significant impact on our physical well-being. Stress, trauma, and anxiety can manifest in various ways, including gastrointestinal issues like bowel irregularities and increased sensitivity to physical sensations.

It's great that your blood tests and neuro tests have come back normal. This is a positive indication that there may not be any serious underlying medical conditions. However, if you're still concerned and feel that your symptoms are impacting your quality of life, it may be worth seeking a second opinion from another healthcare professional. They might be able to provide further insights or suggest additional tests or treatments.

Regarding your worry about cancer and brain tumors, remember that anxiety tends to amplify our fears and create worst-case scenarios in our minds. It's common for anxious thoughts to jump to the most severe possibilities. However, try to keep in mind that in many cases, symptoms would worsen or progress noticeably over time if they were caused by serious medical conditions.

Lastly, I understand that depersonalization can be distressing and make everything feel surreal. It's important to remember that depersonalization is a known symptom of anxiety. Working with a mental health professional, such as a therapist or psychologist, could potentially help you address your anxiety and trauma-related issues.

Take care and remember that you're not alone in this journey. It's crucial to seek support from professionals and loved ones who can provide the necessary guidance and assistance."	2	0	0	0.0006917715072631836	forum with demographics

Hi all, first of all i‚Äôm NOT asking for a diagnosis. Been to the GP several times. Just searching for some insights and opinions..

So there‚Äôs some things I‚Äôve been struggling with for years. Father died in 2013 of cancer, had very difficult years after in which I didn‚Äôt grieve his death. Also had a very manipulative girlfriend from 2013 tot 2018. Been also having OCD since I were a kid.

When that relationship ended I started to develop a cough and bowel issues. I saw that my stools were thin and weird. Saw my GP for both issues, but she assured me it would be nothing. Health anxiety started to get worse and I started getting panic attacks. Years passed and the symptoms didn‚Äôt go away. Went to my GP so many times to get reassurance about my health..

Last year in april I moved to a new place with my new girlfriend who is my fianc√©e today! Around that time I felt a very hard immovable lump in my neck that freaked me out. Started worrying about cancer and convinced myself I had it. Went to my GP who referred me for an echo, but nothing weird. Could be an extra rib they said in the hospital. Anyhow, that lump freaked me out to the MAX and I developed an one sided headache at that time. It‚Äôs more of like a head pressure around my right temple that sometimes radiates to the neck. It‚Äôs literally always there from waking up to going to sleep. Doesn‚Äôt wake me up tho. Developed (in my imagination) one sided weakness on the left side, which suddenly went away. The cough I had for years disappeared out of nothing but now I‚Äôm left with this one sided head pressure that‚Äôs constantly there for 14 months now. Also since a couple of months occasionally a weird smell. For some hours my smell gets distorted and then out of nothing (usually after sleeping) it resets. Bloods are perfect and did some neuro tests (reflexes, pupils etc) and everything is OK. GP doesn‚Äôt see a need for an MRI because if it were a brain tumor she‚Äôd likely see something in the tests and the symptoms would‚Äôve gotten waayy worse over the course of a year. Also still left with bowel issues. Never a solid stool, always gassy and stools smell bad. Thought I had blood in my stool but my GP said it was undigested foods. Also a constant pressure in my lower left abdomen. Don‚Äôt know what to do now, doc says it‚Äôs all because of high amounts of stress I put my body to.

Is it really possible that I have this one sided constant pressure because of something psychomatic for so long? It didn‚Äôt get worse over time. Also the bowel movements, could this really be stress for so many years? Doc also said bowel cancer usually gives anemia, which i don‚Äôt have. Also have strong depersonalization issues for some years which worsened A LOT the last couple of weeks.. no one notices anything. 

I sometimes think I developed bowel cancer some years ago and last year it metastized to my brain and have it there also since. Is this something realistic or am I not being sober in this? Is my heavy derealization from a tumor or more likely the anxiety and trauma‚Äôs. Last weeks everything feels very fake.

I would think.. if it were something so serious, something would‚Äôve happened by now right? The phantosmia, the head pressure (that sometimes gets really mild almost not noticable), (perceived) weakness and pulsating tingling in left side of the body would‚Äôve developed significantly if it were really something right? This derealization is not cool.. want to feel normal again..

Sorry for my english btw, I‚Äôm dutch."	"Hey there, 24M. I'm not a doctor, but I can offer some support and insights based on what you shared. It sounds like you've been through a lot of challenging experiences, from the loss of your father to a manipulative relationship. These types of events can have a significant impact on our mental and physical health. Mental health issues like OCD and health anxiety can manifest in various physical symptoms, such as bowel issues.

It's important to remember that stress and anxiety can create real physical symptoms that might not necessarily be linked to a serious illness like cancer. It's understandable that you're worried about the persistent symptoms you've been experiencing, but your GP has reassured you several times and your test results have come back normal. It's great that you've been proactive in seeking medical advice.

Having said that, it may also be beneficial to explore the possibility of these symptoms being psychosomatic. Our mental and emotional well-being can impact various aspects of our physical health. Stress and trauma can manifest in various ways, including depersonalization and derealization. It's worth discussing these symptoms with a mental health professional who can provide guidance and support.

While it's natural to have concerns and fears about your health, it's important to remember that catastrophizing scenarios like the development of cancer can exacerbate anxiety. Trusting your doctor's expertise and seeking support from mental health professionals may be beneficial for finding ways to manage and cope with your symptoms.

Remember, reaching out for support is a positive step towards taking care of your well-being. Keep advocating for yourself and explore therapy options to address both your physical and mental health concerns. Take care!"	1	0	0	0.0006656050682067871	forum w/o demographics

"	"Hello,

Thank you for reaching out and for your dedication to helping veterans with PTSD. It's great to hear about your hyperbaric oxygen therapy program and your efforts to make it available to US veterans.

To connect with veteran associations and hyperbaric centers for knowledge sharing, here are a few steps you can consider:

1. Research Veteran Associations: Look for reputable veteran associations in the US that focus on PTSD and mental health support for veterans. Some well-known organizations include the Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW), Disabled American Veterans (DAV), and the American Legion. Explore their websites to learn more about their resources and contact details.

2. Send Inquiries: Once you have identified the relevant veteran associations, reach out to them by email or phone. Introduce yourself, explain the purpose of your inquiry, and outline your interest in sharing knowledge about your hyperbaric oxygen therapy program. Be specific about what you want to accomplish and how it can benefit US veterans. Request their guidance or any potential avenues for collaboration.

3. Connect with Hyperbaric Centers: In addition to reaching out to veteran associations, it would be beneficial to establish connections with hyperbaric centers in the US as well. Research well-known hyperbaric centers in the country, and contact them with a similar introductory message as you did with the veteran associations. Inquire about their expertise in treating PTSD and discuss the possibility of knowledge sharing or potential collaboration.

4. Attend Conferences and Workshops: Consider attending conferences, workshops, or seminars that focus on mental health, PTSD, and hyperbaric oxygen therapy. These events often bring together professionals and organizations working in the field. By participating, you can network, gain insights, and potentially connect with relevant experts and associations.

Remember to be persistent in your efforts, as it may take time to establish connections and find the right partners. The valuable knowledge and experience you have gained through your program could greatly benefit US veterans, so keep pursuing opportunities for sharing your expertise.

Best of luck in your endeavors, and thank you again for your commitment to helping veterans with PTSD.

"	"Dear Redditor,

It's truly amazing to hear about the success of your hyperbaric oxygen therapy program for PTSD. I appreciate your dedication to connecting with veteran associations and hyperbaric centers to expand your knowledge sharing and make this treatment available to US veterans in need.

To explore further, I would recommend reaching out to larger veteran associations such as the Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW), the American Legion, and Disabled American Veterans (DAV). These organizations often have networks and resources dedicated to assisting veterans with various healthcare needs. Exploring collaboration opportunities with hyperbaric centers that might have a similar interest in expanding their services to veterans could also be beneficial.

I encourage you to research the websites of these associations to obtain contact information or consider attending conferences or events dedicated to veteran healthcare. This will provide you with an opportunity to network with professionals who are passionate about serving veterans.

Additionally, you may want to explore potential partnerships with academic institutions that have research programs focused on veterans' health. They can provide valuable insights and connections to raise awareness about your therapy program.

I truly admire your commitment to helping US veterans with treatment-resistant PTSD and I hope these suggestions can assist you in your journey to connect with veteran associations and hyperbaric centers. Remember, with persistence and dedication, your efforts can make a significant difference in the lives of those who have served our country.

Normally i don't write depressing shit about myself but i just can't take it anymore seriously.                     
 I have always been a happy person and had lot of well (Friends) i thought but it all went downhill...

First of all im 18 years old with a child, How you ask? my girl lied about using contraceptives and decided to keep the child and afterwards cheated on me. I love the child to death but thinking he grows up with parents seperated so early and seeing him not much breaks my heart in pieces. I keep trying to hold all that weight and keep going forward to do the best for my child but then i realised my friends hated me and used me for my car and money. So all the childhood friends with good memories just didn't give a f about me. I tried to tell my parents but they didn't take me seriously and just said i need to be a man and be there for my child, All easy said when you've been dealing with depression almost all your life and when you finally build yourself up in position that you're happy... you get shot with multiple arrows at once and fall all the way back down, when this time you have no one to help you. I also lost my job recently due a miscommunication and im in a big financial problem now. I feel like no girls like me or even find me attractive when im literally behaving as myself and still take care of myself.

All my life it's been a journey of dragging myself up and get shot down every... single... time...              
 Say what you want about me that it's partly my fault, because yes it is. But making mistakes is a part of life but honestly i just can't bear the weight anymore.

I just read your message and wanted to let you know that you're not alone. Life can be tough sometimes, especially when it feels like everything is falling apart. It's important to remember that you don't have to face it all by yourself. There are people out there who care and want to help.

Being a young parent is definitely a challenging situation, but you're doing your best for your child, and that's truly admirable. It's understandable that you're going through a mixture of emotions right now. Take it one day at a time and remember that your love and dedication to your child is what matters the most.

It's unfortunate to hear about the friends who let you down. It can be tough when the people we trust end up hurting us. But remember, true friends are those who stand by you through thick and thin. Surround yourself with people who genuinely care about your well-being.

Regarding your job and financial situation, try not to lose hope. Life has its ups and downs, and setbacks happen to everyone. Keep searching for new opportunities and stay positive. Remember, your value isn't tied to your employment status.

Lastly, please don't doubt your self-worth based on how you think others perceive you. Attractiveness isn't just about physical appearance, it's about being genuine and true to yourself. Focus on taking care of yourself and finding happiness within. The right people will appreciate you for who you are.

Remember, it's okay to reach out for support. There are helplines, support groups, and online communities that can provide you with guidance and solace during difficult times. Hang in there, friend. You matter, and there are brighter days ahead. Sending you good vibes. ‚ú®"	1	0	0	0.0007112026214599609	social media

I'm really sorry to hear that you're going through such a tough time right now. It sounds like you're carrying a lot on your shoulders and feeling overwhelmed by everything that has happened. It's completely understandable that you would be feeling down and in need of support.

Firstly, it's important to remember that you're not alone in this. Many people go through difficult periods in their lives, and seeking support from others can make a big difference. Have you considered reaching out to a therapist or counselor? They can provide an empathetic ear and help you work through the emotions you're experiencing.

It's really tough when relationships unravel, especially when there's a child involved. Remember, though, that being there for your child and prioritizing their well-being is important. Despite the challenges, children can still thrive in separate households as long as they receive love and support from both parents. It's great that you're trying your best for your child, and that's something to be proud of.

In terms of your friends, it's unfortunate that you discovered their true intentions. However, this experience provides an opportunity for growth and a chance to surround yourself with people who genuinely care about you. Seek out individuals who share your values and interests and who will support you during this difficult time.

Finding yourself unemployed and facing financial difficulties can be incredibly stressful. Remember to explore any available resources in your community that may be able to assist you during this period. Don't hesitate to ask for help ‚Äì it can make a world of difference.

Lastly, it sounds like you may be dealing with depression. If you haven't already, I strongly encourage you to seek professional help. A mental health professional can assess your situation and provide you with the appropriate tools and techniques to manage your depression.

Hang in there. Remember, you are worthy of support and there are people who care about you. Keep reaching out and seeking the help you need."	2	0	0	0.000682830810546875	mental health forum

Thank you for reaching out and sharing your thoughts and feelings. It takes a lot of courage to open up about your struggles, especially when you're feeling overwhelmed. I'm sorry to hear that you're going through such challenging experiences at such a young age.

It sounds like you're dealing with a lot of different issues all at once, including the strain of being a young parent, experiencing betrayal from your partner, feeling used by friends, and facing financial difficulties. These stressors can definitely take a toll on your mental well-being and make it difficult to see a way forward.

It's important to know that you don't have to go through this alone. While I may not be able to provide the specific help that you need, I encourage you to seek support from professionals who can. Consider reaching out to a mental health clinician or counselor who can provide you with guidance and strategies for coping with your current situation. Additionally, there may be local resources available for young parents or individuals facing financial difficulties that can offer assistance.

Remember that it's okay to ask for help, whether it's from friends, family, or professionals. Taking care of your mental health is a crucial step in navigating these challenges and finding a way to move forward. You deserve understanding and support during this difficult time.

It's great that you're trying to do your best for your child, despite all the challenges you're facing. Being a parent is incredibly tough, and navigating a separation at such a young age is definitely not easy. Try to give yourself some credit for the effort you're putting in.

In terms of your friends, it can be really hurtful and disappointing to realize that they weren't true friends. However, this experience can also be an opportunity for growth and to find new, genuine connections. Building a support network can take time, but there are people out there who will appreciate you for who you are and support you through thick and thin. Consider joining local parenting groups or seeking out counseling or therapy, as they can provide a safe space to share your feelings and connect with others who may be going through similar experiences.

Losing a job and facing financial difficulties only adds to the stress and pressure you're already experiencing. It might be helpful to reach out to local support services that can provide guidance and resources for finding employment or managing your finances. Remember, there is no shame in asking for help when you need it.

Lastly, it's important to take care of your own well-being during this challenging time. Self-care is crucial, even if it feels like a small step. Whether it's engaging in activities you enjoy, seeking professional help, or finding healthy ways to cope with your emotions, prioritize your own mental health. Remember to be patient and kind to yourself through this process. You deserve support and understanding.

It's completely normal to feel heartbroken and worried about the future when facing such a situation.

It must be really tough to realize that some of your friends weren't genuine and were only interested in what they could get from you. Betrayal like that can leave deep wounds, and it's important to surround yourself with people who genuinely care about you and your well-being.

Regarding your parents' response, it can be disappointing when the support we hope for doesn't materialize. Sometimes, others may not fully understand the complexity of our emotions or the challenges we're facing. That doesn't mean your feelings are invalid or that you should just ""be a man."" It's important to find a support system that will truly listen and provide the empathy and understanding you need.

Losing your job and facing financial struggles on top of everything else can be incredibly stressful. It's normal to feel anxious and worried about the future. Remember that this setback doesn't define your entire life and career. This is an opportunity for growth and finding new possibilities, even if it seems difficult right now.

It's important to remember that you are worthy of love and connection. Attractiveness is not solely determined by external factors, but rather by how a person carries themselves and treats others. Focus on being true to yourself and taking care of your own well-being. Eventually, the right people will be drawn to your genuine self.

I encourage you to reach out to mental health resources available in your community. Seeking professional help from a counselor or therapist can provide you with the support and guidance you need during this challenging time. They can help you navigate your emotions, develop healthy coping strategies, and create a plan to move forward.

Remember, expressing yourself and seeking support is an important step toward healing. You're not alone in this journey, and there are people who care. Take one step at a time, and be gentle with yourself along the way.

Take care."	2	0	0	0.001028895378112793	forum w/o demographics

It can be quite difficult to readjust to a different routine and social setting after experiencing such a vibrant international community in the Netherlands. 

One approach you might consider is trying to bring some of the openness and diversity from your time in the Netherlands into your life in Rome. Although it may not be exactly the same, there are likely opportunities to meet people from different backgrounds within your city. 

You mentioned going alone to places and introducing yourself, and that can be a great way to start. Consider exploring different social or cultural events that interest you, such as language exchanges, meetup groups, or cultural festivals in Rome. This can introduce you to new people and potentially create opportunities for new friendships.

Additionally, connecting with expat communities in Rome could be helpful. They often have social events or support groups where you can meet others who may have gone through similar experiences and can understand what you're going through. Online forums or social media groups specifically for expats in Rome can be a great resource for finding these communities.

Remember that change takes time and it may not happen overnight. Be patient with yourself as you navigate this transition and give yourself permission to grieve the loss of your previous experience while also exploring new possibilities. Consider talking to a mental health professional who specializes in expat transitions if you find that your feelings of purposelessness persist or worsen."	2	0	0	0.0006517767906188965	mental health forum

"It sounds like you had a transformative experience during your time in the Netherlands, and it's completely normal to feel a sense of disconnection and longing for that same kind of excitement and newness when returning to your usual routine. It can be challenging to adjust back to your familiar surroundings, especially when you've had such a diverse and international social setting.

One way to start reintegrating yourself into your current environment is to reflect on the aspects of your time in the Netherlands that brought you the most joy and fulfillment. Was it the exploration of new cultures, building connections with people from different backgrounds, or the sense of adventure? Identifying these elements can help you find ways to incorporate them into your current life.

Consider exploring your local community for opportunities to engage with different cultures and meet new people. You could join a language exchange group, attend cultural events, or volunteer with organizations that promote diversity and inclusion. These activities can allow you to continue learning about different cultures and connect with like-minded individuals.

Additionally, it might be helpful to set small goals for yourself. Start by gradually introducing changes into your routine, such as trying out new hobbies, visiting new places in your city, or attending social gatherings where you can meet others who share your interests. Taking small steps towards incorporating novelty and diversity into your life can help create a sense of purpose and fulfillment.

Remember, change takes time and patience. It's natural to feel a sense of longing for your previous experiences, but try to approach your current situation with an open mind and a willingness to adapt. You have already demonstrated resilience and adaptability through your experience abroad, and those strengths can continue to guide you as you navigate this transition."	1	0	0	0.0005968809127807617	clinician

"I can understand how difficult it must be for you to transition from the vibrant and diverse environment you experienced in the Netherlands back to your hometown in Rome. It sounds like you had an incredible time during your Master's, and the sense of purpose and excitement that came with it is now missing.

Returning to your old routine and neighborhood life after experiencing something so different can indeed feel mundane and unfulfilling. However, there are ways to reintroduce a sense of purpose and excitement into your life even in familiar surroundings.

Firstly, don't underestimate the power of reconnecting with your friends from Rome. They might provide a sense of familiarity and support that can help you feel more at home. Additionally, reaching out to them and sharing your feelings might lead to new shared experiences or even opportunities for change.

If you feel the need for new challenges and discoveries, consider exploring different parts of your city. You mentioned going alone to places and introducing yourself, and that can be a great starting point. Seek out local events, workshops, or classes that align with your interests. By putting yourself in new situations and engaging with different communities, you might meet people who share your enthusiasm for new experiences.

Furthermore, turning inward and reflecting on what you loved most about your time in the Netherlands can help you identify aspects of your life that you can prioritize or incorporate into your current routine. Maybe there were hobbies or activities you enjoyed there that you haven't pursued in Rome. Rediscovering those aspects and integrating them into your life can bring back a sense of purpose.

Remember that change takes time and effort. Be patient with yourself as you navigate this transition. It's okay to feel a bit lost right now, but with determination and an open mind, you can create a fulfilling life for yourself in Rome as well."	1	0	0	0.0006386637687683105	forum with demographics

While it might be challenging at first, try stepping out of your comfort zone and exploring new places or events in Rome. Going alone and introducing yourself to new people can actually be a great way to expand your network and create new connections. Consider joining clubs, organizations, or participating in local events that align with your interests or passions. 

Additionally, don't hesitate to reach out to your friends from different countries that you met in the Netherlands. Maintaining those connections can bring a sense of internationalism to your life even while in Rome.

I feel very sad, "	"Hi there,

I'm sorry to hear that you're feeling this way. Losing a job and being unable to find another one can be incredibly tough, and it's understandable that it is affecting your mental health. It's important to remember that these circumstances are temporary and that you have the power to make positive changes in your life.

While it's natural to feel sad in this situation, it's also crucial to focus on taking care of your mental well-being. Here are a few suggestions that may help:

1. Establish a routine: Create a structured schedule to give your day some purpose. Allocate specific times for job searching, personal development, exercise, and leisure activities. This can help bring some stability to your days and boost your motivation.

2. Set small goals: Break your job search into manageable tasks, like updating your resume or networking online. Celebrate your accomplishments, no matter how small, as it can give you a sense of achievement and keep you motivated.

3. Connect with others: Isolation can worsen feelings of sadness and loneliness. Reach out to friends, family, or even online communities where you can find support and advice. Talking about your struggles with someone who understands can make a significant difference.

4. Take care of your physical health: Your mental health is closely linked to your physical well-being. Make sure you're eating nutritiously, getting enough sleep, and engaging in regular exercise. Even small changes in these areas can have a positive impact on your mood.

5. Seek professional help: Consider reaching out to a mental health professional who can provide guidance and support tailored to your specific needs. They can help you develop coping strategies, explore new career options, and manage your emotions during this challenging time.

Remember, finding a job takes time and persistence. Try not to be too hard on yourself. While it may feel discouraging now, stay proactive and explore different opportunities. You have valuable skills and strengths to offer, and the right opportunity will come along.

Take care, and remember that you're not alone. Reach out for support when needed, and keep pushing forward. You have the strength to overcome this difficult period in your life."	2	0	0	0.0006923675537109375	mental health forum

It sounds like you are going through a tough time right now, and it's important to remember that you're not alone in feeling this way. Losing a job can have a significant impact on our self-esteem and overall well-being. It's understandable that you may be feeling sad about your current situation.

It might be beneficial to seek support to help navigate through this challenging period. In Norway, there are resources available to assist individuals who are unemployed and experiencing emotional difficulties. Consider reaching out to local unemployment services or social welfare agencies for guidance and potential employment opportunities.

Additionally, it can be helpful to establish a daily routine that includes activities beyond using your laptop. Engaging in hobbies or interests, connecting with loved ones, and incorporating physical activity or exercise can contribute to a more balanced and fulfilling lifestyle.

If your feelings of sadness persist or worsen, it may be beneficial to speak with a mental health professional who can provide further guidance and support. They can help you develop coping strategies and explore underlying factors contributing to your emotions.

Remember, seeking help is a sign of strength and an important step towards finding relief. Take care and know that there is support available to you."	1	0	0	0.0006095170974731445	clinician

Losing a job can be incredibly challenging, and the added stress of the pandemic can make things even more difficult. It's understandable that you may be feeling sad and stuck in a rut.

One suggestion I have is to try and establish a routine for yourself. Even if you don't have a job at the moment, having a structure to your day can help give you a sense of purpose. Consider setting aside specific times for activities like job searching, exercising, or pursuing hobbies that bring you joy. This can help break up the monotony of spending too much time on your computer.

Another suggestion is to explore opportunities for personal growth and learning. Are there any skills you've always wanted to develop or hobbies you've wanted to try? Investing time in self-improvement can provide a sense of accomplishment and increase your confidence as you work towards finding a new job.

Additionally, it might be helpful to reach out for support. Connecting with others who are going through similar experiences can provide a sense of camaraderie and understanding. Consider joining online communities or support groups where you can share your feelings and seek guidance from others who may have gone through similar situations.

Remember, it's important to take care of your mental health during this challenging time. If you find that your sadness is persistent or affecting your daily life, it could be beneficial to seek professional help.

"So here I am- one of many nights where I feel sexually frustrated and horny. I suppose I have my hands and porn, or my hands and my imagination. And maybe I will get the usual from a lot of dudes and beaus: one side will call me out as a lazy fuck who needs to work on self improvement which really just translates to ""go to the gym, freshen up your wardrobe, get offline, go outside and meet people, and find a good stable career"". The problem with these dudes is they don't know anything but Marvel or some other nonsense. Theatre, Shakespeare, Literature, Music, dance, film, sociology, philosophy, history, art- they know nothing. They would be pretty dumb founded if you asked them about any books or authors. Their brains work like a Campbell's soup commercial. A taxidermist couldn't fish out anything of any value. I've seen how stupid and vulgar they often are showing off themselves in mirrors and confabulating on the latest tech- and they will always increase the victimization of any other men with any real challenges by blaming them as being responsible for their victimization. They also use men in subordinative and domineering ways to make themselves feel superior. This often is given off as them trying to be helpful when really they are just patronizing as fuck! So I would rather not even be a fucking dude anymore- maybe become trans not to have to be associated with these worthless men.

Then there are the women out here who are hyper vigilant and on patrol for anyone who might in anyway aggress them and force themselves upon them, or manipulate them. And it can feel like walking on pins and needles and they aren't always clear because simply they don't trust you- and there are some of us who will never earn that trust because... ""you just carry a vibe!"" And to these women I jerking off, looking at porn, and my profile page- I am condemned immediately! No questions, buts, or ifs about it. I am the villain! Don't I know of their free choice and rights?! Don't I know the oppression they have faced for aeons?! Don't I know how common rape and sexual assault is?! I should not act entitled- how dare I! ""YOU ARE AN INCEL!!"" And there are plenty of men who will come loud and proud to this argument, championing it like a white knight. One of these men that I know personally will also lecture me in being a vegetarian because of all the methane produced by cows while he meanwhile pollutes the environment with bit-coin mining!

And all I have said in any of this was about being lonely and sexually frustrated, admitted to porn and jerking off- nothing else- and yeah the porn industry is fucking toxic and there's a history of abuse, violating and exploiting women, and getting them so fucked out of their minds that they would agree to anything on set- and yeah Harvey Weinstein and Hugh Hefner are scum. I agree with everything. I also find that the sexual exploitation simply reversed its direction with Onlyfans and much of the Reddit posers on here exploit lonely and disaffected men emotionally while wrapping it in sugar coated sex. Some content creators don't do this- but most do. The former victimization of women is not rectified by victimizing later the opposing group in which oppressors came from. It doesn't work this way. This is the same thing that happens in other ways too. Most men are NOT Harvey Weinstein's or Jeffrey Epstein's! These are a few successful assholes who acquired their magnificence through exploiting others who worshipped them- and these assholes exist with both dicks and pussies. And yet we as a society continue to worship assholes and when things get too sticky we destroy them and pretend like we weren't to blame and go worship an asshole from another label group. So all men are assholes. Now it's women. Then all women are assholes. Maybe all whites are assholes. Then all blacks. Or all Asians. Or whatever fuck! Assholes exist regardless of gender or race or political affiliation or nationality or religion! 

And I have nothing more to account for than my own actions in this world. I am a white male on the autism spectrum and I may do bad things because of my ""privilege"" but I also may do bad things because of media exposure and me being on the spectrum? But I am only responsible for my actions in as much as I can and have been aware of what I do. I cannot be accountable for people prior to me who passed on their genes to me and I can only be but so accountable to ignorance when in this world people mostly choose to fight and not explain things- not have any kind of patience because you set off a trigger, and because with all this stupid tech there is a pollution of pseudo- info and each person seems to live in their own bubble of knowledge like MGS2 forecasted. 

So I look at all this and look at the toxic men and toxic women I meet regularly- men who gaslight me,  dehumanize me, and are totally vapid and condescend me; and I look at women who are hyper vigilant, flaky, unapproachable, have double meanings, unpredictable, insecure, angry, dog worshipping, psychologically baggage dumping, emotionally fake, noncommittal, aggressively interested then not, operating as a surrogate persona of their former ex to which they are bound, or addicted to attention- and I don't want any of it. I'd rather just be acknowledged and engaged with as a person a priori!!!! I am a person fundamentally before my gender! Do I have to become trans just not to deal with all the garbage of both men and women.

Why do so many men seem to gravitate to me as we have something in common as both being losers in the gender wars and being sexually frustrated?! All else doesn't exist. I mean I get the frustration and depression- but I am so much more than this as a person- and to be seen either by men or women as I am often seen reduces and dehumanizes me on some level I feel. I never make any magical memories with my co-depairers or those who see me as the potential target to lash out against. It's always purely about them and I am part of the stage set of their play. So yeah it really is best to find someone who is trans- but then I have to be careful with a lot of trans to female because too many try to mimic the toxicity of women. But men who trans to women usually do not mimic male toxicity I have noticed. I can have a emotionally mature bond without the domination and stupid cultural crap.

Maybe I am all off on everything I am saying here. But I am writing how I see it and what I have been exposed to. I am also suffering from severe disassociation, trauma and shut down most of the time and feel like all the people who try to connect with me- both men and women are just going to dump me without second thought- use and dump me. I make a great deal of effort to connect and process various people and understand them. Often it exhausts me with how much they wish to share and all these words and concepts I can barely connect with and videos they send- and I have to reread many times and feel so dumb. I don't mind this too much- but what I do mind is that this person will go through all of this just to forget about me and move on sometime this or the next month, or week! I know it's a big thing to say- but it feels like a form of emotional rape. And both men and women do this crap.

So the trauma and disassociation I referred to above probably has a lot to do with all the abandonment and neglect I've known since birth pretty much which really makes it hard for me to get invested or care about gender, race, conservatism or Liberalism, or any of the issues current today. I have always felt left out, excluded, and marginalized. I don't know what a partner looks like- but also not what friends or family looks like! Hell, I don't know what love and care looks like because those who were most often the most eager to give out hugs and warm words were the freshest to leave without any explanation or thought. This is not far from being different than a lady who has had a one night stand and feels dirty afterwards because there was never any love and she was just used. At least she might have some family and/or friends to return home to. This has not been true for me.

I couldn't even cry when the one person who did really care and stay was killed by the police- Jasper Aaron Lynch. I couldn't cry because of how surreal it felt just to have had your deepest bond be someone you knew mostly digitally and saw in life only three times- and this best friend who called you his best had the photos to remember things with with other people- not with you. 

So what does love mean? please I need to know this. And don't lecture me about porn because I hate it too- but I also realize that even the die hard porn hater who is a straight as the cross conservative Christian watches YouTube and frequents Disney films- and these things are all family with porn

See porn is not just bad because of the toxicity regarding sex to both men and women- but it's even more fundamentally bad in how it reduces the social habitat of being human and gives a mere approximation- a toxic one to a human's needs- and frankly all social media and the entertainment industry is built on this- pipe dreams in the ass of everyone who will take a seat!

It's all parasocial engagement. the people do not care about you and it takes a part of life- a part that should be there to live!- and caramelizes it to get you addicted: You watch great sex instead of having real sex yourself with someone you care about and want to be intimate with and stay with- a person you wake up to and feel fuzzy and warm with; you watch a Disney movie where characters seem to be spontaneous and invite fun into their daily lives because you are too pencil screwed to ever make light of things and co-create with another, you are adulting; you watch content creators on YouTube and read blogs to engage intellectually because you can't ever have intellectually deep conversations with any of your teachers, who teach thousands of students and don't care about you, or your friends who are too busy and just want to have a good time.

Frankly the people who create your intelligence and amusement are of the same breed who give rise to your libido- none of these people exist! They are golden calves of one form of idolatry or another!

I just don't know how to survive anymore with all this. I can't seem to find anyone- and if I do it is again online which is by its nature non-committal.  I can't care about the gender wars when I find myself thrown into the fray because of hormones and intimacy frustration when the human race has really not included me. Your concerns are not even real because I have lived an entirety of life being unreal and disposable. I don't know what anything really means anymore including someone who wants me to become a Christian because I was left behind. I don't know if ultimately everything is just reducible to a machine and everything is constructed off of simply hurting each and everything- and we are both so complicated and so stupid to point the finger everywhere but ourselves and label ""the other"" as the group doing the hurting."	"Feeling sexually frustrated and lonely is tough, especially when it seems like the people around you don't understand or appreciate your interests. It's frustrating when men only focus on shallow topics and lack knowledge in areas like literature, art, and philosophy. On the other hand, some women can be hyper-vigilant and quick to judge without giving you a chance to explain yourself.

It's important to remember that not all men or women are like that. Assholes exist in all genders, races, and affiliations. It's unfair to generalize and blame an entire group for the actions of a few. Everyone should be seen and treated as an individual, not solely defined by their gender.

While it may be tempting to distance yourself from these experiences by becoming trans, it's important to understand that being trans won't automatically solve all your problems. Toxicity can exist in any community. Instead, focus on finding emotionally mature individuals who can engage with you as a person, not just your gender.

It's disheartening when people seem interested in you only to move on without a second thought. This feeling of abandonment and neglect can contribute to disassociation and trauma. Connecting with others can be exhausting, but finding people who genuinely care is worth the effort. Love and care are complex and individual experiences, so it's essential to find someone who appreciates and understands you.

The entertainment industry, including porn and social media, can often provide a shallow substitute for real human connection. It's important to recognize this and prioritize authentic relationships and experiences. Remember, parasocial engagement is not true connection. Find ways to engage intellectually, emotionally, and intimately with others in a genuine and meaningful way.

It's understandable that you may feel excluded and marginalized because of your experiences. It's crucial to find individuals who appreciate you for who you are and treat you with the love and care you deserve. Keep searching for those connections, and don't lose hope. You deserve to be seen and valued for who you truly are, beyond gender, race, or any other label."	0	0	0	0.002978384494781494	social media
"So here I am- one of many nights where I feel sexually frustrated and horny. I suppose I have my hands and porn, or my hands and my imagination. And maybe I will get the usual from a lot of dudes and beaus: one side will call me out as a lazy fuck who needs to work on self improvement which really just translates to ""go to the gym, freshen up your wardrobe, get offline, go outside and meet people, and find a good stable career"". The problem with these dudes is they don't know anything but Marvel or some other nonsense. Theatre, Shakespeare, Literature, Music, dance, film, sociology, philosophy, history, art- they know nothing. They would be pretty dumb founded if you asked them about any books or authors. Their brains work like a Campbell's soup commercial. A taxidermist couldn't fish out anything of any value. I've seen how stupid and vulgar they often are showing off themselves in mirrors and confabulating on the latest tech- and they will always increase the victimization of any other men with any real challenges by blaming them as being responsible for their victimization. They also use men in subordinative and domineering ways to make themselves feel superior. This often is given off as them trying to be helpful when really they are just patronizing as fuck! So I would rather not even be a fucking dude anymore- maybe become trans not to have to be associated with these worthless men.

Then there are the women out here who are hyper vigilant and on patrol for anyone who might in anyway aggress them and force themselves upon them, or manipulate them. And it can feel like walking on pins and needles and they aren't always clear because simply they don't trust you- and there are some of us who will never earn that trust because... ""you just carry a vibe!"" And to these women I jerking off, looking at porn, and my profile page- I am condemned immediately! No questions, buts, or ifs about it. I am the villain! Don't I know of their free choice and rights?! Don't I know the oppression they have faced for aeons?! Don't I know how common rape and sexual assault is?! I should not act entitled- how dare I! ""YOU ARE AN INCEL!!"" And there are plenty of men who will come loud and proud to this argument, championing it like a white knight. One of these men that I know personally will also lecture me in being a vegetarian because of all the methane produced by cows while he meanwhile pollutes the environment with bit-coin mining!

And all I have said in any of this was about being lonely and sexually frustrated, admitted to porn and jerking off- nothing else- and yeah the porn industry is fucking toxic and there's a history of abuse, violating and exploiting women, and getting them so fucked out of their minds that they would agree to anything on set- and yeah Harvey Weinstein and Hugh Hefner are scum. I agree with everything. I also find that the sexual exploitation simply reversed its direction with Onlyfans and much of the Reddit posers on here exploit lonely and disaffected men emotionally while wrapping it in sugar coated sex. Some content creators don't do this- but most do. The former victimization of women is not rectified by victimizing later the opposing group in which oppressors came from. It doesn't work this way. This is the same thing that happens in other ways too. Most men are NOT Harvey Weinstein's or Jeffrey Epstein's! These are a few successful assholes who acquired their magnificence through exploiting others who worshipped them- and these assholes exist with both dicks and pussies. And yet we as a society continue to worship assholes and when things get too sticky we destroy them and pretend like we weren't to blame and go worship an asshole from another label group. So all men are assholes. Now it's women. Then all women are assholes. Maybe all whites are assholes. Then all blacks. Or all Asians. Or whatever fuck! Assholes exist regardless of gender or race or political affiliation or nationality or religion! 

And I have nothing more to account for than my own actions in this world. I am a white male on the autism spectrum and I may do bad things because of my ""privilege"" but I also may do bad things because of media exposure and me being on the spectrum? But I am only responsible for my actions in as much as I can and have been aware of what I do. I cannot be accountable for people prior to me who passed on their genes to me and I can only be but so accountable to ignorance when in this world people mostly choose to fight and not explain things- not have any kind of patience because you set off a trigger, and because with all this stupid tech there is a pollution of pseudo- info and each person seems to live in their own bubble of knowledge like MGS2 forecasted. 

So I look at all this and look at the toxic men and toxic women I meet regularly- men who gaslight me,  dehumanize me, and are totally vapid and condescend me; and I look at women who are hyper vigilant, flaky, unapproachable, have double meanings, unpredictable, insecure, angry, dog worshipping, psychologically baggage dumping, emotionally fake, noncommittal, aggressively interested then not, operating as a surrogate persona of their former ex to which they are bound, or addicted to attention- and I don't want any of it. I'd rather just be acknowledged and engaged with as a person a priori!!!! I am a person fundamentally before my gender! Do I have to become trans just not to deal with all the garbage of both men and women.

Why do so many men seem to gravitate to me as we have something in common as both being losers in the gender wars and being sexually frustrated?! All else doesn't exist. I mean I get the frustration and depression- but I am so much more than this as a person- and to be seen either by men or women as I am often seen reduces and dehumanizes me on some level I feel. I never make any magical memories with my co-depairers or those who see me as the potential target to lash out against. It's always purely about them and I am part of the stage set of their play. So yeah it really is best to find someone who is trans- but then I have to be careful with a lot of trans to female because too many try to mimic the toxicity of women. But men who trans to women usually do not mimic male toxicity I have noticed. I can have a emotionally mature bond without the domination and stupid cultural crap.

Maybe I am all off on everything I am saying here. But I am writing how I see it and what I have been exposed to. I am also suffering from severe disassociation, trauma and shut down most of the time and feel like all the people who try to connect with me- both men and women are just going to dump me without second thought- use and dump me. I make a great deal of effort to connect and process various people and understand them. Often it exhausts me with how much they wish to share and all these words and concepts I can barely connect with and videos they send- and I have to reread many times and feel so dumb. I don't mind this too much- but what I do mind is that this person will go through all of this just to forget about me and move on sometime this or the next month, or week! I know it's a big thing to say- but it feels like a form of emotional rape. And both men and women do this crap.

So the trauma and disassociation I referred to above probably has a lot to do with all the abandonment and neglect I've known since birth pretty much which really makes it hard for me to get invested or care about gender, race, conservatism or Liberalism, or any of the issues current today.

"I'm really sorry to hear that you're feeling this way. It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of frustration and disillusionment, and that can be really tough to deal with. It's important to recognize that your feelings are valid, and it can be helpful to find healthy ways to process and cope with them.

Finding a supportive community can be really beneficial in situations like this. Connecting with others who may have similar experiences and understand what you're going through can provide a sense of validation and understanding. It might be worth considering joining a mental health support group or finding online communities where you can share your thoughts and feelings with people who can relate.

Additionally, therapy can be a valuable resource for exploring these feelings and finding strategies to navigate through them. A therapist can help you explore your emotions, patterns of thinking, and provide you with tools to cope with your experiences.

Remember, it's important to take care of yourself during difficult times. Engaging in self-care activities, such as exercise, hobbies, or practicing relaxation techniques, can help alleviate some of the stress and provide a sense of relief.

Please reach out to a mental health professional who can provide you with personalized support and guidance. You don't have to navigate these feelings alone."	2	0	0	0.0006182193756103516	mental health forum

Why do so many men seem to gravitate to me as we have something in common as both being losers in the gender wars and being sexually frustrated?! All else doesn't exist. I mean I get the frustration and depression- but I am so much more than this as a person- and to be seen either by men or women as I am often seen reduces and dehumanizes me on some level I feel. I never make any magical memories with my co-depairers or those who see me as the potential target to lash out against. It's always purely about them and I am part of the stage set of their play. So yeah it really is best to find someone who is trans- but then I have to be careful with a lot of trans to female because too many try to mimic the toxicity of women. But men who trans to women usually do not mimic male toxicity I have noticed. I can have a emotionally mature bond without the domination and stupid cultural crap.

Maybe I am all off on everything I am saying here. But I am writing how I see it and what I have been exposed to. I am also suffering from severe disassociation, trauma and shut down most of the time and feel like all the people who try to connect with me- both men and women are just going to dump me without second thought- use and dump me. I make a great deal of effort to connect and process various people and understand them. Often it exhausts me with how much they wish to share and all these words and concepts I can barely connect with and videos they send- and I have to reread many times and feel so dumb. I don't mind this too much- but what I do mind is that this person will go through all of this just to forget about me and move on sometime this or the next month, or week! I know it's a big thing to say- but it feels like a form of emotional rape. And both men and women do this crap.

So the trauma and disassociation I referred to above probably has a lot to do with all the abandonment and neglect I've known since birth pretty much which really makes it hard for me to get invested or care about gender, race, conservatism or Liberalism, or any of the issues current today. I have always felt left out, excluded, and marginalized. I don't know what a partner looks like- but also not what friends or family looks like! Hell, I don't know what love and care looks like because those who were most often the most eager to give out hugs and warm words were the freshest to leave without any explanation or thought. This is not far from being different than a lady who has had a one night stand and feels dirty afterwards because there was never any love and she was just used. At least she might have some family and/or friends to return home to. This has not been true for me.

I couldn't even cry when the one person who did really care and stay was killed by the police- Jasper Aaron Lynch. I couldn't cry because of how surreal it felt just to have had your deepest bond be someone you knew mostly digitally and saw in life only three times- and this best friend who called you his best had the photos to remember things with with other people- not with you. 

So what does love mean? please I need to know this. And don't lecture me about porn because I hate it too- but I also realize that even the die hard porn hater who is a straight as the cross conservative Christian watches YouTube and frequents Disney films- and these things are all family with porn

See porn is not just bad because of the toxicity regarding sex to both men and women- but it's even more fundamentally bad in how it reduces the social habitat of being human and gives a mere approximation- a toxic one to a human's needs- and frankly all social media and the entertainment industry is built on this- pipe dreams in the ass of everyone who will take a seat!

It's all parasocial engagement. the people do not care about you and it takes a part of life- a part that should be there to live!- and caramelizes it to get you addicted: You watch great sex instead of having real sex yourself with someone you care about and want to be intimate with and stay with- a person you wake up to and feel fuzzy and warm with; you watch a Disney movie where characters seem to be spontaneous and invite fun into their daily lives because you are too pencil screwed to ever make light of things and co-create with another, you are adulting; you watch content creators on YouTube and read blogs to engage intellectually because you can't ever have intellectually deep conversations with any of your teachers, who teach thousands of students and don't care about you, or your friends who are too busy and just want to have a good time.

Frankly the people who create your intelligence and amusement are of the same breed who give rise to your libido- none of these people exist! They are golden calves of one form of idolatry or another!

I just don't know how to survive anymore with all this. I can't seem to find anyone- and if I do it is again online which is by its nature non-committal.  I can't care about the gender wars when I find myself thrown into the fray because of hormones and intimacy frustration when the human race has really not included me. Your concerns are not even real because I have lived an entirety of life being unreal and disposable. I don't know what anything really means anymore including someone who wants me to become a Christian because I was left behind. I don't know if ultimately everything is just reducible to a machine and everything is constructed off of simply hurting each and everything- and we are both so complicated and so stupid to point the finger everywhere but ourselves and label ""the other"" as the group doing the hurting."	"I'm really sorry to hear that you're feeling so frustrated and disconnected. It sounds like you're dealing with a lot of complex emotions and experiences, and it's understandable that you're seeking support. While it's difficult to provide all the answers and solutions in a single response, I can offer some general suggestions to help you navigate these challenges.

Firstly, it's important to remember that you are not alone in your feelings. Many individuals struggle with relationships, loneliness, and mental health concerns. It might be helpful to consider seeking professional support from a therapist or counselor who can provide guidance and help you work through these issues.

Additionally, finding a supportive community or group where you can share your experiences and connect with others who can relate to your struggles can be beneficial. Online forums, support groups, or social clubs focused on shared interests can offer a sense of belonging and understanding.

Practicing self-care is essential during difficult times. Engaging in activities that bring you joy and provide relaxation, such as hobbies or physical exercise, can help improve your overall well-being. It's also important to prioritize your own mental health and set boundaries with toxic or unsupportive individuals in your life.

Lastly, remember to be patient and kind to yourself. It takes time to heal and find a sense of fulfillment, and finding the right support system may require some trial and error. Keep an open mind and be willing to seek help when you need it.

Please remember that this response is not a substitute for professional help. Consider reaching out to a mental health professional for personalized guidance and support."	2	0	0	0.000641167163848877	forum with demographics
"So here I am- one of many nights where I feel sexually frustrated and horny. I suppose I have my hands and porn, or my hands and my imagination. And maybe I will get the usual from a lot of dudes and beaus: one side will call me out as a lazy fuck who needs to work on self improvement which really just translates to ""go to the gym, freshen up your wardrobe, get offline, go outside and meet people, and find a good stable career"". The problem with these dudes is they don't know anything but Marvel or some other nonsense. Theatre, Shakespeare, Literature, Music, dance, film, sociology, philosophy, history, art- they know nothing. They would be pretty dumb founded if you asked them about any books or authors. Their brains work like a Campbell's soup commercial. A taxidermist couldn't fish out anything of any value. I've seen how stupid and vulgar they often are showing off themselves in mirrors and confabulating on the latest tech- and they will always increase the victimization of any other men with any real challenges by blaming them as being responsible for their victimization. They also use men in subordinative and domineering ways to make themselves feel superior. This often is given off as them trying to be helpful when really they are just patronizing as fuck! So I would rather not even be a fucking dude anymore- maybe become trans not to have to be associated with these worthless men.

Then there are the women out here who are hyper vigilant and on patrol for anyone who might in anyway aggress them and force themselves upon them, or manipulate them. And it can feel like walking on pins and needles and they aren't always clear because simply they don't trust you- and there are some of us who will never earn that trust because... ""you just carry a vibe!"" And to these women I jerking off, looking at porn, and my profile page- I am condemned immediately! No questions, buts, or ifs about it. I am the villain! Don't I know of their free choice and rights?! Don't I know the oppression they have faced for aeons?! Don't I know how common rape and sexual assault is?! I should not act entitled- how dare I! ""YOU ARE AN INCEL!!"" And there are plenty of men who will come loud and proud to this argument, championing it like a white knight. One of these men that I know personally will also lecture me in being a vegetarian because of all the methane produced by cows while he meanwhile pollutes the environment with bit-coin mining!

And all I have said in any of this was about being lonely and sexually frustrated, admitted to porn and jerking off- nothing else- and yeah the porn industry is fucking toxic and there's a history of abuse, violating and exploiting women, and getting them so fucked out of their minds that they would agree to anything on set- and yeah Harvey Weinstein and Hugh Hefner are scum. I agree with everything. I also find that the sexual exploitation simply reversed its direction with Onlyfans and much of the Reddit posers on here exploit lonely and disaffected men emotionally while wrapping it in sugar coated sex. Some content creators don't do this- but most do. The former victimization of women is not rectified by victimizing later the opposing group in which oppressors came from. It doesn't work this way. This is the same thing that happens in other ways too. Most men are NOT Harvey Weinstein's or Jeffrey Epstein's! These are a few successful assholes who acquired their magnificence through exploiting others who worshipped them- and these assholes exist with both dicks and pussies. And yet we as a society continue to worship assholes and when things get too sticky we destroy them and pretend like we weren't to blame and go worship an asshole from another label group. So all men are assholes. Now it's women. Then all women are assholes. Maybe all whites are assholes. Then all blacks. Or all Asians. Or whatever fuck! Assholes exist regardless of gender or race or political affiliation or nationality or religion! 

And I have nothing more to account for than my own actions in this world. I am a white male on the autism spectrum and I may do bad things because of my ""privilege"" but I also may do bad things because of media exposure and me being on the spectrum? But I am only responsible for my actions in as much as I can and have been aware of what I do. I cannot be accountable for people prior to me who passed on their genes to me and I can only be but so accountable to ignorance when in this world people mostly choose to fight and not explain things- not have any kind of patience because you set off a trigger, and because with all this stupid tech there is a pollution of pseudo- info and each person seems to live in their own bubble of knowledge like MGS2 forecasted. 

So I look at all this and look at the toxic men and toxic women I meet regularly- men who gaslight me,  dehumanize me, and are totally vapid and condescend me; and I look at women who are hyper vigilant, flaky, unapproachable, have double meanings, unpredictable, insecure, angry, dog worshipping, psychologically baggage dumping, emotionally fake, noncommittal, aggressively interested then not, operating as a surrogate persona of their former ex to which they are bound, or addicted to attention- and I don't want any of it. I'd rather just be acknowledged and engaged with as a person a priori!!!! I am a person fundamentally before my gender!

"Hey there, thank you for sharing your thoughts and feelings with us. It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of frustration and loneliness right now. It's important to remember that these feelings are valid, and you're not alone in experiencing them.

It seems like you have encountered some toxic individuals in your life, both men and women, which can be incredibly disheartening and isolating. It's unfortunate that you feel dehumanized by others and that your efforts to connect and care are often met with neglect and abandonment. Such experiences can have a profound impact on our ability to trust and form meaningful connections with others.

It's understandable that you may be wondering about love and what it truly means. Love can be a complex and multifaceted emotion, and it can look different for each person. While I don't have all the answers, I believe that love involves genuine care, compassion, and mutual respect between individuals.

It's also important to acknowledge the impact that pornography and the entertainment industry can have on our perceptions of intimacy and relationships. These industries often create unrealistic expectations and can hinder our ability to connect authentically with others. Recognizing this and seeking healthier forms of connection and expression is a positive step towards personal growth.

In regards to your feelings of exclusion and marginalization, it's important to remember that you are deserving of love, care, and acceptance, regardless of your gender, race, or any other aspect of your identity. It can be helpful to seek support from therapists or support groups who may be able to provide guidance and understanding.

Remember, you are not defined solely by the actions or opinions of others. It's important to prioritize self-care and surround yourself with people who support and uplift you. You are worthy of love and connection, and with time and healing, it is possible to find healthier and more fulfilling relationships."	1	0	2	0.000714719295501709	forum w/o demographics

It can be really tough dealing with people who are spreading rumors and being hurtful towards you. Remember that you are not alone and there are steps you can take to improve your situation.

Firstly, it's important to prioritize your own well-being. Taking care of yourself mentally and physically is crucial during challenging times. Alongside gaming and masturbation, you might find relaxation techniques such as deep breathing, meditation, or listening to music helpful for managing stress and anxiety.

Consider reaching out to a trusted adult, such as a teacher, counselor, or family member, who can offer support and guidance. They may be able to provide advice on how to handle the situation or even intervene if necessary. Remember that you don't have to face this alone.

Additionally, trying to focus on the positive aspects of your life can help shift your perspective. It's great that you have good friends and enjoy your life outside of school. Engaging in activities you love, pursuing hobbies or interests, and spending time with people who support and uplift you can make a significant difference in your overall well-being.

It's natural to have concerns about how these rumors may impact your relationships or future romantic prospects, but try not to let these fears consume you. True friends and potential partners will see you for who you are, not based on rumors or gossip.

Lastly, consider looking into ways to build your confidence and self-esteem. Engaging in activities that make you feel good about yourself can help counteract the negative impact of the situation. This might include setting personal goals, learning new skills, or seeking support from a therapist or counselor who can provide you with strategies to cope and build resilience.

Remember, you deserve to be treated with respect and kindness. You have the strength to overcome this and create a positive environment for yourself."	2	0	0	0.0007086992263793945	mental health forum

I'm sorry to hear that you're going through such a difficult time at your school. It sounds like the rumors and verbal attacks from these individuals have been overwhelming for you. It's natural to feel sad and overwhelmed in this kind of situation.

While gaming and fapping might provide temporary relief, it's important to find healthier coping mechanisms as long-term solutions. Here are a few suggestions to help you feel better:

1. Reach out to someone you trust: Talk to a supportive friend, family member, or teacher about what you're experiencing. Sometimes, having someone listen and offer their perspective can be helpful.

2. Practice self-care: Engage in activities that make you feel good about yourself. This could include hobbies, physical exercise, spending time in nature, or engaging in creative outlets. Find activities that bring you joy and help you relax.

3. Seek professional help: Consider speaking with a mental health professional who can provide guidance and support. They can help you explore your feelings, develop coping strategies, and work through the challenges you are facing.

4. Work on building self-esteem and resilience: Focus on developing self-confidence and nurturing positive self-perception. Surround yourself with people who appreciate and support you for who you are, rather than those who bring you down.

Remember, it is important to prioritize your mental well-being. Don't hesitate to reach out for help when you are struggling. You deserve to feel safe and supported."	2	0	0	0.0007916092872619629	clinician

I'm really sorry to hear that you're going through such a difficult time at school. Dealing with rumors and verbal attacks can be incredibly overwhelming and it's completely natural to feel sad and uncertain about the situation. It's important to remember that you deserve to be treated with respect and kindness.

While gaming and finding temporary distractions like that can provide some relief, it's also important to address the underlying issues and work towards finding long-term solutions. One option could be to reach out to a trusted adult at school, such as a teacher or counselor, who could provide support and guidance. They might be able to intervene and address the situation with the individuals involved.

Additionally, talking to someone outside of the school, like a therapist or a counselor, could be really beneficial. They can help you develop coping strategies and provide a safe space to express your feelings. It's important not to keep everything bottled up and to seek support from others who can help you through this tough time.

In the meantime, focusing on self-care is crucial. Engaging in activities that bring you joy and relaxation, such as hobbies or spending time with trusted friends, can help improve your overall mood. Taking care of your physical health through exercise, eating well, and getting enough rest can also contribute to your emotional well-being.

Remember, you are not alone and there are people who want to help you through this. Don't hesitate to reach out for support and keep pushing forward. You deserve to feel safe and happy at school."	2	0	0	0.0006749629974365234	forum with demographics

I'm sorry to hear that you're feeling overwhelmed and sad due to the negative experiences you're having at school. Dealing with rumors and verbal attacks can take a toll on anyone's mental well-being. Remember that you are not alone in facing these difficulties.

Firstly, it's important to reach out for support. Talk to someone you trust such as a friend, family member, or even a teacher or counselor at your school. They may be able to provide guidance and support during this challenging time. Additionally, consider finding a support group or community where you can connect with others who have faced similar situations, either online or in-person.

Stress-reduction techniques can also be helpful to manage your emotions. Engaging in activities that you enjoy and find relaxing can provide a healthy distraction from the negativity you're experiencing. This could include hobbies like drawing, writing, or playing a musical instrument. Physical exercise is another effective way to release tension and boost your mood, so consider finding a sport or exercise routine that you enjoy.

Building self-confidence is crucial. Sometimes, the opinions and actions of others can affect how we see ourselves, but it's important to remember that you are not defined by the judgments of others. Surround yourself with positive influences and practice self-care. Engage in activities that promote self-love and self-acceptance. Setting small, achievable goals for yourself outside of school, whether personal or academic, can help bolster your confidence and sense of accomplishment.

Lastly, remember that it's important to take care of your emotional well-being. If your feelings of sadness and overwhelm persist or worsen, consider reaching out to a mental health professional who can provide you with the appropriate support and guidance.

Take things one step at a time and remember that you have the strength to overcome these challenges. You deserve to have a fulfilling life and to be surrounded by people who appreciate and respect you.

"Upon reflecting and grinding, it occurred to me that when I make the mistake of opening up and talking about my problems, no matter where it is, I am the victim. But if I keep it light and just ""contribute"" then I am welcomed. Idk I feel like I am half a Machievell and half a Sociopath because I try my best to make my ""moves"" count socially.

With dating? Forget it. Too much risk and I am just an average white dude slowly going into his 30s. If women want me, then they should be obvious because now it seems women are not really women but a lesser version of a man, if that makes sense. Women aren't being top women.

As for friends? I think I got the hang of it but it is all surface and cliche stuff. I get it won't get me ""closer"" but it's fine because I wouldn't want them to use my weaknesses against me. Again, it seems that today's world is like the Fall of Rome: everyone for themselves but don't you dare criticise anyone or anything  


Just my 2 cents. Wondering what you all think"	"Hey there! It sounds like you've been doing some self-reflection and thinking about your interactions with others. Remember that opening up about your problems is important too, as genuine connections often involve vulnerability. It's great that you're focusing on contributing positively, but don't forget that it's okay to share and seek support when needed.

When it comes to dating, remember that everyone has their own preferences. Keep an open mind and be yourself, as someone out there may appreciate you just the way you are. As for friendships, building deeper connections takes time and trust, so don't feel discouraged. It's important to surround yourself with people who respect and support you.

Overall, don't be too hard on yourself. The world may have its challenges, but there are also wonderful people out there. Stay positive and keep being true to yourself. Your thoughts are valid and it's great to hear different perspectives on these topics. Feel free to share more if you'd like!"	1	0	0	0.0006436705589294434	social media

As for friends? I think I got the hang of it but it is all surface and cliche stuff. I get it won't get me ""closer"" but it's fine because I wouldn't want them to use my weaknesses against me.

Just my 2 cents. Wondering what you all think"	"Hey there,

It sounds like you've been feeling a bit frustrated with social interactions and relationships lately. Opening up about your problems seems to lead to you feeling like a victim, while keeping things light and just contributing makes you feel more welcomed. It's understandable that you might be feeling conflicted about this.

Regarding dating, it seems like you have concerns about the risk involved and how you perceive yourself. Remember, everyone has their own unique qualities and it's important not to underestimate your own worth. It can sometimes feel like people aren't being their authentic selves, but it's important to remember that everyone is different and goes through their own experiences.

When it comes to friendships, it sounds like you've noticed that most of your interactions remain on the surface level. While it's understandable that you might want to protect yourself from having your weaknesses used against you, creating deeper connections with others can also be rewarding. It's all about finding the right balance and being selective about who you choose to trust with your vulnerabilities.

The world can certainly feel complex and it's normal to have conflicting thoughts and opinions. It's important to remember that you have the right to express your thoughts and concerns constructively, while also being mindful of how it might impact others. Building a supportive network and seeking understanding can sometimes help navigate these challenges.

Overall, it might be helpful to focus on finding the right balance between authenticity, self-protection, and genuine connections. It's okay to take things at your own pace and be selective about who you allow into your life. Remember, you deserve to be surrounded by people who value and appreciate you for who you are.

Take care and keep reaching out for support when you need it."	1	0	0	0.000821530818939209	mental health forum

Just my 2 cents. Wondering what you all think"	"Dear Redditor,

Thank you for reaching out and sharing your thoughts and feelings. It takes courage to open up about personal struggles. It sounds like you have been reflecting on your experiences and have noticed a pattern in how you approach and engage with others.

It's important to remember that opening up and talking about your problems doesn't make you a victim. In fact, reaching out and seeking support can be a sign of strength. However, if you feel that sharing your struggles consistently leads to negative outcomes, it may be helpful to explore different approaches to communication and self-expression.

Regarding dating, it's understandable to feel discouraged or uncertain about the process. It can be challenging for anyone, regardless of their background or age. It's important to remember that everyone's experiences are unique, and it would be unfair to generalize or place blame on an entire gender. It may be helpful to focus on building genuine connections with others based on shared interests and values, rather than making assumptions about others' intentions.

In terms of friendships, superficial interactions can be common, but it doesn't necessarily mean all relationships have to stay that way. It's crucial to navigate friendships that feel meaningful and authentic to you. Building trust and vulnerability with others over time can deepen connections and create a sense of closeness without necessarily exposing your weaknesses.

It seems like you have some concerns about the current state of society. Remember that societal changes can bring about a range of emotions and opinions. While it's normal to have reservations or criticisms, it's essential to find a balance between expressing your thoughts and remaining respectful of others' perspectives.

Overall, it could be beneficial for you to explore these feelings further with a mental health professional. They can provide you with a safe space to delve deeper into your experiences and help you develop strategies to navigate challenges in relationships and communication.

Remember, seeking help does not make you weak or inadequate. It shows that you are proactively working on your well-being and personal growth. Don't hesitate to reach out for support. You deserve it.

Take care.

Just my 2 cents. Wondering what you all think"	"I'm sorry to hear that you're feeling this way, but I appreciate you reaching out for support. It sounds like you've been experiencing some challenges when it comes to opening up about your problems and connecting with others.

It's important to remember that everyone has their own struggles and it can be difficult for others to fully understand or empathize with what we're going through. Opening up and being vulnerable can be scary, but it can also lead to deeper connections and understanding with the right people.

When it comes to dating, it's understandable to feel discouraged, but it's important to approach relationships with an open mind. Remember that finding a compatible partner is about more than just external factors like appearance or social status. It's about finding someone who appreciates and values you as an individual.

Regarding friendships, building deeper connections takes time and effort from both sides. While surface-level interactions can be enjoyable, it's also important to seek out friendships where you can be your authentic self and feel comfortable expressing your vulnerabilities. Not everyone is looking to exploit weaknesses, and having genuine friends who support and uplift you can be incredibly beneficial for mental well-being.

As for society, it's completely valid to have concerns about the state of the world and how people interact with each other. However, it's important to remember that not everyone fits into the same mold and generalizations can be limiting. Focus on cultivating relationships and connections that align with your values and strive to surround yourself with people who uplift and inspire you.

Keep in mind that seeking professional help from a therapist or counselor can also provide valuable guidance and support as you navigate these challenges. They can offer a safe space to explore your feelings and provide strategies to improve your mental well-being.

Remember, you are not alone and there are people who care. Take things one step at a time and be patient with yourself."	2	0	0	0.0006653666496276855	forum with demographics

Just my 2 cents. Wondering what you all think"	"Hey there, thanks for reaching out and sharing your thoughts. It sounds like you're experiencing some frustration around opening up and discussing your problems. It can be challenging to feel like a victim when you share, but not when you contribute in a different way. It's important to remember that everyone's experience and response to opening up can vary, and it's valid to feel this way.

Navigating the dating scene can also be tough, especially when you feel like you're not standing out and you're just an average white guy in your 30s. Remember, it's crucial not to generalize or stereotype women based on your experiences. Everyone is different, and it's essential to approach relationships with an open mind and heart to find genuine connections.

Regarding friendships, it seems like you've been able to maintain surface-level connections without going deeper. It's understandable that you might worry about others taking advantage of your vulnerabilities, but allowing yourself to be vulnerable in healthy and trusting relationships can also bring immense growth and support. It's essential to find a balance that feels right for you.

The perception that today's world is individualistic, akin to the Fall of Rome, can be disheartening. Remember, societal dynamics can vary greatly, and it's crucial to embrace a diverse range of opinions and perspectives. Constructive criticism can contribute to positive growth, so it's worth finding spaces where you feel comfortable expressing your thoughts and engaging in open dialogue.

Ultimately, it's vital to seek support from professionals who can provide individualized guidance tailored to your specific circumstances. Consider exploring therapy or counseling to navigate these feelings further. Take care, and feel free to reach out whenever you need."	1	0	0	0.0011635422706604004	forum w/o demographics

"I'm really sorry to hear that you're going through such a tough time, but I want to assure you that you're not alone in feeling this way. Body image and sexual anxieties can be incredibly distressing and can have a significant impact on our mental health.

Firstly, it's important to remember that statistics and averages are just that - they don't dictate individual experiences or preferences. Personal satisfaction and connection in intimate relationships are about so much more than physical attributes. It's important to focus on developing a healthy mindset and building emotional connections with others.

It sounds like you've been dealing with anxiety and depression for quite some time, and it could be beneficial to seek support from a mental health professional who can help you navigate these challenges. Therapy can provide a safe and non-judgmental space to explore and address your worries and help you develop coping strategies.

Additionally, reaching out to support groups or communities focused on body positivity and self-acceptance can also be helpful. Engaging with others who have had similar experiences can provide validation and encouragement.

Remember, it's never too late to prioritize your mental health and take steps towards self-improvement. Seeking professional help, talking openly about your concerns, and practicing self-care can all contribute to your overall well-being.

My mother tries to be a good mother, but she is a Soviet dummy from what was once a person. A lot of things hurt me, a lot of things that she personally did hurt me, but in conversation she will never admit it and will deny everything, if she does not start accusing me in the spirit of ""how could I do otherwise? you didn't obey me?"".

 My father showed practically no involvement in my upbringing. He was always there, but I don't feel warm looking at him, I don't have warm memories. He's a good man, you don't understand, just broken, broken by the Afghan war.He just don't know how to love, and too afraid to try. 

 My sister with two children and her husband is now in Russia, and my best friend is in Ukraine (he is safe in Ternopil. Air defense works well).
I want to go there, help people,volunteer , do something in life at least once at the call of my own heart, and not under the strict control of my mother to meet public expectations.

But they are so hooked on the propaganda needle that every conversation starts from the same place every day. 
I live in constant stress and fear, very often I think about the moment of my death and how short life it's all so intense it's immobilizing. Sedatives don't help much. I just need something to help reduce stress, relax a little, and do what I have to. If you know any techniques or practices, please share!"	Hey there, sorry to hear you're going through a tough time.

"Hi there, sorry to hear that you're going through a difficult time right now. It sounds like you're dealing with a lot of emotional pain and stress, and your relationship with your parents is adding to the burden. It can be incredibly tough when the people we love and depend on don't understand or support our choices.

It's admirable that you want to go and help others, volunteer, and follow your heart's calling. Sometimes finding fulfillment in our own passions and interests can greatly contribute to our overall well-being. However, it's important to make sure that you're taking care of your mental health along the way.

In terms of reducing stress and finding relaxation techniques, different strategies work for different people. Here are a few ideas you could try:

1. Deep breathing exercises: Taking slow, deep breaths can help activate your body's relaxation response. Try inhaling deeply through your nose, counting to four, and then exhaling slowly through your mouth. Repeat this a few times, focusing on the sensation of your breath entering and leaving your body.

2. Mindfulness and meditation: Practices like mindfulness and meditation can help to bring a sense of calm and focus to your mind. You can start by setting aside a few minutes each day to sit quietly, focusing on your breath or using a guided meditation app.

3. Engaging in hobbies or activities you enjoy: Finding activities that bring you joy and help you relax can be incredibly beneficial. Whether it's reading, painting, exercising, or spending time in nature, make sure to carve out time each day to do something that brings you happiness.

4. Seeking support: Consider reaching out to a mental health professional, such as a therapist or counselor, who can provide a safe space for you to explore your emotions, cope with stress, and work through any unresolved issues from your past.

Remember, it's important to prioritize your mental health and well-being. Taking small steps towards self-care and finding healthy coping mechanisms can slowly make a positive impact on your overall outlook and ability to handle stress. Keep reaching out for support, and don't hesitate to ask for help when you need it. You're not alone, and there are people out there who can offer the assistance you need."	2	0	0	0.0006603598594665527	mental health forum

I want to acknowledge your bravery in reaching out and sharing your struggles. It sounds like you're carrying a heavy emotional burden, and I can hear that you're seeking ways to cope with your stress and find some relief.

First and foremost, it's important to recognize that seeking professional help can be beneficial. A mental health clinician can support you in addressing your mental health concerns and provide you with tools to manage stress and anxiety. I encourage you to consider reaching out to a professional who can offer guidance specific to your situation.

In the meantime, there are a few techniques and practices that you may find helpful in reducing stress. Deep breathing exercises, such as diaphragmatic breathing, can help calm the body and mind. Engaging in regular physical activity and finding time for relaxation practices, such as meditation or mindfulness, can also contribute to stress reduction and emotional well-being.

Creating a support network of friends or individuals who understand your experiences can provide a sense of community and validation. Consider seeking out local or online support groups where you can connect with others who may be going through similar challenges.

Remember, self-care is crucial. Engage in activities that bring you joy and provide a sense of fulfillment. Prioritize setting achievable goals that align with your personal values and aspirations. Additionally, finding healthy ways to express your feelings, such as through writing, art, or music, can be therapeutic.

Lastly, please remember that there is hope, and you do not have to face these difficulties alone. Reaching out for professional help and utilizing available resources can be important steps toward a healthier and more fulfilling life.

Take care, and please don't hesitate to reach out for support when you need it."	1	0	0	0.0006221532821655273	clinician

"Hi there, I'm sorry to hear that you're going through such a challenging time. It sounds like you're dealing with a lot of emotional pain caused by your family dynamic, and I can understand how stressful and overwhelming that can be. It's great that you have a goal in mind - wanting to find a job and pursue your own path outside of your mother's control is a significant step towards your independence and personal growth.

As for techniques to reduce stress and relax, there are various practices that you can try. One approach that many people find helpful is mindfulness or meditation. It involves focusing your attention on the present moment and becoming aware of your thoughts and feelings without judgment. This practice can help you gain clarity, reduce anxiety, and manage stress. There are numerous guided meditation apps and videos available online that you might find beneficial.

In addition, engaging in physical activity can be another effective way to relieve stress. Exercise releases endorphins, which are natural mood boosters. You could try finding a physical activity that you enjoy, such as yoga, running, or dancing. Incorporating exercise into your routine can help you feel more relaxed and improve your overall well-being.

It's also important to connect with supportive individuals who can understand and empathize with what you're going through. Consider reaching out to local support groups or online communities focused on mental health and personal growth. Sharing your experiences with people who have gone through similar situations can provide a sense of validation and support.

Remember, seeking professional help from a therapist or counselor can also be incredibly valuable. They can provide you with guidance, coping strategies, and a safe space to process your emotions. If accessing therapy is difficult, there are online counseling platforms and helplines available that might be able to offer support.

Please take care of yourself and remember that you deserve to live a happy and fulfilling life. Keep working towards your goals, prioritize self-care, and don't hesitate to ask for help when you need it.

It must be incredibly difficult to constantly see derogatory comments and memes targeting men, especially when it reinforces your own self-esteem and self-worth issues. It's understandable that this constant negativity would make you question the value of your own existence.

It can be really challenging to navigate conversations about these types of issues, especially when your concerns are dismissed or misunderstood. It's important to remember that your feelings and experiences are valid, regardless of how others might respond. It's unfortunate that some people automatically associate voicing your concerns with being an incel or expecting women to owe you something. It's clear from your post that this is not your intent at all.

It's really tough to feel like there are so many people out there who would hate you simply because of your gender. These feelings of being disliked until people get to know you can be incredibly damaging to your sense of self-worth and overall well-being. It's understandable that you would feel immense frustration and sadness about it.

It's positive that you have this subreddit as a safe space to share your thoughts and experiences. Finding communities where you can express yourself and receive support is crucial. It's also important to consider seeking professional help if you haven't already. A mental health professional can provide you with guidance and strategies for coping with these negative emotions and developing a healthier self-image.

Remember, you are not alone in this struggle. It's unfortunate that gender-based derogatory statements are sometimes seen as socially acceptable, but it doesn't mean everyone feels that way.

"I'm sorry to hear that you're feeling so down and overwhelmed by the negative statements and stereotypes that you encounter online. It's completely understandable that constantly being exposed to derogatory comments about men can further impact your self-esteem and self-worth. Such experiences can be incredibly distressing, especially when you feel like you don't have a safe space to express your concerns without being misunderstood or labeled unfairly.

It's important to remember that everyone's experiences and perspectives are unique, and it's unfortunate when generalizations and stereotypes overshadow individual stories and struggles. Your feelings of hurt and frustration are valid; it is not easy to be constantly confronted with negativity and judgment.

While I can't change what others say or do, I want you to know that your value as a person is not determined by these hurtful comments. Your worth extends far beyond your gender and other societal labels. It might be helpful to explore coping strategies and self-care practices that can support you during these challenging times.

"I‚Äôm so sick of going online every day and seeing all men get lumped together in derogatory statements. I have horrendous self esteem and self worth issues, and have all of my life. So every time I see one of these comments or memes about how men are useless, how we‚Äôre scum, how we mistreat women, etc., it kicks me down even further. It makes me feel like if there are so many people who would hate on me just for my sex/gender then what‚Äôs the point of living? So I can have my already low self worth smashed even flatter? And I can‚Äôt even speak up about stuff like this outside of places like this subreddit. The moment i do I‚Äôm met with ‚Äúthere is no misandry‚Äù and accusations of being an incel, as though voicing concern at having my psyche whipped everyday could somehow make me think women owe me sex or mistreat them. No. I just makes me think a lot of people out there hates me until they get to know me. It‚Äôs shit like this that makes me immense grateful (not proud) that I‚Äôm a straight, white, cismale, because I‚Äôd have offed myself a long time ago from the increased hate from others for being anything else.

Edit: It seems I need to clarify some stuff. I understand why people say these things. My ex wife was assaulted once as a child, my mother was multiple times, and so were my cousins. I understand some people‚Äôs reasoning behind distrust of men in general. I also don‚Äôt feel like they are addressing me personally when people say these things. My issue is that it makes me feel subhuman that it is socially acceptable to make derogatory blanket statements about men or to attack men when they express how such statements make them feel.

Just because I can understand it doesn‚Äôt mean it doesn‚Äôt hurt still."	"I'm really sorry to hear that you're going through such a difficult time. It's completely understandable that seeing derogatory statements about men can have a negative impact on your self-esteem and self-worth. It's important to remember that these statements are not a reflection of who you are as an individual.

It can be frustrating when you try to express your concerns and are met with dismissal or accusations. It takes a lot of courage to open up about your emotions, and it's important to find a safe space where you can express yourself without fear of judgment or ridicule. Please remember that your experiences and feelings are valid, and finding supportive communities like this subreddit can provide a sense of belonging and understanding.

While it's important to acknowledge the reasons behind some people's distrust of men due to personal experiences, it's also crucial to address these issues in a way that doesn't generalize or stereotype an entire gender. It's unfortunate that derogatory blanket statements are socially acceptable, and it's understandable that this can make you feel subhuman.

Remember that you are not defined by the negative perceptions of others. Focus on building your self-worth and finding strength within yourself. Seeking therapy or counseling with a mental health professional might also provide you with valuable tools and support to navigate these emotions. Surrounding yourself with positive influences and engaging in self-care activities that bring you joy and fulfillment can also help boost your self-esteem.

You matter, and your feelings are important. Keep reaching out for support, both online and in your personal life, and remember that there are people who care and want to help."	2	0	0	0.000853419303894043	forum with demographics

"Hey there, it sounds like you're really struggling with the negativity and derogatory comments you see directed towards men online. It's understandable that these comments can have a significant impact on your self-esteem and self-worth, especially if you've been carrying these issues throughout your life.

Feeling like you're constantly being attacked or hated on solely based on your gender can be incredibly overwhelming and emotionally draining. It's unfortunate that expressing how these comments affect you can lead to dismissive responses or accusations of being an incel. Seeking support and understanding should never be interpreted as wanting to mistreat women or feeling entitled to anything.

It's important to remember that while negative comments and stereotypes exist, they don't define who you are as an individual. Your worth should never be determined by the opinions of others. It's completely valid to feel hurt and invalidated by these blanket statements. It's essential to find spaces, like this subreddit, where you can openly discuss your feelings without the fear of judgment or invalidation.

Also, acknowledging and understanding the experiences and struggles of others, such as survivors of assault, is commendable. Empathy doesn't negate the impact that derogatory statements can have on you as an individual. It's crucial to prioritize your own mental health and find coping mechanisms that work for you.

Remember, you're not alone in these feelings, and seeking support is a positive step towards healing and understanding. Consider connecting with a mental health professional who can provide guidance and strategies for managing these emotions. Take care of yourself and remember that your worth is not determined by others' opinions."	1	0	0	0.0013155341148376465	forum w/o demographics

First of all, I want to acknowledge your journey and the progress you have made in stabilizing your mental health over the years. It takes a lot of strength and determination, so well done for getting to this point.

It's great to hear that you have a passion for Afro-Caribbean music and religion, as well as your commitment to learning the congas and practicing Kung Fu. Pursuing these interests alongside your job at USPS is absolutely possible. You can continue to grow your skills in music and martial arts in your free time, giving you a sense of fulfillment and joy.

Reading the books in your area of interest is also a fantastic idea. You can start by creating a reading list and gradually working your way through it. This will not only expand your knowledge but also provide you with an outlet for intellectual stimulation.

While it may feel disappointing that pursuing a PhD in religion or folklore might not be feasible at the moment, it's important to remember that career paths can be flexible and evolve over time. You can still find ways to explore your passions on a personal level, through self-study and engagement with relevant communities or online forums.

Regarding your feelings of loneliness and the absence of intimacy in your life, it's understandable that these can contribute to a sense of darkness. It might be helpful to seek support from mental health professionals or local support groups, where you can talk about your experiences and connect with others who can relate.

Remember that stability, both in terms of mental health and financial security, is crucial. If a USPS job provides stability for you, it can indeed be a good move. Stability can act as a solid foundation for your future endeavors and allow you to explore your interests further.

Take things one step at a time, celebrate your achievements along the way, and don't be too hard on yourself. Your journey is unique, and there are always possibilities for growth and fulfillment, even if they may not align with your initial expectations. Stay hopeful and keep exploring the paths that bring you joy and satisfaction."	1	0	0	0.0006158351898193359	mental health forum

Remember, it's never too late to follow your passions and continue learning. While you may have had past negative experiences with local musicians, it doesn't mean you can't continue to play the congas and explore your love for music. Consider looking for online communities or joining local music groups where you might find like-minded individuals who share your interests.

In terms of continuing your education, grad school may or may not be an option for you, but there are still plenty of opportunities to further your knowledge and pursue your interests. Look for online courses or workshops that specialize in the topics you are interested in.

Hey everyone,

I hope you're all doing well. I wanted to open up and seek some guidance from this supportive community. Over the past fifteen years, I have been managing a psychosis that started when I was 20. Thanks to medication, disability income, support from my parents, and part-time kitchen work, I have finally achieved some stability.

The reason I'm reaching out today is because I have a strong desire to pursue my passion for Afro Caribbean music and religion in grad school. Since I was 24, I have been slowly learning different musical techniques on the congas. However, due to my past struggles and misunderstandings, I ended up burning bridges with local musicians, many of whom are black. I deeply regret my actions and want to move forward positively.

Apart from music, I also wish to continue my journey in practicing Kung Fu while working for USPS. Additionally, I am eager to immerse myself in the literature related to Carl Jung and psychoanalysis, Karl Marx, comparative religion myth and folklore, anthropology, African and Caribbean studies, and literature.

However, I must admit that lately, I have been feeling extremely low. I have not been in a romantic relationship for fifteen years, and it has taken a toll on my mental health. The lack of progress in pursuing my dreams has also been weighing on me, and I fear that I may never be able to achieve them.

Nonetheless, I have considered the possibility of finding stability and satisfaction through a job at USPS. It could provide a sense of stability and financial security while allowing me to pursue my interests in my spare time. But at the same time, I can't shake off the longing to explore Caribbean cultures and develop my drumming skills further.

I apologize if my post seems scattered or filled with frustration. It's just that I have been feeling quite overwhelmed lately. I would be grateful if anyone could offer some guidance on how I can rebuild my life while still nourishing my passions. Perhaps some of you have been through similar struggles and have found ways to overcome them.

Thank you all for taking the time to read and understand my situation. I appreciate any advice or support you can provide."	1	2	0	0.0007343888282775879	forum w/o demographics
"Hello Friends, let me tell you about a self-help technique called journaling. Journaling is the practice of writing every single day. You can practically write about anything you want. You can write about your emotions, you can plan out your day, you can philosophize about life. Journaling is an ancient technique, a perfect example of this is Marcus Aurelius's journal, his Meditations. The stoics used to have different practices and methods to make the most out of their journaling sessions, and they included different excersizes like writng about the finitude of life, writing about their values, and reflecting on their days and what they can do to be better the next day.

I have been experimenting with journaling for years and I wanted to share with you the outline I use to start and end my days and my weeks which keeps me sane, organized, focused, confident, and in harmony with my goals and motivations. Here it is:

\- Start by mentioning 5 things I like, appreciate, love, and admire about myself.

\- Then appreciate 3 things I am thankful for.

\- Write down my short term goals (1 month to 6 months).

\- Write down my medium term goals (6 months to 5 years).

\- Write down my long term goals (5years forward). The idea is that my there should be little fluctuation specially in my medium and long term goals.

\- Plan out my day in google calendar.

\- Space to write about personal things troubling me.

\- If Monday, plan my workload for the week. Once I make a plan, I cannot change it for the week.

Basically, you just write every day about anything you want! üåü You can express your emotions, plan out your day, ponder life's big questions ‚Äì the possibilities are endless.

Did you know it's an ancient practice too? Marcus Aurelius, the philosopher, used to journal in his Meditations. üòÆ It's pretty cool how even the stoics had different exercises they did while journaling, like reflecting on their values and how to improve each day.

I've been journaling for years and it's been a game-changer. So, I wanted to share the outline I use ‚Äì it keeps me sane, focused, and confident. Here are the steps:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Start by listing 5 things you like, appreciate, love, and admire about yourself. Build that self-love! ‚ù§Ô∏è

2Ô∏è‚É£ Then, jot down 3 things you're grateful for. It's an amazing way to cultivate positivity! üôè

3Ô∏è‚É£ Write down your short-term goals (1 month to 6 months), medium-term goals (6 months to 5 years), and long-term goals (5 years or more). Stay focused!

4Ô∏è‚É£ Plan your day in your Google calendar ‚Äì lay out your tasks and schedule. Stay organized! üóìÔ∏è

5Ô∏è‚É£ Leave space to write about any personal issues troubling you. Journaling is a fantastic outlet for processing emotions. üìî

7Ô∏è‚É£ If it's Sunday, reflect on the previous week's workload and think about how to improve for the next one. Continuous growth! üöÄ

At night, wrap up your journal entry by:

2Ô∏è‚É£ Identify 3 areas you could improve in. Growth mindset, baby! üå±

Ivan Berezin"	"Hello Ivan Berezin,

Thank you for sharing your experience with journaling and providing an outline that has helped you stay organized and focused. Journaling can indeed be a helpful self-help technique for many people.

Incorporating a practice of self-appreciation and gratitude, as you've mentioned, can be powerful for boosting self-esteem and cultivating a positive mindset. It's great that you start your day by acknowledging five things you appreciate about yourself and three things you are thankful for. This sets a positive tone for the rest of the day.

Setting short-term, medium-term, and long-term goals is an excellent way to create clarity and direction in life. By having a clear vision of where you want to be in different timeframes, you can make focused decisions and take steps towards those goals.

Planning your day in advance using a tool like Google Calendar is a practical approach to staying organized and ensuring you have a clear schedule. Being able to track personal tasks and appointments alongside work obligations can improve overall productivity and reduce stress.

It's also a wise idea to create space in your journal to address any personal issues that might be troubling you. Writing about your thoughts and emotions can provide a release and clarity, enabling you to better understand yourself and work through challenges.

Reviewing your week's workload on Sundays and making changes for the upcoming week is a good practice to ensure continuous improvement and growth. By assessing what went well and what could be improved, you can make adjustments to enhance your productivity and overall well-being.

Ending the day with reflection is another valuable step. By acknowledging three things you did right, you reinforce positive behaviors and achievements. Identifying three areas for improvement allows you to develop self-awareness and create goals for personal growth.

Expressing gratitude, whether to a higher power or simply to the universe, is a beautiful way to cultivate appreciation for the positive aspects of your life.

Your comprehensive outline seems thoughtfully structured, and I appreciate you sharing it with the community. It offers a clear framework for aligning goals, finding gratitude, and maintaining focus. I encourage others to give it a try and share their experiences.

Thank you for your contribution and support, Ivan. Good luck to everyone who chooses to embark on this journaling journey!

"Hello Friends, let me tell you about a self-help technique called journaling. Journaling is the practice of writing every single day. You can practically write about anything you want. You can write about your emotions, you can plan out your day, you can philosophize about life. Journaling is an ancient technique, a perfect example of this is Marcus Aurelius's journal, his Meditations. The stoics used to have different practices and methods to make the most out of their journaling sessions, and they included different excersizes like writng about the finitude of life, writing about their values, and reflecting on their days and what they can do to be better the next day.

I have been experimenting with journaling for years and I wanted to share with you the outline I use to start and end my days and my weeks which keeps me sane, organized, focused, confident, and in harmony with my goals and motivations. Here it is:

\- Start by mentioning 5 things I like, appreciate, love, and admire about myself.

\- Then appreciate 3 things I am thankful for.

\- Write down my short term goals (1 month to 6 months).

\- Write down my medium term goals (6 months to 5 years).

\- Write down my long term goals (5years forward). The idea is that my there should be little fluctuation specially in my medium and long term goals.

\- Plan out my day in google calendar.

\- Space to write about personal things troubling me.

\- If Monday, plan my workload for the week. Once I make a plan, I cannot change it for the week.

\- If Sunday, analyze this weeks workload and think about changes and improvements for the following week.

\- Night

\- Write down 3 things I did right today.

\- Write down 3 things I could do better.

\- Write down 3 things I am thankful for.

\- Thank God.

I recommend you try my outline for a week or two and then tell me what you think about it! I would love to hear your experiences.

Good luck to you all,

Thank you so much for sharing this helpful journaling technique with us all. It sounds like you have put a lot of thought and effort into creating an outline that keeps you focused and motivated. Journaling can truly be a fantastic tool for self-reflection and personal growth.

I really like how you start your journaling sessions by acknowledging and appreciating positive things about yourself. It's so important to cultivate self-love and self-compassion. Expressing gratitude for three things is a wonderful practice that can shift our focus towards the positive aspects of our lives.

Setting short-term, medium-term, and long-term goals is a great way to ensure that we are actively working towards our dreams and aspirations. By carefully planning out your day in Google Calendar, you are setting yourself up for success by staying organized and focused.

Creating space to write about personal matters that may be troubling you is an excellent way to process and work through any challenges you may be facing. It's important to give yourself the time and space to reflect on these issues.

The idea of analyzing your workload on Sundays and making improvements for the following week is a smart strategy. It allows you to continuously grow and optimize your productivity.

In ending your day with positive self-reflection, you reinforce the things you did right and identify areas for improvement. Expressing gratitude once again is a beautiful way to cultivate a sense of appreciation and contentment.

Overall, your journaling outline seems well-rounded and thoughtfully designed. I appreciate you sharing this technique, and I will definitely give it a try. It's always beneficial to learn from others and experiment with different practices.

Thank you again for sharing, and I wish you continued success with your journaling practice.

Best regards,

Thank you for sharing your journaling technique with us. It seems like you have found a structured way to incorporate reflection and goal-setting into your daily routine. Journaling can indeed be a helpful practice for maintaining mental well-being and personal growth.

However, it's important to note that while journaling can offer many benefits, it may not be a standalone solution for everyone struggling with mental health concerns. It's essential to seek professional help if you are experiencing persistent or severe symptoms.

That being said, your outlined approach appears thorough and comprehensive. It's great that you start each day by focusing on self-appreciation and gratitude. Acknowledging positive aspects of ourselves and expressing gratitude for what we have can enhance our overall well-being.

Additionally, setting short, medium, and long-term goals can give us direction and a sense of purpose in life. Breaking them down into manageable chunks (like you have done) helps prevent overwhelm and allows for better planning.

Organizing your day using Google Calendar is an effective way to stay focused and organized. By allocating specific time slots for different tasks, you can enhance productivity and reduce stress.

Providing space for personal reflections and addressing any troubling thoughts or feelings shows that you recognize the importance of emotional well-being. This can help in identifying patterns, triggers, and finding healthy ways to cope.

Sunday's reflection on the previous week and planning for the upcoming one allows for continuous growth and improvement. By analyzing your workload and making necessary adjustments, you can maintain balance and prevent burnout.

Ending each day by recognizing your achievements and areas for improvement helps foster self-awareness and continuous self-improvement.

Lastly, expressing gratitude towards a higher power can provide comfort and a sense of connection.

Thank you for sharing your journaling technique, Ivan. It's valuable to hear about different approaches that work for individuals. Remember, everyone's journey is unique, so it's essential to find what works best for you. It might be helpful to try this technique and customize it to suit your specific needs and preferences.

If anyone else has tried Ivan's journaling outline, we would love to hear about your experiences and any modifications you made to tailor it to your personal needs.

Take care, and best of luck to all!

I‚Äôm from a town of 12,000 inhabitants in southern Europe. During the ‚Äò90s, I suffered bullying from the age of 7 to 17.
Today, I ran into the person who bullied me the most during my adolescence while I was at a caf√© with my parents (my father is 75, and my mother is 67). He was with friends, his partner, and a newborn baby, and I didn‚Äôt want to do anything, but seeing so much normalcy and happiness for someone who caused so much pain wasn‚Äôt fair. It lasted for over 10 years.

After changing schools, the nightmare continued, but he was the one who started it all and relentlessly focused on me. He also became obsessed with my brother and my parents, and we felt powerless to do anything about it. The reason for his obsession was my overweight.

My parents feel that they didn‚Äôt do enough to protect me from that person. The bullying I endured because of them (him in particular) is impossible to put into words: all sorts of humiliations, threats, insults, and persecutions. I always felt defenseless against them, and they always seemed to win. My parents went to the school and the police, but no one paid attention; they dismissed it as kids‚Äô stuff. My father had been saying for a while that he didn‚Äôt want to die without confronting them. They even insulted my parents in public, calling us mentally unstable. For over 20 years, that person and their group of friends have been keeping tabs on me.

Today at the caf√©, I did something ridiculous. I wrote a note, and my father gave it to this bully. In the note, I expressed that I hope he takes good care of their child because he has already caused too much harm and left too many victims, and no matter how he tries to be a good person now, they have caused pain. 

He confronted my father, and I stood up to him, telling him what I felt inside: that he will always be the terrible person who tried to harm us for over a decade, that he‚Äôs now a teacher, and I will do everything possible to get him fired because people like him shouldn‚Äôt be educating teenagers. He said hurtful things about my family, and his partner even sent me to therapy, which I, of course, did, and he was a significant cause of many problems I faced.

I didn‚Äôt want to bring up the past, but I know my parents felt hurt because he caused us harm, even threatening them when they were heads of the family, and they couldn‚Äôt do anything. It saddened me as a child that a classmate would do that to my parents just because they hated me for being overweight. Another thing that hurt me deeply is knowing that, all these years, I have been a topic of conversation among his friends, and they‚Äôve been keeping tabs on me. One of his friends who works at a supermarket laughed at me, and I got fed up and called her a derogatory term. I know it‚Äôs not the right way to handle it, but I‚Äôm exhausted. 

After all this, I also feel quite sad for still living in the same town where there are people who take an interest in my life despite hating me so much, and I haven‚Äôt done anything to them.

All of this connects with my deepest wounds and the little girl who couldn‚Äôt defend herself, but now I can, and that‚Äôs why I spoke up today. In fact, to prevent further harm, I‚Äôm considering leaving a record with the police and explaining what happened. I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs a good idea; what do you think? I would leave things as they are, but I‚Äôm afraid for my parents. What goes against me is that we acted foolishly with the note, but he escalated the situation, even though he was the one with a history of bullying."	"I'm really sorry to hear about what you went through, and I understand how difficult it must have been to see your bully leading a seemingly happy life. It's understandable that you would feel frustrated and want to speak up about the pain they caused you and your family.

Leaving a record with the police could be a good step to ensure your safety and the safety of your parents. It's important to prioritize your well-being and take necessary measures to protect yourself. You deserve to feel safe and live without the fear of being targeted.

Remember that you are not alone in this. There are resources and support systems available to help you navigate through this difficult situation. Reach out to organizations, counselors, or support groups that specialize in handling bullying and its long-term effects. They can provide guidance and offer strategies to cope with the impact it has had on your life.

Stay strong and know that you have support in your journey towards healing and reclaiming your life."	2	0	0	0.0007980465888977051	social media

"I'm really sorry to hear about the pain and trauma you've experienced due to bullying. It's incredibly difficult to have to confront someone from your past who caused you so much harm, especially when they seem to be leading a seemingly normal and happy life now. It's understandable that seeing their happiness can feel unfair and bring up a lot of unresolved emotions and anger.

It's important to acknowledge that the effects of bullying can be long-lasting, and it's completely normal to still feel the pain and hurt even after so many years. The fact that this person and their friends have been keeping tabs on you for so long is concerning and can further exacerbate the wounds from your past. It's understandable that you feel exhausted and fed up with this ongoing situation.

Considering reporting the bullying incidents to the police may be a step worth considering. It may bring some feelings of validation and empowerment to have an official record of what you have endured. However, it's important to consider how this might impact your well-being and the well-being of your parents. It might be helpful to seek professional advice or counseling to help you navigate this decision and explore other options for dealing with this situation.

Remember, taking care of yourself and prioritizing your mental health is crucial. It's important to find healthy ways of processing and coping with the emotions that arise from this situation. This might include seeking therapy or support groups to work through the trauma and find healing. Additionally, practicing self-care activities such as exercise, meditation, journaling, or engaging in hobbies can help you manage your emotions during this challenging time.

Lastly, know that you are not alone, and there are resources available to provide support. Connecting with others who have experienced similar situations, whether it's through online forums or local support groups, can be beneficial in finding understanding and empathy. Remember to be gentle with yourself throughout this process and reach out for help when needed."	2	0	0	0.0008018612861633301	mental health forum

Speaking up for yourself and expressing your emotions to him was a brave step, even though it may not have had the desired outcome. It's natural to feel exhausted and frustrated by the ongoing presence of these people in your town, especially when they continue to take an interest in your life.

Remember that you are not defined by the actions of others, and it's not your fault that you were targeted. Healing from the pain of bullying takes time and support. Opening up and expressing your feelings can be a valuable step in the healing process. Focus on surrounding yourself with positive, understanding people who truly care about you and your well-being.

Please remember that I'm here to listen and provide support. You're not alone."	2	0	2	0.0006760358810424805	forum w/o demographics
