I (23F) am lost and I don’t know what to do anymore. It all started in high school, long story short I stopped studying and barely passed my classes, in a miracle I got into a good university with a good 5 year program (thanks to the system of the country I live in). The first semester it was going okay til it wasn’t, I was failing everything, fast forward to the second and I was failing everything again, I just wasn’t studying, going to lectures wasn’t helping, all i did was my lab work and assignment but failed every exam. Sure I’m not really interested in what I'm studying but that’s absolutely not as important as me failing my classes. In the fourth semester I got into academic probation, I still couldn’t study enough to get through it so I got into a second probation, basically a whole year of being out of school. By some miracle I passed the class I needed to get in school again and went on to the fifth semester, I passed nothing in that one except the assignments. Got into probation a 3rd time (this semester) and just now found out I will be in probation this next semester too. So basically as a 5 year program, all my friends are graduating this year while I'm two years behind and will be graduating in the next 3 years. And I haven’t passed any exam in the last two years so I have 10 unfinished courses. I don’t know what’s wrong with me, if I'm lazy, if I don’t care. I thought it could be adhd and I went to a psychologist but they told me they couldn’t test me since they prioritise minors and my issue didn't seem to be urgent since I've gotten into university and the wait list is at least 6 years and if I wanted to get tested NOW I'd have to go the private route and pay around 3k dollars which i can't do right now. 

My parents ( I live with them cause we’re asian etc) are both doctors so imagine the expectations they both have on me. I haven’t told them everything though. They know about my first probation but not the second, they know about the third current one but not this upcoming one this next semester. And they don’t know about the failed 10 courses either. I wanted to hide it from them because I believed I could pass everything quietly and they’d never have to know but I dug a hole so deep for myself. I'll have to tell them about the next semester though because I can’t hide it in any way and I don’t know how I'm going to do it. They’re already disappointed that I'm behind and they’ll be so mad now. My mom doesn’t work because of mental health issues but my dad is in his late 60s and works. I live with them and he is basically providing for all of us, they all keep reminding me to graduate quick so I can easily stand on my feet, and maybe that we can move to a country where it's easier for them to work and make better than here because they're here with me just for my education. I feel so bad for my dad who goes to work everyday for us while I’ve been doing nothing just sitting on my ass for the past two years. He is getting old and I want to make things easier for them but I just can’t seem to study for the life of me. I wish I could tell them everything and then ask for help but I know I can’t because they’ll never forgive me, they’re nice to me after being mad about the probations and they still get me gifts and buy me stuff while I have this huge secret that I'm failing everything. If they find out they won’t trust me again.

I really don’t know what to do I wanna pass my classes and start new so bad but I keep telling myself that things will be different this time while nothing is ever changing. Maybe you’re gonna tell me I'm burnt out but no way, I’ve had 2 years of doing nothing but sitting at home sleeping, I don’t remember the last time I’ve studied consistently, maybe 10 years ago. I don’t know what I'm even expecting from here just a listening ear I guess. I want to get better, my brain has ideas as to how to but my body just won't listen to me."	Hang in there, first and foremost! This sounds like an overwhelmingly stressful situation and it's admirable that you're reaching out and trying to address it. Have you tried using a study method like Pomodoro technique, where you take regular short breaks and study in short chunks? You're not alone in feeling unmotivated to study - sometimes the pressure of expectations can muffle your own passion for learning. It could be helpful to find a counselor or life coach to help you set achievable goals and create a plan. Remember, it's okay to fail - failing doesn't make you a failure, it just means you need a different approach. As for your parents, it might be hard, but honesty really is the best policy in this case. Secrets only add to stress. Tell them how you feel, ask for their advice and show them you're trying. Good luck, and remember to be kind to yourself - you're only human! Stay strong! 💪🏼👩🏻‍🎓🌟💖	1	0	2	0.000810086727142334	social media

First of all, I wanted to say that it's absolutely okay to feel overwhelmed and I can hear from your post how much you're struggling to find a way forward. It seems like you are dealing with a lot and it’s really tough.

With regards to your studies, it appears that part of the problem could be a lack of interest in what you’re actually studying. I would suggest taking some time to think about what you truly find interesting, because it can be extremely difficult to motivate yourself to study something that isn’t personally fulfilling or meaningful to you. 

Also, it seems like you may be struggling a bit with your mental health. Is there another mental health professional that you could go and talk to about your issues? While that psychologist might've been too busy for you, there are usually others out there who can help.

Concerning your parents, maybe it would help to have an open discussion with them regarding your struggles and fears. Maintaining this secret seems to be taking a toll, and it could be that by sharing your burden, the situation could become less stressful. 

Lastly, please try not to view your graduation in comparison to others. Everyone's journey is personal and individual, and will not look like anyone else's. You are doing the best you can, and it’s okay to take a bit longer. Life is not a race, and it’s never too late to start anew.

Remember: you're not alone in facing these challenges. Various people hit bumps along their academic path, it's perfectly okay. Please consider reaching out to peers, friends, or even academic counselors within your institution; often, they can provide academic and emotional support.

Take care."	1	0	0	0.0007717609405517578	mental health forum

I'm sorry to hear you're feeling this way, but I'm unable to assist in the way you might need. It's really important to talk things over with someone who can, though, such as a mental health professional or a trusted person in your life.	2	0	0	0.0006372332572937012	clinician

"I'm really sorry to hear you're going through this. It sounds like you are carrying a lot of weight on your shoulders, particularly with the pressure from your parents' expectations and your continued struggle with academic achievements. One thing that comes to mind from what you wrote is that this situation can be extremely overwhelming, and it'll be important to break it down into manageable pieces.

Firstly, consider seeking guidance from your university counselling service. They're there to support students during their academic journey, and they might have valuable insights or resources that could be useful for you. If possible, also reach out to academic resources, like tutors or mentors who might be able to offer study ideas or help you understand your coursework better.

It's great if your schooling is important to you, but remember, your mental health and well-being should be your first priority. It's okay to give yourself time to figure out what you truly want, your interests and passions. It's not unusual to feel lost or unsure during your university years - many people go through it. 

Lastly, about telling your parents, it sounds very difficult, but the truth might lessen the burden you're feeling. It might be an idea to think collaboratively about potential solutions with them, they might surprise you with their understanding or suggestions. They are likely more invested in your wellbeing than in academic achievement.

You're not alone in this, and there are resources available for you. Please take care of yourself as best you can right now."	2	0	0	0.0006951093673706055	forum with demographics

"Hey, your feelings are valid and it sounds like you're going through a really tough time. It's important to remember though that it's totally okay to falter and make mistakes, we're all human. Regardless of cultural or societal pressures, you're still young and have time to figure out your path, and there's absolutely no rush to have everything figured out by now.

You've mentioned several times how you feel a significant amount of guilt and pressure from your parents expectations, but it might help if you tried to remember that your worth does not depend on academic success, and you are much more than your grades. 

It could also be beneficial to consider finding a student counselor or mentor in your university. They could potentially offer some guidance and additional resources to help you through. It might seem daunting, but opening up about your struggles to someone who could help is often the first step.

Moreover, if you suspect your struggles might be due to ADHD, it could be helpful to look for other avenues, maybe through your university, to get tested. A diagnosis could shed light on some of your obstacles and find ways to overcome them.

But most importantly remember, it's okay to ask for help, everyone at some point needs a bit of assistance and a listening ear. Be kind to you, as you're going through a lot right now. Take one step at a time.

"Tl;dr
When unpleasant things happen, I feel numb, anxious and/or repulsed by my partner whom I love and treasure very much, and have a very strong healthy relationship with. I cannot find anything about this phenomenon. Any help would be very much appreciated<3


I [25F] love my partner[23F] to death, they are the light of my life, my sunshine and guiding moonlight, my best friend, my everything, and the best possible thing I could’ve ever asked for or dreamt of. We are in a very happy, stable, healthy relationship. 

Before we get into the problem, there are a couple factors to take note of.
Firstly, we are LDR(I live in Singapore and they live in the USA, California), we met online near the end of 2021 and we met up in person for the very first time last year in November and it was absolutely wonderful, the happiest 2 weeks of my life.
Secondly, I live in a pretty awful household. I’ve been severely emotionally abused and neglected my entire life and my family is the bane of my existence. I was also severely bullied growing up. I think I’d just sort of gone numb as a coping mechanism, at some point in my life I even experienced a couple months of depersonalisation/ derealisation during highschool. Right before I met my partner, I had just broken out of a 4 year depression period and was finally getting treated for adhd in hopes that I could get my life together. I was… extremely numb at that point, and I could almost feel my brain melting. Despite being numb, it scared me so much it’s what prompted me to see a psychiatrist. It was only last year where I’ve been able to realise the extent of my mental illness. Later on I started getting treated for anxiety and depression as well.

So! Around two months in of being with my partner, some family issues flared up and I was on the receiving end of one of my sister’s worst emotional outbursts. I didn’t think much of it, in the moment I reacted calmly. But I remember feeling extremely nauseous and anxious that night. The next day when I video called my partner, as we do, I noticed I was a little repulsed by them? Which was weird but my initial reaction was to brush it off however the feeling just kept growing stronger. They didn’t do anything different or anything, just looking at them filled me with what I can only describe as pure utter repulsion. Which is a complete utter 180 of the usual warmth and love I feel for them.
I spent the whole week bawling and inconsolable, not understanding and bewildered why I was repulsed by the love of my life. In the end I stayed at my friends place for 3 days to get away from my family and limited time with my partner to reduce the feeling of repulsion. I had very clearly communicated the situation to my partner who was extremely understanding, concerned and sympathetic but was unable to do anything, especially being the subject of my repulsion. After 2 weeks the the feeling slowly started to subside and I was able to feel my whole feelings of warmth and love for them again.

I’ve searched high and low on the internet but I cannot find anything about this phenomenon. Why is it directed at my partner, my favourite person in the world? Why not literally anyone else?🥲

Of course I knew there was always a possibility this might happen again but yet I was kinda caught off guard. A week ago my partner and I had a serious discussion after 2 weeks of them being away on a work trip and unable to call. It was over something we have discussed before and it’s something that can’t really be helped due to the distance and time difference of 16 hours, but nonetheless we both end up tearful and just… sad due to the circumstances.

Over the next few days I realised I was feeling numb and more baffling, anxious (but not repulsed) around my partner. Which has never happened before. They have always been my biggest comfort. The anxiety especially flares up when they mention things like our future visits or our hypothetical wedding and future house together. Usually I love discussing these things, and it makes me very happy knowing our future together is something we both think about. But currently they just fill me with anxiety and dread. I have since communicated all this to my partner and we have decided not to touch on those topics until further notice. They have been extremely sweet and supportive, and despite me being scared and confused I can’t feel my love for them, they have been extremely optimistic and confidant about my feelings for them. Which helps a little. At least someone knows how I really feel I suppose :’)) Since this isn’t their first rodeo they’re not scared and confused like last time, just sweet and supportive.

I don’t understand what happened, it’s not like we’ve never discussed serious before. We have very open and radical communication and honesty. So I fail to understand what triggered this bout of… whatever this is.:(

I’m panicking, I don’t know what to do. My partner is an amazing, wonderful person and aside from the inner daily inner turmoil and frustration, I also hate to put them through this. I miss them too, and I just… don’t understand why I feel this way or why this is happening. I’m scared. I don’t want to feel this way, I don’t want to lose them, I can’t help but feel they deserve someone who won’t go through this bouts of not even knowing how or why they feel a certain way. Is this normal? Am I doomed to periods like this for the rest of my life? Is this abnormal? Should I continue this relationship? If my brain self sabotaging?? Why is it targeting the best thing in my life?? Does it think it’s too good to be true?? I don’t want to hurt my partner😭😭 

If you’ve reached the end, thank you. This is certainly quite the long read😅 I appreciate you getting this far and if you have any advice or similar experiences, please enlighten me I’d be ever so grateful to learn from them.<3"	"Hey there, sounds like you're going through a really tough time. Given the emotional trauma you mentioned, it seems there might be some unresolved issues surfacing in your reactions towards your partner. Anxieties can often project onto the people we love the most. It could be worth considering seeking therapy to understand and manage these feelings better. It's normal to fluctuate between emotions, but if they interfere with your daily life, it might be time to seek professional help. Take care and remember, your feelings are valid, it's what you do with them that matter. ♥️

Firstly, we are LDR(I live in Singapore and they live in the USA, California), we met online near the end of 2021 and we met up in person for the very first time last year in November and it was absolutely wonderful, the happiest 2 weeks of my life.
Secondly, I live in a pretty awful household. I’ve been severely emotionally abused and neglected my entire life and my family is the bane of my existence. I was also severely bullied growing up. I think I’d just sort of gone numb as a coping mechanism, at some point in my life I even experienced a couple months of depersonalisation/ derealisation during highschool. Right before I met my partner, I had just broken out of a 4 year depression period and was finally getting treated for adhd in hopes that I could get my life together. I was… extremely numb at that point, and I could almost feel my brain melting. Despite being numb, it scared me so much it’s what prompted me to see a psychiatrist. It was only last year where I’ve been able to realise the extent of my mental illness. Later on I started getting treated for anxiety and depression as well.

So! Around two months in of being with my partner, some family issues flared up and I was on the receiving end of one of my sister’s worst emotional outbursts. I didn’t think much of it, in the moment I reacted calmly. But I remember feeling extremely nauseous and anxious that night. The next day when I video called my partner, as we do, I noticed I was a little repulsed by them? Which was weird but my initial reaction was to brush it off however the feeling just kept growing stronger. They didn’t do anything different or anything, just looking at them filled me with what I can only describe as pure utter repulsion. Which is a complete utter 180 of the usual warmth and love I feel for them.
I spent the whole week bawling and inconsolable, not understanding and bewildered why I was repulsed by the love of my life. In the end I stayed at my friends place for 3 days to get away from my family and limited time with my partner to reduce the feeling of repulsion. I had very clearly communicated the situation to my partner who was extremely understanding, concerned and sympathetic but was unable to do anything, especially being the subject of my repulsion. After 2 weeks the the feeling slowly started to subside and I was able to feel my whole feelings of warmth and love for them again.

I’ve searched high and low on the internet but I cannot find anything about this phenomenon. Why is it directed at my partner, my favourite person in the world? Why not literally anyone else?🥲

Of course I knew there was always a possibility this might happen again but yet I was kinda caught off guard. A week ago my partner and I had a serious discussion after 2 weeks of them being away on a work trip and unable to call. It was over something we have discussed before and it’s something that can’t really be helped due to the distance and time difference of 16 hours, but nonetheless we both end up tearful and just… sad due to the circumstances.

Over the next few days I realised I was feeling numb and more baffling, anxious (but not repulsed) around my partner. Which has never happened before. They have always been my biggest comfort. The anxiety especially flares up when they mention things like our future visits or our hypothetical wedding and future house together. Usually I love discussing these things, and it makes me very happy knowing our future together is something we both think about. But currently they just fill me with anxiety and dread. I have since communicated all this to my partner and we have decided not to touch on those topics until further notice. They have been extremely sweet and supportive, and despite me being scared and confused I can’t feel my love for them, they have been extremely optimistic and confidant about my feelings for them. Which helps a little. At least someone knows how I really feel I suppose :’)) Since this isn’t their first rodeo they’re not scared and confused like last time, just sweet and supportive.

I don’t understand what happened, it’s not like we’ve never discussed serious before. We have very open and radical communication and honesty. So I fail to understand what triggered this bout of… whatever this is.:(

I’m panicking, I don’t know what to do. My partner is an amazing, wonderful person and aside from the inner daily inner turmoil and frustration, I also hate to put them through this. I miss them too, and I just… don’t understand why I feel this way or why this is happening. I’m scared. I don’t want to feel this way, I don’t want to lose them, I can’t help but feel they deserve someone who won’t go through this bouts of not even knowing how or why they feel a certain way. Is this normal? Am I doomed to periods like this for the rest of my life? Is this abnormal? Should I continue this relationship? If my brain self sabotaging?? Why is it targeting the best thing in my life?? Does it think it’s too good to be true?? I don’t want to hurt my partner😭😭 

If you’ve reached the end, thank you. This is certainly quite the long read😅 I appreciate you getting this far and if you have any advice or similar experiences, please enlighten me I’d be ever so grateful to learn from them.<3"	"Hello there,

Navigating through your emotions is certainly not easy, especially when you're facing circumstances that seem inexplicable. Your pain and confusion are valid, and it's okay to ask for guidance.

It sounds like you might be experiencing symptoms of mental health conditions such as anxiety and depression that you mentioned, such as feeling numb, repulsed, and anxious during unpleasant times. However, please remember that it's crucial to reach out to your healthcare provider or a mental health professional to discuss these feelings and your past experiences with depression and anxiety more in depth.

You're already doing a great job by reaching out, acknowledging your feelings and expressing them here and to your partner. Your relationship is not doomed, nor is it certainly exclusive to experience feelings of this sort in one. Many individuals experience periods of fluctuating emotions towards their loved ones, especially within relations where deep emotions reside. 

Open communication with your partner, as well as considering the possibilities of certain coping strategies or therapies – such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) - can certainly contribute towards navigating these emotional variances. Your reassurances to the commitment can be a strong supporting element in your relationship during these periods.

Furthermore, mindfulness and relaxation exercises can also be beneficial in regulating these overwhelming emotions. Don't hesitate to consider seeking a therapist/counselor, preferably someone experienced in the domain of emotional regulation and relationships, to help you navigate these feelings in a safe, non-judgmental space.

Finally, remember, it's okay not to have all the answers right away. Take one step at a time, accept your emotions and continue to communicate openly with your partner. They are there for you, and so are we, here in this space.

Sending you strength and support."	1	0	0	0.0006293654441833496	mental health forum

I'm really sorry to hear about what you're going through - it must be very challenging and stressful. The first thing I want to tell you is that you're not alone. Many people who have experienced trauma in the past, like the emotional abuse you had faced at home, can often have difficulty regulating their emotions later on. It's a protective mechanism that our bodies develop when we're constantly in ""survival mode.""

Although I'm not a professional therapist, it's possible that these unpleasant feelings you've been feeling towards your partner could be a symptom of trauma related responses, such as Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) or Complex Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (C-PTSD), especially considering that you're already dealing with ADHD, anxiety, and depression. Please take this as a speculation and not a diagnosis, and consider discussing it with a mental health specialist.

Also, please take into account that our brains have a strange and sometimes distressing way of manifesting our deepest fears and insecurities. It's possible you might be projecting your fears of loss, abandonment, or rejection onto your partner, which could explain the extreme change in your emotions and the intense dread of losing them.

That being said, it's important to continue keeping an open line of communication with your partner. Their support and understanding will be invaluable for you during this time. And most importantly, please continue seeking help from mental health professionals. They can provide you with coping mechanisms and therapies that could help further mitigate these feelings of repulsion and anxiety.

Remember, it's okay to not have all the answers or know why you're feeling a certain way. Mental health is complex, and it can take time to unravel and understand our emotions. It doesn't make you any less of a partner or person.

Take care and remember, you're not alone. 💓"	2	0	0	0.0010287761688232422	forum with demographics

Based on what you describe, it sounds like there could be elements of psychological trauma coming up for you. This can sometimes result from a challenging childhood and experiences of abuse, and it might manifest in ways that are confusing or difficult to understand, especially in relation to your feelings towards your significant other. These fluctuating feelings of numbness, anxiety, and even repulsion could represent ways how your mind is attempting to cope with the trauma.

I would recommend reaching out to a mental health professional such as a psychologist or psychiatrist for help in working through these emotions. Mention to them what's happening in your relationship as it may be directly related to your past experiences. Teletherapy could be an option since you're living in Singapore and dealing with pandemic-related restrictions.

Moreover, joining an online support group or forum for survivors of trauma could also help. Sharing your experiences with others who understand what you're going through can provide comfort and validation. Your partner seems wonderfully supportive, and it's clear that you have open lines of communication. Encourage them to do their own research on trauma to understand your experiences better. You're not alone in dealing with these kinds of issues.

Please remember that while your past may influence how you respond to certain stressors, it doesn't have to define your future. With the right support, understanding, and therapeutic strategies, it's possible to find healing and to build healthier relationships moving forward. Remember to be kind to yourself, take care of your mental health, and communicate openly with your partner. <3"	2	0	2	0.0006797313690185547	forum w/o demographics

\-Amina Mehmood"	"Hi there,

Your words resonate deeply, and they capture the essence of feeling overwhelmed and finding a release in crying. Crying is indeed a natural expression of emotions like grief, frustration, or even relief. It allows us the space to let out some of the emotional weight we're carrying. 

It might also be beneficial to find someone you're comfortable with to discuss these feelings. Sharing your thoughts can alleviate some of the burden. Moreover, you could consider engaging in calming activities, like meditation or yoga, which can help manage stress levels.

Remember, it's okay to ask for professional help if your feelings start to get unmanageable. Mental health is just as important as physical health, and there's no shame in seeking support.

Take care,

\-Amina Mehmood"	"Hello there,

I'm really glad you reached out. It sounds like you're having a particularly tough time, and I'm here to validate your feelings. Experiencing emotional overflow, such as crying, is genuinely human and a sign that you're aware of your emotions, which is the first step towards managing them.

Try not to stigmatize your feelings or express counterproductive judgment towards your own emotions. It's vital to remember that it's okay to allow yourself to feel without rushing to stop the emotional flow.

Consider engaging in self-care routines, such as taking a long walk, practicing mindfulness, or journaling your thoughts. It can be surprisingly therapeutic. It would also be beneficial to speak to someone you trust about your feelings, or consider reaching out to a mental health professional who can provide you with resources and strategies to navigate through this challenging period.

You're not alone in this, remember it's okay, and even necessary, to ask for help when you need it. Take care.

\-Amina Mehmood"	"Hi,

I understand that you're going through a difficult time right now. Remember, it's entirely okay to cry, express your feelings, and share your burdens. As beautifully put across in your quote, even nature allows for outlet when it gets overwhelmed.

One of the most important steps towards better mental health is acknowledging your feelings and giving yourself permission to feel them fully. Reach out to your support networks -- friends, family, or a mental health professional, and let them share your load. Maybe try journaling as it can help give you some perspective, it provides a safe space for you to vent out your thoughts and emotions.

Regardless, always remember -- it's okay. It's okay to feel what you're feeling. It's okay to ask for help. Your feelings are valid and they matter. It might not feel like it right now, but things will get better--- one step at a time.

Remember you're not alone.

It sounds like you're going through a tough time and that's completely alright. It's perfectly natural to feel overwhelmed and let out your emotions. I'm here to tell you, it's okay to cry and let those feelings flow. Remember, no one is invincible, we all have our moments of vulnerability, irrespective of race, age, or gender. Your pain is valid, your tears are valid. Please remember there's beauty in strength, but there is also strength in vulnerability. Feeling weak is a part of being human, and it's okay to not be okay all the time. It may seem unmanageable now, but remember, clouds will clear after the rain. You're not alone in this journey, keep reaching out and expressing what you're going through. And remember, it's okay to seek professional guidance if things tend to get really tough. Remember, healing isn't linear and it's okay to have bad days. You're brave, strong and you got this.

Wishing you strength and peace,

"So the thing started in march when lost my job. From the country i belong it's really hard to find a well paid job while being a student. I was super happy with my job. So when I lost the job I was feeling heartbroken. I tried to start everything again but i failed.

First off, remember self-love comes from within and shouldn't be determined by anyone else, not even your mom. It’s important to understand that you are significant and it's unjust to judge someone based on their physical appearance. As for your job situation, could you consider online freelancing or part-time roles relevant to your studies? They might be a good stepping stone for later full-time employment. Finally, it might be beneficial to seek support from a mental health professional who can provide coping mechanisms for dealing with your feelings and the stresses you are facing. Remember, there’s always help and hope. You're stronger than you believe!	2	0	0	0.0006597638130187988	social media

Regarding your job loss, remember that just because you lost a job, it doesn't define your worth or competence. It could be due to circumstances beyond your control. As difficult as it may seem, try to frame it as a chance to step back, reassess your goal, and perhaps even find something better.

In terms of your appearance, I know society tends to put emphasis on a particular beauty standard, but this doesn't reflect everyone's taste or views. Beauty does come in all forms and we all have our unique set of qualities. The most important thing is to appreciate and embrace your unique traits. The dissatisfaction you feel about your appearance is likely a product of societal pressure, but remember, society doesn't define your value or worth.

As for your relationship with your mom, it's really tough when those close to us cause distress. It might be useful to have an open conversation with her about how her comments affect you. If that isn't an option, seeking support from outside sources like friends, other family members, or even professional counselors can be helpful.

It sounds like you might benefit from speaking with a mental health professional about some of these issues, especially if you're having trouble eating or if you're spending a lot of time watching series online as an escape from reality. They can provide you with strategies and support to better cope with your feelings.

In the meantime, taking care of your physical health can have a positive impact on your mental state. Try to eat a balanced diet, keep a regular sleep schedule, and incorporate some physical exercise into your daily routine. Please remember, you're not alone and there are people who care! Keep reaching out for help, it shows strength and self-awareness. You're doing a great job just by seeking advice. Stay strong."	2	0	0	0.0008178353309631348	mental health forum

I want to remind you that your worth is not determined by your job or by societal standards of beauty. You are valuable and deserving of love and respect, just as you are.

As for your mother, it can be painful when the people we care about most don't support us. It's important to remember that her actions reflect her own insecurities, and not your worth. Finding a way to kindly but assertively express your feelings to her might be helpful. It might not change her behavior, but being able to assert yourself can be empowering.

For your mental health, consider finding a supportive community online or in person, such as this one, where you can express your feelings and receive validation. It might also help to establish a routine, which can create a sense of normalcy and control in a chaotic situation.

Also, it might be beneficial to seek professional help if it's available and affordable in your situation. A mental health professional could provide guidance and coping strategies during this difficult time.

Lastly, it's okay to take time for self-care. Rather than viewing watching series online as an escape, try to see it as allowable downtime for your mental health. However, it's also important to balance this with other activities, such as exercise, hobbies, or spending time with friends, in order to maintain overall well-being.

Remember, it's okay to ask for help, and you're not alone in your struggles. Many people experience these feelings, especially in difficult times. You're stronger than you think, and you can overcome these challenges."	2	0	0	0.0008829236030578613	forum with demographics

I'm a 21y/o girl from a south asian country."	"Hello there, 

Firstly, I want to say I'm sorry to read about the challenges you're currently experiencing. Your feelings are valid, and it’s clear you're dealing with a lot right now. 

Remember, being unemployed is not a reflection of your worth. Many people are experiencing job loss, especially now, and it's important not to internalize it. Searching for jobs while being a student is, indeed, very difficult. I encourage you to be patient. Focus, instead, on honing your skills and learning new ones. Job security fluctuates; your knowledge and abilities are your long-term assets.

Your beauty and the color of your skin do not determine your ability and worth. Know that people's standards of beauty differ worldwide. And, beauty is ultimately subjective; it’s important to embrace your uniqueness and love yourself regardless of societal expectations.

It hurts when those closest to us contribute to our insecurities. It might be helpful to have an honest, open conversation with your mom. She might not even realize how her words are affecting you.

Reach out to your school. They should have resources available to support mental health, and may also assist you with job placement.

Lastly, remember that although it's an escape, watching series all day isn’t healthy. Maybe you could consider establishing a daily routine that involves physical exercise, healthy eating, social interactions, and sleep. Small, achievable changes can make a big difference in overall well-being.

Remember you're not alone in this struggle; many people are dealing with similar issues. You're stronger than you think and reaching out for help shows your courage. I believe in you. Be proud of who you are and be patient with yourself through this hardship. You are so much more than external appearance, and remember, things will get better.

Take care and don't hesitate to reach out if you need someone to talk to.

"How does one cope with crisis after crisis?

I’m tired. So tired that I seem strangely calm. 

I hate my life. Because it’s nothing but pain and suffering. I’m an average person who has been tested way beyond my limits, with no reprieve, no breaks, no appreciation. 

In the last decade I’ve realized, slowly, that my life is not mine at all. None of my talents, interests, aspirations, hopes, actually matter. I’m merely place on earth to deal with my family. And despite all my efforts, life places me exactly where I should be - the middle-aged spinster daughter of a Chinese family. 

I’m freaked out right now because my mother is suddenly unwell. Whilst merely looking at symptoms it’s hard to say what is wrong - she said she felt an unsettled tummy and felt bloated. Then we had to attend a funeral and on the way home she threw up (my uncle was driving us home, and admittedly the car ride was inducing carsickness even in me). 

My fear roots from the matter that she had cancer like 16 years ago. 

I’m trying not to over react. I know that sometimes people have upset stomaches. The weather is bizarrely hot where I am (over 33c) and I myself feel sluggish. That the carsickness might have caused the vomiting. 

She’s now napping. We have a doctor’s appt in the evening. I’m trying to stay calm. I’m trying to disregard all my feelings, because no one cares about how I feel. It’s always about someone else - my father, my disabled family member, my mother. Never me."	Hey there, it sounds like you're carrying an incredibly heavy load, emotionally and mentally, and it's normal to feel overwhelmed. Try to remember, it’s okay not to be okay sometimes. Take it one day at a time, one crisis at a time. It's great that you're aware about not overreacting. It can be hard to differentiate between rational concern and anxiety-predicted worst case scenarios. Don't disregard your feelings; they're valid. Do what you can, when you can - you've got a doctor's appointment for your mom - so that's a positive step you've taken. Take care of your mental health - turn to friends, groups, or even therapy to vent your feelings without judgment. All this will help in coping, one step at a time. 💪 You're strong, remember that! 💓	1	0	0	0.0007544755935668945	social media

Experiencing one crisis after another can be incredibly draining, and it's completely valid to feel overwhelmed, scared and even resentful. 

Something that is vitally important in such a situation, and oftentimes overlooked, is self-care. You mentioned feeling like you're only there for your family, but remember, you have to take care of yourself in order to be able to take care of others. The feeling of self-neglect can lead to high levels of stress and anxiety which can also manifest as physical health issues. 

Engage in activities that you love, embrace your talents and hobbies. Try to dedicate even a small period of your day to something you enjoy or to simply rest. Practicing mindfulness, even for a few minutes a day, can help reduce stress too. 

When it comes to your mother's health, try not to fear the worst immediately. Medical advancements have been remarkable over the past decade, and even if it was something serious (which it may very well not be), there are many treatments available. It's good that you're already going to see a doctor; keeping open lines of communication with healthcare professionals is crucial during these times. 

Finally, if it's available and you're open to it, consider seeking external support, like therapy. An impartial mental health professional can provide invaluable techniques and strategies to navigate and cope with periods of high stress.

Remember, it's okay to take a step back. It's okay to prioritize your mental health. Wishing you strength and peace during this difficult time."	1	0	0	0.0007132887840270996	mental health forum

I see you, and you absolutely matter. I want to say how incredibly strong you are for stepping up, carrying the weight of these pressures, and still trying to move forward.

It's understandable that your mother's recent bout of illness triggered concerns and fears, given her past medical history. The connection you're making is natural. And while it's crucial to get her checked, remember that our minds can also be quick to jump to worst case scenarios in times of overwhelming stress.

Regarding your sense of becoming invisible while doing your part in your family, I believe it's a narrative seen frequently in Chinese culture, where traditional expectations can designate the obligation for caregiving. I would not have the audacity to tell you that you can shrug off this ingrained sense of duty. However, I'd urge you to understand that it's *okay* to prioritize your mental health. It's essential to your overall wellbeing and resilience.

Please remember that while you're in this role, you are more than 'a middle-aged spinster daughter.' You are a unique individual with your strengths, interests, aspirations, and feelings. It may feel like your world is shrinking around these responsibilities, but you are most certainly not alone in experiencing this struggle. 

Talking with a mental health professional could provide a safe space for you to explore and heal from these feelings, as well as develop coping strategies to deal with this constant stress. It could also be helpful to join support groups with people in similar situations. Knowing that there's a community of people who understand what you're going through can be incredibly comforting.

Remember, it's alright to step back and just breathe once in a while, and always remember that you matter just as much as the people you're caring for. You're stronger than you know. Here for you."	1	0	0	0.0010085701942443848	forum w/o demographics
"Hey Reddit,

I'm (28F) an American living in Europe I won't say where for anonymity. I met my husband (30M) during the pandemic and when restrictions were lifted I made the journey to meet him. We were smitten, and I moved over and we now have a child. My mother (55F) tries to come over several times a year to come see me and our little one. She usually stays about a Month. Which is great when it comes to quality time with her grandchild, but our relationship is quite tumultuous.

I grew up in a very authoritarian single parent household. My mother is misogynistic, has never been financially stable, and doesn't align in the same political opinions of either of her children. Growing up she forced us to go to a very toxic ""Church"" who labeled me a ""Bad seed"". She even at one point threatened to kick me out over not wanting to attend once I turned 18. I could go on and on about that Church, but that's another story. She was also very harsh with her punishments. Including taking our doors for several months when I was a teen, my door knob so I wouldn't lock my doors, and grounded me from going outside or seeing my friends besides at school for 6 months. She is very impulsive as well, often changed jobs, would constantly have us move houses or go back to live with our grandparents. Which honestly was our saving grace for alot of my childhood. And she is a very argumentative and basically always wants to talk about conservative politics even knowing I've asked her to try not to bring up these topics as it is harming our relationship. She is a very loving mother and I know she does love and wants the best for me. I'm also aware I need therapy.

The problem I'm having is she told me recently she was going to work on her career (which I will also not divulge) towards moving here for work. She wants to live closer and maybe even eventually live with us. Our relationship is very complicated, but I love her and want her to be happy. I just would rather have our relationship still be at a distance. I know I can't control her actions, but how do I tell her I'd rather her not try to come and live with my family. My husband would also not like this. 

So Reddit what do you think?

It sounds like you're dealing with a lot. It's good that you've been able to put up with it for so long and are seeking therapy. In dealing with your mom, it might be best to make it about you rather than her. State what's best for your mental health and sanity, and what's most beneficial for your family. Reiterate that as much as you love her, you need space and boundaries for the sake of a healthy relationship. In reassuring her about your love, you can try mentioning that you will try to provide her with as much support as possible from a distance. Last but not least, you could suggest alternatives, like longer overseas visits or video calls to keep her connected with the grandchild. 

Take care of yourself and stand your ground. Good luck!

TD;LR: Make the conversation about what's good for you and your family rather than directly against her. Suggest alternatives for her connection with the family from a distance. It's all about setting healthy boundaries!"	1	0	0	0.0009400248527526855	social media

This truly sounds like a tough situation and I empathize with you deeply. From your story, it's clear you're dealing with a challenging predicament. Here's how I suggest you could softly approach your mother:

Firstly, make it about your own feelings and concerns rather than her behavior. Express how much you value your independence and the peaceful life you and your husband have built together in Europe. 

Secondly, whenever people contemplate big decisions such as relocating, they usually weigh the pros and cons. You might consider sharing your concerns and uncertainties about this move, saying that you're not sure how it will impact your life, your husband's and your child's well-being.

Thirdly, reassure her that despite the geographical distance, you will make utmost efforts to ensure that she is still a part of your lives. You could emphasize your commitment to regular communication, video calls, and visits (when possible). Talk about how you cherish the visits she already makes and how much those mean to your family.

And lastly, remember to show love and respect for your mother throughout this conversation. Your message might be easier for her to process if she understands that it's coming from a place of love for your own family's wellbeing.

Remember to stay strong. You're entitled to set boundaries for the health of your own family. Best of luck.

It certainly sounds like you're navigating a tricky emotional situation. I'm glad you've reached out and acknowledged your need for support. It's okay to want space and boundaries in your life, even when it comes to family. Here's a potential approach to communicating your needs: 

1. **Use ""I"" statements to express your feelings:** This helps to deescalate conflict, because you're not directly blaming her. You might say ""Mom, I feel stressed and overwhelmed at the thought of us living so close together.""

2. **Be assertive but gentle:** Standing up for your needs is necessary, but it doesn't have to involve being harsh or aggressive. Gently make your points, acknowledging her feelings as well.

3. **Address it as a family decision:** You could say, ""My husband and I have decided we need our space. We wanted to tell you this as it impacts our family dynamics."" By including your partner, it presents a united front and takes some pressure off you.

4. **Be clear about your boundaries:** It's critical for you to establish what you can and can't tolerate. Make sure to set clear boundaries about visits, how much time you want to spend together, and topics you're comfortable discussing.

5. **Encourage her independence:** Assert that while you appreciate her love and her desire to be close, your family needs its own space to grow and thrive, just like she does.

6. **Suggest alternatives:** Could she visit more frequently, instead of moving?

Lastly, remember that this is a process and might not all be resolved in one conversation. It would help if you could access therapy to further explore these issues, and perhaps even consider family therapy with your mother. This could offer a safe space to discuss your history, current dynamics, and future expectations. 

Good luck and be patient with yourself and others during this time."	1	0	0	0.0010981559753417969	clinician
"Hey Reddit,

I'm (28F) an American living in Europe I won't say where for anonymity. I met my husband (30M) during the pandemic and when restrictions were lifted I made the journey to meet him. We were smitten, and I moved over and we now have a child. My mother (55F) tries to come over several times a year to come see me and our little one. She usually stays about a Month. Which is great when it comes to quality time with her grandchild, but our relationship is quite tumultuous.

I grew up in a very authoritarian single parent household. My mother is misogynistic, has never been financially stable, and doesn't align in the same political opinions of either of her children. Growing up she forced us to go to a very toxic ""Church"" who labeled me a ""Bad seed"". She even at one point threatened to kick me out over not wanting to attend once I turned 18. I could go on and on about that Church, but that's another story. She was also very harsh with her punishments. Including taking our doors for several months when I was a teen, my door knob so I wouldn't lock my doors, and grounded me from going outside or seeing my friends besides at school for 6 months. She is very impulsive as well, often changed jobs, would constantly have us move houses or go back to live with our grandparents. Which honestly was our saving grace for alot of my childhood.

TD;LR: My mother told me of her 5 year plan to come live near me. We have a very complicated relationship where I would rather us stay at a distance. How do I tell her gently?"	"Hi there,

It seems like you're dealing with a challenging situation here. Balancing the need for personal space with the need to maintain familial relationships, especially ones that have complex emotional ties, is never easy.

First, take a moment to acknowledge your feelings and concerns. Your apprehension and discomfort about this decision is completely valid, considering your past experiences with your mother and your current relationship with her. 

In terms of communicating your feelings to your mother, be as honest, direct and compassionate as possible. Using 'I' statements can be effective in conveying your thoughts without making it seem like an attack on her. For example, you could say: ""Mom, I appreciate your desire to be close with us and play an important role in our child's life. However, I have some concerns about us living too close together. The distance has allowed us to maintain a healthier relationship, and I worry it could become strained if we live in closer proximity. I value our relationship and think it would be best for us to continue how we have been.""

Remember, it is okay to prioritize your mental health and the well-being of your family. You are right in understanding that you cannot control her actions, but setting clear boundaries is crucial for your peace of mind. Lastly, as you have pointed out, seeking therapy can be immensely helpful in dealing with such issues. Therapists can provide strategies and tactics that are tailored to your situation.

Best of luck!"	1	0	0	0.0009441971778869629	forum with demographics

Navigating difficult family relationships can be really challenging, but remember that it is crucial to prioritize the wellbeing of yourself and your family.

Firstly, consider seeking therapy as you've mentioned it yourself. A professional can provide guidance on how to establish boundaries and navigate your dynamics with your mother more effectively.

When telling your mother about your feelings, think about using ""I statements"". Instead of saying ""You make it difficult for us to live in the same house,"" say ""I feel anxious at the thought of us living in the same house due to our past."" This focuses on your feelings and experience, reducing the likelihood of your mother feeling attacked.

Set firm boundaries and be clear about what you expect from her. Try to be consistent in your words and actions to avoid confusion.

Remember that your feelings are valid. Balancing the needs of your immediate family (you, your husband, and your child) and the relationship with your mother is not easy. It might be beneficial to find a local support group or forum to gain insight from others who have been through similar experiences. 

I hope this helps, and I wish you the best."	1	0	0	0.0008657574653625488	forum w/o demographics
"so i had recently told my parents about the fact that i drink socially. my mom was not okay with it and she kept overthinking over it for months. i came back to home from college and my mom was constantly talking about drinking drinking and drinking calling me a drunkard and what not, inspite of it being pretty much controlled and moderated on my end.

my dad was initially okay with this but mom kept provoking him to DO SOMETHING about it. then my dad’s ego triggered and he’s a narcissist and he asked me to cancel my flight tickets back to college or he will break my mac. i canceled the tickets but asked my bf for some money and booked fresh ones for today. dad asked me to show the bank details for who paid and i cant show because they are also not okay with me having a boyfriend. so i kept begging them to just leave it and let me go. if he got to know about the bf he would abuse him or beat him up like he did to my last bf. i was scared. i just wanted to take my flight for today and leave. he threatened to break my phone so i ran from home. he locked my mac in an almirah. he tracked me down hunted me and brought me back home, again asking for bank details. i didn’t share. i booked cab so that i can leave for airport. after the cab came, he threatened me that if i sit in the cab, he will do something reallly realllyy bad. i begged him. he pulled me. and threw my luggage outside the cab. brought me back home. told me i will never go back to college. i cried and begged to let me catch my flight. he told my how i was sooo wrong to have the audacity to book the flight and an uber all whilst he was against it. i said i am sorry to cater to his narcissistic ego. i cried to just let me go. he said ill stay, show him the bank details tomorrow and then leave after 10 days. i didn’t want to show the bank details. i asked him to pls understand, it’s private. he said what private? wtf are u hiding from me? he slapped me. i went to my room started crying. he locked my laptop and phone in an almirah and locked me in another room. i kept crying then my aunt knocked. i told her everything about why i cant show the bank details etc. she said she will try convincing them. she went and talked to them and told them that she thinks whatever is in the statements is fine. she asked them to trust her and let me go. they said fine- they will not check my statements and i can only go after 10 days. then i didn’t go for my flight and stayed against my will. today they stealthily took my passbook and they have gone to the bank to get the statement’s printed . once they get to know about my bf they are going to do the same thing to him, abuse him on call, they will also abuse me and enforce a break up and they will threaten him that if he keeps any contact with me, they will screw him and his family over. and they are also not booking my flight tickets for after 10 days as of now, saying they will see. i don’t want to stay here. i want to run away to college. my dad is a narcissist and mom has some other issues in which she gets sadistic pleasure everytime i am hurting because she thinks i am learning a lesson for drinking. i dont know what to do. should i file a complaint? but i am not financially independent yet. should i call women’s rights (i am based in india btw). or should i just live with it?"	"I'm truly sorry to hear you're going through this. It's very difficult to go through such family issues. If you feel unsafe at all, it's important to seek help. While I'm not an expert, here's what you could potentially do:

1. Seek Support: Reach out to friends, professors, or counselors at college who may help. They could potentially provide resources or support.
2. Legal Advice: Consult a women's rights organization or a lawyer. They should be able to better assist you in understanding your legal rights and steps you can potentially take, such as potentially placing a restraining order.
3. Financial Independence: Start working towards financial independence by seeking a part-time job or scholarship. This isn't a quick solution, but will serve you in the long run.
4. Hotline: There are many hotlines for women in distress in India, like Women's helpline 181, Bharosa, and others. Use these, they are there for you.

Remember, your rights and safety are important. Don't ever let anyone make you feel otherwise. Stay strong, you're not alone."	2	0	0	0.001125037670135498	social media

"I'm really sorry to hear you're having to deal with such a difficult situation. Your feelings and experiences are valid. It's crucial that your safety is prioritized, and it sounds like both your mental and physical well-being are at risk. I'd encourage you to reach out to local resources. You might consider contacting women's rights organizations, social service entities, or even police if you feel safe in doing so. I'm not sure of your age, but if you're an adult, your parents do not have the right to control you in this way. 

If it's within your capability, starting to work towards financial independence can be a powerful tool for your future. This might mean getting a part-time job or seeking scholarships and grants for your college education. Remember it may take time, so be patient with yourself.

You also mentioned drinking socially. It's completely normal for young adults to explore their boundaries, but always remember to keep it within limits for your own well-being.

The most important step is to remove yourself from this harmful situation. Reach out to close friends, other family members, or a counselor/therapist if you're able to. Hold on, and remember that things can get better with time and effort."	2	0	0	0.0015473365783691406	mental health forum

I'm really sorry to hear you're experiencing this. It sounds incredibly difficult and overwhelming, and no one should have to go through this. It's important to remember that you have rights, and abusive behavior is not okay. I would recommend reaching out to local authorities or a domestic abuse hotline to discuss options for your safety. It's best to speak to professionals who can provide you with practical, contextual support. Whether you decide to make a report is entirely your choice, but reaching out to support may provide you with some clarity and guidance. Additionally, please consider looking at resources for emotional support - consider local helplines or support groups for individuals who are also experiencing similar struggles. You might, when possible, also explore ways to become financially independent, such as jobs, internships or scholarships. Please remember, it's important to ensure your wellbeing, and it's okay to ask for help. You don't have to go through this alone.	2	0	0	0.0009156465530395508	clinician

You're right, some of the actions you've described from your parents are not okay and are abusive. It's vital that your safety comes first - no matter what.

If you think you are in immediate danger or being threatened, it's okay to contact the authorities. In India, there are various organizations that are available for you to talk to, even anonymously if you prefer - consider reaching out to organizations such as National Commission for Women or Childline (if you're under 18), they are trained to help in these circumstances. 

Many colleges also have support systems in place for students experiencing difficult family situations. Reach out to a counselor or advisor, they usually have resources available for you, they might also be able to provide some kind of financial support or advice. As a student, there are often grants or scholarships that you might be eligible for. 

Additionally, consider talking to trusted friends, professors or advisors about your situation - building a support system can be instrumental in times like this. They may be able to provide you with support, opportunities, or advice. 

Remember, you have every right to your privacy and personal boundaries, these are important and should be respected. You're not alone in this, the first step is reaching out, and you've done that here. We're all here to help."	2	0	0	0.0011255145072937012	forum with demographics

"Sorry to hear that you're going through such a difficult situation. Of course, it's important to get professional advice before taking any steps, but I can certainly relay some options you might consider. If you feel you're in immediate danger, please contact local law enforcement. They are trained to handle situations like this. If physical or emotional abuse is prominent, consider notifying local women's rights groups. They are there to support individuals in situations like yours and they might be able to provide the help that you need.

Considering you're still in college, you may have access to free or inexpensive mental health resources. Reach out to your college's student health center or counselor’s office about your situation. They may be able to provide some additional guidance or resources to support you.

If your situation allows, seek employment or an internship. This can help with financial independence and potentially provide you an opportunity to move out.

Your safety, health, and mental wellbeing are most important. Make sure to prioritize them. Even though you're based in India, there are global organizations as well that can help with domestic abuse, mental health, and more. Stay strong and reach out to available help. You're not alone in this.

During the last 16 years of my parents’ marriage, my dad has been paranoid and jealous of my mom even though she’s the breadwinner and he barely works. Yesterday was the last straw when my mom was working at the nail salon and my dad accused my mom of cheating, saying that “the nail salon closed a long time ago”. To which my mom called her coworkers and showed camera footages for proof, but he refused to look or listen. Last night, he terrorized my mom and gave us until Sunday to move out of the house that my mom paid for. What could I do in this situation? Who can I report this to and what evidences would I need?	In a difficult situation like this, you may want to first get in touch with domestic abuse hotlines or local law enforcement for advice, as it sounds like your mom may be dealing with verbal and emotional abuse. You might also want to consider reaching out to a legal advisor for information about your mother's rights, especially regarding the house. Remember to carefully document each incident as this can play a crucial role in legal procedures. Include dates, times, places, and details about what happened. Your mom’s co-workers’ statements and the camera footages can be an additional layer of proof that she was indeed at work. Stay strong and be supportive towards your mom, she needs it the most right now. Sending positive vibes and strength to you and your mom.	0	0	0	0.0007873773574829102	social media
During the last 16 years of my parents’ marriage, my dad has been paranoid and jealous of my mom even though she’s the breadwinner and he barely works. Yesterday was the last straw when my mom was working at the nail salon and my dad accused my mom of cheating, saying that “the nail salon closed a long time ago”. To which my mom called her coworkers and showed camera footages for proof, but he refused to look or listen. Last night, he terrorized my mom and gave us until Sunday to move out of the house that my mom paid for. What could I do in this situation? Who can I report this to and what evidences would I need?	"I'm really sorry to hear you're going through all of this, it sounds incredibly tough. It might be best to reach out to local law enforcement and provide them with any evidence you have, such as camera footage or even witnesses who can confirm what's happening. A lawyer could also provide additional guidance for safeguarding the house and your mother's rights. 

In terms of evidence, generally speaking, written or recorded evidences of threats/abuse, proof of the ownership of the house (if your mom indeed is the one who paid), proofs of his baseless accusations (such as camera footages of the salon) would typically be useful. A journal of the incidences can be help too. 

Simultaneously, contact local organizations that offer counseling and assistance for domestic abuse situations. These organizations can walk you through the process of collecting evidence and directing it to appropriate legal channels. 

Remember, your safety and your mom's safety are paramount. If you feel immediate threat, don't hesitate to call emergency services in your location and get to a safe location. Don't forget to get psychological support for yourself too, as this is a difficult situation to navigate."	2	0	0	0.001017153263092041	mental health forum

"I'm really sorry to hear that you're experiencing this. It sounds like a very stressful situation for you and your mother. As a mental health clinician, I'd suggest that the priority here is to make sure you and your mom are safe. Contact your local authorities or police if you genuinely feel that your safety or your mother's safety is at risk. 

Consider reaching out to your local domestic violence agency. They can provide you with information about obtaining a restraining order, if necessary, as well as other resources and supports. Evidence-wise, any kind of physical or electronic documentation of threats or violent behavior could be helpful - text messages, emails, voicemails etc. You could also keep a log of incidents that include dates, times, and a description of what happened. Remember, third-party witnesses can be valuable too, so consider sharing your experiences with trusted friends or family.  

Empower yourself by understanding your rights. A consultation with an attorney who specializes in family law might also be beneficial so you and your mom can know more about the rights and privileges afforded to you in this situation. 

Lastly, don't forget to care for your own mental health during this time. Reaching out to a therapist or counselor can provide an emotional outlet and resources to help you cope. You're not alone in this. Please reach out to the appropriate authorities if you feel unsafe. In the meantime, know that there are resources and individuals available, willing, and capable of offering you support."	2	0	0	0.000782012939453125	clinician

"I'm really sorry to hear about what you and your mom are going through. This sounds like a very difficult and stressful situation. First, your safety and your mom's safety should be the highest priority. If you feel in immediate danger, don't hesitate to call the Police. 

You also should try to document everything - write down or record these situations if it is safe to do so. This can act as evidence if you need to show someone at a later date. For legal advice, you could reach out to a family law attorney who could advise on possible options and next steps. 

Furthermore, consider reaching out to local domestic violence nonprofits that can provide advice, emotional support and practical help. They may be able to help with temporary accommodation if your mom needs to move out. 

Online counseling can also be a good option for both of you to help cope with the emotional trauma and stress. In the meantime, lean on your friends and family for support and to discuss your feelings. You're not alone - remember that there are organizations and resources out there for people in your situation."	2	0	0	0.0007829666137695312	forum with demographics

If you're comfortable with it, reaching out to local law enforcement may be an immediate step you can take. Explain the situation and ask about possible restraining orders. In terms of evidence, any texts, voicemails or any record of his threats would be beneficial. 

You might also consider contacting a domestic violence hotline for advice on these situations. You need to ensure that you, your mom, and other family members are safe. Consider reaching out to a licensed counselor or therapist to talk through these issues; they can provide beneficial strategies to cope with this stress.

I'd also advise trying to gather financial records of payments your mom made towards the house, as these can support her case if needed. It's quite likely the house could be considered as her property if she's been the one primarily paying for it.

Remember, your safety and emotional wellbeing is the most important thing right now. I'm wishing you all the strength and courage. Hang in there."	2	0	0	0.0008773207664489746	forum w/o demographics

"24 f here,I feel like I hate my life. I've never had a serious relationship and I've never kissed a guy,I'm a virgin. This year it finally hit me how for the last 4 years my mental health was in shambles. I still live at home with my parents, because I was studying till last year and still working on my career and am not financially capable enough to move out-plus I'm Asian so it's not even considering very bad for me to still be living at home.
I'm not even confident enough to drive by myself, I'm full of self-doubt and the past 2 years I just experienced such self loathing thoughts,I'm an introvert, was a really shy kid,and I hate this about my personality, I've always wished I was different, was an extrovert but the last 2 years,these thoughts were so amplified,it made me really dislike myself and dislike so many parts of my personality-I'm a people pleaser and feel like such a pushover,all I could think over the last 2 years was,wow I'm such a loser,doormat,not confident enough to drive,and I don't even have a career or am smart enough to find a job,still living at home,plus I'm fat and ugly-
yes on top of all this,I grew up fat,I managed to lose some weight over the last 1.5 years,but I've always been insecure because of this as well and heard things like you'd look nicer if you lost weight or you'll find a guy if you lost weight as a teenager and at 18 a guy even told me you'd look better if you lost weight-really made me believe I wasn't good enough and made me all the more closed of to guys and dating in the past 4 years.
Also,because of my awkward,quiet nature,I was unable to form a proper concerte friendship in college,despite being in college for 5 years. Isn't that so abnormal? A young person who has no proper friend from college? 
This made me dislike myself a lot more last year and really made me feel like had I been not me,had I been a non-awkward extrovert I wouldn't have this problem. 
I'm finally starting to realize just how much in shambles my mental health has been for the past,especially 4 years,and I hate it. Feels like I lost a part of my life,and as a result of which I ignored my dating life and even college social life for the past few years.
I just want to ask,is this normal? To be closed off socially due to shit,shit mental health.
Am I a loser because I haven't kissed anyone at this age where even 17 year olds are having sex? Also,I'm not one to hookup,or have casual sex,I'd prefer a genuine relationship,iam already self conscious and really awkward, is this another factor that is going to make things harder for me,dating wise?
Am I a complete weirdo or outcast because of this or am I doomed to be alone because of this?
Also,since I've just realized these things,as of now my priority is to just work on getting my career sorted, and to better my mental health and make a few new friends,join the gym and focus on my physical health as well-I don't want to prioritize dating as of now after the realization of how trash my mental health was.
Is that the right thing to do? 
Idk why,I feel like if I de-prioritize dating any further, I'll just die alone with no sexual experience, and will just become a weird outcast and people my age will eventually settle down,be married,etc. and will be heavily judged for being xyz age and not having had a  proper relationship or experience with physical intimacy. 
Can anyone relate/understand?
I feel like I cannot share any of this with my closest friends because they won't really understand, and I don't want to share something and have my feelings be dismissed or invalidated.

Also,if you managed to read everything, thank you so much!"	"Hey there, sending lots of strength and positivity your way! 💪💖 It's absolutely okay to feel the way you're feeling. This journey is YOURS and everyone moves at their own pace. You're not weird or an outcast for being a virgin or for not having been in a relationship; there's no ""right"" age for these experiences to happen. If casual hookups aren't for you, stand by that choice. 

Now, it sounds like you're being overly harsh on yourself. We all have insecurities, but they needn't define us. Your worth is not determined by your relationship history or your physical appearance. That being said, prioritising your mental health and career right now is a mature decision. Also, it definitely doesn't mean that you'll end up alone! 

You're young and have plenty of time to embark on romantic relationships once you're in a better state of mind. You're dealing with a lot right now; don't rush yourself. It's completely fine to focus on your personal growth and achieving a healthy mental state. It's crucial to love and value oneself before entering a relationship.

Oftentimes, a good starting point is therapy or counselling to address the feelings of self-loathing and isolation you're experiencing. Remember, it's also okay to lean on your friends; everyone struggles, and no one will think less of you for sharing. Many can relate to what you're going through, you're not alone. 

Stick around on supportive platforms like this, where you can be open about your feelings without judgment. Keep evolving, learning, and prioritizing your own well-being. Good things will follow. Trust in your journey. 🌻🙌"	1	0	0	0.0009582638740539551	social media

Also,if you managed to read everything, thank you so much!"	"I'm really glad you reached out and put your feelings into words. That's a brave step and I want you to know that your self-reflection is an immense strength. 

Firstly, understand that we all develop at our own pace and comparing yourself to others will only feed into your insecurities. It's okay to not have had a relationship or sexual experience yet; your worth is not measured by these aspects.

When it comes to living with your parents, everybody's circumstances are different. There's no definitive age to move out, especially when considering different cultural contexts. Remember that you're working towards your career and flexibility can offer opportunities for growth during this stage.

Being introverted or shy isn't something to feel ashamed of. Introverts have unique strengths - being thoughtful, observant and empathetic are just a few examples. Remember to start appreciating your qualities instead of viewing them as shortcomings.

Regarding your weight, remember health is more important than appearances. If you are happy with your progress and feel healthier, that's all that matters. You do not exist to please anyone else's visual preferences.

Social anxiety isn't unusual. It's commendable that you are prioritizing your mental and physical health. Therapy could be a great step forward, and you might want to consider this.

As for your concern about dating, priorities change and evolve. It's okay to want to focus on yourself for a while. In time, you'll know when you're ready to explore that side of life. 

Remember that it's okay to not have everything figured out. It's okay to feel lost and unsure. What matters is your determined self-improvement journey. You are not alone in this and there's plenty of support available for when you're ready. Keep going, you're stronger than you realize.

Also,if you managed to read everything, thank you so much!"	"Hi there. Your feelings of struggle and self-doubt sound really tough, and it's brave of you to reach out for support like this. It seems you're dealing with a lot all at once: questions about your identity, your place in society, your lack of experience in romantic and sexual relationships, and feeling unsatisfied with your current circumstance. 

Firstly, everyone is different and moves at their own pace; there's no right or wrong timeframe for experiencing first kisses, relationships, or independent living. It's okay to feel the way you do, and you're not alone in experiencing these feelings, especially during such an uncertain time in your life. 

You've acknowledged the challenges with your mental health and the fact you're not in the position to prioritize dating right now which I think is a very wise decision. Taking the time to work on your career, creating a new routine, taking care of your physical and mental health, and trying to form new friendships indeed are major steps you're taking towards improving your well-being. 

It's also important to remember that while our societal norms often present one type of extroverted personality as ideal, there's value in being introverted too. Introverts often have deep thought processes, are great listeners and sensitive to others' needs, and these are valued qualities in friendships and relationships.

Finally, connecting with others who have had similar experiences and sharing your thoughts and feelings with them can often provide a great deal of reassurance and comfort. Don't hesitate to look for support groups or counselling services in your community as well. Online counselling and cognitive behavioral therapy may also be beneficial. 

It's not going to be an overnight change, but taking these steps to self-improvement and self-love is already a huge victory. Keep going, be gentle with yourself, and know that it's okay to seek professional help for guidance on your journey. Best of luck!"	1	0	0	0.0006658434867858887	clinician

I just want to ask,is this normal? To be closed off socially due to shit,shit mental health.
Am I a loser because I haven't kissed anyone at this age where even 17 year olds are having sex? Also,I'm not one to hookup,or have casual sex,I'd prefer a genuine relationship,iam already self conscious and really awkward, is this another factor that is going to make things harder for me,dating wise?
Am I a complete weirdo or outcast because of this or am I doomed to be alone because of this?
Also,since I've just realized these things,as of now my priority is to just work on getting my career sorted, and to better my mental health and make a few new friends,join the gym and focus on my physical health as well-I don't want to prioritize dating as of now after the realization of how trash my mental health was.
Is that the right thing to do? 
Idk why,I feel like if I de-prioritize dating any further, I'll just die alone with no sexual experience, and will just become a weird outcast and people my age will eventually settle down,be married,etc. and will be heavily judged for being xyz age and not having had a  proper relationship or experience with physical intimacy. 
Can anyone relate/understand?
I feel like I cannot share any of this with my closest friends because they won't really understand, and I don't want to share something and have my feelings be dismissed or invalidated.

Also,if you managed to read everything, thank you so much!"	"First of all, sending you a virtual hug. I wish I could instantly alleviate your pain, but please remember you're not alone in feeling this way. Many people have tormented themselves with self-deprecating thoughts and I want to assure you that you're not a 'weirdo' or 'loser' for experiencing them.

When it comes to relationships, please don't rush yourself. It's perfectly okay to not have experienced certain things yet. Everyone has a different timeline for their life, and it's not a competition. It’s also healthy for you to want a genuine connection rather than casual encounters.

Your decision to concentrate on personal improvement (career, health, relationships) is a commendable step towards self-acceptance and love. Healing is not a linear process and having patience with yourself is key.

When you begin to have a healthier relationship with yourself, it will reflect onto your relationships with others as well. You could consider a therapist or counselor for professional guidance if these thoughts become unbearable and you feel they are inhibiting your daily life.

Let’s not forget that Cosmo, Vogue and every Rom-Com on Netflix aren't the be-all and end-all. They set unrealistic expectations that can take a toll on your mental health. Just go at your own pace, life is not a race.

 Remember, you are more than your looks, more than a virgin or non-virgin, more than your quiet nature. You are a unique individual with so much potential and worth. It's okay to feel lost or confused, but you are not alone. You are capable and deserving of love, friendship, and success. Please remember this on your darker days. 

Also, when you're ready, try to open up to a close friend about your feelings - you might be surprised to find out how much they can relate or provide support. We're arching our backs under fires too, even if they look different from your own.

And lastly, remember that it's okay to ask for help, and it's okay to not have everything figured out yet. Each step towards improvement, no matter how small, is a huge achievement. You're strong for reaching out, and we are here for you.

Much love to you. if you need to talk further about anything, we're always ready to lend a listening ear."	2	0	0	0.0010066628456115723	forum with demographics
"24 f here,I feel like I hate my life. I've never had a serious relationship and I've never kissed a guy,I'm a virgin. This year it finally hit me how for the last 4 years my mental health was in shambles. I still live at home with my parents, because I was studying till last year and still working on my career and am not financially capable enough to move out-plus I'm Asian so it's not even considering very bad for me to still be living at home.
I'm not even confident enough to drive by myself, I'm full of self-doubt and the past 2 years I just experienced such self loathing thoughts,I'm an introvert, was a really shy kid,and I hate this about my personality, I've always wished I was different, was an extrovert but the last 2 years,these thoughts were so amplified,it made me really dislike myself and dislike so many parts of my personality-I'm a people pleaser and feel like such a pushover,all I could think over the last 2 years was,wow I'm such a loser,doormat,not confident enough to drive,and I don't even have a career or am smart enough to find a job,still living at home,plus I'm fat and ugly-
yes on top of all this,I grew up fat,I managed to lose some weight over the last 1.5 years,but I've always been insecure because of this as well and heard things like you'd look nicer if you lost weight or you'll find a guy if you lost weight as a teenager and at 18 a guy even told me you'd look better if you lost weight-really made me believe I wasn't good enough and made me all the more closed of to guys and dating in the past 4 years.
Also,because of my awkward,quiet nature,I was unable to form a proper concerte friendship in college,despite being in college for 5 years. Isn't that so abnormal? A young person who has no proper friend from college? 
This made me dislike myself a lot more last year and really made me feel like had I been not me,had I been a non-awkward extrovert I wouldn't have this problem.

Also,if you managed to read everything, thank you so much!"	"Hey there,

Firstly, I want to say that everything you're feeling is valid. Your emotions are real and no one should ever make you feel as if they aren't. It sounds like you've been going through an incredibly hard time and you've been very brave for sharing all this with us.

Let's start with the concept of normal. Normality varies widely and is more of a social construct than a definitive measure. What may seem normal to some may not to others. It is okay to have not kissed anyone yet, no matter your age. Similarly, there's no set timeline to move out, get a job, or find a significant other. You're not a weird outcast for where you currently stand in life.

While society often makes young people feel rushed to hit certain milestones, remember that life isn't a race and everyone follows their own path. It's completely okay to prioritize getting your career sorted, improving your mental health and making new friends. Also, joining the gym is a great decision! This will not only enhance your physical health but also works wonders for mental health.

In terms of dating, it's important to navigate relationships at a pace and with a mindset that feels right for you. If that’s not where your focus is right now, that's perfectly okay. There's no need to follow societal expectations of when and how to enter a romantic relationship. 

I would also like to suggest seeking professional help if you're comfortable with it. Therapists, counselors, and mental health professionals can provide you with tools and coping mechanisms to deal with self-loathing thoughts and promote a better self-image.

You're not alone in feeling like this. Many people have had similar experiences and feelings, and a lot of them are able to come out the other side feeling better about themselves. Stay strong—it's okay to give yourself time to grow and evolve at a pace that works for you. You're appreciated as you are!"	1	0	0	0.000818789005279541	forum w/o demographics
"so recently, I decided that I was going to be online full-time as a high school junior taking all college classes...due to my mental health. High school was just not for me. I've taken college classes since freshman year of high school, so I am very used to college courses. I personally prefer college courses over high school courses. I am starting on the 21st and today was my high school's first day. I loved online during Covid. I thought that I will like it even more now since I don't have to hop on Google meets.

but some thing about seeing all my classmates posting about their first day of school, makes me very sad for some reason. I didn't think that I would be this sad crying over the high school I hated so much. I'm not crying because I'm anxious over taking these college classes(which shouldn't be that hard because they are GenEds high school grad requirements). it feels like some part of me is missing. I know it's good for me that I am starting college early but some part of me is nervous that I won't have a social life. And yes, I knew what I was getting into with online, but I didn't expect it to be this sad, especially after my grandpa leaving. I've been feeling very lonely because he has been living with me for the last two months. And he was the only person I really talked to during the summer because my parents are usually working. he just always chitchat with me. there was really no one else. I didn't expect that to hit me and I feel very lonely and sad inside now that he left.

even when my parents are at work, I'm the only child, so it was just me myself and I. But with him visiting us for the summer, I felt like I finally had someone to talk to. But with him leaving, I have a hard time adapting to the lonely life I had before with no one to communicate with.

I plan on getting a job soon, so I hope that will keep me busy. It's just I was use to my grandpa being with me and I was also used to being in high school for seven hours each day. now that I am a college student with a lot of time on my hands, I feel that a part of me is missing.

I also have a very hard time adjusting to new changes. I know that online will be better for my mental health in the future. but there's just been a lot going on with my grandpa leaving and have my grandma just passed away. Since I am online, I could travel to my home country. But that is also a very big decision if I want to commit to staying there for a few months.

usually, I prefer not being in a classroom with 30 other people. I hated high school and that was the main reason why I switched to online. I felt the high school classes were difficult for absolutely no reason and the school system was not for me. I think I am more sad about being so use to my summer with my grandpa then about high school.
With starting college full-time I feel that I am somewhat of an adult. That I am no longer a kid and maybe that's why I'm feeling sad about high school. But that's just one of the small reasons why I'm feeling this way, but I think my social life is what I'm concerned with the most. And the college thing is just to pile on top of what is really the main reason.

my mom did ask if I wanted to travel to my home country which 98% of my family lives there. didn't really think about it and just said no because I thought that would be very inconvenient. but now I am considering it. And I never really spent time with my family in Vietnam that much. I haven't seen them for four years now.
Maybe that's why I am so sad about my grandpa leaving because I never felt so connected with a family member that was not my mom."	"Hey there, it sounds like you're going through a major life transition, which can understandably spark all kinds of emotions. There's immense pressure on the concept of 'high school years' being the best of your life, but everyone's journey is different. It's 100% okay to feel a sense of loss - about leaving high school and your grandpa's departure even if the logical part of your mind knows they're for the best. 

Consider joining online clubs/groups at your college, it can be a great way to find people who share your interests and create that social link you might be craving. It might also be worth looking into forms of therapy to process your feelings, they can provide useful tools for managing life changes. 

It's great that you're considering reconnecting with your family in Vietnam. It could provide a sense of familial connections and help alleviate some feelings of loneliness, and who knows, you might even be surprised at how much it can feel like home. Remember you're in control and it's ok to change your mind.

Hang in there, soldier. Change is hard, but also full of great potential and unforeseen adventures. Sending you all the good vibes. 🌼🌼🌼 Keep reaching out and keep talking about your feelings, you're definitely not alone in this.

"Firstly, let me say that the emotions you are feeling are valid and very normal. Embracing a new phase in life, such as going to college, can bring a wide range of emotions like excitement, anxiety, and in your case, feelings of sadness and loneliness. 

Missing your grandpa is completely natural. It sounds like you two bonded over the summer and it's normal to feel a void when someone you've grown close to has to leave. You might consider finding ways to keep in touch with him regularly, maybe through phone or video calls.

Starting with online classes doesn't mean you will lack social interaction. Yes, it can feel different than traditional face-to-face interaction but there are many ways to stay connected. You can join online clubs or forums, participate in class discussions, or even reach out to classmates who may also feel isolated and seek camaraderie in your shared situation.

When it comes to managing your emotions, practicing mindfulness techniques could be beneficial. These practices, such as meditation, deep breathing, and conscious awareness, may help calm your mind, manage your emotions, and bring you a sense of peace.

Considering the idea of connecting with your extended family in Vietnam could also be something to ponder more thoroughly. It could be an incredible opportunity to immerse yourself in a different culture and get to know your family better.

The flexibility of online learning could make it quite feasible to stay abroad for a prolonged period, taking this as a factor in your decision. It's good to think about what’s best for you in the short and long term, and which options align best with your goals. 

At times like this, it may help to consult a guidance counselor or mental health professional. They can provide emotional support, as well as practical advice for navigating these major life transitions.

Remember that these feelings will pass over time as you develop a new routine and find new methods to connect with others. You're embarking on an exciting stage in your life, and it's perfectly fine to feel somewhat overwhelmed at first. Best of luck on this new journey. You've got this!"	1	0	0	0.0006658434867858887	mental health forum

Firstly, I want to commend you for your ability to diligently take on college courses as a high school student. That's not an easy feat, and yet you're gracefully handling it. It's understandable to feel conflicted about leaving high school and the emotions that arise from seeing your peers' experiences. 

Missing the presence of your grandpa and feeling alone is a valid response. His company provided companionship, and that's a tough thing to lose. Maybe try to reserve some time every day or week to call him, this way sustain some of the bond you have built. 

Feeling like you've lost a piece of yourself by switching school environments and losing your companion - that's normal. Significant life changes can often cause us to mourn what was. Remember, it's okay to take some time to grieve, but also try to look at things from a different perspective. You may not be around your high school friends, but there are so many opportunities for meeting new people and making friends in an online environment as well. Maybe you could join a club or a study group? Having plans and engaging in various activities will often make the process of readjusting easier.

As for your concern about a lack of social life, I understand why that would worry you. Transitioning to online study can indeed feel isolating. But remember, social interactions are not only limited to in-person meetings. You can join online communities, virtual clubs, and even have remote study buddies. You can build a different, but still fulfilling, social life.

Lastly, regarding visiting Vietnam - I think it's a great idea. Family can provide a great deal of comfort and visiting them might help you process your feelings and reconnect with your roots. A change in location might also be rejuvenating and offer a fresh perspective.

Change is not easy, but it often leads us to places we never imagined we would journey to. It's okay to feel overwhelmed and unsure. Seek support, maintain connections and allow yourself to embrace the new chapter in your life with courage and confidence.

Take care."	1	0	0	0.0006436705589294434	forum w/o demographics
i’m currently on vacations and visiting cities filled with young people is my worst fear. I do not know why since i’m a young girl (20) but seing all of these people makes me feel very uneasy. The thing is that when a city is filled with average old people I’m complaining that there isn’t enough young adults and when there are plenty of young adults i’m almost shaking in fear. Hearing them laughing in groups while i’m walking alone in a country that isn’t even mine is killing me. help. The worst is that almost everybody is blonde with blue eyes wearing pastel colours while I’m a whole Asian girl wearing black from head to toe.	Hey there, it sounds like you might be dealing with a mix of social anxiety and feeling out of place. First of all, remember there's no right or wrong way to enjoy your travels. It's 100% okay to gravitate towards quieter spots. Try breaking down big spaces into smaller, manageable ones, or focus on details that interest you (architecture, history, cuisine) rather than on the crowd. As for the cultural shock, try not to stereotype. Not everyone with blonde hair and blue eyes wearing pastel is the same, just as not all Asian girls in black are alike. You have your own unique style which is fantastic! Embrace your uniqueness, because that's what makes you special. 😊 #LoveYourself	1	0	0	0.0015871524810791016	social media

I'm really sorry to hear you're going through such a tough time, but remember, it's okay to feel this way and there are many people who can relate to you. It seems like you're dealing with a significant amount of social anxiety. It's completely normal to feel a certain level of discomfort in unfamiliar environments, especially when cultural differences are apparent.

What could help is to try and shift your perspective a bit. Remember not to compare yourself to others; we all are unique and different in our own ways. Being an Asian girl wearing black among blondes and pastels, could be interpreted as you standing out uniquely.

Perhaps try starting small to ease your discomfort. Find places where you feel most comfortable and gradually spend more time in busier places. Additionally, finding activities that you enjoy might also help you connect with like-minded individuals, which could alleviate some of your anxiety.

Feel free to explore professional help, like talking to a therapist or counselor. They can guide you with coping strategies tailored specifically for you. Remember, it's okay to seek help and it doesn't make you weak or any less of a person.

Lastly, be patient with yourself. It's okay to be scared. And it's okay not to be okay. Take one day at a time and remember to breathe. Learning to feel comfortable in new environments takes time. Be gentle with yourself.

Take care and remember that you are not alone in how you are feeling."	2	0	0	0.0009916424751281738	mental health forum

"Hi, it's completely normal to feel uncomfortable or anxious when you're in unfamiliar places, especially when you feel you stand out from the crowd. It's a part of our survival instinct to feel more at peace when around familiar environments and faces, even if it sometimes doesn't make a lot of logical sense.

A few suggestions that might help: 

1. Do some deep-breathing exercises when you start to feel uneasy. Long, slow breaths in through the nose and out through the mouth can help calm your nervous system and make you feel more grounded and present. 

2. Find activities that you're interested in and join local groups if you can. It's a great way to meet new people and thus feel less isolated. 

3. Embrace your individuality. There's absolutely nothing wrong with being different — in fact, it can be empowering. 

4. Talk to a therapist about your feelings if it's possible. They might have techniques or coping mechanisms that can help you feel less anxious when you're in these situations.

Remember, it's entirely okay to have fears and anxieties; everyone does! The key is to recognize these fears but not let them control you. It does get better with time and experience. Be patient with yourself and take it one day at a time."	1	0	0	0.0008092522621154785	forum with demographics

It sounds like you're dealing with a complex set of emotions right now. Some of what you're describing seems like it could come from social anxiety, while experiencing racial demarcation can lead to an intense sense of unease and alienation. Both are real and can be very stressful, particularly when you're alone in a foreign country.

Being a young Asian female, you're already dealing with multiple layers of identity and difference, and it can sometimes seem like others are inherently more comfortable, happy, or 'at home' when it's not necessarily the case.

Remember that it's okay to feel out of place, and it's okay to feel a bit scared in unfamiliar situations engaged with unfamiliar people. Everyone feels like that to some extent—it just manifests differently in each of us.

Firstly, try to embrace your own individuality and feel proud of it, including your cultural background and clothing style. There isn't a certain standard or norm as to how a person should look, act or 'be' most especially you choose to express yourself with your fashion style.

Secondly, consider seeking out local events or groups where you might find other young adults who may share similar interests, regardless of their race. This might help you feel more at ease, and most importantly, it could help you to start establishing some connections in your current location.

Be kind and patient with yourself. Gradually push your comfort zone without forcing yourself into situations that make you overly uncomfortable. Recognize that everyone handles stress differently and it's okay to need time to yourself. If you notice your feelings of fear and anxiety becoming more overwhelming, consider seeking support from a mental health professional.

Remember, it's your journey and you are allowed to navigate it at your own pace. Please be gentle with yourself. Stay safe and wishing you well."	1	0	0	0.0011419057846069336	forum w/o demographics

God, why! But wait why do we HAVE to shave if we hate it so much. Let's be honest making ourselves go through hot wax and exorcist level yanking or bleeding to death while shaving is like self-torture just to look good (in the eyes of society). If it is that painful why do we make ourselves go through it? 

Did you see the movie Khiladi? The one where Akshay Kumar was seen flaunting his body hair. Wouldn't it be amazing if we saw women flaunting theirs too? 

Have you seen animals shave their body hair? There's a reason why we have body hair. It keeps mammals warm. It protects the body against trauma and also against ultraviolet damage. In human beings, specialized hairs such as eyelashes and hairs inside the nostrils and external ears afford some protection from the environment. Eyebrows prevent sweat from getting into the eyes. Scalp hairs may assist in stabilizing the temperature of the brain. Hairs can also excrete toxic substances like arsenic, and are thus of use in forensic medicines. As every dermatologist knows, the physiological functions of hairs are immeasurable.

We all go through puberty. Hairy or otherwise it's one's choice to either keep the hair on our body or not. Society or your friends can't shame you for your body hair. There is a reason why we were born with the same. It protects us from so many unimaginable things. Imagine not having eyelashes or nostril hair, then how will you survive the dust that affects your body? All I want to say is let's continue to break the barriers and show that beauty is diverse and you don't have to be a certain stereotype to be beautiful. 

When you look at the world, the world isn't just one palette. It's a rainbow. So, say goodbye to your inner critic and take a pledge to be kinder to yourself and others too.

-Debapriya, intern at u/just_lemmebe1"	"Hey Debapriya, it sounds like your frustration is something many can relate to. It's essential to keep in mind that beauty standards differ globally and are mainly crafted by society than any biological necessity. You're spot on about body hair, it exists for a reason and is purely natural. Flaunt that ethnic FIT you found for Diwali, sleeveless and hair full (if that's what you prefer) and make a statement.

Remember Akshay in Khiladi? Just like him, proudly displaying your body hair can pave the way for broader acceptance and help to challenge outdated beauty norms. Embrace your body hair if you so wish, or shave/wax if that is what makes you confident and happy.

Body hair isn't shameful to have, neither in public nor alone. Let’s champion diversity and redefine beauty, it's high time we did. Let's add more colors to our beauty-palette and make it as vibrant as a rainbow. Don’t let societal norms and expectations dictate how you present yourself. Embrace your uniqueness, love your body and shine bold and beautiful this Diwali.

-Debapriya, intern at u/just_lemmebe1"	"Hey there, Debapriya,

I 100% agree with your reflections and I believe many others reading this will as well. Beauty standards have been pressuring both men and women across cultures and societies. It's high time we make our own decisions based on what makes us happy and comfortable, rather than what's expected by societal norms.

Akshay Kumar in Khiladi did indeed pave the way for a dialogue around this subject matter, and why can't we have a range of expressions of beauty that includes all kinds of natural looks?

Your concern about the health benefits of hair is also valid. Our bodies are designed the way they are for a range of reasons, many protective or supportive of our overall well-being. The existence of body hair, from eyelashes to those elsewhere, serves various functions and it's essential that we value our bodies in their natural form. 

If you feel confident and beautiful in your sleeveless Kurti without going through the painful routine of shaving, then go ahead and rock it! Your comfort and satisfaction should always come first.

The world indeed is a diverse palette. Your words have power and can inspire so many out there who are hesitant to step outside the confines of societal beauty standards. Keep being you, keep empowering and most importantly, keep being kind to yourself and others.

Stay strong and shine on.

-Debapriya, intern at u/just_lemmebe1"	"Hi Debapriya, 

You've managed to bring forth some really great points in regard to societal standards of beauty, and I wholeheartedly agree with your perspective. The pressure of adhering to certain beauty norms can indeed feel a bit much at times, and it's a part of the conversation we all need to have more often.

Celebrating body hair is about celebrating our body in its natural state, and it's truly inspiring to see you speaking up against the unnecessary pressures we inflict upon ourselves. You've also made an important point about the physiological benefits of body hair, it does serve vital roles in our overall body function.

So, whether it's about choosing to wear that sleeveless Kurti without shaving, or loving yourself as you are, remember, it's all about you and your comfort, not about societal expectations. It's time to flaunt your confidence, not just your clothes. 

One's beauty is truly diverse and is not bound by stereotypes. And it's only when we acknowledge and appreciate this diversity that we can truly celebrate beauty in its many forms. 

Remember, it's not just about conforming or non-conforming to societal norms but about celebrating who we are, in our most authentic form. Continue to spread this message of acceptance and diversity, and hopefully, more people will resonate with it. 

Be kind to yourself and others, always. You're a unique individual with your own beauty, and that's absolutely worth celebrating.

Best,

-Debapriya, intern at u/just_lemmebe1"	"Hi Debapriya,

Thank you for your thoughtful post and the meaningful perspective you're bringing to the table about societal beauty expectations. You're completely right; dealing with the physical discomfort and potential health risks of hair removal can often feel like a great deal just to fit into a certain beauty standard.

Embracing our natural bodies and loving ourselves as we are is indeed a powerful act. Moreover, challenging societal norms and advocating for acceptance of all bodies, regardless of body hair, is also an essential mindset change needed in society. 

Remember, your body, your rules - you don't have to do something you aren't comfortable with. If you want to rock that sleeveless Kurti without shaving - go for it! Beauty comes in all forms, not just the ones dictated by societal norms. It’s how you feel about yourself that truly matters. 

You're making a great point about the functional aspects of our body hair too. We maintain our eyebrows, eyelashes, and other body hairs for many practical reasons beyond just aesthetic ones. The same way, the decision to keep or remove body hair should be a personal one, not forced upon us by societal pressure. 

Continue to voice these important topics, promote acceptance, and challenge beauty stereotypes. You're doing a great job, and your efforts at breaking barriers are appreciated! 

Keep being you, and never let anyone tell you that you're not beautiful just as you are!

Stay Strong!

-Debapriya, intern at u/just_lemmebe1"	"Hi Debapriya,
You've managed to touch on an issue so many people struggle with, particularly women of South Asian descent. So first, I'd like to say: You're on the right track, fiercely addressing the societal pressures on women to conform.

Why indeed should we cause ourselves discomfort or pain, through waxing or shaving, to fulfil societal expectations of how we 'should' look? Representation in media, such as the movie 'Khiladi' you mentioned, is so important because it breaks the stereotype, allowing body hair to be seen as natural, which can help encourage acceptance.

We all have different comfort levels with body hair, and that's okay. Pressures to look a certain way can be overwhelming, but the natural functions of body hair are indeed unique and important. Every individual should have the right to decide about their body hair as they see fit.

It's great that you're promoting self-love and body acceptance in such a progressive way. Encouraging everyone to 'break the barriers' and redefine what beauty means to them can lead towards a more inclusive and understanding society. Your statement should resonate with every young woman, regardless of their ethnic background. 

The world indeed isn't a singular palette, but a rainbow made up of diverse, unique individuals. Now, it's about empowering each other to embrace that diversity and celebrating our individuality.
Keep spreading the positive message - you're doing amazing, Debapriya!

"I don't have many friends, but I ended up being the odd one out of the only college class I have with them today. Met with a therapist I've been meeting for about a year for the last time today because I am getting too old for youth services and completed a transition. Went onto a poc discord channel for the first time in months and saw that a yt person was using that channel to interview poc about ""recognizing race with bad vision"" or smthn, and I realized almost nobody in that tiny toxic channel is actually black, just mostly other races who aren't happy with ""black people being the only race represented in poc"". One of two of my closest friends is a guy and my parents have taught me unconsciously that it is awkward, so I am ashamed, and my other closest friend has drifted away from me because she feels like she's ""been a bad influence"" (she hasn't).

The only things that made me more introverted are my insecurities. I need people to talk to but I guess I have too many boyish hobbies to relate to girls my age and am too weird to fit into my own race. I talk genuinely to friends about once a month and the rest is spent being in isolation or being an odd one out.

Knowing who you are, being secure and confident in that, matters- doesn't matter what your race, interests or hobbies are. Gender norms shouldn't dictate what your hobbies should be and everyone moves at their own pace when it comes to making friends. They are hard to come by, but not impossible. Try to be patient and kind to yourself - it's okay to feel the way you do. Find hobbies that interest you and it's more than likely you'll find others with similar interests there. Sometimes we find our closest friends in the most unexpected places. It's important to remember that you ARE enough, just as you are. 🤗💪🙏💖	2	0	0	0.000735938549041748	social media

(I'll delete if offensive in any way)"	"Hi, it sounds like you're going through a rough patch. School transitions and changes in treatment services can be challenging. It seems you are also dealing with some struggles related to identity and feeling like you fit into certain groups, be they racial, gender, or hobby-related. It's common to face such struggles, so please note that you're not alone.

Though I can't be there to provide as much support as a mental health professional can, here are a few suggestions. Firstly, continue reaching out for support in online communities like this Reddit. You might find others who are going through or have been through similar circumstances and can offer empathy and guidance. Secondly, consider finding groups or clubs within or outside of school related to your interests. This can help you meet a more diverse group of people who share your hobbies.

You've mentioned a history of working with a therapist. If that has been helpful for you, it might be a good idea to seek out adult counseling or therapy services. It could be beneficial to talk about these thoughts and feelings in a safe, therapeutic setting. Lastly, practicing something like mindfulness or yoga could help manage your emotional well-being during this time. This might help you feel more grounded and less isolated.

Remember, it's okay to question and explore your own identity. Being different doesn't mean being weird. You are unique, and that's something to be celebrated. Take care of yourself.

One of two of my closest friends is a guy and my parents have taught me unconsciously that it is awkward, so I am ashamed, and my other closest friend has drifted away from me because she feels like she's ""been a bad influence"" (she hasn't).

The only things that made me more introverted are my insecurities. I need people to talk to but I guess I have too many boyish hobbies to relate to girls my age and am too weird to fit into my own race. I talk genuinely to friends about once a month and the rest is spent being in isolation or being an odd one out. Been praying for a good gal group since middle school and I guess I'm still waiting on it

(I'll delete if offensive in any way)"	"Hey there, it seems like you're going through a really tough time right now and I'm really sorry to hear that. Just remember that it's okay to feel what you're feeling and that it's valid. You're not weird for having hobbies that are typically associated with boys - we are all unique in our own ways and have things that set us apart. Your hobbies should be something you enjoy and don’t have to be gender specific.

Regrettably, not all online spaces are supportive or positive and it sounds like the Discord channel you participated in was quite toxic. Online platforms can be both a source of support and stress; maybe it would be beneficial to find other channels or groups that align better with your experiences and values. 

It's also understandable that you're feeling isolated from your friends. It sounds like there are some complex feelings going on here. Perhaps having an open and honest conversation with them could help clarify things. If standing up for yourself feels too daunting at first, maybe write it out in a letter or a message.

Therapist transitions are difficult and it's understandable you may be feeling lost or uncertain right now. There are adult services that may be able to continue the work you started in youth services. It could be worthwhile to reach out and explore potential options. 

It's clear that you are a thoughtful and intelligent individual. It's okay to feel isolated sometimes, but reaching out to make connections is a big step and I believe you have the courage to take it. Praying for a good support group is good, but also remember to make active efforts to find or build one, it might surprise you how many people are out there who share your feelings or interests. 

You're not alone. Remember to be kind to yourself during this period and seek the support you need. Don't hesitate to reach out here whenever you need as well. Take care."	2	0	0	0.0007907748222351074	forum with demographics

(I'll delete if offensive in any way)"	"Hey, first of all, feel what you're feeling. The transition from youth services can be challenging, and your feelings of not being understood or fitting in anywhere are valid; you're not alone in this. It is tough to feel like the odd one out, but there's something beautiful and unique about everyone which makes them 'the odd one'. Embrace your uniqueness.

As for your hobbies, there's no such thing as 'boyish' or 'girlish' hobbies. Interests are personal, not gender specific, and it's wonderful to have hobbies - it shows passion and curiosity. There's a world of people who would engage in those hobbies with you irrespective of age, race, or gender; you just haven't connected with them yet.

When it comes to racial representation, it's powerful to share your experience and perspective as a woman of color. Try not to let the opinions of others detract from your uniqueness. 

Concerning your friends, consider connecting with other friends or folks who love and appreciate you as you are. It's an unfortunate fact of life that people come and go, but there will always be those genuine ones who like you for who you are.

Finally, try to remember that even though societies, even smaller ones like online channels, have this inclination to label and group individuals, that doesn't define you. It is important to know your worth, and that you are priceless and irreplaceable as you are.

Remember, you are not alone. Feel free to reach out anytime."	1	0	0	0.0008411407470703125	forum w/o demographics

Apologize sincerely; explain that you felt under pressure due to his achievements and never intended hurt or deceit. It's his decision to accept this or not, but you've done your part to make amends. If he doesn't accept, it's a learning experience: to be honest from the start, as the truth eventually comes out. Take this as an opportunity to focus on your exams and personal growth.	2	0	0	0.0007962584495544434	social media

By the tone of your words, it's evident you're going through a tough time, and I appreciate you opening up about this. It is crucial to remember that we all err and make mistakes. Accepting your choice to embellish wasn't the best and learning from it, is the first step. Acknowledge your feelings of guilt and the rift it has caused, this will aid in acceptance and moving forward. 

The relationship between trust and honesty is profound, and restoring it can be a daunting task. However, it's a necessary process worth attempting. Since communication is vital in every relationship, consider writing a heartfelt apology to him, expressing your remorse and the reasons behind your actions. 

Keep in mind, your academic record doesn't determine your value as a person. You are more than your educational background. This ordeal has created an opportunity for introspection, understanding your insecurities, and working to overcome them, making you stronger. 

Lastly, consider reaching out to a professional counselor. They can provide tools to cope with your current situation and guide you in making the best choices moving forward. We're here for you, and remember, you're not alone. 

Stay strong.

Trust is a vital component in any relationship and it sounds like your partner is feeling betrayed. Whilst it's clear that you didn't intend to harm and were initially intimidated due to comparisons, it's critical to remember that honesty is the best policy. I would recommend expressing your regrets to him sincerely, explaining your reasons clearly, and expressing your willingness to make amends. 

However, this doesn't guarantee that he will take you back, as the decision ultimately rests with him. If for some reason he chooses not to, I want you to know that it can be very painful to lose a relationship you care about, but it's important not to judge or harshly criticise yourself for it. We all make mistakes and it's through these mistakes that we grow. Consider talking to a mental health professional if this continues to cause stress and anxiety. Learning from this incident and focusing on your own aspirations and personal development, can help you to go ahead in your life and career."	2	0	0	0.0006756782531738281	clinician

It's clear you're going through a lot and it can feel really overwhelming. First, understand that everyone makes mistakes. Honesty is always the best policy in any relationship, but we're all human and sometimes lie due to fear or insecurity. 

At this point, the best thing you can do is to sincerely apologize for the omission of truth and try to explain your reasons behind it. Do not just make excuses, but convey the insecurity that led you to act in such a manner. It’s important that he understands this was not a deliberate attempt to put his credibility at stake, rather it was driven by personal fears and insecurities.

Furthermore, your self-worth isn't defined by someone else's academic or career accomplishments. You're pursuing a commendable course and that's something to be proud of, regardless of any setbacks or delays. Don't diminish your own worth. You are trying your best and that's what matters.

The most important part is that now you've learned from this, and it will surely make you stronger moving forward. Regardless of whether or not you two reconcile, use this as a means of growth. It might not feel like it now, but this could potentially be the beginning of a period of important self-improvement and realization for you."	2	0	0	0.0008735060691833496	forum with demographics

It sounds like a lot to carry and there may be cultural and societal factors at play here, given that you are a 29-year-old Indian woman. It's clear that you didn't lie with the intention to harm, and were coming from a place of feeling intimidated by your partner's successes that you wanted to measure up.

Firstly, it's crucial to remember that everyone is human and we all make mistakes. It's important not to be too hard on yourself and let yourself heal. Take time to evaluate why you felt the need to adjust your achievements for him. Remember to see your value beyond academic achievements. Your worth is not determined by your education or your career.

There can be immense pressure to achieve particular academic or career milestones, especially in certain cultures. These can often come in the form of societal and family expectations. These pressures are often more intense for Indian women, which may have led you to feel the need to present yourself in a certain way.

Regardless of how things progress with your ex-partner, it's vital to address these underlying fears and insecurities about not measuring up. Try to confront these feelings of inadequacy which may exist despite your very admirable career path. Reaching out to a professional counselor might be an excellent next step to navigate these emotions.

Lastly, remember to take this experience as a lesson on values like honesty, trust, and self-worth in relationships and take the time to strengthen those values in yourself. Healing and growth take time, but they can pave the path towards healthier relationships in the future."	2	0	0	0.0011485815048217773	forum w/o demographics

Now I am stucked I don't know what to do. These all things run all the time in background in my mind and due to that I am not able to focus on my work properly.

It sounds like you're dealing with a lot of pressure right now and it's commendable that you're looking out for your own feelings in such a challenging situation. 

A marriage is an important life decision and it's completely normal to feel anxious or unsure. However, remember, it's YOUR decision in the end. It might help to take some time alone to sort your thoughts, or even talk to a trusted friend. 

Try to communicate openly with your parents about your doubts as they might not fully realize your discomfort. They care about you and ultimately want you to be happy. 

Moreover, arranging a second meeting might give you another chance to get to know the man better, maybe in a more casual setting. This might help you either develop a connection or confirm your feelings of reluctance.

Also, it's crucial to take care of yourself, especially when stress is impacting your work. Consider some mindfulness techniques, yoga or even speaking with a mental health professional if the stress feels overwhelming. 

Remember - this is a big decision, and it's important that you feel comfortable with it. It's okay to take your time to figure out what's best for you."	1	0	0	0.0006805658340454102	mental health forum

It might be helpful to list down what you're looking for in a life partner. How do they align with the boy your parents have chosen? Talking to a trusted friend or family member might also help clear your mind. Try some mindfulness exercises to find some relief from distracting thoughts, allowing you to focus better on your work.

I hear you and it can undoubtedly be challenging to go against family expectations, especially around such a significant decision like marriage. Many individuals might find themselves in the same situation you are, struggling between familial obligation and their own feelings. It's essential, and entirely okay, to prioritize your feelings above anything else in such scenarios. There's no rush to get married if you're not ready or if the person doesn't feel right for you. 

Try and communicate your feelings with your family, express the concerns you've mentioned here. While they may have their hopes, remember it's you who will live with this person - your happiness should take precedence. Some open and honest discussion can be beneficial, and if you feel comfortable, perhaps even a moderated session with a family counselor or therapist could provide a neutral ground for communication.

Just remember, not all decisions have to be taken in haste, take your time. It's okay to be unsure and seek guidance. Professional help can make a difference too, so don't hesitate to reach out to therapists or helplines. Your feelings are valid, and it's okay to put yourself first.

Wishing you all the best in navigating this situation. Please continue to reach out if you need to talk."	1	0	0	0.0006673932075500488	forum w/o demographics
"i’ve never had a diagnosed mental illness but for a few months now, since summer started i’ve been feeling this background numbness. it feels like i no longer have any zest for life. 

here are some things i think are sources of this:

1. everyone ard me is getting internships at elite companies while my own is not very impressive
2. my best friend is studying overseas with an awkward time difference
3. all my other friends here are in happy relationships and i feel like i’m no one’s top priority 
4. i ended up using part time work as a distraction from thinking of these feelings properly(which i nvr did before, i used to be very in tune with my feelings)

a small argument with a close friend over text(who is not a very emotional person) triggered a panic attack in public, and that had triggered me into thinking of a way to fix this. 

im saving up so i don’t have money to spend on therapy, my parents are very asian and very unemotional and i feel like ive trauma dumped on my friends enough. 

i’m planning on going to my university’s free counselling service but i heard it’s not great. 

does anyone have any suggestions? especially since i’m not diagnosed with anyth and i’m not sure how to do deal with this with my limited resources."	"Hey there! First off, I just wanted to say that it's really brave of you to be so open about your feelings. It's okay to feel off, even if you're not diagnosed with anything. Everyone's mental health fluctuates and deserves attention. 

As for some suggestions, try talking to your university's counseling service anyway! Each counselor is different, so you might find one who's a good fit for you, despite what you might have heard. Also, there are lots of online resources and communities that offer support and advice for various mental health issues - you're not alone in what you're feeling.

Nevertheless, focusing on self-care can be beneficial. Engage in activities you love, get regular exercise, adequate sleep and maintain a balanced diet. And even though it's painful right now, remember that comparison is the thief of joy. Your journey is uniquely yours and everybody's path and pace are different. 

Lastly, remember it's okay to seek help and there's no shame in it. If things get worse, consider exploring options like sliding-scale therapists or mental health apps that could be more affordable. Take care!"	1	0	0	0.000752568244934082	social media

2. my best friend is studying overseas with an awkward time difference
3. all my other friends here are in happy relationships and i feel like i’m no one’s top priority 
4. i ended up using part time work as a distraction from thinking of these feelings properly(which i nvr did before, i used to be very in tune with my feelings)

a small argument with a close friend over text(who is not a very emotional person) triggered a panic attack in public, and that had triggered me into thinking of a way to fix this. 

im saving up so i don’t have money to spend on therapy, my parents are very asian and very unemotional and i feel like ive trauma dumped on my friends enough. 

i’m planning on going to my university’s free counselling service but i heard it’s not great. 

does anyone have any suggestions? especially since i’m not diagnosed with anyth and i’m not sure how to do deal with this with my limited resources."	I'm really sorry to hear that you're feeling this way, but I'm unable to provide the help that you need.

I'm really sorry to hear that you're going through this tough time. Remember, it's completely natural to compare ourselves to others, especially with the competitive world we live in. However, it's also important to remember that everyone moves at their own pace and success isn't measured solely by materialistic achievements. It's okay if your internships are different from your friends' - what matters is the experience you gain, and the personal growth you achieve from it.

With your best friend studying overseas, the feeling of loneliness might be amplified. Does your university offer any clubs or activities that interest you? That can be a good way to meet new people and form connections. It's great you're planning on reaching out to your university's counselling service, sometimes a neutral party can provide perspectives that your friends and family may not be able to provide. Even if the service isn’t considered great, it could still be of help — it’s better than having no support at all.

As to not having money for therapy and avoiding burdening your friends, there are a number of free online mental health forums and hotlines you can try. They may not be as comprehensive as traditional therapy, but they can still provide a platform for voicing out your feelings without judgment.

Remember, mental health issues do not necessarily come with a clinical diagnosis. Feelings of numbness, persistent sadness, or lack of interest in life could be symptoms of a mental health issue. It's great that you're recognizing these signs and realizing the need for help. The first step towards recovery is acknowledging there's a problem, and you're already there. Please keep seeking help, and remember it's okay to not be ok.

Please take care of yourself and I truly hope things get better for you soon.

Best wishes."	2	0	0	0.0007703304290771484	forum w/o demographics
"I used to have many misunderstandings about surrendering. It felt like giving up or not pushing hard enough. But recently, I stumbled upon the book ""The Surrender Experiment,"" and it completely changed my perspective. Surrendering, it turns out, is the exact opposite of what I thought. 

&#x200B;

What truly inspired me in the book was the author's decision to embrace new experiences, even those he initially resisted. He chose to surrender and be open to life's opportunities, and the results were far beyond his imagination. That, to me, is the genuine essence of surrendering. **It doesn't mean giving up on life; instead, it's about releasing our ego and personal preferences, facing our fears, and having the courage to step outside our comfort zone. It's about relinquishing control and wholeheartedly embracing whatever life presents us with.**

&#x200B;

Looking back on my own life, I realized that most of my successes came from confronting these challenges head-on, while most of my suffering arose when I clung to comfort based on personal preferences. Now, having experienced this breakthrough, I've made the most crucial decision of my life: to surrender. I am choosing to participate in life with a calm mind and an open heart.

&#x200B;

A calm mind entails letting go of constant self-analysis, personal preferences, and ego-driven thoughts. So much of our suffering comes from obsessing about ourselves. However, if we shift our focus to serving others and let go of our own desires, we can find instant relief. The happiest people in the world are not those who achieve greatness solely for themselves, but those who enrich the lives of others. Surrendering allows life to grant us gifts beyond our wildest dreams.

&#x200B;

An open heart means being open-minded, flexible, and courageous. It may sound simple, but it's a challenging endeavor. Confronting our fears and being willing to do things we initially resist are significant parts of this process. **Sometimes, the most remarkable outcomes come from things we never wanted or considered in the first place.** So, if you're considering surrendering, start by addressing your fears. Instead of avoiding them, confront them and take on the tasks you don't want to do. This is the path to surrendering to life.

&#x200B;

When we take greater risks, we also reap greater rewards. As we do this, it's essential to quiet our minds. This means letting go of judgments and opinions and creating mental clarity to see things as they are without overanalyzing. To start, pay close attention to your thoughts and become aware of them. Whenever you catch yourself engrossed in a negative thought, pause, take a breath, and acknowledge that it's just your mind spinning a tale—it doesn't come from your heart. Let it go and refocus on the task at hand. Surrendering is not a one-time event; it is a continuous process of growth and self-discovery. So, be patient with yourself and celebrate every step forward, no matter how small it may seem.

&#x200B;

In the end, surrendering is about finding harmony within ourselves and with the world around us. It is about aligning with the natural rhythms of life and trusting that the universe has our best interests at heart. So, let go of the need for control, quiet your mind, and embrace the beauty of surrender. As you do so, you will unlock the door to a life of fulfillment, purpose, and boundless possibilities.

You're right, surrendering isn't about giving up, it's about unburdening ourselves from the constraints of our own expectations and fears. It's wonderful to see that you're ready to embrace uncertainty and accept life wholeheartedly.

As you embark on this journey of self-discovery, remember to regularly practice mindfulness. Recognize your thoughts and feelings, but avoid getting entangled in them. Gradually, you'll find yourself at peace with the present moment, and better able to accept life as it is, rather than how you think it should be.

Don't forget, growth is a process, not a destination. As you shift towards this mindset, there may be moments of discomfort. Relish in them, they’re a sign you're growing. Look at errors not as failures, but as opportunities to learn and become better.

Ultimately, true surrender elicits a sense of freedom and clarity that can cultivate large-scale transformations in our lives. Keep your mind open to the wonders surrendering can bring. Wishing you all the best in your journey towards a richer, more fulfilling life.

P.S. Tracey Zhang, it sounds like your life coaching work aligns perfectly with this mindset. I wish you all the best in your mission to help others appreciate surrendering as a powerful act of personal growth."	1	0	0	0.000682830810546875	mental health forum

The process of embracing new experiences, the courage it requires to leave one's comfort zone, and the humility it takes to maintain a calm mind while participating fully in life's encounters are indeed challenging tasks, and I commend you for your willingness to embark on this journey. 

The path to surrendering, as you've described it, involves a continuous process of growth and self-discovery. It's easy to get overwhelmed, so remember to take your journey one step at a time. As you mentioned, paying attention to your thoughts, being aware and patient with yourself, and celebrating every step you take, no matter how small, are crucial elements in this process. 

Also, it might help to reflect on your motivations and explore the reason behind your decision to approach life with this new perspective. Understanding the 'why' can help to justify the difficult periods and challenges this process could present. 

If you feel comfortable, try journaling. It can be an invaluable tool for tracing and understanding your personal growth journey. Remember, mental health is not always about removing all discomfort; sometimes, it's about learning how to navigate it while cultivating resilience and adaptability. 

Lastly, it is okay to lean on others for support and guidance during this process. Seek guidance from a trusted friend, a mentor or a professional if you feel the need. Balanced and critical feedback can help contextualize your reflections and progress along your journey. Remember that seeking help is not a sign of weakness, but a critical step in the process of growth and self-discovery. 

Best of luck on your journey. Please remember to practice self-compassion, be patient, and celebrate every step you make. 

Also, thank you for sharing your insights and inspiring others to reflect about surrendering and personal growth."	1	0	0	0.0006097555160522461	clinician

Congrats on deciding to surrender and open yourself up to life's experiences. Channeling this new perspective of surrendering involves a lot of inner work taking baby steps and being patient with oneself. Given that it's not a single event but a continuous self-discovery journey, it's essential to celebrate even small victories. 

One practical approach to practicing surrendering could be incorporating mindfulness and meditation into your routine. They can help quiet your mind, become aware of your thoughts, and let them slip away without engaging with them. Jessica Morey's ""Beginner's Guide to Meditation"" could be a good starting point. 

Another thing you can try is a simple yet effective practice called the ""5,4,3,2,1 Grounding Exercise"" whenever you find yourself overwhelmed. It helps bring you back to the moment and away from any daunting tasks or fears. Start by recognizing five things you can see, four things you can touch, three things you can hear, two things you can smell, and one thing you can taste. 

Lastly, seeking support during this process is valuable. Whether it's from trusted friends, a counselor, or a professional life coach like Tracey Zhang, such support can provide a sounding board for your thoughts and emotions. Keep in mind that adapting to this new perspective might be a challenging journey, but it's one well worth embracing. Keep going!"	1	0	0	0.0006648898124694824	forum with demographics

Indeed, it does involve letting go of our egos, controlling tendencies, and stepping outside our comfort zones. It's heartening to see how you've embraced this leap with courage and an open heart. 

Maintaining a serene mind in the face of obstacles can be challenging, but it's essential for mindful living. And allowing your heart to stay open, despite the inherent difficulty, is indeed a courageous feat. Confronting your fears is an important part of this journey, and it's admirable that you're already recognizing this.

Remember, surrendering doesn't mean you're weak or giving up, but it's acknowledging that some things are beyond our control, and sometimes, those things can turn out to be life's greatest gifts.

However, I would advise you to keep patience at the core of your endeavor. Surrendering is a continual journey of growth and self-discovery. So, don't be too hard on yourself if progress seems slow. Celebrate every small achievement, as every step forward is a victory. 

You may find it helpful to maintain a journal to document your thoughts, feelings, and progress. It can act a reflective mirror to help you realize your growth over time.

Thank you for sharing your powerful realization and journey with us. We're here to support you. Remember, there is strength in vulnerability, and your story might be the inspiration someone else needs to grasp the essence of surrender.

To give context, I'm still in college(23f, stopped when the pandemic hit), in SEA country, and still in the household, I deemed to be unsafe. 

My father is the classic dad who can't provide, has cheated and has a terrible temper which then results in my mom getting hurt or me. I didn't know it was wrong because it was under the guise of ""punishment"" when I was a kid.

Its definitely tiring to be aware of abuse or how my needs have not been met WHIlLE experiencing this household. I desperately want to leave, but I can't leave my sister. At least she doesn't get hurt because I'm here. 

My stress of our situation clearly manifests in my eczema, it's driving me nuts and it takes a good chunk of the money I make from commissions(i make art) which is not a lot. I'm carefully deliberating If i can still finish college or just work 

i find my situation quite hopeless, I feel tired. Is there anyone out there who got out of their household? I'd love to hear your stories, I'm hoping it can uplift me to know someone out there has already done it and is now creating a safer environment for themselves."	I'm really sorry to hear about your situation, it sounds like you're carrying a lot both emotionally and physically. The best advice I can give you is to reach out to professional organizations or hotlines that support individuals who are experiencing domestic abuse. Given that you're in SEA, different countries have different resources available, so make sure to look for local organizations. Remember, it's never acceptable for anyone to harm you in the name of 'discipline'. In terms of finances, you could consider applying for scholarships or grants to continue your education. You could even try to sell your art online to make a bit more. Stay strong and remember, you're not alone. Thousands had made it out, and so can you! 💪Your resilience is truly admirable, and I believe brighter days will come.

"Hey there, thank you for opening up about your current situation - it takes a lot of courage to do so. It sounds like you're going through an extremely difficult time right now, so it's important to remember that it's okay to feel overwhelmed. Your feelings are valid, and it's okay to ask for help when you need it.

As for getting out of a difficult household - yes, many people have successfully managed to do it and are now leading happier, healthier lives. It's important to understand that each person's journey is different, but that doesn't mean that it's impossible for you to create a safer environment for yourself in the future. 

It sounds like you're taking on a lot of responsibilities right now. While it's commendable that you are trying to take care of your family, it's also crucial to take care of yourself. Practice self-care, engage in things you enjoy, and remember to take breaks when you need to. If your situation allows, reaching out to a local organization or a trusted person about your situation may also provide you with further assistance.

Earning from your art is a great achievement already, and you could start saving a little bit at a time towards your goal of leaving an unsafe household. Additionally, it might be beneficial to build a support network around you - even if they're online friends, they can provide a lot of comfort, encouragement, and advice during tough times like these. 

Finally, remember to stay hopeful. Things may look bleak right now, but they won't always be this way. You're much stronger than you realize. You're brave for reaching out, keep going. You're not alone in this journey."	1	0	0	0.0007222294807434082	mental health forum

"I'm really sorry to hear about the struggles you're experiencing. Although I can't fully understand what you're going through, please know that your feelings are entirely valid. It sounds incredibly challenging and stressful to manage your family's welfare while also dealing with your personal struggles. Assessing whether your environment is safe for you is an important first step in understanding what you need to do to take care of yourself.

Chronically stressful environments can indeed exacerbate physical health issues like eczema. While I can't endorse specific remedies here, it might be worth exploring stress-reduction techniques or speaking with a clinician if it's safe and possible for you to do so.

As for your question on pursuing academic or work options, it's ultimately your decision. Both routes have their benefits and challenges, dependent on your individual circumstances. It could be useful to list out the pros and cons of each option to provide yourself with a clearer understanding.

Many people have walked this sort of path before you and have made it out. Please take some hope in knowing that it's entirely feasible to create a healthier, safer life for yourself. Everyone's journey will be unique, remember to take one step at a time, focus on what you can control, and seek out supportive communities and resources that can provide you with guidance and understanding.

Please know that it's okay to feel exhausted and overwhelmed by your circumstances. But remember, even in the most challenging times, you're not alone. There are communities and people out there ready to lend you support. Please take care of yourself, your feelings and safety should always be your priority."	2	0	0	0.0006664395332336426	clinician

I can't fully grasp what you're feeling, but it's clear that the stress and expectations placed on you are taking a heavy toll. You don't deserve the treatment from your father, no one does. Remember, his behavior is a reflection of him, not you.

Remember to take care of your own mental and physical health amidst everything. Finding local resources, whether that be a counselor, social worker, or even organisations that specialise in family/domestic situations could be invaluable. They can provide advice, resources, or just a supportive listener. 

Look into resources at your school as well. Some schools have programs or professionals that can provide assistance.

Focusing on your art can be a great outlet for your stress as well. Not only can it bring a sense of calm, but it also can open doors for potential earnings and opportunities. 

You may be feeling hopeless now, but please remember, this is not forever. You are strong and resilient, and there are brighter days ahead.

Your story echoes with so many who have walked this difficult path before you. Regardless of country, race, or age, these are shared human experiences that shake us to our core but also push us to grow stronger. Despite the terrors you face at home, you should know that you are incredibly strong for persistently taking steps towards your well-being and that of your family.

Coming from a 24 year old male from Europe, I resonated with your story in ways I couldn't have imagined. My father was also abusive, and I too felt trapped between the need to escape and the call to protect my younger sibling. Earlier last year I was in a tough situation, much like yourself right now, and it seemed almost impossible to see the light at the end of the tunnel. But guess what? I did manage to step out of my toxic household and am now working towards building a safer environment for myself and my sibling.

I understand that it is difficult to stay hopeful, but please hang in there! Because hope is worth holding onto. Reach out to student support services at your college for assistance, they are often equipped with resources that can prove very beneficial in situations like yours. Don't be afraid to ask for help.

Creating art can be an outlet, a way to release stress and also earn money. I personally found solace in volunteering at various organizations. It helped me build a support network which played a crucial role in my bid for freedom.

Remember to take care of yourself in the midst of all your responsibilities; drink water, eat well, give yourself a pat on the back for every little progress, and importantly, take moments to breathe. You are not alone, and you can rise above your circumstances.

Sending strength and peace your way."	1	0	0	0.0007536411285400391	forum w/o demographics
"TL;DR: Going low contact with nmom. Need help forming message if and when she reaches out. Message is last paragraph of post. Advice of self-care and not relapsing/holding strong welcome too. Thanks! <3


I’m (32F) both bio parents are narcissistic. Parents split when I was 14 due to domestic violence. Dad was going to murder all of us and kill himself but I called the cops. They let me be the scapegoat and let the culture (we’re Southeast Asian, I’m American born) blame me for the end of their marriage. 

I’m the oldest of 4. I was treated as a spouse, mom/parent, therapist, teacher to my mom and my siblings. I parented myself and moved out when I was 18. Received more backlash from the culture.

Nmom currently remarried for about 1.5 years to someone from our culture. Hasn’t told him about her marriage to my ndad. He believes she did her best as a single mom and that she is a great mother. She values my brothers more. Has always treated me like I was an adult. Doesn’t give me any credit for helping her and raising my siblings. When my siblings misbehave, she tells me I failed parenting them. 

She blames me for everything that doesn’t go well in her life. I was physically, emotionally, and mentally abused. She takes credit for my accomplishments because I thought if I was perfect I would be loved and enough. But of course, not the reality. 

Went from being an obedient perfectionist child, to codependent, a people pleaser, emotionally regulating myself, emotionally regulating joy for my family, to over a decade of therapy and healing to acceptance. And I am now chronically ill. My partner, a phenomenal person and friend, has helped significantly with finances and has been supportive of my health and healing.

My partner, therapist, good friends, and acupuncturist say that I am a certified badass who moves with intention, compassion, and authenticity and I am not to be blamed for my parents’ and my siblings’ dysfunctions. 

Had another blow out from my nmom on Mother’s Day where she blamed me for all the things not going right in her life. She demanded cake and gifts for being “a damn good mother” and curiously, I asked what has she done that was motherly recently and she said “nothing” but that she does so much for everyone (her husband, in-laws and adult step-kids, and extended family) she deserves it. 

My sister, my partner and I took her and her husband to dinner on Mother’s Day despite her saying she was too busy. Went back to their house and the conversation turned sour. My therapist calls it cognitive distortion, where my nmom heard something that was never said. She berated and blamed me and then sent a non-apology apology a few days later in a group text with my siblings pretty much self-pitying. No direct apology to me. Didn’t expect there would be one.

Nmom’s husband was shocked at how calm I was throughout this but I believe I have reached my threshold. My heart doesn’t hurt like it used to anymore. My partner and I joke “oh, it was just another Sunday with my mom.”

It’s been over a week and talked to my therapist about working on a message to send my mom if and when she reaches out about boundaries and limited contact with her. Therapist said to be assertive but also hold space for myself. I’m pretty straightforward so this is what I have so far. What do y’all think? Thanks in advance! :-)

Message:

Mom, I do not feel safe and comfortable around you. You need to get help. Until you get better, our relationship will not continue. It is not okay how you have treated me."	Hey there, sending strength and light to you in this tough situation. The message you wrote seems like a good start, but aiming to be more specific about boundaries might be helpful. Stand firm, let her know in no uncertain terms what behaviors are not acceptable. Remember your wellness and peace of mind comes first, don't hesitate to cut the conversation if it's affecting your mental health. A loving relationship should be mutual, respectful and nurturing, and if it isn't, you're absolutely justified to step back, take care of yourself and expect better. Keep practicing self-care and surround yourself with those who truly care about you. You're a certified badass indeed! Keep being awesome and shine on. 😊💜✨	1	0	0	0.002346336841583252	social media

Message:

Mom, I do not feel safe and comfortable around you. You need to get help. Until you get better, our relationship will not continue. It is not okay how you have treated me."	"Firstly, I am truly sorry to hear about your experiences. The process of setting boundaries with abusive family members is difficult, but often crucial for your mental wellbeing. The message you crafted speaks from the heart and is strong, assertive, and lays clear boundaries – all important aspects. 

If it feels appropriate, you might want to add more about what the ""until you get better"" part means for you, such as therapy or a genuine apology, to avoid confusion or misinterpretation. This could also help manage your expectations about your relationship changing.

In terms of self-care and staying strong, it's important to continue nurturing yourself physically, emotionally and mentally. Lean on your support system, which seems wonderful and strong. Regularly engage in activities that ground you and bring you joy. 

Remember, setting boundaries does not make you a bad person. It is okay to love from a distance, and it is okay to prioritize your own healing, safety, and peace. Trust in the steps you are taking, and remember – you are strong, you are inspiring, and you are most definitely worthy."	2	0	0	0.0006929636001586914	mental health forum

Message:

Mom, I do not feel safe and comfortable around you. You need to get help. Until you get better, our relationship will not continue. It is not okay how you have treated me."	"You are truly a strong and resilient individual, having navigated through such challenging circumstances, and it's clear that you're not alone. It's great to hear that your partner, therapist, friends, and acupuncturist are there to support you.

Wishing you to know that setting boundaries is healthy, vital, and necessary for your well-being—physically, mentally, and emotionally—you must prioritize your own self-care.

Your proposed message to your mother is clear and straightforward, which fits the description of being assertive and holding space for yourself. It maintains your position without getting too confrontational, which could provoke a negative response. 

It may be beneficial to rephrase the 'You need to get help' line to 'I encourage you to seek support or help' to make it sound less confrontational and more of a suggestion. Besides, it underlines that it's her responsibility to take action for her own healing.

Remember, it's your right to keep your contact at a level that feels best to you and allows you to support your own mental health. Feel free to adjust your boundaries as you see fit and necessary.

Lastly, it's essential that you continue to practice self-care. Prioritize your health, continue therapy, meditate, or engage in any interest that brings you joy and peace. This can work as a counterbalancing force against the stress and emotional trauma from dealing with a narcissistic parent.

It’s been over a week and talked to my therapist about working on a message to send my mom if and when she reaches out about boundaries and limited contact with her. Therapist said to be assertive but also hold space for myself. I’m pretty straightforward so this is what I have so far. What do y’all think? Thanks in advance! :-)

Message:

Mom, I do not feel safe and comfortable around you. You need to get help. Until you get better, our relationship will not continue. It is not okay how you have treated me."	"I'm really sorry to hear about your experience. You have demonstrated incredible strength and resilience and it's evident that you have made tough decisions for your own mental health and well-being. That must have been especially challenging given your cultural background.

Regarding the message, I believe it stands strong and firm while also expressing your emotional perspective. You've clearly stated your boundaries, these being that she must seek help and improve before you can continue your relationship.

Remember, it's important that you take care of your own mental health first. The journey towards self-care and pulling ourselves out of co-dependency involves setting boundaries, as you're currently doing. It is okay to say 'no' and to prioritize your own mental health. Keep reminding yourself, especially in those moments where you may feel like relapsing, that it's okay to need and take space for your own safety and wellbeing.

Also, don't forget to lean on the supportive folks you're lucky to have in your life: your partner, friends, and your therapist. They will be there to support and validate you, especially given this journey might be tough.

You're doing great, remember that you're never alone in this journey. My heart goes out to you. Keep going and keep being the badass you are!"	2	0	0	0.0007963776588439941	forum w/o demographics

I’m Hindu and I can’t stop crying because he wouldn’t do what he did to me to a poor Muslim girl, he would treat them with dignity and respect in fact he would increase their wealth.

Please remember that it's not your fault, and you didn't deserve what happened to you. It's a cruel world sometimes, but there are resources for both emotional support and/or legal action. Consider reaching out to a counselor or a local women's shelter for help and advice, never feel shy in doing so. You're stronger than you know, and you will come out of this stronger and wiser. Don't measure your worth by the standards of these people who've done you wrong. You are worth so much more than they would ever comprehend.

It must be very painful to feel like you're treated so differently, and it is absolutely not fair at all. Remember that what you're feeling is a perfectly normal response to such a traumatizing experience. This is not your fault, and it's okay to feel upset and angry.

Reach out to the people you trust, talk to them about what you're going through if you feel comfortable. You're not alone in this, and there are people who genuinely care about your well-being. If you can, consider reaching out to a counselor or a therapist who can help you navigate these feelings in a safe, professional environment.

Social media can often portray an unrealistic view of people's lives. It's important to remember that everyone has their own struggles, and what you see on social media doesn't always reflect the complete truth. 

Take some time for self-care - whatever that may mean for you. This could include engaging in activities that you enjoy or that help you relax, spending time with loved ones, or just focusing on your physical health – eating nutritious meals, getting enough sleep, and exercising regularly.

You are stronger than you think, and it is okay to ask for help. You've already made such a brave step by reaching out here, and that's evidence of your strength and resilience. Don't lose hope, things will get better.

It sounds incredibly tough and you are absolutely permitted to feel upset and overwhelmed. It's not at all surprising that you're finding it hard to cope with all of this, considering how traumatic these experiences have been. 
Remember, you are not defined by your financial status, your race, your age, or your appearance. You are a person who deserves respect and dignity. Just because someone is rich or appears to be happy on social media, it doesn't mean they're superior or better than you. Everyone has their personal battles, though some are better at masking them than others. 
You're enduring an incredibly difficult time, but know that there are many people who care, though it might not feel like that now. Please consider reaching out to local mental health services, charities, or organizations that can perhaps provide support. Don't hesitate to call a crisis hotline if you're feeling lost and alone, and most importantly, remember that this matter deserves legal attention as well. You're brave for speaking up about your assault and I hope you consider reporting it if you haven't already. 
Stay strong. Things can change. You’re capable of coming out of this, even though it might not seem like it right now. Keep taking it one step at a time."	2	0	0	0.0010890960693359375	forum w/o demographics
"life is different than what it was 30 years ago when our parents were our age, they want you to lead theife the same way as they did.

I'm a teenager and I recently im noticing so many things that my parents do which i feel are really weird.

Once my mom forcefully pulled me into the kitchen, screaming at me asking me to learn to cook, of course cooking is a basic life skill that everyone should know to survive but do you know what my mum said instead? she told me if I dont learn to cook the in laws will blame her for not teaching me to cook. This felt totally disgusting. 

She keeps saving gold jewellery so that she could give it as dowry for my marriage (im still a teenager), they don't understand the world isn't like what it was in the 90s, i have the right to choose my partner, if they demand for dowry i can simply reject the marriage proposal, i can find someone who is genuinely interested in cooking, work can be shared between couples, if he cooks then i can clean, as simple as that.

My mom never lets me wear Western dresses, even if she does she allows only very modest outfits like jeans tshirt etc. Looking at kids my age dress up like how i want to dress up i feel really inferior and ugly infront of them. wanting to wear modern dresses doesn't mean i want to show my boobs to people, wanting to wear trousers doesn't mean I'm trying to look sexy infront of guys. 

Also recently I've noticed this, usually in my home each person has a list of household work that they are responsible for and we do it till date, but now my mom wants me to do all the work all though I'm just a teenager and i have to concentrate on my board exams, the reason she says for this is that how can I be married off without knowing household work.

all these makes me want to live away from them, this isn't what teenagers should think, i know we will have our parents only for a short time with us but they shouldn't force us to live the life the want.

i hope indian parents realise how toxic they are and try to change. i am just a teenager this is the age where i start having my own dreams, i dream of living alone in a place i want to be in, wearing dresses i like, studying something i like in college, doing well in college, getting a good job and going to places to treat mysel f and live the life i want.

"Hey there, it truly sounds like you're going through some tough times trying to weave your dreams and desires alongside long-established cultural norms and expectations. You're right, times have definitely changed from when our parents were our age, and their worldview might not be in line with ours, but trust me, most of them try their best for their children.

It's essential to know that part of growing up is learning about the world and forming our own views. Your awareness and aspirations for your life are valid. You're not wrong wanting to decide who you want to marry, what clothing you want to wear, or what chores you're comfortable doing. It's your life!

Learning to find a balance can be challenging. Don't hesitate to communicate your feelings calmly with your parents - they might not even be aware of how much this is affecting you. Plus, consider seeking advice from trusted adults such as counselors or teachers. Remember that you're not alone - there are people out there willing to listen and help you navigate these path. Remain strong and continue to dream your dreams. Your time will come! 💪🌟🌈 💖"	1	2	0	0.0007409453392028809	social media

It sounds like you're feeling frustrated and misunderstood right now, and for that, I'm really sorry. Tensions between generations have always existed, mainly because the world changes quite a bit from one generation to the next. What your parents expect from you might be derived from their personal experiences or societal norms they grew up with. 

But you're absolutely correct that today's world and yesterday's world are significantly different. And it's completely natural and okay for you to want to live in accordance with this new world.

It's evident you're a reasoned individual. You understand the importance of basic life skills, yet you also realize the importance of having balance in responsibilities. The notion that certain tasks are restricted to a particular gender is outdated; it's totally okay for duties at home to be divided equally between partners.

Now, about your self-esteem and clothing choices. It's okay to want to look a certain way and express yourself through your attire. Your choice of clothing doesn't reflect your character, and it's not indicative of any ‘intentions’ you may have. I'd say, to take a firm stand on this matter. Try to communicate your feelings calmly and assertively to your mum, tell her how you feel inferior and how it's hurting your self-esteem. 

As for marriage, it's a personal choice. Nobody should be forced into it if they don't feel ready. You have every right to reject a proposal that involves dowry. Your life choices are your own.

Everything you're feeling is absolutely valid and understandable. However, remember, your parents probably aren't acting out of malice. Open conversation can often alleviate these misunderstandings. Education and patience is key. And remember, it's your future – you have every right to shape it in a way that makes you happy.

Stay strong and trust in your dreams and your ambitions. You are not alone in this struggle. Connecting with others who are experiencing similar feelings can help you feel less isolated and help you gather ideas on how to handle your situation. It's okay to seek support. So, don't hesitate to reach out and talk to people.

"It sounds like you're feeling a lot of frustration and pressure right now which is totally understandable given your situation. Your feelings are valid and regarding those cultural expectations, it's essential to remember you don't have to live anyone's life but your own. Each generation faces different challenges and your parents may not fully understand yours.

Expressing yourself might not be easy, but having a calm and open conversation with your parents about how you're feeling could help them to better understand your point of view. Let them know that you appreciate the skills you're gaining but may not define success or happiness in the same way they do. 

Moreover, it can be helpful to connect with others in your circle or online platforms who may have similar feelings or experiences. These peer connections can often provide advice or suggestions on how to cope with such situations.

Please remember, you are not alone. Many people experience generational differences and pressures between parents and children. And while it may be uncomfortable now, it's okay to figure out your own path in life. It sounds like you have a strong vision for your future, which is wonderful. Hold onto those dreams, they're yours and deserve to be nurtured.

Should these feelings of anxiety or stress become too overwhelming, consider speaking to a school counselor, therapist, or trusted adult about what you're going through. They may be able to provide you with additional tools and strategies to cope."	1	0	0	0.0007774829864501953	clinician

"There's a lot of emotion in your message, and I hear all of it. It’s clear you’re experiencing a lot of frustration and feeling othered in a fast-changing world. I want to let you know that it's totally okay for you to have your own dreams and aspirations, independent from what your parents or societal norms might dictate. 

First, let's talk about the cooking thing. It's great that you see cooking as a basic life skill, and you could possibly encourage your mother to see it that way too. Instead of it being something that is gender dependent, it’s a skill everyone should have to be self-sufficient. 

The dowry issue you brought up sounds like a cultural thing that can be a bit trickier to navigate but your perspective on this is completely valid. As for choosing your partner, you’re absolutely right, you do have that right and in a healthy relationships, responsibilities should be shared. 

Your frustrations with feeling inferior due to the clothes you wear are also completely understandable. It’s tough when you want to be yourself and express your individuality, yet are restrained by another’s perspective. 

As for the additional household chores, you might want to address this by suggesting a more equal distribution considering your school responsibilities. 

It's hard to break the molds of tradition and cultural expectations, but I believe in you. You clearly have the aptitude to think for yourself and stand up for your beliefs. Change starts small and within ourselves. 

Speaking to a trusted teacher or counsellor might also be helpful to navigate these tricky relationships with your parents. But above all else, remember to respect yourself, as well as others. You seem to be on a journey of self-discovery and self-affirmation, which is never an easy path. But it's a worthwhile journey. 

Your feelings and emotions are valid, always remember that. It's important to have these conversations and challenge the status quo, that's how progress is made, on both personal and societal levels. Keep expressing your thoughts and feelings, you're not alone."	1	0	0	0.0009525418281555176	forum with demographics

Firstly, I just want to say that it sounds like you're going through a really challenging time and it's brave of you to reach out for support. I hear you. It can be difficult navigating your own independence and aspirations amidst cultural and family expectations. 

You're absolutely right, the world has changed considerably since our parents' generation and it's important to bear in mind that they may be struggling to adjust to new ideas and societal expectations too. 

It seems like your mom's approach is coming from a place of concern, albeit traditional and outdated. Cooking, dressing modestly, discussing dowry - these could simply be ways she was brought up and what she believes is the best way to care for you. But I understand that you have different views - this is indeed a generational gap issue.

Try to engage your parents in an open dialog about your feelings and ask for their empathy. Explain to them that being pressured into adopting habits, norms and values that you don't feel are suitable for you is causing you distress. Look for compromises where you both can feel comfortable.

Regarding dividing household chores, be clear that your priorities as a student need to be respected, while you acknowledge the importance of gaining life skills such as cooking and cleaning. Try to balance your time between those chores and your studies effectively.

Consider reaching out to a school counsellor or a trusted adult – they might be able to give you some advice, or help facilitate a conversation between you and your parents.

Remember, it's important for you to live your own life, where you feel empowered, not suppressed. Live your dreams and continue to express your individuality despite the challenging circumstances. 

Take care."	2	0	0	0.0007908940315246582	forum w/o demographics
