When unpleasant things happen, I feel numb, anxious and/or repulsed by my partner whom I love and treasure very much, and have a very strong healthy relationship with. I cannot find anything about this phenomenon. Any help would be very much appreciated<3


I [25F] love my partner[23F] to death, they are the light of my life, my sunshine and guiding moonlight, my best friend, my everything, and the best possible thing I could’ve ever asked for or dreamt of. We are in a very happy, stable, healthy relationship. 

Before we get into the problem, there are a couple factors to take note of.
Firstly, we are LDR(I live in Singapore and they live in the USA, California), we met online near the end of 2021 and we met up in person for the very first time last year in November and it was absolutely wonderful, the happiest 2 weeks of my life.
Secondly, I live in a pretty awful household. I’ve been severely emotionally abused and neglected my entire life and my family is the bane of my existence. I was also severely bullied growing up. I think I’d just sort of gone numb as a coping mechanism, at some point in my life I even experienced a couple months of depersonalisation/ derealisation during highschool. Right before I met my partner, I had just broken out of a 4 year depression period and was finally getting treated for adhd in hopes that I could get my life together. I was… extremely numb at that point, and I could almost feel my brain melting. Despite being numb, it scared me so much it’s what prompted me to see a psychiatrist. It was only last year where I’ve been able to realise the extent of my mental illness. Later on I started getting treated for anxiety and depression as well.

So! Around two months in of being with my partner, some family issues flared up and I was on the receiving end of one of my sister’s worst emotional outbursts. I didn’t think much of it, in the moment I reacted calmly. But I remember feeling extremely nauseous and anxious that night. The next day when I video called my partner, as we do, I noticed I was a little repulsed by them? Which was weird but my initial reaction was to brush it off however the feeling just kept growing stronger. They didn’t do anything different or anything, just looking at them filled me with what I can only describe as pure utter repulsion. Which is a complete utter 180 of the usual warmth and love I feel for them.
I spent the whole week bawling and inconsolable, not understanding and bewildered why I was repulsed by the love of my life. In the end I stayed at my friends place for 3 days to get away from my family and limited time with my partner to reduce the feeling of repulsion. I had very clearly communicated the situation to my partner who was extremely understanding, concerned and sympathetic but was unable to do anything, especially being the subject of my repulsion. After 2 weeks the the feeling slowly started to subside and I was able to feel my whole feelings of warmth and love for them again.

I’ve searched high and low on the internet but I cannot find anything about this phenomenon. Why is it directed at my partner, my favourite person in the world? Why not literally anyone else?🥲

Of course I knew there was always a possibility this might happen again but yet I was kinda caught off guard. A week ago my partner and I had a serious discussion after 2 weeks of them being away on a work trip and unable to call. It was over something we have discussed before and it’s something that can’t really be helped due to the distance and time difference of 16 hours, but nonetheless we both end up tearful and just… sad due to the circumstances.

Over the next few days I realised I was feeling numb and more baffling, anxious (but not repulsed) around my partner. Which has never happened before. They have always been my biggest comfort. The anxiety especially flares up when they mention things like our future visits or our hypothetical wedding and future house together. Usually I love discussing these things, and it makes me very happy knowing our future together is something we both think about. But currently they just fill me with anxiety and dread. I have since communicated all this to my partner and we have decided not to touch on those topics until further notice. They have been extremely sweet and supportive, and despite me being scared and confused I can’t feel my love for them, they have been extremely optimistic and confidant about my feelings for them. Which helps a little. At least someone knows how I really feel I suppose :’)) Since this isn’t their first rodeo they’re not scared and confused like last time, just sweet and supportive.

I don’t understand what happened, it’s not like we’ve never discussed serious before. We have very open and radical communication and honesty. So I fail to understand what triggered this bout of… whatever this is.:(

I’m panicking, I don’t know what to do. My partner is an amazing, wonderful person and aside from the inner daily inner turmoil and frustration, I also hate to put them through this. I miss them too, and I just… don’t understand why I feel this way or why this is happening. I’m scared. I don’t want to feel this way, I don’t want to lose them, I can’t help but feel they deserve someone who won’t go through this bouts of not even knowing how or why they feel a certain way. Is this normal? Am I doomed to periods like this for the rest of my life? Is this abnormal? Should I continue this relationship? If my brain self sabotaging?? Why is it targeting the best thing in my life?? Does it think it’s too good to be true?? I don’t want to hurt my partner😭😭 

If you’ve reached the end, thank you. This is certainly quite the long read😅 I appreciate you getting this far and if you have any advice or similar experiences, please enlighten me I’d be ever so grateful to learn from them.<3"	"Hey there, sounds like you're going through a really tough time. Given the emotional trauma you mentioned, it seems there might be some unresolved issues surfacing in your reactions towards your partner. Anxieties can often project onto the people we love the most. It could be worth considering seeking therapy to understand and manage these feelings better. It's normal to fluctuate between emotions, but if they interfere with your daily life, it might be time to seek professional help. Take care and remember, your feelings are valid, it's what you do with them that matter. ♥️

Navigating through your emotions is certainly not easy, especially when you're facing circumstances that seem inexplicable. Your pain and confusion are valid, and it's okay to ask for guidance.

It sounds like you might be experiencing symptoms of mental health conditions such as anxiety and depression that you mentioned, such as feeling numb, repulsed, and anxious during unpleasant times. However, please remember that it's crucial to reach out to your healthcare provider or a mental health professional to discuss these feelings and your past experiences with depression and anxiety more in depth.

You're already doing a great job by reaching out, acknowledging your feelings and expressing them here and to your partner. Your relationship is not doomed, nor is it certainly exclusive to experience feelings of this sort in one. Many individuals experience periods of fluctuating emotions towards their loved ones, especially within relations where deep emotions reside. 

Open communication with your partner, as well as considering the possibilities of certain coping strategies or therapies – such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) - can certainly contribute towards navigating these emotional variances. Your reassurances to the commitment can be a strong supporting element in your relationship during these periods.

Furthermore, mindfulness and relaxation exercises can also be beneficial in regulating these overwhelming emotions. Don't hesitate to consider seeking a therapist/counselor, preferably someone experienced in the domain of emotional regulation and relationships, to help you navigate these feelings in a safe, non-judgmental space.

Finally, remember, it's okay not to have all the answers right away. Take one step at a time, accept your emotions and continue to communicate openly with your partner. They are there for you, and so are we, here in this space.

Sending you strength and support."	1	0	0	0.0006293654441833496	mental health forum

I'm really sorry to hear about what you're going through - it must be very challenging and stressful. The first thing I want to tell you is that you're not alone. Many people who have experienced trauma in the past, like the emotional abuse you had faced at home, can often have difficulty regulating their emotions later on. It's a protective mechanism that our bodies develop when we're constantly in ""survival mode.""

Although I'm not a professional therapist, it's possible that these unpleasant feelings you've been feeling towards your partner could be a symptom of trauma related responses, such as Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) or Complex Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (C-PTSD), especially considering that you're already dealing with ADHD, anxiety, and depression. Please take this as a speculation and not a diagnosis, and consider discussing it with a mental health specialist.

Also, please take into account that our brains have a strange and sometimes distressing way of manifesting our deepest fears and insecurities. It's possible you might be projecting your fears of loss, abandonment, or rejection onto your partner, which could explain the extreme change in your emotions and the intense dread of losing them.

That being said, it's important to continue keeping an open line of communication with your partner. Their support and understanding will be invaluable for you during this time. And most importantly, please continue seeking help from mental health professionals. They can provide you with coping mechanisms and therapies that could help further mitigate these feelings of repulsion and anxiety.

Remember, it's okay to not have all the answers or know why you're feeling a certain way. Mental health is complex, and it can take time to unravel and understand our emotions. It doesn't make you any less of a partner or person.

Take care and remember, you're not alone. 💓"	2	0	0	0.0010287761688232422	forum with demographics

Based on what you describe, it sounds like there could be elements of psychological trauma coming up for you. This can sometimes result from a challenging childhood and experiences of abuse, and it might manifest in ways that are confusing or difficult to understand, especially in relation to your feelings towards your significant other. These fluctuating feelings of numbness, anxiety, and even repulsion could represent ways how your mind is attempting to cope with the trauma.

I would recommend reaching out to a mental health professional such as a psychologist or psychiatrist for help in working through these emotions. Mention to them what's happening in your relationship as it may be directly related to your past experiences. Teletherapy could be an option since you're living in Singapore and dealing with pandemic-related restrictions.

Moreover, joining an online support group or forum for survivors of trauma could also help. Sharing your experiences with others who understand what you're going through can provide comfort and validation. Your partner seems wonderfully supportive, and it's clear that you have open lines of communication. Encourage them to do their own research on trauma to understand your experiences better. You're not alone in dealing with these kinds of issues.

Please remember that while your past may influence how you respond to certain stressors, it doesn't have to define your future. With the right support, understanding, and therapeutic strategies, it's possible to find healing and to build healthier relationships moving forward. Remember to be kind to yourself, take care of your mental health, and communicate openly with your partner. <3"	2	0	2	0.0006797313690185547	forum w/o demographics
"Hey Reddit,

I'm (28F) an American living in Europe I won't say where for anonymity. I met my husband (30M) during the pandemic and when restrictions were lifted I made the journey to meet him. We were smitten, and I moved over and we now have a child. My mother (55F) tries to come over several times a year to come see me and our little one. She usually stays about a Month. Which is great when it comes to quality time with her grandchild, but our relationship is quite tumultuous.

I grew up in a very authoritarian single parent household. My mother is misogynistic, has never been financially stable, and doesn't align in the same political opinions of either of her children. Growing up she forced us to go to a very toxic ""Church"" who labeled me a ""Bad seed"". She even at one point threatened to kick me out over not wanting to attend once I turned 18. I could go on and on about that Church, but that's another story. She was also very harsh with her punishments. Including taking our doors for several months when I was a teen, my door knob so I wouldn't lock my doors, and grounded me from going outside or seeing my friends besides at school for 6 months. She is very impulsive as well, often changed jobs, would constantly have us move houses or go back to live with our grandparents. Which honestly was our saving grace for alot of my childhood. And she is a very argumentative and basically always wants to talk about conservative politics even knowing I've asked her to try not to bring up these topics as it is harming our relationship. She is a very loving mother and I know she does love and wants the best for me. I'm also aware I need therapy.

The problem I'm having is she told me recently she was going to work on her career (which I will also not divulge) towards moving here for work. She wants to live closer and maybe even eventually live with us. Our relationship is very complicated, but I love her and want her to be happy. I just would rather have our relationship still be at a distance. I know I can't control her actions, but how do I tell her I'd rather her not try to come and live with my family. My husband would also not like this. 

So Reddit what do you think? 

TD;LR: My mother told me of her 5 year plan to come live near me. We have a very complicated relationship where I would rather us stay at a distance. How do I tell her gently?"	"Hey there,

It sounds like you're dealing with a lot. It's good that you've been able to put up with it for so long and are seeking therapy. In dealing with your mom, it might be best to make it about you rather than her. State what's best for your mental health and sanity, and what's most beneficial for your family. Reiterate that as much as you love her, you need space and boundaries for the sake of a healthy relationship. In reassuring her about your love, you can try mentioning that you will try to provide her with as much support as possible from a distance. Last but not least, you could suggest alternatives, like longer overseas visits or video calls to keep her connected with the grandchild. 

Take care of yourself and stand your ground. Good luck!

TD;LR: Make the conversation about what's good for you and your family rather than directly against her. Suggest alternatives for her connection with the family from a distance. It's all about setting healthy boundaries!"	1	0	0	0.0009400248527526855	social media

This truly sounds like a tough situation and I empathize with you deeply. From your story, it's clear you're dealing with a challenging predicament. Here's how I suggest you could softly approach your mother:

Firstly, make it about your own feelings and concerns rather than her behavior. Express how much you value your independence and the peaceful life you and your husband have built together in Europe. 

Secondly, whenever people contemplate big decisions such as relocating, they usually weigh the pros and cons. You might consider sharing your concerns and uncertainties about this move, saying that you're not sure how it will impact your life, your husband's and your child's well-being.

Thirdly, reassure her that despite the geographical distance, you will make utmost efforts to ensure that she is still a part of your lives. You could emphasize your commitment to regular communication, video calls, and visits (when possible). Talk about how you cherish the visits she already makes and how much those mean to your family.

And lastly, remember to show love and respect for your mother throughout this conversation. Your message might be easier for her to process if she understands that it's coming from a place of love for your own family's wellbeing.

Remember to stay strong. You're entitled to set boundaries for the health of your own family. Best of luck.

It certainly sounds like you're navigating a tricky emotional situation. I'm glad you've reached out and acknowledged your need for support. It's okay to want space and boundaries in your life, even when it comes to family. Here's a potential approach to communicating your needs: 

1. **Use ""I"" statements to express your feelings:** This helps to deescalate conflict, because you're not directly blaming her. You might say ""Mom, I feel stressed and overwhelmed at the thought of us living so close together.""

2. **Be assertive but gentle:** Standing up for your needs is necessary, but it doesn't have to involve being harsh or aggressive. Gently make your points, acknowledging her feelings as well.

3. **Address it as a family decision:** You could say, ""My husband and I have decided we need our space. We wanted to tell you this as it impacts our family dynamics."" By including your partner, it presents a united front and takes some pressure off you.

4. **Be clear about your boundaries:** It's critical for you to establish what you can and can't tolerate. Make sure to set clear boundaries about visits, how much time you want to spend together, and topics you're comfortable discussing.

5. **Encourage her independence:** Assert that while you appreciate her love and her desire to be close, your family needs its own space to grow and thrive, just like she does.

6. **Suggest alternatives:** Could she visit more frequently, instead of moving?

Lastly, remember that this is a process and might not all be resolved in one conversation. It would help if you could access therapy to further explore these issues, and perhaps even consider family therapy with your mother. This could offer a safe space to discuss your history, current dynamics, and future expectations. 

Good luck and be patient with yourself and others during this time."	1	0	0	0.0010981559753417969	clinician

It seems like you're dealing with a challenging situation here. Balancing the need for personal space with the need to maintain familial relationships, especially ones that have complex emotional ties, is never easy.

First, take a moment to acknowledge your feelings and concerns. Your apprehension and discomfort about this decision is completely valid, considering your past experiences with your mother and your current relationship with her. 

In terms of communicating your feelings to your mother, be as honest, direct and compassionate as possible. Using 'I' statements can be effective in conveying your thoughts without making it seem like an attack on her. For example, you could say: ""Mom, I appreciate your desire to be close with us and play an important role in our child's life. However, I have some concerns about us living too close together. The distance has allowed us to maintain a healthier relationship, and I worry it could become strained if we live in closer proximity. I value our relationship and think it would be best for us to continue how we have been.""

Remember, it is okay to prioritize your mental health and the well-being of your family. You are right in understanding that you cannot control her actions, but setting clear boundaries is crucial for your peace of mind. Lastly, as you have pointed out, seeking therapy can be immensely helpful in dealing with such issues. Therapists can provide strategies and tactics that are tailored to your situation.

Best of luck!"	1	0	0	0.0009441971778869629	forum with demographics

Navigating difficult family relationships can be really challenging, but remember that it is crucial to prioritize the wellbeing of yourself and your family.

Firstly, consider seeking therapy as you've mentioned it yourself. A professional can provide guidance on how to establish boundaries and navigate your dynamics with your mother more effectively.

When telling your mother about your feelings, think about using ""I statements"". Instead of saying ""You make it difficult for us to live in the same house,"" say ""I feel anxious at the thought of us living in the same house due to our past."" This focuses on your feelings and experience, reducing the likelihood of your mother feeling attacked.

Set firm boundaries and be clear about what you expect from her. Try to be consistent in your words and actions to avoid confusion.

Remember that your feelings are valid. Balancing the needs of your immediate family (you, your husband, and your child) and the relationship with your mother is not easy. It might be beneficial to find a local support group or forum to gain insight from others who have been through similar experiences. 

I hope this helps, and I wish you the best."	1	0	0	0.0008657574653625488	forum w/o demographics
"A few weeks ago, I (28M) found out that I have an older half sister (35F) through 23andMe. Let's call her Emily. We share the same father. She reached out to me and I've gotten to know Emily a bit.

Emily seems like a lovely person and I feel blessed to have discovered that I now have an older sister. She's married and has two young kids. I haven't met her husband or her kids yet, though she wants to introduce me to them soon.

Through talking with Emily, I've since learned that my father had a one night stand back when he was a grad student in university, and that her bio-mom later put her up for adoption. My father does not know that Emily exists. Emily seems to have had a happy life and grew up on the other side of the country. While I grew up in California, she grew up on the East Coast. I now live in the East Coast and I've even met Emily in person for coffee once and we share many of the same physical features (same eyes, same nose, tall height, etc.).

Anyway, here's why I'm on Reddit and asking for help. Emily wants to get to know the rest of the family and meet them. As far as I know, I'm the only one in my immediate family who used 23andMe, and Emily hasn't met anyone from my family yet. I've told Emily a bit about my father (61M) and sister (25F) but haven't really mentioned much. Emily wants to meet our father and sister. 

I haven't told my family about Emily yet. The truth is, my father was extremely abusive growing up and I'm basically in limited contact with him with the occasional text every few months. I haven't seen him in years. I talk to my mother on the phone occasionally. 

How do I proceed from here? How do I go about explaining to the rest of my family the existence of my older half-sister? I feel like doing so would cause a huge rift between my parents. I'm not sure how my other relatives would even react to this. And, while I'm 100% Asian-American, Emily is half-Asian and half-white and super white-passing. I'm not sure how my parents and other family members would react to this. Several of them are pretty racist.

I'm not sure how Emily will react to meeting my father. My father was abusive and is toxic and sexist. I feel like she'll be disappointed when meeting him. She's told me that she's always wanted to know a bit about her father and get to know her Asian side of herself. 

I've thought about maybe telling my sister first and asking her what she thinks and going from there, and starting with introducing my sister to Emily first.

It certainly sounds like you have a lot on your plate right now, and it's completely understandable to feel overwhelmed. Approaching this sort of situation is indeed delicate, and your fears and concerns are absolutely valid.

Firstly, it's great that you and Emily have started to build a positive relationship and she seems open to building connections with the rest of the family. It's quite possible that she understands that she might not receive the reactions she wants, considering the circumstances of her birth.

Before you start introducing Emily to the family, I think it's crucial to have an honest conversation with her about your father. She does not need the exhaustive details but should be made aware that he can be difficult and your relationship with him has been far from perfect. This will prepare her for possible disappointment and she can make an informed decision about whether or not she still wants to meet him.

When it comes to your immediate family, it seems like your instincts are right to talk to your sister first. She might be more understanding and supportive in this situation. Remember, you don't have to rush things. Take the time to mentally and emotionally prepare before each discussion, and keep them as calm and scripted as possible. When talking about Emily, focus on her - her life, experiences, character - rather than the circumstances of her birth.

Regarding the racism that Emily might face from your family, prepare her for it. Give her the chance to decide if she still wants to meet them while aware of this issue.

Remember, it's crucial in this process to take care of your mental health first. Reach out for professional help if it becomes too overwhelming. Good luck. I hope everything turns out positive in the end. 

-TL;DR: Talk honestly with Emily about your father, approach your sister first about Emily's existence, prepare Emily for potential racism, and take care of your mental health during this process."	1	0	0	0.0008492469787597656	mental health forum

Navigating such situations is always tricky, but I encourage you to consider a few guiding principles:

1) Dedicate time to sit with these feelings and unpack them. Journaling or talking with trusted friends could be useful.
2) Before embarking on action, make sure you clearly understand Emily's expectations and wishes. Transparency and mutual respect are essential in these discussions.
3) It may be beneficial to inform your sister first, as you suggested. Engaging a supportive ally can make the situation feel less overwhelming. You can gauge her reactions and together develop a strategy to inform the rest of family.
4) Consider seeking professional guidance, like psychotherapy or family mediation, which could provide space for these important conversations to occur.
5) Always prioritize your well-being and mental health. 

You don't need to rush this process. Remember, your and Emily's feelings are paramount in this situation. It's a challenging narrative to navigate, but by taking measured steps, prioritizing open communication, and seeking professional assistance, you can approach it with care and consideration."	1	0	0	0.0006116628646850586	clinician

I've told Emily a bit about my father (61M) and sister (25F) but haven't really mentioned much. Emily wants to meet our father and sister. 

I haven't told my family about Emily yet. The truth is, my father was extremely abusive growing up and I'm basically in limited contact with him with the occasional text every few months. I haven't seen him in years. I talk to my mother on the phone occasionally. 

How do I proceed from here? How do I go about explaining to the rest of my family the existence of my older half-sister? I feel like doing so would cause a huge rift between my parents. I'm not sure how my other relatives would even react to this. And, while I'm 100% Asian-American, Emily is half-Asian and half-white and super white-passing. I'm not sure how my parents and other family members would react to this. Several of them are pretty racist.

I'm not sure how Emily will react to meeting my father. My father was abusive and is toxic and sexist. I feel like she'll be disappointed when meeting him. She's told me that she's always wanted to know a bit about her father and get to know her Asian side of herself. 

I've thought about maybe telling my sister first and asking her what she thinks and going from there, and starting with introducing my sister to Emily first.

Any advice on how I should proceed from here? How do I bring this up to my family? How do I introduce them?

TL;DR: I discovered I have an older half-sister. We share the same father. She wants to meet the rest of the family. Neither knows the other exists. My father was abusive growing up and I'm not sure how to explain this to my sister, or how to proceed from here."	"This is a complex situation and it's completely fine to feel uncertain about how to navigate through it. One step you could take is to have an open, honest conversation with Emily first. While it's great that you want to respect her wishes to meet the family, it's also crucial for her to understand the negative aspects of your father's character and behavior. It may be difficult, but it's important that she enters the situation with her eyes wide open. 

Regarding your family, your sister could be a good starting point. Present everything gradually, giving her time to digest the newfound information. Gauge her reaction before sharing with others. If she's supportive, she could be a strong ally. 

Dealing with your father may be more challenging. You might want to seek professional advice from a family counselor or psychotherapist to discuss the best way to approach this conversation. As for the rest of your family, unfortunately, you can't fully predict or control their reactions. 

Always remember that you're not alone in this. It's completely ok to seek help or advice, and it's essential to prioritize your own mental health through this process."	1	0	0	0.000719606876373291	forum with demographics
"A few weeks ago, I (28M) found out that I have an older half sister (35F) through 23andMe. Let's call her Emily. We share the same father. She reached out to me and I've gotten to know Emily a bit.

Emily seems like a lovely person and I feel blessed to have discovered that I now have an older sister. She's married and has two young kids. I haven't met her husband or her kids yet, though she wants to introduce me to them soon.

Through talking with Emily, I've since learned that my father had a one night stand back when he was a grad student in university, and that her bio-mom later put her up for adoption. My father does not know that Emily exists. Emily seems to have had a happy life and grew up on the other side of the country. While I grew up in California, she grew up on the East Coast. I now live in the East Coast and I've even met Emily in person for coffee once and we share many of the same physical features (same eyes, same nose, tall height, etc.).

Anyway, here's why I'm on Reddit and asking for help. Emily wants to get to know the rest of the family and meet them.

It's wonderful that you've found an unexpected new family member in Emily. Such situations can indeed be emotionally complex, and it's very valid to feel anxious or uncertain. It's clear you have Emily's best interests at heart, which is wonderful. 

Taking one step at a time might be helpful. Since you have a good relationship with your sister (25F), it might be beneficial to discuss this with her first. This can allow both of you to navigate this situation together and alleviate some of the burden from your shoulders. Ensure that the conversation is private and comfortable; show her the 23andMe results if necessary so that the evidence is tangible.

Regarding your father, it might be best to leave the choice to meet him with Emily, after letting her know about his abusive past. Everyone's healing process is different and perhaps meeting her biological father, despite his flaws, might give her closure.

Concerning racial issues, it's an unfortunate reality that ethnicity can sometimes cause family tension. In the end, it's important to remember that we can’t control others' perceptions or behaviors. Emily, as an adult, probably can anticipate potential racial issues given she is half Asian, half Caucasian. 

Above all, remember to prioritize yours and Emily's mental wellbeing. It's okay to take things slow or even enlist the help of a family therapist or counselor if needed. It might also be helpful to discuss this with a professional who can give insights on effectively communicating such information.

Take care."	1	0	0	0.0010564923286437988	forum w/o demographics

It sounds like you're dealing with quite a bit right now, and I'm really sorry to hear you're feeling this way. It's good that you're identifying what may trigger your social anxiety. Interaction can be less intimidating in smaller groups or in one-on-one situations; perhaps you could start by gradually building your social network from there. Regarding work, consider seeking professional advice from either a counselor or a psychologist to better understand and manage your social anxiety issues. Meanwhile, exploring various stress management techniques such as mindfulness, yoga, or even just regular physical activity could be beneficial. It's a journey, mate.

"Hey there, firstly, well done on being open about your struggles - this is a significant step towards managing and overcoming social anxiety. 

One strategy you might want to try is cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). It's a type of therapy that can help you understand and change thought patterns that lead to harmful behaviors or feelings of unease. In Australia, you may be able to ask your GP for a recommendation or find a therapist that specializes in CBT.

Another avenue could be joining local clubs or trying out new hobbies. This can be a more relaxed way to meet new people with shared interests.

Additionally, it could be beneficial to find a support group for people dealing with social anxiety. This could help you not only meet new people, but also provide a space where you feel understood and supported.

However, always remember to consult with a mental health professional before embarking on any new mental health strategy. It's important to receive advice tailored specifically to your situation. 

Take care of yourself and remember it's okay to take small steps towards your goal. You've got this!"	1	0	0	0.0006404519081115723	mental health forum

"I'm sorry to hear you're dealing with such a heavy burden. It can indeed be challenging to manage social anxiety especially when it appears to impact various aspects of everyday life. It's great that you've been able to identify different situations and factors that affect your anxiety, as it's the first step towards managing it. You might find Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) beneficial: it is a problem-specific and goal-oriented approach that often includes mindfulness exercises or practices, exposure therapy, and cognitive restructuring, amongst others. It is particularly effective in treating social anxiety. 

However, having a supportive network is also important. As you have moved countries, you might consider joining expat communities or other groups with shared interests where you can meet people in a more structured, less anxiety-inducing environment. 

Also, if you haven't yet, speaking with a mental health professional can provide more personalized guidance. They can offer therapeutic techniques tailored exactly to your needs and help you form a comprehensive plan to manage your anxiety. Remember, it's perfectly okay to seek help. Taking the first step towards addressing the issue is commendable and I wish you the very best on your journey to better mental health."	2	0	0	0.000631868839263916	clinician

"Hi there,

It's really brave of you to openly share about your struggle with social anxiety. It's something that many people face, so know that you're not alone. Your past consumption of cannabis might have increased feelings of anxiety, but it's a great that you have moved away from it.

You've identified that you're okay interacting with one person, which is a powerful observation. Maybe you can harness that strength by seeking more one on one interactions instead of group settings. This way, you can build your confidence slowly, and eventually transfer it to other environments.

To improve on this, you could start with behavioral techniques such as deep breathing or mindfulness meditation, which can help center you in those uncomfortable moments. Practicing these may relieve some of your anxiety.

Another suggestion would be to seek a supportive platform like group therapy or counselling. This could offer you a way to expose yourself to social situations in a controlled environment and gradually learn to cope with the anxiety. In the same vein, Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) can equip you with practical ways of managing anxiety. 

Remember, it's okay to ask for professional help if you feel like this is significantly affecting your life. Psychiatrists and therapists are there to guide and support you through these battles.

Don't hesitate to take it slow - progress isn't necessarily fast, but the commitment to taking steps forward is what counts the most. You are more than capable of overcoming this hurdle and remember, the community is here to support you throughout your journey. 

Warmly,

"Hey there,

It sounds like you're going through a tough time, and I'm really sorry to hear that. I'm not a professional, but I've also dealt with social anxiety and I want to share a few things that could help.

Firstly, it's okay to struggle with this - a lot of people do, across all races, genders, and ages. You mentioned that your issue could have originated from smoking weed in your early 20s and your behaviour changing. Please know that a lot of individuals in their 20s go through major personality changes as we grow and mature, and it's not uncommon to become more introspective or worried about social interactions. It's not your fault, and you're not alone.

Try to integrate into your new environment slowly; take it step by step. Start off by meeting new people one on one - which you've mentioned is comfortable for you - then gradually move on to small groups. This could be through work colleagues, acquaintances or joining a hobby class or group. Also, speak to your girlfriend about it; she's there to support you.

Additionally, talking to a professional, like a psychiatrist or therapist, could really benefit you. They could provide strategies, coping mechanisms and may even suggest cognitive-behavioral therapy for social anxiety, which has proven to be very effective. 

Remember, it's okay to take things slow. Healing and change are not overnight endeavors, and it's important to take care of yourself throughout the process. Best of luck! You're not alone in this.

Apologize sincerely; explain that you felt under pressure due to his achievements and never intended hurt or deceit. It's his decision to accept this or not, but you've done your part to make amends. If he doesn't accept, it's a learning experience: to be honest from the start, as the truth eventually comes out.

By the tone of your words, it's evident you're going through a tough time, and I appreciate you opening up about this. It is crucial to remember that we all err and make mistakes. Accepting your choice to embellish wasn't the best and learning from it, is the first step. Acknowledge your feelings of guilt and the rift it has caused, this will aid in acceptance and moving forward. 

The relationship between trust and honesty is profound, and restoring it can be a daunting task. However, it's a necessary process worth attempting. Since communication is vital in every relationship, consider writing a heartfelt apology to him, expressing your remorse and the reasons behind your actions. 

Keep in mind, your academic record doesn't determine your value as a person. You are more than your educational background. This ordeal has created an opportunity for introspection, understanding your insecurities, and working to overcome them, making you stronger. 

Lastly, consider reaching out to a professional counselor. They can provide tools to cope with your current situation and guide you in making the best choices moving forward. We're here for you, and remember, you're not alone. 

Stay strong.

Trust is a vital component in any relationship and it sounds like your partner is feeling betrayed. Whilst it's clear that you didn't intend to harm and were initially intimidated due to comparisons, it's critical to remember that honesty is the best policy. I would recommend expressing your regrets to him sincerely, explaining your reasons clearly, and expressing your willingness to make amends. 

However, this doesn't guarantee that he will take you back, as the decision ultimately rests with him. If for some reason he chooses not to, I want you to know that it can be very painful to lose a relationship you care about, but it's important not to judge or harshly criticise yourself for it. We all make mistakes and it's through these mistakes that we grow. Consider talking to a mental health professional if this continues to cause stress and anxiety. Learning from this incident and focusing on your own aspirations and personal development, can help you to go ahead in your life and career."	2	0	0	0.0006756782531738281	clinician

It's clear you're going through a lot and it can feel really overwhelming. First, understand that everyone makes mistakes. Honesty is always the best policy in any relationship, but we're all human and sometimes lie due to fear or insecurity. 

At this point, the best thing you can do is to sincerely apologize for the omission of truth and try to explain your reasons behind it. Do not just make excuses, but convey the insecurity that led you to act in such a manner. It’s important that he understands this was not a deliberate attempt to put his credibility at stake, rather it was driven by personal fears and insecurities.

Furthermore, your self-worth isn't defined by someone else's academic or career accomplishments. You're pursuing a commendable course and that's something to be proud of, regardless of any setbacks or delays. Don't diminish your own worth. You are trying your best and that's what matters.

The most important part is that now you've learned from this, and it will surely make you stronger moving forward. Regardless of whether or not you two reconcile, use this as a means of growth. It might not feel like it now, but this could potentially be the beginning of a period of important self-improvement and realization for you."	2	0	0	0.0008735060691833496	forum with demographics

Summary: My boyfriend broke up with me because I didn't disclose that I have gap years in my academics"	"I empathize with your situation and I'm so sorry to hear about how this has unfolded. It sounds like a lot to carry and there may be cultural and societal factors at play here, given that you are a 29-year-old Indian woman. It's clear that you didn't lie with the intention to harm, and were coming from a place of feeling intimidated by your partner's successes that you wanted to measure up.

Firstly, it's crucial to remember that everyone is human and we all make mistakes. It's important not to be too hard on yourself and let yourself heal. Take time to evaluate why you felt the need to adjust your achievements for him. Remember to see your value beyond academic achievements. Your worth is not determined by your education or your career.

There can be immense pressure to achieve particular academic or career milestones, especially in certain cultures. These can often come in the form of societal and family expectations. These pressures are often more intense for Indian women, which may have led you to feel the need to present yourself in a certain way.

Regardless of how things progress with your ex-partner, it's vital to address these underlying fears and insecurities about not measuring up. Try to confront these feelings of inadequacy which may exist despite your very admirable career path. Reaching out to a professional counselor might be an excellent next step to navigate these emotions.

Lastly, remember to take this experience as a lesson on values like honesty, trust, and self-worth in relationships and take the time to strengthen those values in yourself. Healing and growth take time, but they can pave the path towards healthier relationships in the future."	2	0	0	0.0011485815048217773	forum w/o demographics

1. **Set boundaries**. Start off by designating certain hours of the day as ""phone-free"" and enforcing these rules strictly. 

2. **Find an offline hobby**. Find something that interests you outside the digital world to divert your attention, like reading physical books, gardening, or exercising.

3.  **Get professional help**: Talk to a counselor or mental health professional. It's a sign of strength, not weakness, to ask for help. You needn't face this alone.

Regarding your anger issues, mindfulness and meditation can help manage these feelings. In addition, seeking professional assistance, such as a therapist or psychologist can guide you through strategies to control anger and frustration. 

Remember, it's important to talk about this with your closed ones. They can also provide you with emotional support during this process.

Wishing you resilience and perseverance on this journey. You've already taken the first big step by acknowledging the issue. Take care."	2	0	0	0.0008533000946044922	mental health forum

It's completely normal to have habits that interfere with our lives, and the first step to getting better is acknowledging the problem, which you've done already. A useful technique for managing phone usage may be to set clear, realistic boundaries for yourself. Allocate specific times during the day for phone usage, and gradually decrease this over time. 

Also, you could find a hobby or activity that you enjoy to distract your mind and occupy your time. Exercise, reading, painting, or any form of physical activity could prove to be a helpful alternative to spending time on the phone. Furthermore, consider using apps or tools that track and limit screen time to encourage healthier tech habits. 

In relation to your anger management, it could be beneficial to practise mindfulness techniques such as deep breathing exercises and meditation to reduce stress and anger. Trying to self-regulate your emotions through these techniques could offer some relief.

However, the best course of action would be to reach out to a mental health professional who can provide interventions and strategies specifically tailored to you. Remember, there's no shame in seeking help, it's a courageous step towards better personal well-being and mental health. Best of luck and remember that change takes time, go easy on yourself."	2	0	0	0.0007593631744384766	clinician

It sounds like you feel very trapped by your phone use and your ability to manage your frustration. It's important to remember that small steps can lead to larger strides over time. 

For your phone addiction, try setting specific boundaries for when and how long you can use your phone. You can even use apps to limit your screen time or make certain parts of the day tech-free periods. Also, consider substituting your phone usage with other activities such as reading a book, spending time with your child and spouse, or doing something outside like exercise. 

As for handling your frustration, consider exploring stress management techniques and mindfulness practices, like deep breathing exercises, yoga, or meditation. You might also want to explore cognitive-behavioral techniques that can help you to catch and control negative thought patterns before they spiral out of control. 

Remember to also reach out to professionals for help when needed. Therapists, counselors, and even peer support groups can be invaluable resources to help navigate these issues. You're not alone in this journey and there are people and resources that can help."	2	0	0	0.0008025765419006348	forum with demographics

Being in retail , you have to be polite but sometimes I am super annoying"	"Hi there,

I understand how frustrating and isolating it can be when you feel like your phone is taking over your life. It's really commendable that you've recognized your problem and are seeking help - it's the crucial first step towards change. 

Let's start with your phone addiction: There are many strategies you can try. Begin with setting boundaries. Allocate specific ""phone-free"" zones or times in your day when you intentionally leave your phone in another room or switch it off. Start using apps that limit screen time or alert you when you have surpassed your daily limit. 

(I recommend the apps Forest, Offtime or SPACE, they're pretty handy)

To fill the void during these phone-free periods, focus on activities you enjoy - spend time with your kid, give your business a little more attention or cultivate a new hobby. Essentially, engage with the world around you and stay busy.

As for your anger issues, this seems to be more related to emotional management. Often, our anger is a manifestation of heightened stress, unresolved issues or unrecognized triggers. It's important to identify and address these root causes with a professional. Therapy, especially Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT), can be beneficial. 

In the meantime, practice mindfulness techniques such as deep breathing or meditation. Taking time each day to calm your mind and body can significantly mitigate the intensity of your anger. 

Remember, there's no magic fix here and it's okay to take small steps. Don't beat yourself up if progress is slow. You're already on the path to betterment. 

And please, if you feel it's right for you, consult with a mental health professional. They can offer you more personalized strategies and guidance.

Take care of yourself!"	1	0	0	0.0009426474571228027	forum w/o demographics
"Hey there, I’m an Indian M27, I lost my both parents when I was in Uni (age 22), a year after that I moved to a different country (NZ) to study.

Now, I have settled here permanently, however I am extremely lonely and depressed at times. I have a few friends that adore me and accept me as I am.

I recently came out as a gay man and said no to an arranged marriage/engagement. My relationship with my siblings has evolved and we rarely talk now.

I have a really good job, my manger is the best person I’ve known at work, he’s very supportive. I have seen that I have become very lazy and I used to get very panicked about the emails piling up. I know the only way through is through but since 4th July, my dads death anniversary.I have been feeling quite low and not showing up at work. I have exhausted all my leaves. I just feel too overwhelmed and I just want to stay away from those emails.

It's important to remember that there is no ""right"" timeline for progression in life and it's okay to take things at your own pace. One surefire way to combat feelings of loneliness is to surround yourself with supportive communities. Whether that's joining clubs or attending events in your new home of NZ, or finding communities online of others who share similar experience - these can be potential spaces for comfort.

With regards to your workload, it's great that you have a supportive manager. Have you considered having an open conversation with him about your situation? Professional life can be overwhelming especially when you're dealing with personal battles. You might want to explore options like therapy sessions to better handle your stress.

It's commendable that you've been making an effort with gym and such. Remember, it's okay to slip sometimes - the important thing is you keep trying. You got this!

It might feel tough now, but remember, healing isn't linear. You've been strong for such a long time, remind yourself that it's okay to have bad days. Sending all my positive vibes your way. Stay strong and take care! ☀️🌈🌻🙌"	1	0	0	0.0006704330444335938	social media

Thanks for reading 😊"	"Hello! 🙋‍♀️

First off, I want to express my genuine admiration for the strength you've shown by moving to a new country, pursuing your education, and coming out as who you truly are. It sounds like you've navigated an ocean of change and upheaval, and simply by sharing your story here, you show a resolve to keep moving forward. 

It's important to remember that feeling low, especially around anniversaries of traumatic events, is completely normal and a part of the healing process. You are not alone in these feelings, and it's okay to take the time you need to grieve and recoup. 

Taking steps to manage your workload is key in this time. If your manager is supportive as you've mentioned, can you possibly arrange for a discussion about how you're feeling, and explore ways to manage your inbox stress? This could be delegation, prioritization, or even specific ""inbox time"" scheduled for you to catch up. Remember that you have the right to safeguard your mental health in the workplace!

In terms of the ""consistent inconsistency"", it might be helpful to confer with your therapist or a mental health professional about strategies to develop sustainable and manageable routines. Remember that progress is not linear, and it's okay to have ""off days"". Small changes can often lead to big results over time, so don't pressure yourself to do everything perfectly.

Connecting with others can really help too. If you feel comfortable doing so, try to reach out to your friends when you're feeling low. They may not be able to 'fix' things for you, but sometimes simply sharing your thoughts and feelings can be incredibly therapeutic and provide a sense of relief.

Finally, remember it's great you're working on yourself and your mental health - it might not always feel like it, but every step you're taking towards addressing your struggles is a win. Keep pushing through, brighter days will find you!

Take care, my friend. 💙

Thanks for reading 😊"	"Hey there, thank you for having the courage to open up about your feelings and struggles on this platform. I'm genuinely sorry to hear about the tough time you're going through. Losing parents is profoundly challenging, especially this young, and adjusting to a new life in a different country can feed into feelings of loneliness and depression.

It sounds like you've been through a rollercoaster of emotions lately, especially due to recent events such as coming out and saying no to an arranged marriage, as well as dealing with the anniversary of your father's passing. These are all significant life events that would naturally affect anyone's emotional state and it's okay to struggle through them.

Returning to the workplace issue, sometimes it can be beneficial to confide in a work colleague or superior about your mental health struggles. Given that your manger is supportive, if you feel comfortable, perhaps you could discuss your struggle to manage your workload during these difficult times.

Remember, mental health is just as important as physical health. You have done well by recognizing your own inconsistencies and taking action to work through them. That alone is a significant first step. It's okay if you sometimes stumble -- we all do. Your journey isn't a straight road; think of it more as a winding path with occasional bumps.

It might be beneficial to engage in therapy, self-care activities, meditation or perhaps find a support group or club around something you are passionate about. This could be a way to meet new people and reduce feelings of loneliness. 

Life is a fluctuating experience; some days are good, others not so much. Inconsistency is a part of that journey. It's important to be patient with yourself and give yourself as much time as you need to heal and find solid ground. Remember, feelings are just visitors. They come and they go. Hold on, and keep doing your best, one day at a time."	2	0	0	0.0006641745567321777	forum with demographics

Thanks for reading 😊"	"Hello,

First and foremost, remember you're absolutely not alone, even if it might physically feel that way at times. Your feelings of being overwhelmed, and your response to grief are very natural and are shared by many who have faced similar situations.

Experiencing a transition in a foreign land, coupled with personal loss and changes in your identity, can be very challenging. It is great that you are seeking help and reaching out to people here. It's an important step towards dealing with these emotions.

Try connecting with your tight-knit group of friends and lean on them for comfort. Given that they know and accept you for who you are, they'd be a good source of strength and distraction when you need it most.

Also, it might be beneficial for you to seek professional help by reaching out to a mental health counselor or a therapist. This is nothing to be ashamed about. They can provide important coping mechanisms and strategies to deal with your workload, loneliness, and grief. Workplaces often have Employee Assistance Programmes (EAP) that can offer confidential counseling and support free of charge.

In terms of dealing with your workload, take small steps. Perhaps begin by setting specific and achievable goals for yourself each day, and celebrate small victories. It's okay to have periods of inconsistencies. What matters more is the fact that you recognise your areas of improvement and actively making efforts towards it.

As a fellow Indian and an expat, I can understand how cultural elements mixed with the personal transitions in your life can feel overwhelming. There is also a very open and accepting LGBTQ+ community in NZ which can help you feel more at home.

Finally, regular exercise, a balanced diet, and adequate sleep, which you seem to be working towards, can help immensely in managing your mental health.

You are much stronger than you believe you are. Remember this journey is not a race, it's about taking one step at a time. Take care.

Sending you good vibes. 🌈🙏😊"	1	0	0	0.0007179379463195801	forum w/o demographics

I'm 25M, an Indian, fair, skinny, if all these details can be any relevant.

Since childhood, I've noticed that people takes me for granted. Let me explain few cases:

- My schooling happened in hostel where my hostelmates molested me as we used to sleep together (many instances)
- Few months back, one of my good classmates from school asked me for my CTC, I told him some random number less than my actual CTC, and asked him not to tell this to anybody, but later in a school reunion I got to know that everyone from my schoolmates knew my salary, I didn't confronted that friend as I never talked to him after that get together.
- Few months back, I went to a trip and explicitly asked my mom to not tell any relatives about my trip but she ended up telling to so many relatives and that pisses me off
- I occasionally visit a local food vendor, kind of their regular customer, I've been noticing for few times that he takes time to serve me food, like even when those who come after me, he serves them and then me.

All these instances made me adamant to not believe anybody, and I'm having trust issues.

I think there's something wrong in my personality, that I'm not aware of, that makes people take me for granted as if I can't do any shit, my words have no respect or what!?

Is it related to my body or personality?


Please help. How to remove this trait?"	So sorry to hear you're going through this, it truly sounds tough. While I can't solve your problem completely, I can suggest a few steps. First off, consider counseling or therapy to address past traumas & current trust issues. They're highly qualified and specialized in these areas. Secondly, work on setting clear boundaries with friends and family members. Explain the importance of your privacy in a calm manner. Lastly, try to assert yourself more, express your feelings openly - without being confrontational - when you feel taken for granted. And remember, it's not your fault. It's easy to blame ourselves but it's more about the other person's lack of respect for boundaries. Stay strong. 💪💜	2	0	0	0.0011001825332641602	social media

Please help. How to remove this trait?"	"I'm sorry to hear that you're going through such a tough time, it sounds like you've had to endure quite a few deep betrayals of your trust and this can be extremely challenging to navigate through. Please know, the experiences you've had do not reflect your worth or your capability as an individual.

The actions of others, especially when they're hurtful, often say more about them than about you. The situations you've described could imply issues with boundaries and trust, but that's not an inherent problem with yourself. Rather, it might be about learning how to effectively set boundaries.

There are some steps you can take to tackle this. 

1. **Learn to Assert Yourself**: Assertive communication is a key way to help earn respect and ensure your needs are met. It involves expressing your feelings, wants, and needs clearly and respectfully.
 
2. **Set Boundaries**: Identify what your limits are in relationships (family, friends, or otherwise). These are rules or guidelines for how you expect to be treated, communicated with, or respected. Once you've identified your needs, it's important to communicate them clearly.
   
3. **Find Support**: Connect with mental health professionals or support groups where you can share your feelings and experiences. They can provide guidance, practical strategies, and techniques on how to navigate difficult situations and relationships.
   
4. **Work on Building Self-confidence and Self-respect**: It’s very possible that building a strong sense of self-worth and respect can help in these situations.
   
While these steps can help, it's pertinent that you talk to a professional about what you're going through. They can help make sense of your experiences, work with you to develop a plan of action and provide the support you need."	2	0	0	0.0007434487342834473	forum with demographics

"TL;DR: Going low contact with nmom. Need help forming message if and when she reaches out. Message is last paragraph of post. Advice of self-care and not relapsing/holding strong welcome too. Thanks! <3


I’m (32F) both bio parents are narcissistic. Parents split when I was 14 due to domestic violence. Dad was going to murder all of us and kill himself but I called the cops. They let me be the scapegoat and let the culture (we’re Southeast Asian, I’m American born) blame me for the end of their marriage. 

I’m the oldest of 4. I was treated as a spouse, mom/parent, therapist, teacher to my mom and my siblings. I parented myself and moved out when I was 18. Received more backlash from the culture.

Nmom currently remarried for about 1.5 years to someone from our culture. Hasn’t told him about her marriage to my ndad. He believes she did her best as a single mom and that she is a great mother. She values my brothers more. Has always treated me like I was an adult. Doesn’t give me any credit for helping her and raising my siblings. When my siblings misbehave, she tells me I failed parenting them. 

She blames me for everything that doesn’t go well in her life. I was physically, emotionally, and mentally abused. She takes credit for my accomplishments because I thought if I was perfect I would be loved and enough. But of course, not the reality. 

Went from being an obedient perfectionist child, to codependent, a people pleaser, emotionally regulating myself, emotionally regulating joy for my family, to over a decade of therapy and healing to acceptance. And I am now chronically ill. My partner, a phenomenal person and friend, has helped significantly with finances and has been supportive of my health and healing.

My partner, therapist, good friends, and acupuncturist say that I am a certified badass who moves with intention, compassion, and authenticity and I am not to be blamed for my parents’ and my siblings’ dysfunctions. 

Had another blow out from my nmom on Mother’s Day where she blamed me for all the things not going right in her life. She demanded cake and gifts for being “a damn good mother” and curiously, I asked what has she done that was motherly recently and she said “nothing” but that she does so much for everyone (her husband, in-laws and adult step-kids, and extended family) she deserves it. 

My sister, my partner and I took her and her husband to dinner on Mother’s Day despite her saying she was too busy. Went back to their house and the conversation turned sour. My therapist calls it cognitive distortion, where my nmom heard something that was never said. She berated and blamed me and then sent a non-apology apology a few days later in a group text with my siblings pretty much self-pitying. No direct apology to me. Didn’t expect there would be one.

Nmom’s husband was shocked at how calm I was throughout this but I believe I have reached my threshold. My heart doesn’t hurt like it used to anymore. My partner and I joke “oh, it was just another Sunday with my mom.”

It’s been over a week and talked to my therapist about working on a message to send my mom if and when she reaches out about boundaries and limited contact with her. Therapist said to be assertive but also hold space for myself. I’m pretty straightforward so this is what I have so far. What do y’all think? Thanks in advance! :-)

Message:

Mom, I do not feel safe and comfortable around you. You need to get help. Until you get better, our relationship will not continue. It is not okay how you have treated me."	Hey there, sending strength and light to you in this tough situation. The message you wrote seems like a good start, but aiming to be more specific about boundaries might be helpful. Stand firm, let her know in no uncertain terms what behaviors are not acceptable. Remember your wellness and peace of mind comes first, don't hesitate to cut the conversation if it's affecting your mental health. A loving relationship should be mutual, respectful and nurturing, and if it isn't, you're absolutely justified to step back, take care of yourself and expect better. Keep practicing self-care and surround yourself with those who truly care about you. You're a certified badass indeed! Keep being awesome and shine on. 😊💜✨	1	0	0	0.002346336841583252	social media

I’m (32F) both bio parents are narcissistic. Parents split when I was 14 due to domestic violence. Dad was going to murder all of us and kill himself but I called the cops. They let me be the scapegoat and let the culture (we’re Southeast Asian, I’m American born) blame me for the end of their marriage. 

I’m the oldest of 4. I was treated as a spouse, mom/parent, therapist, teacher to my mom and my siblings. I parented myself and moved out when I was 18. Received more backlash from the culture.

Nmom currently remarried for about 1.5 years to someone from our culture. Hasn’t told him about her marriage to my ndad. He believes she did her best as a single mom and that she is a great mother. She values my brothers more. Has always treated me like I was an adult. Doesn’t give me any credit for helping her and raising my siblings. When my siblings misbehave, she tells me I failed parenting them. 

She blames me for everything that doesn’t go well in her life. I was physically, emotionally, and mentally abused. She takes credit for my accomplishments because I thought if I was perfect I would be loved and enough. But of course, not the reality. 

Went from being an obedient perfectionist child, to codependent, a people pleaser, emotionally regulating myself, emotionally regulating joy for my family, to over a decade of therapy and healing to acceptance. And I am now chronically ill. My partner, a phenomenal person and friend, has helped significantly with finances and has been supportive of my health and healing.

Message:

Mom, I do not feel safe and comfortable around you. You need to get help. Until you get better, our relationship will not continue. It is not okay how you have treated me."	"Firstly, I am truly sorry to hear about your experiences. The process of setting boundaries with abusive family members is difficult, but often crucial for your mental wellbeing. The message you crafted speaks from the heart and is strong, assertive, and lays clear boundaries – all important aspects. 

If it feels appropriate, you might want to add more about what the ""until you get better"" part means for you, such as therapy or a genuine apology, to avoid confusion or misinterpretation. This could also help manage your expectations about your relationship changing.

In terms of self-care and staying strong, it's important to continue nurturing yourself physically, emotionally and mentally. Lean on your support system, which seems wonderful and strong. Regularly engage in activities that ground you and bring you joy. 

Remember, setting boundaries does not make you a bad person. It is okay to love from a distance, and it is okay to prioritize your own healing, safety, and peace. Trust in the steps you are taking, and remember – you are strong, you are inspiring, and you are most definitely worthy."	2	0	0	0.0006929636001586914	mental health forum

Message:

"Your message to your mother is a powerful, self-affirming step toward setting the boundaries necessary for your healing and peace. If you're concerned about being too harsh, consider adding a note about your own needs being the force behind your decision rather than focusing primarily on her behaviors, like: ""Mom, for my own wellbeing and mental health, I have decided that I need to have limited contact with you. This has been my decision based on many difficult experiences and it's important that it is respected."" Whichever final phrasing you go with, I applaud your bravery in advocating for yourself and setting firm boundaries. Remember, it's okay to prioritize your own mental health and well-being. You are enough. Please continue leaning on your support system, working with your therapist, and practicing self-care as you navigate this challenging time."	0	0	0	0.0007547140121459961	clinician

Message:

Mom, I do not feel safe and comfortable around you. You need to get help. Until you get better, our relationship will not continue. It is not okay how you have treated me."	"You are truly a strong and resilient individual, having navigated through such challenging circumstances, and it's clear that you're not alone. It's great to hear that your partner, therapist, friends, and acupuncturist are there to support you.

Wishing you to know that setting boundaries is healthy, vital, and necessary for your well-being—physically, mentally, and emotionally—you must prioritize your own self-care.

Your proposed message to your mother is clear and straightforward, which fits the description of being assertive and holding space for yourself. It maintains your position without getting too confrontational, which could provoke a negative response. 

It may be beneficial to rephrase the 'You need to get help' line to 'I encourage you to seek support or help' to make it sound less confrontational and more of a suggestion. Besides, it underlines that it's her responsibility to take action for her own healing.

Remember, it's your right to keep your contact at a level that feels best to you and allows you to support your own mental health. Feel free to adjust your boundaries as you see fit and necessary.

Lastly, it's essential that you continue to practice self-care. Prioritize your health, continue therapy, meditate, or engage in any interest that brings you joy and peace. This can work as a counterbalancing force against the stress and emotional trauma from dealing with a narcissistic parent.

You got this! Best of luck on your journey, and remember, you are not alone."	1	0	0	0.0008611679077148438	forum with demographics

"I'm really sorry to hear about your experience. You have demonstrated incredible strength and resilience and it's evident that you have made tough decisions for your own mental health and well-being. That must have been especially challenging given your cultural background.

Regarding the message, I believe it stands strong and firm while also expressing your emotional perspective. You've clearly stated your boundaries, these being that she must seek help and improve before you can continue your relationship.

Remember, it's important that you take care of your own mental health first. The journey towards self-care and pulling ourselves out of co-dependency involves setting boundaries, as you're currently doing. It is okay to say 'no' and to prioritize your own mental health. Keep reminding yourself, especially in those moments where you may feel like relapsing, that it's okay to need and take space for your own safety and wellbeing.

Also, don't forget to lean on the supportive folks you're lucky to have in your life: your partner, friends, and your therapist. They will be there to support and validate you, especially given this journey might be tough.

You're doing great, remember that you're never alone in this journey. My heart goes out to you. Keep going and keep being the badass you are!"	2	0	0	0.0007963776588439941	forum w/o demographics
