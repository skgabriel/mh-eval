"Hey there! I understand you're going through a difficult phase, while handling this level of pressure can be hard, it's never too late to start. Set up a study schedule, break your tasks into manageable parts. It might help to start with subjects or chapters you find interesting. Use tools to manage your focus such as the 'Pomodoro technique'. Remember it's okay to take short breaks. 

Discipline becomes key in such situations – make sure you're eating healthily, staying hydrated, and getting the sleep your body needs. It's also crucial to find healthy methods of stress management; exercise can be a real mood booster!

Don't hesitate to seek professional help with your mental health, talking to a counselor at school could be a start. If your school teachers are informed, they'll likely help you plan a study schedule too. You're not alone. You will overcome this, step by step. The strength is within you. All the very best! 🌼🔬📘🌟"	1	0	0	0.0006885528564453125	social media

"Hey there, thank you for reaching out. It sounds like you're struggling to keep up with your school work and it's causing both depression and a lot of anxiety. Prioritizing your mental wellbeing is key here. However, please remember that it's completely normal to lose focus sometimes, especially when you're feeling overwhelmed.

First, break down your tasks into more manageable pieces. Look at your list of backlogged chapters and homework, pick one thing, and focus only on that. Try the Pomodoro Technique; study hard for 25 minutes, then take a 5-minute break, repeat. This approach can help increase your focus and make your work feel less daunting.

Next, have an open and honest discussion with your father. Explain your struggles, and maybe suggest coming up with a focused study plan together. He might not realize how much pressure you're under and might be able to offer some help and understanding.

Lastly, remember to take care of yourself. Get enough sleep, eat healthy, and integrate some form of exercise into your daily routine.

Importantly, do seek a mental health professional or counselor in your school to discuss your depression. You don't have to go through this alone. If you're in India, you can reach out to Vandrevala Foundation Helpline (1860 2662 345) for help. Stay strong, you've been through challenging times before, and you will get through this too!"	1	0	0	0.0007384419441223145	mental health forum

"Hey, I understand you're going through a really challenging time right now. It's totally normal to feel overwhelmed and stressed during times like this. You're a young student in a crucial year of study and it's alright to feel this way as the JEE ADV is known to be a tough exam.

It seems like there's a lot of pressure from your father and teachers which isn't helping your situation. I'd recommend having an open discussion with them about how you're feeling. Let them know you're struggling with focusing and are feeling the pressure. They may not fully understand what you're going through and it's important for them to know to better support you.

Additionally, it might be helpful to seek professional help such as a counsellor or psychologist. They can provide techniques and strategies for managing stress, concentration, motivation, and overall mental health issues such as depression. It's okay to ask for help when you're feeling this low.

Remember, it's not about how much time you've wasted but about how you're going to make the most of the time you have now. Break your studying into small parts. Try the Pomodoro technique which involves studying for a set amount of time (like 25 minutes), then taking a 5 minute break. Review your study technique; maybe there's a more efficient way for you to learn and retain information.

Please don't let these challenges define you. We all stumble in life but the key is to learn, grow, and start anew."	1	0	0	0.0008181929588317871	forum w/o demographics
"Sometime I tend to be a bit hypochondriac and I know that. But for some reason it doesn't help much. 

When I walk home I usually pass a house with a very cute and playful, young German Shepard (maybe a year old? I don't really know). Sometimes this dog drops out one of its toys to someone to throw it back, so it can chase it, bring back and throw it out between the bars of the fence again. Yesterday the dog sat behind the fence again, waiting for someone. Since the ball, the dog usually drops out, were not really intact to say the least, it tried to drop out a very soft and chewy, yellow toy. The poor dog had a hard time throwing it out, because it always stuck to the bars of the fence, so it started to furiously chew the toy for some reason. I thought he just trying to drop it out, so when he brought the toy close to the fence I tried to take it away (the dog seems very friendly, so I didn't think it was a bad idea). As I tried to take the toy away the dog accidentally ""bit"" me. I wrote ""bit"" me because it didn't even break the skin, and the ""bite mark"" literally just looked like when you press your teeth to finger harder. 

Ever since I'm a bit nervous about getting rabies, because even though to get infected, the bite has to break the skin, but during the winter my eczema on my hand gets a lot worse, and my hand is usually full of micro cuts and small wounds, so maybe the dog's saliva got into one of the many wounds on my hand. I know it sounds stupid, but when I tell you all the things that are against me getting rabies, I will sound straight retarded to even worry about it. 

I live in Slovakia (near Bratislava). When your dog grow older than 3 month, you have to vaccinate it against rabies. It's mandatory. (But my thoughts says what if the owner failed to do that?)

Second my country is almost rabies free. Only the eastern part of the country has a very few rabies cases every few years (and even these infected wild or stray animals mostly are from Poland and Ukraine, and just crossed the border). I don't think the western part of the country where I'm from had a single rabid animal in the last 5 years (probably even much more). I read in an article that the last man who died of rabies, died in 1990. So in 32 years, no deaths of rabies. But my thoughts says what if it just wasn't in the news, but did happened? 

Why am I like this?"	Hey there, it sounds like you're dealing with a lot of anxiety right now! It's completely normal to worry about your health, especially when bites can be dangerous. However, from what you've described, the chances of you contracting rabies in your situation are incredibly small. Rabies mainly transmits through deep bite wounds and the virus doesn't survive long outside the host's body (like on a dog toy). Plus, it sounds like your country has a robust vaccination program for pets. Try speaking to a medical professional to alleviate your fears, or perhaps reach out to the dog's owner for vaccination confirmation. In the future, consider bringing your own toy to play with the dog to avoid such accidents. Remember, it's okay to seek professional help to manage your health-related anxiety - you're not alone in this. Take care!	1	0	0	0.0017014145851135254	social media

Why am I like this?"	"Hi there, it sounds like you're dealing with quite a bit of anxiety, and certainly, reminding yourself that you are prone to hypochondriac tendencies can be a minor comfort. 

From your description, it sounds like the likelihood of you contracting rabies from this encounter seems exceedingly low. Slovakia has strong policies for pet immunizations and it has an impressive history of keeping rabies at bay, as evidenced by the fact that no rabid animals were reported in your part of the country for over five years. While hypotheticals can stir worry, the observed facts present a safer image.

Nevertheless, if you're still feeling anxious, there are options you can explore. Consider consulting a healthcare professional for reassurance. Just a simple call or appointment to address your concerns can often alleviate the tension you may be feeling.

It's also vital to talk about these anxieties, so well done reaching out. In the future, you may want to consider consulting a therapist or counselor who can provide strategies to manage your fears effectively. 

In the meantime, try mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) techniques. Guided meditations or breathing exercises can help calm a racing mind. Sometimes, simply acknowledging your fears and not judging them can also help to lessen their intensity. 

Remember, it's completely normal to worry about our health, especially in today's climate. Please take care of yourself both physically and mentally.

Why am I like this?"	"Hi there, it sounds like you're dealing with a lot of anxiety right now, which is tough. What you're feeling is valid, even if it feels far-fetched. Anxiety often leads us to play out worst-case scenarios in our heads, even if they're unlikely. 

In your case, even though you're fully aware of the low risk of contracting rabies from your interaction with the dog, the ""what ifs"" keep piling up. These are symptoms of health anxiety, which is when worry about your health becomes obsessive and is a form of anxiety disorder. 

It's normal to consider the possibility of danger or illness, but when these thoughts become intrusive and overwhelming, that's when they can be problematic. One strategy is to practice mindfulness, which involves presence in the moment and acceptance of things as they are. When you notice anxious thoughts about your health creeping in, acknowledge them without judgment, and then purposefully redirect your attention to something else, like your breath or a nearby object.

Reaching out to a mental health professional in your own area might be helpful for you. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is usually effective for health anxiety. It can provide you with tools to manage the anxiety and shift negative thought patterns. 

Though I'm unable to provide direct assistance, I hope this preliminary guidance is helpful, and encourages you to reach out to a specialist who can provide you with local resources. It's important to remember that it's okay to ask for help. You're not alone in this."	1	0	0	0.0013020038604736328	clinician

Why am I like this?"	"Hey there, 

It’s okay to have fears and concerns about health, especially when you're dealing with something as unpleasant as a perceived dog bite. It's our brain's way of being precautionary and it's quite natural. It’s clear that you are highly knowledgeable and have done your research about your fear of rabies, which is commendable. However, your anxiety seems to be getting the better of you, despite the odds being in your favor. 

Your fears of the dog's owner not vaccinating, a misreported rabies case, or health implications because of your eczema are understandable, but it's essential to realize that these are ""what ifs"" and not ""what is"". The truth is, the health system and rules are put in place for a reason and they are generally reliable. It's highly likely that the dog has been vaccinated, especially given the mandatory regulations in Slovakia.

Even though it's easier said than done, it might help if you shifted your focus onto the things that are within your control, instead of what isn’t. Maybe you can use this experience to discuss with your doctor about your anxieties, and if needed, get immunized against rabies, not because you're at risk, but to ease your anxiety. 

Remember, a healthy amount of concern is very different from persistent anxiety, and it's okay to reach out to professionals. Maybe consider therapy or counselling to help deal with this hypochondria. 

You're not alone in feeling this way, and reaching out for help is a brave step. Take care of yourself. You're doing just fine."	1	0	0	0.002405822277069092	forum with demographics

The situation with the dog does sound a bit stressful. However, it's important to remember that in Slovakia, where you live, it's mandatory to have pets vaccinated against rabies once they are older than 3 months, so it's highly likely that this German Shepard is vaccinated. Also, your geographical location near Bratislava, which falls under a mostly rabies-free zone, further reduces any risk of you getting infected.

Feeling worried and overthinking is a part of anxiety disorders like hypochondria. However, it's important in these situations to try and rely on factual information. Even though it is completely natural to have these concerns, remember to ground yourself in the reality that the facts present. Based on what you've described, it is highly unlikely you contracted rabies from the dog.

Remember you can always consult a healthcare professional if your concerns continue to bother you or if your eczema has become worse due to cold weather or stress.

It might also be worthwhile to seek professional support for addressing your hypochondria. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy has been seen to be very effective with such conditions. In the meantime, try to practice mindfulness-based techniques to help manage your fears and anxieties – deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, or even calling a friend or family member to divert your mind. 

You're doing well by acknowledging your fear rather than suppressing it. Please do reach out and keep us updated. Always here to support you."	2	0	0	0.0016551017761230469	forum w/o demographics

I (23F) am lost and I don’t know what to do anymore. It all started in high school, long story short I stopped studying and barely passed my classes, in a miracle I got into a good university with a good 5 year program (thanks to the system of the country I live in). The first semester it was going okay til it wasn’t, I was failing everything, fast forward to the second and I was failing everything again, I just wasn’t studying, going to lectures wasn’t helping, all i did was my lab work and assignment but failed every exam. Sure I’m not really interested in what I'm studying but that’s absolutely not as important as me failing my classes. In the fourth semester I got into academic probation, I still couldn’t study enough to get through it so I got into a second probation, basically a whole year of being out of school. By some miracle I passed the class I needed to get in school again and went on to the fifth semester, I passed nothing in that one except the assignments. Got into probation a 3rd time (this semester) and just now found out I will be in probation this next semester too. So basically as a 5 year program, all my friends are graduating this year while I'm two years behind and will be graduating in the next 3 years. And I haven’t passed any exam in the last two years so I have 10 unfinished courses. I don’t know what’s wrong with me, if I'm lazy, if I don’t care. I thought it could be adhd and I went to a psychologist but they told me they couldn’t test me since they prioritise minors and my issue didn't seem to be urgent since I've gotten into university and the wait list is at least 6 years and if I wanted to get tested NOW I'd have to go the private route and pay around 3k dollars which i can't do right now. 

My parents ( I live with them cause we’re asian etc) are both doctors so imagine the expectations they both have on me. I haven’t told them everything though. They know about my first probation but not the second, they know about the third current one but not this upcoming one this next semester. And they don’t know about the failed 10 courses either. I wanted to hide it from them because I believed I could pass everything quietly and they’d never have to know but I dug a hole so deep for myself. I'll have to tell them about the next semester though because I can’t hide it in any way and I don’t know how I'm going to do it. They’re already disappointed that I'm behind and they’ll be so mad now. My mom doesn’t work because of mental health issues but my dad is in his late 60s and works. I live with them and he is basically providing for all of us, they all keep reminding me to graduate quick so I can easily stand on my feet, and maybe that we can move to a country where it's easier for them to work and make better than here because they're here with me just for my education. I feel so bad for my dad who goes to work everyday for us while I’ve been doing nothing just sitting on my ass for the past two years. He is getting old and I want to make things easier for them but I just can’t seem to study for the life of me. I wish I could tell them everything and then ask for help but I know I can’t because they’ll never forgive me, they’re nice to me after being mad about the probations and they still get me gifts and buy me stuff while I have this huge secret that I'm failing everything. If they find out they won’t trust me again.

I really don’t know what to do I wanna pass my classes and start new so bad but I keep telling myself that things will be different this time while nothing is ever changing. Maybe you’re gonna tell me I'm burnt out but no way, I’ve had 2 years of doing nothing but sitting at home sleeping, I don’t remember the last time I’ve studied consistently, maybe 10 years ago. I don’t know what I'm even expecting from here just a listening ear I guess. I want to get better, my brain has ideas as to how to but my body just won't listen to me."	Hang in there, first and foremost! This sounds like an overwhelmingly stressful situation and it's admirable that you're reaching out and trying to address it. Have you tried using a study method like Pomodoro technique, where you take regular short breaks and study in short chunks? You're not alone in feeling unmotivated to study - sometimes the pressure of expectations can muffle your own passion for learning. It could be helpful to find a counselor or life coach to help you set achievable goals and create a plan. Remember, it's okay to fail - failing doesn't make you a failure, it just means you need a different approach. As for your parents, it might be hard, but honesty really is the best policy in this case. Secrets only add to stress. Tell them how you feel, ask for their advice and show them you're trying. Good luck, and remember to be kind to yourself - you're only human! Stay strong! 💪🏼👩🏻‍🎓🌟💖	1	0	2	0.000810086727142334	social media

In the fourth semester I got into academic probation, I still couldn’t study enough to get through it so I got into a second probation, basically a whole year of being out of school. By some miracle I passed the class I needed to get in school again and went on to the fifth semester, I passed nothing in that one except the assignments. Got into probation a 3rd time (this semester) and just now found out I will be in probation this next semester too. So basically as a 5 year program, all my friends are graduating this year while I'm two years behind and will be graduating in the next 3 years. And I haven’t passed any exam in the last two years so I have 10 unfinished courses. I don’t know what’s wrong with me, if I'm lazy, if I don’t care. I thought it could be adhd and I went to a psychologist but they told me they couldn’t test me since they prioritise minors and my issue didn't seem to be urgent since I've gotten into university and the wait list is at least 6 years and if I wanted to get tested NOW I'd have to go the private route and pay around 3k dollars which i can't do right now. 

My parents ( I live with them cause we’re asian etc) are both doctors so imagine the expectations they both have on me. I haven’t told them everything though. They know about my first probation but not the second, they know about the third current one but not this upcoming one this next semester. And they don’t know about the failed 10 courses either. I wanted to hide it from them because I believed I could pass everything quietly and they’d never have to know but I dug a hole so deep for myself. I'll have to tell them about the next semester though because I can’t hide it in any way and I don’t know how I'm going to do it. They’re already disappointed that I'm behind and they’ll be so mad now. My mom doesn’t work because of mental health issues but my dad is in his late 60s and works. I live with them and he is basically providing for all of us, they all keep reminding me to graduate quick so I can easily stand on my feet, and maybe that we can move to a country where it's easier for them to work and make better than here because they're here with me just for my education. I feel so bad for my dad who goes to work everyday for us while I’ve been doing nothing just sitting on my ass for the past two years. He is getting old and I want to make things easier for them but I just can’t seem to study for the life of me. I wish I could tell them everything and then ask for help but I know I can’t because they’ll never forgive me, they’re nice to me after being mad about the probations and they still get me gifts and buy me stuff while I have this huge secret that I'm failing everything. If they find out they won’t trust me again.

I really don’t know what to do I wanna pass my classes and start new so bad but I keep telling myself that things will be different this time while nothing is ever changing. Maybe you’re gonna tell me I'm burnt out but no way, I’ve had 2 years of doing nothing but sitting at home sleeping, I don’t remember the last time I’ve studied consistently, maybe 10 years ago. I don’t know what I'm even expecting from here just a listening ear I guess. I want to get better, my brain has ideas as to how to but my body just won't listen to me."	"Hey there, 

First of all, I wanted to say that it's absolutely okay to feel overwhelmed and I can hear from your post how much you're struggling to find a way forward. It seems like you are dealing with a lot and it’s really tough.

With regards to your studies, it appears that part of the problem could be a lack of interest in what you’re actually studying. I would suggest taking some time to think about what you truly find interesting, because it can be extremely difficult to motivate yourself to study something that isn’t personally fulfilling or meaningful to you. 

Also, it seems like you may be struggling a bit with your mental health. Is there another mental health professional that you could go and talk to about your issues? While that psychologist might've been too busy for you, there are usually others out there who can help.

Concerning your parents, maybe it would help to have an open discussion with them regarding your struggles and fears. Maintaining this secret seems to be taking a toll, and it could be that by sharing your burden, the situation could become less stressful. 

Lastly, please try not to view your graduation in comparison to others. Everyone's journey is personal and individual, and will not look like anyone else's. You are doing the best you can, and it’s okay to take a bit longer. Life is not a race, and it’s never too late to start anew.

Remember: you're not alone in facing these challenges. Various people hit bumps along their academic path, it's perfectly okay. Please consider reaching out to peers, friends, or even academic counselors within your institution; often, they can provide academic and emotional support.

Take care."	1	0	0	0.0007717609405517578	mental health forum

"I'm really sorry to hear you're going through this. It sounds like you are carrying a lot of weight on your shoulders, particularly with the pressure from your parents' expectations and your continued struggle with academic achievements. One thing that comes to mind from what you wrote is that this situation can be extremely overwhelming, and it'll be important to break it down into manageable pieces.

Firstly, consider seeking guidance from your university counselling service. They're there to support students during their academic journey, and they might have valuable insights or resources that could be useful for you. If possible, also reach out to academic resources, like tutors or mentors who might be able to offer study ideas or help you understand your coursework better.

It's great if your schooling is important to you, but remember, your mental health and well-being should be your first priority. It's okay to give yourself time to figure out what you truly want, your interests and passions. It's not unusual to feel lost or unsure during your university years - many people go through it. 

Lastly, about telling your parents, it sounds very difficult, but the truth might lessen the burden you're feeling. It might be an idea to think collaboratively about potential solutions with them, they might surprise you with their understanding or suggestions. They are likely more invested in your wellbeing than in academic achievement.

You're not alone in this, and there are resources available for you. Please take care of yourself as best you can right now."	2	0	0	0.0006951093673706055	forum with demographics

"Hey, your feelings are valid and it sounds like you're going through a really tough time. It's important to remember though that it's totally okay to falter and make mistakes, we're all human. Regardless of cultural or societal pressures, you're still young and have time to figure out your path, and there's absolutely no rush to have everything figured out by now.

You've mentioned several times how you feel a significant amount of guilt and pressure from your parents expectations, but it might help if you tried to remember that your worth does not depend on academic success, and you are much more than your grades. 

It could also be beneficial to consider finding a student counselor or mentor in your university. They could potentially offer some guidance and additional resources to help you through. It might seem daunting, but opening up about your struggles to someone who could help is often the first step.

Moreover, if you suspect your struggles might be due to ADHD, it could be helpful to look for other avenues, maybe through your university, to get tested. A diagnosis could shed light on some of your obstacles and find ways to overcome them.

But most importantly remember, it's okay to ask for help, everyone at some point needs a bit of assistance and a listening ear. Be kind to you, as you're going through a lot right now. Take one step at a time.

It’s OK to not have a 'why' right now. You are in a period of growth, exploring yourself and your passions. Take some time off, travel, meet new people, learn about new cultures and most importantly, learn about yourself. In India, you have an ocean of possibilities this vast country is not a limitation but an opportunity. Find what interests you, and the 'why' will eventually reveal itself.

The feeling of not having direction is a heavy one, but let us remind ourselves that it's completely okay to feel lost and confused at times - it's part of being human. 

It's evident you've suffered a major setback, having to recalibrate your dreams from the USA to India isn't an easy transition. But remember, it does not define you, nor does it have to dictate your destiny. You have the power to remodel these situations into opportunities - it may be just the right time to explore new areas of passion and interest.

Perhaps all this could be a phase for self-exploration and introspection. Don't be hard on yourself for not having an immediate answer to your ""why."" It is okay to take time to understand who you are, what you want, and where you plan to go. The lack of a long-term goal is not a reflection of your worth, but simply a stepping stone to self-discovery.

And please remember, seeking professional help is never a sign of weakness. Speak to a therapist or psychologist if your feelings of hopelessness persist. They are trained to help and could provide you with useful tools to navigate your feelings.

Stay persistent, it's okay to take one step at a time. You are not alone in this and there is help available. Take care of yourself."	2	0	0	0.0006954669952392578	mental health forum

Working hard, training, and persevering are generally seen to be a path towards reaching personal goals, but it's important to remember that goals may often need to evolve, and that's not a bad thing. It can be a point for growth and self-discovery. When a dream or a goal changes or disappears, it can be seen as an opportunity to create a new goal or even redefine what success means to you.

It seems like your aspirations were set on the USA, but circumstances have changed and you're now confronting the reality of being in India for the foreseeable future. This can be a time of introspection, to explore what can you gain and explore in India. 

It's okay to feel like you're merely existing right now. Periods of transition can feel like that, but be sure to engage in practices of self-care and connect with others for support.

Remember, it's okay not to be okay sometimes, and it's okay not to know the next step. Take your time; things usually have a way of falling into place with a little bit of patience and effort. Consider talking about your feelings with a mental health professional, it can provide more personalized advice and strategies of coping with these moments of uncertainty."	1	0	0	0.0006282925605773926	clinician

It's totally normal to feel lost about your future, It's a common feeling many people in their 20s face. The purpose with which you charged forward with, for the USA and undergrad, has dissipated and it feels like the passion has left you. It’s okay, most of us face this period of emptiness where we simply don’t know where we’re headed. 

Your feelings are valid, but remember, it's okay if the ""why"" and purpose isn't clear to you at this very moment. It's okay if you just exist and live each day as it comes. Every person’s journey starts with a single step, even when you're not sure where you're going. 

For now, focus on your immediate needs like self care, good nutrition, exercise and talking to some trusted friends or family about your feelings. It can help more than you can imagine. 

Remember that it's okay to seek professional help as well, you aren't alone in this. A mental health professional can provide you with real tools to navigate these feelings.

Life has a way of leading you where you are meant to be, even if the journey seems hazy now. Don't pressure yourself in finding your whole life's purpose at once. It takes time, patience, and a lot of trial and errors. 

You're doing much better than you think you are. Believe in yourself. Change, as scary as it is, often leads to growth. You got this! 💪

"Most problems started in 2020. In March, the start of covid. I was sick (and i don't know the reason why) and my dad came, from the most southern province of the country back to discuss with me. He announced that the divorce i did not know about was gonna happen, and kinda after that day he just left to my step family. That's part one: the divorce. 
After a few months when we were all emotionally unstable i went to visit to their house and also sleep there. From 2020-2021 most of those events happened. There are a few key moments. There were moments where my step brother (2 then) and step sister (7), were pretty annoying. I hate them both. At some point in 2021 there was conflict and i got so mad i pointed a knife towards my step mother that i still hate. Since then was i not allowed to there anymore. That's the divorce part. 

Now for the school and crush part. So since 2020 I've had a crush on someone (gender unconfirmed) and we were friends, lifelong. Together with my childhood friend, we were the 3 Musketeers. But my crush began to hate on my friend, causing me to have to choose for 1. I chose my crush, not to realize she was already internet dating with people scattered across the world. So i changed my mind and chose my friend. After this change my crush began being extremely toxic and is now my enemy, also causing some bad traumas. 

The basic school: i was never a group's child. I'm not bullied, neither accepted. I didn't really have much friends, except 2 till now (IRL). Most others betrayed me. 

My mom: i live alone with my mom, and some conflicts made. Maybe this is just puberty, or Asian parenting. But i don't quite believe she really does love love me. 

The interneg saga: since fall 2022, I've been playing a lot of hypixel. I met someone (a girl) and she invited me to her SMP. I met a lot of friends and we had fun. Around september the SMP kinda died and nobody really joined anymore. I downloaded discord again, and begon chat with 2 of friends. The girl was really unactive on both discord and minecraft (she's only active at breaks apparently). The other friend was a 16 year old Austrian boy. He was the first internet friend. We were great friends. After that success, i began gaining more internet friends. I decided to recall my old youtube series SMP, and invited him, along with 3 other friends. After that success i opened a discord server for the friends too. More friends were coming. When at a rare moment, i realized i had feelings for the girl that invited me to the SMP (as she really knew me and accepted me, even helping me with my murder habit). Sadly she's still only online around school breaks. At some point at January, one of my internet friends invited a guy named Oz. He played on my creative server along with other friends. At one point he decided to be bad and destroy my steakhouse in game (almost). I banned him from both servers. Others disagreed, so a month later he re-appears. He then tried to grief. So he was banned again. Then a weird glitch happened to the server, and for no reason he was re-invited. A hacker was controlling him (unsure, great chance he lied). We ""solved"" the hacker, but then some conflict came. I said not so nice things to him, as nuking his country or that the hacker may come back to hack him and his family. The Austrian boy, was really scared out by this and left in neutrality. He thought i was going insane so unfriended me. He said i needed mental health help. 

What should i do. I don't think i have a bad life, but that's because i compare it to African starving children. Am i going through depression, puberty or is this normal?"	"Hey, I'm really sorry to hear about your struggles. It seems like you've been dealing with a lot of intense emotions and conflicts. Remember it's okay to not be okay and it's important to express your feelings and seek help when you need it. One crucial step could be talking to a therapist or a counselor at school. They're there to provide the needed life advice and mental health support. 

For the family issues, it might be worth trying to have honest conversations with your dad and mom about your feelings. As for your school situation, getting involved in clubs or extracurricular activities could be a pathway to creating new friendships. 

Managing online relationships and gaming can be tricky. You might want to focus on creating positive environments in your games and on your server, banning those who persistently cause trouble. If you have feelings for someone, consider expressing them honestly and kindly. As for your Austrian friend, maybe apologise sincerely for your actions if you think you were wrong. 

Your emotions are valid and nothing about this is easy. Depression is serious - anyone can face it, regardless of how ""good"" or ""bad"" they perceive their life to be. Don't hesitate to reach out to mental health professionals if you're feeling overwhelmed. Hope this helps, remember you're not alone in this!"	2	0	0	0.0012087225914001465	social media
"Most problems started in 2020. In March, the start of covid. I was sick (and i don't know the reason why) and my dad came, from the most southern province of the country back to discuss with me. He announced that the divorce i did not know about was gonna happen, and kinda after that day he just left to my step family. That's part one: the divorce. 
After a few months when we were all emotionally unstable i went to visit to their house and also sleep there. From 2020-2021 most of those events happened. There are a few key moments. There were moments where my step brother (2 then) and step sister (7), were pretty annoying. I hate them both. At some point in 2021 there was conflict and i got so mad i pointed a knife towards my step mother that i still hate. Since then was i not allowed to there anymore. That's the divorce part. 

Now for the school and crush part. So since 2020 I've had a crush on someone (gender unconfirmed) and we were friends, lifelong. Together with my childhood friend, we were the 3 Musketeers. But my crush began to hate on my friend, causing me to have to choose for 1. I chose my crush, not to realize she was already internet dating with people scattered across the world. So i changed my mind and chose my friend. After this change my crush began being extremely toxic and is now my enemy, also causing some bad traumas. 

The basic school: i was never a group's child. I'm not bullied, neither accepted. I didn't really have much friends, except 2 till now (IRL). Most others betrayed me. 

My mom: i live alone with my mom, and some conflicts made. Maybe this is just puberty, or Asian parenting. But i don't quite believe she really does love love me. 

The interneg saga: since fall 2022, I've been playing a lot of hypixel. I met someone (a girl) and she invited me to her SMP. I met a lot of friends and we had fun. Around september the SMP kinda died and nobody really joined anymore. I downloaded discord again, and begon chat with 2 of friends. The girl was really unactive on both discord and minecraft (she's only active at breaks apparently). The other friend was a 16 year old Austrian boy. He was the first internet friend. We were great friends. After that success, i began gaining more internet friends. I decided to recall my old youtube series SMP, and invited him, along with 3 other friends. After that success i opened a discord server for the friends too. More friends were coming. When at a rare moment, i realized i had feelings for the girl that invited me to the SMP (as she really knew me and accepted me, even helping me with my murder habit). Sadly she's still only online around school breaks. At some point at January, one of my internet friends invited a guy named Oz. He played on my creative server along with other friends. At one point he decided to be bad and destroy my steakhouse in game (almost). I banned him from both servers. Others disagreed, so a month later he re-appears. He then tried to grief.

Firstly, just want you to know that you are not alone and it's okay to feel confused. That's natural given everything you've been through.

You've been through some intense events, such as experiencing illness, your parents' divorce, conflicts with your step family, emotional shocks and interpersonal issues (with both your crush and closest friend). These experiences are intense for anyone, of any age or gender. It's not just puberty, and it seems like there's more going on than normal teenage struggles.

Comparing your life to others in drastically different circumstances, like starving children in Africa, won't help you understand your emotions better. Everyone's pain and struggles are unique, and it's okay to acknowledge your feelings without belittling them, regardless of someone else's hardships.

It's also quite evident from your post that you feel quite isolated. This can certainly contribute to feelings of sadness, anger, and confusion, which could be signs of depression. However, you must not diagnose yourself - seek help from a mental health professional. They can provide you with the appropriate resources and tools to navigate through your feelings better.

As for school issues and the conflict with your in-game friends, it's crucial to learn to respect others and their boundaries, even when you feel upset or wronged. This is a part of maturing and growing. Cutting ties with people who make you feel bad or angry can sometimes be the right thing to do.

Try to consider professional help, even if it's online. It could really help you sort through your feelings and give you a better perspective on things.

Take care of yourself. You are important, and remember it's okay to ask for help."	1	0	0	0.0008259415626525879	forum w/o demographics
"Hey, I'm a 16-and-a-half-year old, and I've just moved to the US (California specifically) from Japan (city with about 1 million people) after living there for 2.5 years.

So, to put some background, I lived about half of my life in Hong Kong in an international school and was attending middle school until early 2021 when we suddenly had to move to Japan, where my mom is from. Dad moved to Calfiornia in late 2022. The move and subsequent stay in Japan completely destroyed me, and today I suffer from severe depression due to the experience. I basically had zero personal development and was messed up there, losing much of my contact with my friends and all, alongside failing to integrate with Japanese society. Today I feel like I'm still 14.5 years old, and am extremely scared of growing up. The moving kept getting delayed and my mom tried to make me integrate with Japan because she didn't know how long we would stay there for.

The general attitude of my parents tends to be that ""IT's only 2.5 years! When you grow up, you'll see it as a short part of your life!"". However, my feeling is that I must live my teenage years now, or I must die. I simply do not see growing up as an option at all until I've at least experienced what it's like to be a teenager. My parents' dismissal just doesn't seem to make any sense at all to me. 

We are thinking about starting me in 10th grade instead of 11th this fall due to all of these problems, but my age is a scourge on trying to experience anything as a teen anymore. I've heard the quote ""Children only have one childhood"". I feel like the same can be said for adolescence, and I just don't get the appeal of anything if I'm supposed to grow up. I suffer from a multitude of problems from that experience, and I do not understand how I'm supposed to grow up.

I literally have no idea what to do, and I just don't know how this isn't just going to go further downhill for me. 

What do you guys think?

&#x200B;"	Hey there, it sounds like you've been through a lot with all the sudden moves and lifestyle changes. It's okay to feel overwhelmed and lost, given the circumstances. Please, consider seeking professional help for your depression. There are many resources available, especially in California. Definitely, take your time to adjust, it's okay to take a step back academically if necessary. Remember, you're not alone and there's no set timeline for personal development or 'being a teenager'. It can and will get better with time and support. Hang in there!	1	0	0	0.0006890296936035156	social media

&#x200B;"	"Hey there, it sounds like you're going through a really tough time, and that your feelings are very overwhelming right now. It's okay to feel this way, your feelings are completely valid. 

I think you're right in saying that adolescence is an important phase in life. The changes in one's body, mind, and environment can make it very hectic and sometimes stressful. 

Firstly, it's really brave of you to share this and reach out for advice. It might help to share these feelings with your parents if you haven't already done so. They might not fully understand the depth of your emotions, but they need to know how you're feeling in order to support you.

Secondly, it may be beneficial to seek professional help. A therapist or counselor could provide the support you need, especially one who specializes in teenage psychology. Making the transition fromJapan to California and adjusting to a new culture can be very tough on someone so young, and a professional could help you navigate those challenges. 

Remember that change is slow, and it's okay not to be okay. You're going through so many adjustments right now, and it's okay to take some time to get used to them. It's also completely normal to feel out of place or scared about growing up, but remember that every new stage of life brings new experiences and opportunities as well.

Lastly, joining clubs or communities around your interests might help. It can feel less lonely when you're surrounded by others who share your interests or have similar experiences. 

Remember, don't hesitate to reach out to those around you or even online communities like this one. You're not alone, and there are people ready to listen and help."	1	0	0	0.0007128119468688965	mental health forum

&#x200B;"	"Hello there,

Your feelings of confusion, frustration, and even hopelessness are entirely valid in circumstances like this. Moving, shifting between cultures, and emotional growth are all significant life transitions, and it's understandable why it's giving you a hard time. The teen years can be confusing and challenging under normal circumstances, and you've had to face them with even more complex issues layered on top. 

Amid all these challenges you're facing, it's crucial to take a breath, ground yourself to the present and understand that adolescence is a journey filled with trials and victories. It's not about rushing but about living each moment to its fullest, regardless of the specific age attached. Yes, you've lost some time but remember, life isn't a race; it's a personal journey where the pace varies for everyone. 

Try to express your concerns about your feelings of missed adolescence to your parents, if you feel comfortable. They might not understand entirely, but it's essential to communicate your feelings to them. Ideally, if possible, seek professional support, like a counselor or a psychiatrist, who can provide the appropriate guidance and support. Remember, it's okay to ask for help, and there's no specific deadline to have life experiences or to grow up. 

Connect with trusted friends and try to immerse yourself in experiences that you cherish, this will help you develop a sense of belonging and possibly make up for some of what you feel you've missed out on so far. Also, engage in activities that can aid personal development, like hobbies, sports, clubs, and volunteering. 

Please take each day one step at a time and remember to take care of yourself, both physically and emotionally. Your feelings are valid, and you are worthy of receiving the help you need. You're stronger than you give yourself credit for, and while these times may seem tough now, with time and the right support, you'll be able to navigate through this."	1	0	0	0.0006642937660217285	clinician

&#x200B;"	"Hello,

It seems like you're dealing with a lot of changes right now, and it's perfectly natural to feel overwhelmed and anxious in such situations. The rapid movement between cultures and countries might have induced a certain degree of disorientation and isolation -- it's remarkably challenging. Adolescence is a tender, crucial point in anyone's life, and feeling like you've missed out can be distressing. Many individuals, though, have diverse life experiences and trajectories, and it's not uncommon for people to feel they've missed out on certain life stages due to various reasons. It's crucial to remember that everyone has their own unique journey, and comparing yours with the 'norm' can sometimes be counterproductive. 

Commendably, you're already a step ahead by recognizing your feelings and expressing them. I'd recommend you consider professional help, such as seeing a therapist who can provide techniques and strategies tailored to your situation to help you cope. 

Your parents may not comprehend how you're feeling, which can be frustrating. However, try discussing it with them candidly if you can. Explain that what you're currently feeling is very real and intense for you and ask for their support. They may not fully understand, but their encouragement could be beneficial.

Also, remember there is no set timeline to experience certain feelings or stages. The idea of ""being a teenager"" can be experienced differently by each person and isn't strictly tied to specific ages. Nevertheless, start by embracing the small things - try joining local youth clubs, or participating in activities in your area to get a sense of community and friendship. You're in a new phase of life with an entirely new set of possibilities. You might struggle to find your footing now, but that's okay – it's part of your journey and makes you who you are.

Lastly, please remember that it's okay to not have all the answers now. Battles are fought one day at a time. Stay strong, and give yourself the credit and kindness you deserve through these tumultuous times."	1	0	0	0.0006804466247558594	forum with demographics
"Hey, I'm a 16-and-a-half-year old, and I've just moved to the US (California specifically) from Japan (city with about 1 million people) after living there for 2.5 years.

So, to put some background, I lived about half of my life in Hong Kong in an international school and was attending middle school until early 2021 when we suddenly had to move to Japan, where my mom is from. Dad moved to Calfiornia in late 2022. The move and subsequent stay in Japan completely destroyed me, and today I suffer from severe depression due to the experience. I basically had zero personal development and was messed up there, losing much of my contact with my friends and all, alongside failing to integrate with Japanese society. Today I feel like I'm still 14.5 years old, and am extremely scared of growing up. The moving kept getting delayed and my mom tried to make me integrate with Japan because she didn't know how long we would stay there for.

The general attitude of my parents tends to be that ""IT's only 2.5 years! When you grow up, you'll see it as a short part of your life!"". However, my feeling is that I must live my teenage years now, or I must die. I simply do not see growing up as an option at all until I've at least experienced what it's like to be a teenager. My parents' dismissal just doesn't seem to make any sense at all to me. 

We are thinking about starting me in 10th grade instead of 11th this fall due to all of these problems, but my age is a scourge on trying to experience anything as a teen anymore. I've heard the quote ""Children only have one childhood"". I feel like the same can be said for adolescence, and I just don't get the appeal of anything if I'm supposed to grow up. I suffer from a multitude of problems from that experience, and I do not understand how I'm supposed to grow up.

I literally have no idea what to do, and I just don't know how this isn't just going to go further downhill for me. 

What do you guys think?

&#x200B;"	"Firstly, I want to acknowledge the courage it takes to share your feelings in such an open and honest way. It sounds like you're going through a tough time, and I understand that your feelings of fear and anxiety about growing up are very real. Your transition from Japan to California, coupled with the pressure of integrating into a new society, clearly sits heavy with you.

You're right that adolescence is a unique and formative period, and missing out on it can feel tragic. However, remember that everyone's life journey is different. Some people have very distinct, typical teenage experiences, others don't. It doesn't make their lives less enriched or their growth less significant. 

Your feelings of being 'stuck' at 14.5 years old might be related to your severe depression that you mentioned. You don't have to navigate these feelings on your own, it's important to consider speaking to a professional about your concerns. A licensed psychologist or therapist could provide you with some practical coping strategies for your feelings of anxiety about the future.

As for school, there's no rush or set timeline, and starting in 10th grade instead of the 11th might give you more time to adjust and make social connections. Try engaging in activities that interest you, join clubs, or participate in sports, this could help you form bonds with other students and feel more integrated.

Remember, growth isn't linear, and it's okay to feel 'behind'. Your life isn't determined by the experiences you've missed but rather the ones you're yet to have. You can heal, develop, and relish in the freedom that comes with it. It's never too late to start gaining these experiences. Stay strong and don't hesitate on reaching out for some professional help."	1	0	0	0.0006638169288635254	forum w/o demographics
"I (18m) was sexually assaulted multiple times by my cousins in different occasions (26m and 28m) when I was 8 and they were 16 and 18. Hello everyone, I decided to tell you this story to get it off my chest. A bit of a backstory, my father is european and my mother is asian. Back in 2013 we went to my mother's country for a ""vacation"" that turned out to be an 8 year nightmare. There I met my extended family on my mother's side. Particularly my first cousin, let's call him Chris. Chris was the youngest of 2 siblings that were orphaned due to their mother being killed by their father and running away.

One day, he was babysitting me while my mum went to the casino to gamble. My other siblings went to my other cousin's house (not part of the story) to play with them. So I was left with him alone. I was playing with my tablet when he called me and told me to go to the bedroom because he is bored and wants to play a game. So as a naive 8 year old boy, I obliged.

He tells me to lay beside him so he can show me how to play this game. He taught me how to jerk off. A few moments later, he tells me to do the same for him. I said okay and did the same to him. 

One night, while we were sound asleep. He was laying beside me while my other siblings were in another bed, he started to sexually assault me. I woke up to a sharp pain, and him going full on me. I kept silent, thinking that he wanted to play at this late at night. This went on for a good 30 minutes where he finished and went back to sleep. This happened multiple times. 

I later discovered sex and realised that he was doing it to me. I questioned myself if I was gay and I was in denial, telling myself that I like women and I'm not gay. (I was bullied pretty early on for acting a bit feminine)

Now going to the other cousin. Let's call him Joe. He is my 2nd cousin and lived with my aunt while he was studying.

One day we went there for 3 days to visit them and so we met there. We played with my other cousins all day and when night fell and we went to sleep, I slept beside Joe.

I woke up to him feeling my butt while he takes my hand and puts it in his gentleman's area. I was afraid because he looked scary when we first met and so I remained silent and obliged at every motion he makes, he pushes me down, I go down. That went on the 2 nights that we were there. 

I was pretty traumatised and in denial because I am not gay, I like women. And so I kept it a secret.

3 years ago I left that one hell of a country to return back to the home country of my father. I was put on therapy but I didn't mention that I was sexually assaulted by Chris and Joe. And so I still bear the trauma right now.

I don't want to reveal it to my parents since they separated 6 years ago. Because I am alright at the moment. A few nights ago though, I accidentally overshared it with a friend and I kind off regret it but I couldn't help it. 

I feel a big weight off my chest has been relieved and I feel much better now. Thank you for reading."	So sorry you're dealing with this. It's amazing that you've come forward with your story - coming out with it will surely help others in similar situations. Keep talking to your therapist, they can provide the assistance needed. Reporting the abusers may be something else to consider, when you're ready for it. Remember, you're incredibly brave and no one can take that from you. And just in case you haven't heard it enough – it was never your fault, there's no correlation between the assault and your sexuality. Stay strong. 💪💜	2	0	0	0.002225220203399658	social media

You must be so strong to have held on to that kind of traumatic experience without sharing it. It's important to remember that what happened to you isn't your fault and doesn't define your sexual orientation. 

It also sounds like it could be really beneficial for you to talk about it in therapy. You've already made the first step towards healing by sharing your story here, and with your friend. Find a therapist that you can trust and feel comfortable with - it may take a few tries, and that's okay. They can provide coping techniques as well as professional guidance to further your healing process. 

Moreover, many survivors find it helpful to report their abuse at their own pace to people they trust in their personal circles – you should never feel obligated to do so, but know that your feelings and experiences are valid, and you have every right to share them if it would help you heal. 

Remember to take good care of yourself and reach out to hotlines for emotional support or crisis management like RAINN (the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network) in the U.S. or similar ones relevant to your country. 

Please take good care of yourself and remember that it's okay to reach out to people. You're not alone in this."	2	0	0	0.0011951923370361328	mental health forum

No one should ever have had to endure what you've experienced. It's brave of you to share your story here, it's an important step in moving towards healing. These incidents, it's important to note, are not a reflection of your identity or sexuality. You were taken advantage of in a situation where you should have been safe and cared for.

Firstly, it's commendable that you're seeking therapy; it's a crucial step in healing. While it's understandable that you may feel reluctant to share your experiences with your therapist, they are there to help you navigate these traumas and process your feelings in a safe and supportive environment. If you feel comfortable, try to open up to them about what you experienced. It could be extremely beneficial in creating a tailored approach to your recovery.

If you still feel uneasy about disclosing this to your therapist, you might consider reaching out to a hotline dedicated to supporting survivors of sexual assault. They have trained professionals who can provide confidential support and give advice on your next steps.

As for sharing the experience with your friend, it's completely natural to seek support from those close to you. Sharing things that are burdening you can help in reducing the weight the pain and memories carry. Don’t regret it if your friend provides you with the support you need.

Remember, it's okay to not be okay sometimes, and it's okay to ask for help. Don't blame yourself for what happened - you were a child who was exploited by people who were supposed to keep you safe. It was not your fault.

Take care of yourself. Surround yourself with supportive and understanding people; engage in activities you enjoy to bring some positivity into your environment. Make sure you are working on healing at your own pace. Do not rush it. You're not alone in this journey."	2	0	0	0.0009691715240478516	forum with demographics

It's incredibly brave of you to share these experiences. It's important to understand that what happened to you was not your fault and doesn't define your sexuality.

However, this doesn't make you gay, unless you feel attracted to men, which seems not to be the case based on your post. It appears that you were exploited by two family members who should have protected you. 

As someone who has experienced trauma, reaching out to the right support systems is very important. Though you're currently in therapy, it seems you're still struggling with these unresolved traumas. It might be beneficial to share these experiences with your therapist, they are equipped to provide you the tools to process these events. 

If you feel fear or shame about revealing these experiences, you might also consider seeking support from an organization that specifically works with survivors of sexual assault. They could provide you with the understanding and professional help you need to recover from this traumatic experience.

Lastly, remember that your safety and mental wellbeing are the most important things. It's normal to feel hesitant about revealing this to your parents, but if ever you feel it might help, they may surprise you by providing support. Continue to reach out and share when you feel comfortable, and remember that self-acceptance and recovery can take time. You're resilient and brave for coming this far and seeking help. Stay strong, know that you're not alone and always remember saying 'no' is your right. You are more than your past and these experiences.

"Trigger warning, close call (accident). You may skip.

Had a lot of bad thoughts these past few weeks, tough day at work, no breaks sa sermon kahit pag uwi.

I was riding my bike kanina sa Coastal, way above speed limit kasi its ""throttle therapy"".

I know its toxic, pea-brain strat kesa to talk it out. Hindi lang ako comfortable na magkwento ulit. It felt good, until it didn't.

Cruising at 106, tulala without knowing na may bump sa right side ng kalsada if you are riding southbound and nakalagpas na ng toll.

Nagulat buong katawang lupa ko, my handlebar wobbled. I thought I'm a goner. Tried to control it, my left hand lost its grip and I throttled it while leaning backwards para hindi lumala yung wobbling.

Eventually I gained control ulit before going up the ramp papuntang Las Piñas-Bacoor and pulled over shortly. I was shaking pagbaba ng bike, took me 2 hours bago ako umalis ng rest area na yon.

Umuwi ako ng bahay ng maayos, hindi lumagpas ng 30 takbo ko after what happened kahit 4 AM at walang katao-tao sa kalsada.

To kuya Lorenzo who checked up on me, thank you. Hindi ko man nakuha number mo, sobrang pasasalamat kong tumigil ka para kausapin ako at kamustahin.

Drive safe, friends. Don't be an asshole like me. Thanks."	Hey there, I'm sorry to hear you're having a rough time. It sounds really scary what you went through on your bike, but I'm relieved to hear you were able to regain control and no serious injuries took place. Throttle therapy may provide temporary relief, but it's not a good long term solution. It's okay not to share your story verbally, there are other ways to unload the burden, like writing in a private journal or expressing through art. Remember to take care of yourself both physically and mentally. We need to prioritize our mental health as much as our physical health. Riding safe and within the speed limit is non-negotiable, you matter to a lot of people more than you realize. Stay safe, my friend. And if you ever feel like talking, you have a community here that's ready to lend an ear. Take care. 💜💛	2	0	0	0.000812232494354248	social media

Taking unnecessary risks on a bike as a form of dealing with stress is not healthy behavior and it's great that you recognize that. You're not alone in this, most of us have reacted poorly to stress or anxiety at some point. Speaking openly about our problems can help release some of that built up tension and normalize the struggles we're facing.

Consider talking with a trusted friend, family member, or consider seeking professional help through a counselor or psychologist. It's okay not to feel ready to spill everything just yet, speaking when and about what you're comfortable with is what's important.

Take care on the roads, remember one mistake can lead to very serious consequences. Try to find a healthier outlet for your stress, such as aerobic exercises, yoga, or meditation. If you're struggling with negative thoughts, please consider reaching out to a mental health professional.

Remember, you're not alone, there's always someone ready to listen and help. Speak out when you're ready and take care of yourself."	2	0	0	0.0007761716842651367	mental health forum

Your feelings seem to be overwhelming you and I want to reassure you that it's okay to feel this way, but also remember that it's important to find safe outlets for these feelings. Throttle therapy may seem like a quick-fix, but as you've learned, it can be very risky and lead to even more anxiety. 

Instead, why not try physical exercise that's a bit safer, like jogging or perhaps yoga? Exercising can help release pent-up feelings and reduce anxiety. Adding some form of meditation to your routine could also help you decompress and explore your thoughts and feelings in a safe and controlled environment. 

I understand you're not comfortable discussing these feelings, and that's okay. You don't have to rush yourself. Everyone heals in their own time, and one day, you may find you're ready to share. 

Remember: You are important and your feelings are valid. It's okay to struggle sometimes, and it's okay to ask for help. Taking care of your mental health is just as important as your physical wellbeing. Please, stay safe!"	2	0	0	0.0007447600364685059	clinician

It's understandable you're feeling this way, particularly after having such a terrifying experience on your bike. Please remember, it's okay to discuss your feelings, even if it feels uncomfortable, and there are plenty of professionals who are trained to help you navigate through these difficult times. 

While ""throttle therapy"" might provide temporary relief, reaching out to professionals or even trusted friends and family can be instrumental in your emotional healing. Also, it's important to remember to prioritize your physical safety as well - speeding on a bike can be incredibly dangerous.

It was very brave of you to share your story, and I'm sure it will remind others to be careful on the road. I'm glad you're safe and that someone checked on you at that time.

It's clear just from your words that you're going through a lot right now. Stress at work can feel crushing at times, I can definitely relate to that. It's understandable to feel like you need an outlet for all of it. Biking, especially at high speeds, can seem like a cathartic way of releasing tension. But remember, safety always comes first. 

You've had a scare but thankfully, you're here now and able to tell your story. It's important to gain control not just of your bike but also of your emotions. Next time you're feeling overwhelmed, instead of trying to escape from the situation, why not take a step back? This could mean taking some time to yourself, doing some relaxation techniques such as deep breathing, yoga, or mindfulness, and of course reaching out to trusted friends or professionals.

Remember, opening up about your feelings doesn't mean you're weak. It takes a lot of courage to express oneself and even more to seek help. Kuya Lorenzo showed kindness and concern in your time of need. Let this instance remind you that help is there when you need it, and sometimes it comes from the most unexpected places. 

And lastly, never hesitate to reach out for professional mental health support. It's there for a reason, and taking care of your mental health is just as important as taking care of your physical health. Stay safe, friend."	1	2	0	0.0007882118225097656	forum w/o demographics

You're not alone in feeling anxious about exams - it's something that many of us go through. One thing to keep in mind is that everyone learns at a different pace and in different ways, so it's okay if you can't do things the way your friends do. 

Try to set aside some distraction-free time each day to focus on your revision. Break it down into manageable sections, maybe pick a couple of subjects each day. Being organized and having a game plan can help alleviate the anxiety of feeling unprepared. 

Can I suggest something? You may also want to focus more on understanding the concepts rather than memorizing information. Not only is this a more sustainable learning strategy, you might find that it alleviates some test-related anxiety too. 

If you're feeling really overwhelmed, it might be beneficial to speak to someone that you trust about your worries. It could be a friend, family member or even a counselor. Sometimes, just sharing our fears takes some of the weight off our shoulders. 

Please remember that not being as prepared as you hoped doesn't say anything about your intelligence. It just demonstrates that perhaps you were tied up with other commitments. You're not ""bobo."" You've simply hit a hiccup in your journey, which is quite normal.

Stay positive and believe in yourself. If law school is truly your dream, then remember that one exam is just a tiny step in the process, and even the hiccups serve to make you stronger and more resilient on this path.

Take care of yourself. We believe in you!"	1	0	0	0.001038193702697754	mental health forum

Remember, intelligence isn't solely about passing exams and it doesn't define your worth. Examinations don't test every aspect of what makes you ""you"". These are simply tools designed to challenge our ability to recall and apply information under pressure.

It's important firstly to not compare your study habits or techniques to those of your peers - different people learn and recall information differently. Your current anxiety might actually be a source of motivation to put some effective study strategies into action.

In terms of studying, it's better to study smarter rather than harder. Break down your study materials into manageable chunks, focus on understanding the concept instead of just memorizing the facts. Perhaps look into active revision techniques that engage more of your brain, such as teaching someone else, or explaining the topic in your own words.

Regarding your future, it's okay to feel uncertain about law school. It's a big step and therefore, understandably nerve-wracking. Speaking to people who have been in your position might help alleviate some of these concerns.

Remember, it's perfectly okay to struggle or even fail. It doesn't mean you're not smart or capable. It just means you're human. Lastly, consider speaking with a professional counselor as they can provide personal guidance to help you manage your anxiety and address your self-doubt. You're not alone in this, many people share your fears and worries. Remember to take care of your mental health alongside your studies. Best of luck."	1	0	0	0.000817716121673584	clinician

Exam stress is completely normal, but it's crucial to manage it in a way that's productive and doesn't affect your self-worth. Remember that the outcome of an exam doesn't define your intelligence or worth.

Firstly, don't compare yourself to your friends. Everyone has different strengths, and the pace at which they study or their performance doesn't reflect on yours. 

Try to set aside some time for studying, even if it's not as much as you'd like. A bit of revision is always better than none. 

When you start doubting your abilities, challenge those thoughts. Use each challenging problem as a learning opportunity. No one is born knowing all the answers, so it's OK not to know everything straight away. 

It might also be a good idea to talk about your worries with someone you trust, be it friends, family or even a counselor. Sometimes, our fears and anxieties feel a lot less overwhelming when we share them with others. 

Regarding your future plans to go to law school, try to focus on the present. Don't let the fear of future challenges hold you back from your dreams. Remember, you're not alone, and each step of the journey teaches us something valuable.

When it comes to studying, remember that it's not just about the quantity of time, but the quality. Even if it's just a few hours, making sure those hours are well-spent is important: no distractions, rest well before the study session, and take breaks when needed.

Your self-doubt is also something many of us go through. The fact that you're worried shows that you care about doing your best, and that's already a good sign! Struggling with certain subjects does not make you ""bobo"". Everyone has areas they find more challenging, it's part of being human. Learning to embrace these challenges can be a stepping stone towards personal growth.

When it comes to law school and the bar exam, remember to tackle one step at a time. Just because you're finding things tough now doesn't mean you won't be able to do it in the future. Skills are learned and developed, not innately possessed.

Take care of your mental health along the way, try not to let fear or anxiety consume you. Breathe, believe in yourself, and do your best.

\-Amina Mehmood"	"Hi there,

Your words resonate deeply, and they capture the essence of feeling overwhelmed and finding a release in crying. Crying is indeed a natural expression of emotions like grief, frustration, or even relief. It allows us the space to let out some of the emotional weight we're carrying. 

It might also be beneficial to find someone you're comfortable with to discuss these feelings. Sharing your thoughts can alleviate some of the burden. Moreover, you could consider engaging in calming activities, like meditation or yoga, which can help manage stress levels.

Remember, it's okay to ask for professional help if your feelings start to get unmanageable. Mental health is just as important as physical health, and there's no shame in seeking support.

Take care,

\-Amina Mehmood"	"Hello there,

I'm really glad you reached out. It sounds like you're having a particularly tough time, and I'm here to validate your feelings. Experiencing emotional overflow, such as crying, is genuinely human and a sign that you're aware of your emotions, which is the first step towards managing them.

Try not to stigmatize your feelings or express counterproductive judgment towards your own emotions. It's vital to remember that it's okay to allow yourself to feel without rushing to stop the emotional flow.

Consider engaging in self-care routines, such as taking a long walk, practicing mindfulness, or journaling your thoughts. It can be surprisingly therapeutic. It would also be beneficial to speak to someone you trust about your feelings, or consider reaching out to a mental health professional who can provide you with resources and strategies to navigate through this challenging period.

You're not alone in this, remember it's okay, and even necessary, to ask for help when you need it. Take care.

\-Amina Mehmood"	"Hi,

I understand that you're going through a difficult time right now. Remember, it's entirely okay to cry, express your feelings, and share your burdens. As beautifully put across in your quote, even nature allows for outlet when it gets overwhelmed.

One of the most important steps towards better mental health is acknowledging your feelings and giving yourself permission to feel them fully. Reach out to your support networks -- friends, family, or a mental health professional, and let them share your load. Maybe try journaling as it can help give you some perspective, it provides a safe space for you to vent out your thoughts and emotions.

Regardless, always remember -- it's okay. It's okay to feel what you're feeling. It's okay to ask for help. Your feelings are valid and they matter. It might not feel like it right now, but things will get better--- one step at a time.

It sounds like you're going through a tough time and that's completely alright. It's perfectly natural to feel overwhelmed and let out your emotions. I'm here to tell you, it's okay to cry and let those feelings flow. Remember, no one is invincible, we all have our moments of vulnerability, irrespective of race, age, or gender. Your pain is valid, your tears are valid. Please remember there's beauty in strength, but there is also strength in vulnerability. Feeling weak is a part of being human, and it's okay to not be okay all the time. It may seem unmanageable now, but remember, clouds will clear after the rain. You're not alone in this journey, keep reaching out and expressing what you're going through. And remember, it's okay to seek professional guidance if things tend to get really tough. Remember, healing isn't linear and it's okay to have bad days. You're brave, strong and you got this.

I'll cut to the chase because I really need some guidance here on how to manage my girlfriend's condition.
  
These diagnosis has been confirmed by a psychiatrist here in Sarawak, Malaysia. 
  

  

  
She has : 
  

  
1. Depression: She would randomly fall into depression anytime she feels alone (most frequent reason and it has been observed to be true) therefore to remedy this, she goes out every single day to shop for clothes , eat at cafes, and frequent a bar that my aunt's best friend owns (to mostly listen to music, play pool, karaoke)
  

  

  
2. Schizophrenia (Hear's voices if surrounding is too quiet, telling her she's not good enough/should harm herself for being useless. To drown these voices out, she constantly listens to music on high volume).
  

  
3. Anxiety: She gets super anxious if there is a stampede level amount of people in locations such as ballrooms etc so there is a limit to how much she can tolerate .
  

  
The deadly combo: Depression and Schizophrenia,  Everytime she feels alone , she would freeze up and experience both of these at the same time, it would start with an uncontrollable onset of depression followed by voices in her head telling her to harm herself / not good enough / no point in staying alive.  To DROWN these voices she self harms . She would cut lines on her wrist with a pen knife until she feels ""calmer"" . According to her, seeing blood on her wrists makes her calm , it stops the voices (she claims the voices would be overpoweringly annoying and she thinks the only way to drown them out would be to cut herself which she claims bring relief.
  

  

  
I'm at a stage where I'm constantly spending time with her nearly everyday skipping important errands which is unsustainable and disuptive to my life as well because I can't trust her to be alone. She seems to also be afraid of being alone too, but when she is , she would try to control symptoms with loud music to drown voices and if necessary she would take an emergency prescription called ""CLONazepam"" to supress her emotions etc and fall asleep. 
  

  
""Escitalopram"" is another prescription for her depression and anxiety. As well as another one to treat schizophrenia (forgot the name).
  

  
She also seems to be suffering from chronic insomnia where she would be able to stay up to 48 hours if she's not taking her depression prescription (which also helps her sleep)
  

  
The main problem I need help with is to find a way to help her manage her urges to self harm , lately it seems to be amplifying. Most of the time she takes her prescriptions and she would be fine, but there are days when she would feel a severe instant onset of depression+schizophrenia and the medication would be too late to stop her from the thought of self harming. A good example was yesterday when she was with me in my room and I fell asleep before her since she left her medication that helps with sleep at her home, she woke me up and told me she is experiencing extreme depression and she felt like self harming herself and she cried. I reassured her that I won't leave her side and would be there constantly to keep her from her urges, prior to waking me up , she took the emergency prescription ""CLONazepam"" which eventually kicked in and made her drowsy and she eventually fell asleep. Had I not been there she told me she would have 100% tried to cut herself. She told me the voices in her head was so annoying that she needed to cut herself to feel relief. 
  

  
So now you can see why this is a problem. Eventually I will find a job and I wouldnt be able to be present as often anymore. I need to find ways to help her manage the symptoms better and ultimately try to cure her onset schizophrenia because that seems to be the most debilitating part of her condition . It disrupts her life completely and she isnt able to work because of it. 
  

  
Despite all the consultations with psychiatrists (whom seem to be absoultely unexperienced and unprofessional) here in sarawak malaysia ,  she still feels these things. The only thing that works is her medication however the therapy part of her treatment doesnt seem to be effective. Previously during her first attempt to get professional help,  they would keep her in the hospital and restrain her for a few days because of the self harming.She told me the psychiatrists and staff were mostly rude to her and treated her like she was a crazy person. In therapys sessions , they would literally tell her not to  ""overthink about things"" as an advice which stunned me. She also was taught steps to help manage symptoms from a binder which she could not bring home so she would have to jot it down on her phone or something.
  

  

  
(Extra background info)
  
1. I onced rushed to her house with a first aid kit and just saw her sitting there non chalantly with her wrists filled with dried up blood from the cuts and acts like it's normal and she would like laugh when I took it seriously. She would tell me ""relax it's normal , everytime i cut my wrists i dont feel anything,it's just small cuts, I'm not gonna die or anything""
  

  
2. We've only gotten together with her for 2 months , and i decided to be with her knowing her symptoms because I fell in love and I wanted to help her to get better but this seems to be taking a toll on me too as she would go out every single day and expects me to be there with her (not forced however but I would force myself to be there to accompany her to keep her safe as she only has 2 friends currently (whom are working and arent always available)
  

  
3. She was raped by her own brother at 14 , her family members did not believe her claims. Now is staying with parents still but rapist brother is in another city. I told her to make a report but she didnt want to risk being disowned by her parents. She's currently 18, I'm 23. 
  

  
4. She also has a history of abusive exes (verbal abuse) 
  

  
5. She has a history of taking recreational drugs such as ecstacy and ketamine ( she stopped at the moment ) , so we're chinese and there are lots of chinese connections here in our hometown that deals drugs mostly at Karaoke Centers. Currently she stopped already but she still keeps in contact with those people. I adviced her to cut ties with these people but she doesnt want to. She told me she isnt confident that she cant completely stop it in the future if i ever am not around. 
  

  
6. Her family is aware of her condition but doesn't understand it therefore is often dismissive of her condition and considers it a burden and a waste of their time. (This is the most hearbreaking part)
  

  

  
To anyone who's gone through the same thing and recovered or psychologists on this platform. I'm in desperate need of help to help my girl manage her symptoms. I'm really afraid of losing her . She has the kindest soul but she hides her pain constantly and she doesnt want to open up to others. But she has me now and I constantly remind her that she can talk to me about anything but it's still something she is working on . She constantly hides her pain and acts like everything is okay , makes jokes constantly but when she's alone that all changes. Obviously hiding it all in has been something she's been doing for years and it's definitely not healthy in the long run and it comes back with a vengeance anyways whenever she's in a state of loneliness and helplessness. 
  

  
I appreciate you guys in advance for any advice that you can give her . She doesn't know how else to seek help so I'm going to seek help for her. Money is also a constraint so I cant bring her to a more qualified/experienced  therapist/psychologist in another city yet but maybe in the future. Saving up the money as we speak."	"It sounds like your girlfriend is dealing with incredibly challenging conditions, and your dedication to supporting her is really admirable. She's dealt with a lot in her life that's clearly taking a toll on her mental health. Please remember that it’s also very important to take care of yourself during this challenging time. 
   

  
Firstly, urge her to take her prescribed medication consistently. This could help to reduce the frequency and intensity of her symptoms. Keep her doctor informed of what she's experiencing, they may need to adjust her medication until they find the most effective combination for managing her symptoms.
  

  
Secondly, while you are looking for a more qualified/experienced therapist, there are a wealth of online resources available that could help in the meantime. Websites like 7Cups, Psychology Today, and the Samaritans offer free support, while some also provide discounted therapy sessions.
  

  
Encourage her to get involved with online communities that deal with her specific conditions, they can provide a supportive environment where she can talk openly about her experiences without judgment and hear that she's not alone. As well as acting as an emotional outlet, they can also serve as a valuable resource for coping strategies.
  

  
Lastly, and this is going to be the hardest one, but she needs to cut ties with those still involved with drugs. Those connections are hazardous for the progress of her recovery.
  

    
Remember, while you're there for her, you also need to preserve your own mental health. Ensure to involve as many professionals as possible in this situation and seek to broaden her support network.
   
    
Hope you both receive the help you need soon. Sending strength and positivity your way."	1	0	0	0.0007972121238708496	social media

She seems to also be afraid of being alone too, but when she is , she would try to control symptoms with loud music to drown voices and if necessary she would take an emergency prescription called ""CLONazepam"" to supress her emotions etc and fall asleep. 
  

  
""Escitalopram"" is another prescription for her depression and anxiety. As well as another one to treat schizophrenia (forgot the name).
  

  
She also seems to be suffering from chronic insomnia where she would be able to stay up to 48 hours if she's not taking her depression prescription (which also helps her sleep)
  

  
The main problem I need help with is to find a way to help her manage her urges to self harm , lately it seems to be amplifying. Most of the time she takes her prescriptions and she would be fine, but there are days when she would feel a severe instant onset of depression+schizophrenia and the medication would be too late to stop her from the thought of self harming. A good example was yesterday when she was with me in my room and I fell asleep before her since she left her medication that helps with sleep at her home, she woke me up and told me she is experiencing extreme depression and she felt like self harming herself and she cried. I reassured her that I won't leave her side and would be there constantly to keep her from her urges, prior to waking me up , she took the emergency prescription ""CLONazepam"" which eventually kicked in and made her drowsy and she eventually fell asleep. Had I not been there she told me she would have 100% tried to cut herself. She told me the voices in her head was so annoying that she needed to cut herself to feel relief. 
  

  
So now you can see why this is a problem. Eventually I will find a job and I wouldnt be able to be present as often anymore. I need to find ways to help her manage the symptoms better and ultimately try to cure her onset schizophrenia because that seems to be the most debilitating part of her condition . It disrupts her life completely and she isnt able to work because of it. 
  

  
Despite all the consultations with psychiatrists (whom seem to be absoultely unexperienced and unprofessional) here in sarawak malaysia ,  she still feels these things. The only thing that works is her medication however the therapy part of her treatment doesnt seem to be effective. Previously during her first attempt to get professional help,  they would keep her in the hospital and restrain her for a few days because of the self harming.She told me the psychiatrists and staff were mostly rude to her and treated her like she was a crazy person. In therapys sessions , they would literally tell her not to  ""overthink about things"" as an advice which stunned me. She also was taught steps to help manage symptoms from a binder which she could not bring home so she would have to jot it down on her phone or something.
  

  

  
(Extra background info)
  
1. I onced rushed to her house with a first aid kit and just saw her sitting there non chalantly with her wrists filled with dried up blood from the cuts and acts like it's normal and she would like laugh when I took it seriously. She would tell me ""relax it's normal , everytime i cut my wrists i dont feel anything,it's just small cuts, I'm not gonna die or anything""
  

  
2. We've only gotten together with her for 2 months , and i decided to be with her knowing her symptoms because I fell in love and I wanted to help her to get better but this seems to be taking a toll on me too as she would go out every single day and expects me to be there with her (not forced however but I would force myself to be there to accompany her to keep her safe as she only has 2 friends currently (whom are working and arent always available)
  

  
3. She was raped by her own brother at 14 , her family members did not believe her claims. Now is staying with parents still but rapist brother is in another city. I told her to make a report but she didnt want to risk being disowned by her parents. She's currently 18, I'm 23. 
  

  
4. She also has a history of abusive exes (verbal abuse) 
  

  
5. She has a history of taking recreational drugs such as ecstacy and ketamine ( she stopped at the moment ) , so we're chinese and there are lots of chinese connections here in our hometown that deals drugs mostly at Karaoke Centers. Currently she stopped already but she still keeps in contact with those people. I adviced her to cut ties with these people but she doesnt want to. She told me she isnt confident that she cant completely stop it in the future if i ever am not around. 
  

  
6. Her family is aware of her condition but doesn't understand it therefore is often dismissive of her condition and considers it a burden and a waste of their time. (This is the most hearbreaking part)
  

  

  
To anyone who's gone through the same thing and recovered or psychologists on this platform. I'm in desperate need of help to help my girl manage her symptoms. I'm really afraid of losing her . She has the kindest soul but she hides her pain constantly and she doesnt want to open up to others. But she has me now and I constantly remind her that she can talk to me about anything but it's still something she is working on . She constantly hides her pain and acts like everything is okay , makes jokes constantly but when she's alone that all changes. Obviously hiding it all in has been something she's been doing for years and it's definitely not healthy in the long run and it comes back with a vengeance anyways whenever she's in a state of loneliness and helplessness. 
  

  
I appreciate you guys in advance for any advice that you can give her . She doesn't know how else to seek help so I'm going to seek help for her. Money is also a constraint so I cant bring her to a more qualified/experienced  therapist/psychologist in another city yet but maybe in the future. Saving up the money as we speak."	"I'm really sorry to hear what your girlfriend is going through and it's clear that you care about her very much. 

Let's start with a simple truth: you can't be her sole support and you can't take responsibility for her health - these are things that she needs to work out for herself, with professional help. Give yourself permission to take care of yourself as well, because you won't be of any help to her if you're running on empty.

Depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, these are severe, chronic conditions that require professional help and sometimes even medication. It's great that she's already receiving some psychiatric attention and is on medication. It may be time to discuss her feelings about the care she's receiving with her doctor and talk about alternate forms of therapy she might benefit from. Cognitive behavioural therapy can be highly effective.

Self-harm is a coping mechanism, and usually, it means that she's feeling overwhelmed by emotions and doesn't know any other way to cope. Encourage her to talk with her professionals about it and make sure they understand the severity of what she's dealing with. Reiterate that she doesn't have to fight alone and it's okay to ask for help.

As for the self-harm, try to help her identify the triggers and steps that lead up to her wanting to self-harm. It may help her to delay the self-harm by taking herself away from the object she uses, doing something else for a while, or using distraction techniques. 

In general, reaching out more to friends could help too. Depression tends to make us isolate ourselves which can create a vicious cycle - the lonelier she feels, the worse her symptoms become. 

Remember, you can't ""cure"" her - she needs professional help, medication, and possibly therapy. You can support her by encouraging her to get the treatment she needs, but you also need to take care of yourself. If you're feeling overwhelmed, please talk to someone about it. You're under a lot of pressure and it's important not to neglect your own mental health.

I would recommend you both call some local crisis or suicide prevention hotlines. You can find the list here for Malaysia: www.befrienders.org.my You could also reach out to organizations like https://mmha.org.my/ who might be able to point you in the right direction for other community resources available.

Good luck; it's clear that you care deeply for your girlfriend and it's heartbreaking to see her suffer through this."	2	0	0	0.0013685822486877441	mental health forum

I'll cut to the chase because I really need some guidance here on how to manage my girlfriend's condition.
  
These diagnosis has been confirmed by a psychiatrist here in Sarawak, Malaysia. 
  

  

  
She has : 
  

  
1. Depression: She would randomly fall into depression anytime she feels alone (most frequent reason and it has been observed to be true) therefore to remedy this, she goes out every single day to shop for clothes , eat at cafes, and frequent a bar that my aunt's best friend owns (to mostly listen to music, play pool, karaoke)
  

  

  
2. Schizophrenia (Hear's voices if surrounding is too quiet, telling her she's not good enough/should harm herself for being useless. To drown these voices out, she constantly listens to music on high volume).
  

  
3. Anxiety: She gets super anxious if there is a stampede level amount of people in locations such as ballrooms etc so there is a limit to how much she can tolerate .
  

  
The deadly combo: Depression and Schizophrenia,  Everytime she feels alone , she would freeze up and experience both of these at the same time, it would start with an uncontrollable onset of depression followed by voices in her head telling her to harm herself / not good enough / no point in staying alive.  To DROWN these voices she self harms . She would cut lines on her wrist with a pen knife until she feels ""calmer"" . According to her, seeing blood on her wrists makes her calm , it stops the voices (she claims the voices would be overpoweringly annoying and she thinks the only way to drown them out would be to cut herself which she claims bring relief.

"It sounds like both you and your girlfriend are really struggling right now, and it's clear that you deeply care about her. It's courageous of you to reach out for support like this.

Your girlfriend's mental health conditions are complex and serious. It’s really important she is under the care of mental health professionals who are able to provide her with the right treatment and support. I suggest you consider speaking with a mental health advocacy organisation in your country, as they may be able to help connect you to more professional resources.

Managing her urges for self-harm can be aided by developing a safety plan that she can follow when she gets these urges, including identifying triggering situations, coping strategies, distractions, and people she can contact for support when she’s feeling this way. A trained mental health professional should be involved in the creation of this plan. 

It's also important for you to take care of yourself. Being the main support of someone with mental health problems can be very taxing. Encourage her to expand her support network if possible, as she also can't solely rely on you. You might find it helpful to join a support group yourself, or to seek therapy, to help manage the toll this is taking on you.

Remember, you're not alone, there are resources and communities out there that can help you both. Continue reaching out and obtaining professional help where possible."	1	0	0	0.0006746053695678711	clinician

"Firstly, I'm really sorry to hear that your girlfriend is going through this. It's clear that you care deeply about her and are doing all you can to help, which is truly commendable. Mental health issues are complex and it's fantastic that she has someone on her side. However, it's crucial to keep in mind that you are not a professional psychologist or psychiatrist, and while I see the deep care you have for her, remember that you have limitations and your own emotional health to take care of too.

So how can you help her? 

1. Encourage her to keep using her prescribed medications and to talk openly with her psychiatrist about their effectiveness. Maybe she could research and ask about other medication options or Combination Therapy in her sessions. Normally, a combination of medication and true therapy is the primary line of treatment for schizophrenia and depression. 

2. Urge her to report any feelings of self-harm to her psychiatrist. This is very serious and will help her find better strategies for managing her symptoms and keeping her safe.

3. If she is comfortable with it, it may be beneficial for her to seek therapy to deal with her past trauma including her history of abuse. This could likely be a contributing factor to her current psychological struggle.

4. She might find it helpful to join a support group (either in person or online) of people who are experiencing similar issues. Sometimes this type of group can provide a sense of comfort and understanding that other people in her life may not be able to.

5. Encourage her to develop some healthy coping skills that could help distract her when the depressive and schizophrenic episodes hit. Talking to a mental health professional is often the best way to develop these skills. 

6. Remember to look out for your own mental health. You can't pour from an empty cup, it's critical to take care of yourself so you can take care of her.

This isn't a quick or easy process. She's dealing with some severe mental health issues and it's going to take time and consistent, professional help to manage those. Just continue to be as supportive as you can, while taking care of yourself too. Good luck to you both."	2	0	0	0.0013552308082580566	forum with demographics

3. She was raped by her own brother at 14 , her family members did not believe her claims. Now is staying with parents still but rapist brother is in another city. I told her to make a report but she didnt want to risk being disowned by her parents. She's currently 18, I'm 23. 
  

  
4. She also has a history of abusive exes (verbal abuse) 
  

  
5. She has a history of taking recreational drugs such as ecstacy and ketamine ( she stopped at the moment ) , so we're chinese and there are lots of chinese connections here in our hometown that deals drugs mostly at Karaoke Centers. Currently she stopped already but she still keeps in contact with those people. I adviced her to cut ties with these people but she doesnt want to. She told me she isnt confident that she cant completely stop it in the future if i ever am not around. 
  

  
6. Her family is aware of her condition but doesn't understand it therefore is often dismissive of her condition and considers it a burden and a waste of their time. (This is the most hearbreaking part)
  

  

  
To anyone who's gone through the same thing and recovered or psychologists on this platform. I'm in desperate need of help to help my girl manage her symptoms. I'm really afraid of losing her . She has the kindest soul but she hides her pain constantly and she doesnt want to open up to others. But she has me now and I constantly remind her that she can talk to me about anything but it's still something she is working on . She constantly hides her pain and acts like everything is okay , makes jokes constantly but when she's alone that all changes. Obviously hiding it all in has been something she's been doing for years and it's definitely not healthy in the long run and it comes back with a vengeance anyways whenever she's in a state of loneliness and helplessness. 
  

  
I appreciate you guys in advance for any advice that you can give her . She doesn't know how else to seek help so I'm going to seek help for her. Money is also a constraint so I cant bring her to a more qualified/experienced  therapist/psychologist in another city yet but maybe in the future. Saving up the money as we speak."	"The situation is definitely challenging, and it's really commendable you're standing by her and seeking help where necessary. My advice will lean towards an immediate intervention for her well-being and stability – and this may very well involve including professional guidance.

Revisiting her medications might be necessary, this can be done by seeing another psychiatrist for a second opinion or reviewing her current treatment plan with her existing psychiatrist. Certain behavioral therapy like Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT) can be helpful with managing depression, anxiety, and frequent harmful thoughts connected to Schizophrenia.

Engage her actively in activities that keep her mind busy and help with relaxation - yoga, art, sports, reading. Ensure she has regular sleep, maintain a healthy diet and cut down alcohol which might worsen symptoms.

Support groups can make a significant difference. It doesn't just offer friendly advice, but a chance to connect and interact with others under similar circumstances.

A switch in therapists is also worth considering, since she should feel comfortable and accepted while working on her mental health. Look for support charities that offer lower-cost counseling.

Your well-being is equally important, consider getting personal support or counseling to help manage your feelings and expectations. Remember, you alone cannot ""cure"" her mental health conditions, but your support makes a significant difference in her struggle.

Lastly, hotlines are available for immediate help during critical moments of self-harm or suicidal thoughts. It's important to keep them handy. These are tough times, hang in there, both of you. Your love and determination for her well-being is bound to make a difference."	1	0	0	0.0007801055908203125	forum w/o demographics
"So the thing started in march when lost my job. From the country i belong it's really hard to find a well paid job while being a student. I was super happy with my job. So when I lost the job I was feeling heartbroken. I tried to start everything again but i failed. 
Also I am not good looking or pretty neither have a light skin tone which fits the society's preference. 
I don't have a love life too. Actually I am scared to approach to anyone with the looks I have. 
The things got worst when my mom also start picking on me or you can say bullying me for having a dark skin tone or not for being pretty. It's one of the big reason why i stop posting myself on socials. 
She also says i lost the job because she prayed. 
Everything is so messes up in my life. I don't eat properly anymore all I do is watching series online. Which you call you a escape for me. 
Can anyone help me with my situation? I want to recover from all this. Please..
I'm a 21y/o girl from a south asian country."	Hey there, I'm really sorry to hear that you're going through such a tough time. First off, remember self-love comes from within and shouldn't be determined by anyone else, not even your mom. It’s important to understand that you are significant and it's unjust to judge someone based on their physical appearance. As for your job situation, could you consider online freelancing or part-time roles relevant to your studies? They might be a good stepping stone for later full-time employment. Finally, it might be beneficial to seek support from a mental health professional who can provide coping mechanisms for dealing with your feelings and the stresses you are facing. Remember, there’s always help and hope. You're stronger than you believe!	2	0	0	0.0006597638130187988	social media

Regarding your job loss, remember that just because you lost a job, it doesn't define your worth or competence. It could be due to circumstances beyond your control. As difficult as it may seem, try to frame it as a chance to step back, reassess your goal, and perhaps even find something better.

In terms of your appearance, I know society tends to put emphasis on a particular beauty standard, but this doesn't reflect everyone's taste or views. Beauty does come in all forms and we all have our unique set of qualities. The most important thing is to appreciate and embrace your unique traits. The dissatisfaction you feel about your appearance is likely a product of societal pressure, but remember, society doesn't define your value or worth.

As for your relationship with your mom, it's really tough when those close to us cause distress. It might be useful to have an open conversation with her about how her comments affect you. If that isn't an option, seeking support from outside sources like friends, other family members, or even professional counselors can be helpful.

It sounds like you might benefit from speaking with a mental health professional about some of these issues, especially if you're having trouble eating or if you're spending a lot of time watching series online as an escape from reality. They can provide you with strategies and support to better cope with your feelings.

In the meantime, taking care of your physical health can have a positive impact on your mental state. Try to eat a balanced diet, keep a regular sleep schedule, and incorporate some physical exercise into your daily routine. Please remember, you're not alone and there are people who care! Keep reaching out for help, it shows strength and self-awareness. You're doing a great job just by seeking advice. Stay strong."	2	0	0	0.0008178353309631348	mental health forum

I want to remind you that your worth is not determined by your job or by societal standards of beauty. You are valuable and deserving of love and respect, just as you are.

As for your mother, it can be painful when the people we care about most don't support us. It's important to remember that her actions reflect her own insecurities, and not your worth. Finding a way to kindly but assertively express your feelings to her might be helpful. It might not change her behavior, but being able to assert yourself can be empowering.

For your mental health, consider finding a supportive community online or in person, such as this one, where you can express your feelings and receive validation. It might also help to establish a routine, which can create a sense of normalcy and control in a chaotic situation.

Also, it might be beneficial to seek professional help if it's available and affordable in your situation. A mental health professional could provide guidance and coping strategies during this difficult time.

Lastly, it's okay to take time for self-care. Rather than viewing watching series online as an escape, try to see it as allowable downtime for your mental health. However, it's also important to balance this with other activities, such as exercise, hobbies, or spending time with friends, in order to maintain overall well-being.

Remember, it's okay to ask for help, and you're not alone in your struggles. Many people experience these feelings, especially in difficult times. You're stronger than you think, and you can overcome these challenges."	2	0	0	0.0008829236030578613	forum with demographics

Firstly, I want to say I'm sorry to read about the challenges you're currently experiencing. Your feelings are valid, and it’s clear you're dealing with a lot right now. 

Remember, being unemployed is not a reflection of your worth. Many people are experiencing job loss, especially now, and it's important not to internalize it. Searching for jobs while being a student is, indeed, very difficult. I encourage you to be patient. Focus, instead, on honing your skills and learning new ones. Job security fluctuates; your knowledge and abilities are your long-term assets.

Your beauty and the color of your skin do not determine your ability and worth. Know that people's standards of beauty differ worldwide. And, beauty is ultimately subjective; it’s important to embrace your uniqueness and love yourself regardless of societal expectations.

It hurts when those closest to us contribute to our insecurities. It might be helpful to have an honest, open conversation with your mom. She might not even realize how her words are affecting you.

Reach out to your school. They should have resources available to support mental health, and may also assist you with job placement.

Lastly, remember that although it's an escape, watching series all day isn’t healthy. Maybe you could consider establishing a daily routine that involves physical exercise, healthy eating, social interactions, and sleep. Small, achievable changes can make a big difference in overall well-being.

Remember you're not alone in this struggle; many people are dealing with similar issues. You're stronger than you think and reaching out for help shows your courage. I believe in you. Be proud of who you are and be patient with yourself through this hardship. You are so much more than external appearance, and remember, things will get better.

Take care and don't hesitate to reach out if you need someone to talk to.

"How does one cope with crisis after crisis?

I’m tired. So tired that I seem strangely calm. 

I hate my life. Because it’s nothing but pain and suffering. I’m an average person who has been tested way beyond my limits, with no reprieve, no breaks, no appreciation. 

In the last decade I’ve realized, slowly, that my life is not mine at all. None of my talents, interests, aspirations, hopes, actually matter. I’m merely place on earth to deal with my family. And despite all my efforts, life places me exactly where I should be - the middle-aged spinster daughter of a Chinese family. 

I’m freaked out right now because my mother is suddenly unwell. Whilst merely looking at symptoms it’s hard to say what is wrong - she said she felt an unsettled tummy and felt bloated. Then we had to attend a funeral and on the way home she threw up (my uncle was driving us home, and admittedly the car ride was inducing carsickness even in me). 

My fear roots from the matter that she had cancer like 16 years ago. 

I’m trying not to over react. I know that sometimes people have upset stomaches. The weather is bizarrely hot where I am (over 33c) and I myself feel sluggish. That the carsickness might have caused the vomiting. 

She’s now napping. We have a doctor’s appt in the evening. I’m trying to stay calm. I’m trying to disregard all my feelings, because no one cares about how I feel. It’s always about someone else - my father, my disabled family member, my mother. Never me."	Hey there, it sounds like you're carrying an incredibly heavy load, emotionally and mentally, and it's normal to feel overwhelmed. Try to remember, it’s okay not to be okay sometimes. Take it one day at a time, one crisis at a time. It's great that you're aware about not overreacting. It can be hard to differentiate between rational concern and anxiety-predicted worst case scenarios. Don't disregard your feelings; they're valid. Do what you can, when you can - you've got a doctor's appointment for your mom - so that's a positive step you've taken. Take care of your mental health - turn to friends, groups, or even therapy to vent your feelings without judgment. All this will help in coping, one step at a time. 💪 You're strong, remember that! 💓	1	0	0	0.0007544755935668945	social media

Experiencing one crisis after another can be incredibly draining, and it's completely valid to feel overwhelmed, scared and even resentful. 

Something that is vitally important in such a situation, and oftentimes overlooked, is self-care. You mentioned feeling like you're only there for your family, but remember, you have to take care of yourself in order to be able to take care of others. The feeling of self-neglect can lead to high levels of stress and anxiety which can also manifest as physical health issues. 

Engage in activities that you love, embrace your talents and hobbies. Try to dedicate even a small period of your day to something you enjoy or to simply rest. Practicing mindfulness, even for a few minutes a day, can help reduce stress too. 

When it comes to your mother's health, try not to fear the worst immediately. Medical advancements have been remarkable over the past decade, and even if it was something serious (which it may very well not be), there are many treatments available. It's good that you're already going to see a doctor; keeping open lines of communication with healthcare professionals is crucial during these times. 

Finally, if it's available and you're open to it, consider seeking external support, like therapy. An impartial mental health professional can provide invaluable techniques and strategies to navigate and cope with periods of high stress.

Remember, it's okay to take a step back. It's okay to prioritize your mental health. Wishing you strength and peace during this difficult time."	1	0	0	0.0007132887840270996	mental health forum

I see you, and you absolutely matter. I want to say how incredibly strong you are for stepping up, carrying the weight of these pressures, and still trying to move forward.

It's understandable that your mother's recent bout of illness triggered concerns and fears, given her past medical history. The connection you're making is natural. And while it's crucial to get her checked, remember that our minds can also be quick to jump to worst case scenarios in times of overwhelming stress.

Regarding your sense of becoming invisible while doing your part in your family, I believe it's a narrative seen frequently in Chinese culture, where traditional expectations can designate the obligation for caregiving. I would not have the audacity to tell you that you can shrug off this ingrained sense of duty. However, I'd urge you to understand that it's *okay* to prioritize your mental health. It's essential to your overall wellbeing and resilience.

Please remember that while you're in this role, you are more than 'a middle-aged spinster daughter.' You are a unique individual with your strengths, interests, aspirations, and feelings. It may feel like your world is shrinking around these responsibilities, but you are most certainly not alone in experiencing this struggle. 

Talking with a mental health professional could provide a safe space for you to explore and heal from these feelings, as well as develop coping strategies to deal with this constant stress. It could also be helpful to join support groups with people in similar situations. Knowing that there's a community of people who understand what you're going through can be incredibly comforting.

Remember, it's alright to step back and just breathe once in a while, and always remember that you matter just as much as the people you're caring for. You're stronger than you know. Here for you."	1	0	0	0.0010085701942443848	forum w/o demographics
"Hi,  
I am new on Reddit (and to this sub). I am 26 (fast approaching 27) but hope that's not an issue. I liked the topics discussed in this sub and thought about sharing something I felt recently. 

So, I used to really like a girl in my college days. She liked me as well. But we both knew it'll never work because there were so many hurdles between us (I don't want to get into details, but coming from India for marriage caste, religion, etc. are very important stuff, especially for older people, and creates many problems - yeah it sucks!). Anyway, for this reason, we always kept a distance. We were good friends, she called me for everything, whatever help she ever needed I was the first person she ever called. Even when we were never in any kind of relationship, she'll still get jealous when I get too close to some other girls. But not in a weird possessive ay, but I'd say in a cute way. Anyway, college life ended just like that, we did keep in touch. Random messages & calls from time to time. After a few years, she got married (Arranged marriage, It's India!). She invited me to it. I got to talk to the groom and I liked him. I know it's a bit hard to get a grasp about someone with a few minutes of conversation but still, I felt they're a good match.   
After her marriage, our contact reduced so much. We rarely talked. But that was okay. I was over her and she wasn't on my mind all the time like she used to be and I moved on. But a few days ago, on their marriage anniversary, she posted her wedding pics and looking at that I felt all the feelings I had came back to me at once.  


I wonder how different my life would have been if we were of the same religion. (Please don't judge us here because it's really hard in some communities to marry someone of a different religion. It literally destroys families.)  


 I was wondering whether anyone here ever looked back in their life & felt something like this.  


Just sharing one of my favorite poems which kinda explains my feeling.

Now to your post, It's normal, and human, to reminisce about what might have been, particularly in circumstances where you had no control over the situation. Your feelings are valid and common. Overcoming these scenarios requires consciously adopting the perspective that everything in life happens for some reason. This enables you to grow from your experiences. Feel free to share your thoughts & feelings, no judgments here. Btw, your English is great, don't stress about it. Keep sharing, we're here to listen!	1	0	0	0.0009077787399291992	social media

Apologies for any grammar errors, English is not my first language."	"Hello, 

Firstly, welcome to Reddit and this sub! Your age is definitely not an issue. 

It's only natural to rekindle old emotions when you experience past connections or situations. We all reminiscence and sometimes wonder ""what if?"" These reflections can bring up deep seeded feelings. It's normal and a very human reaction. By allowing ourselves to feel these things, we can inch closer to finding closure.

Understand that our past shapes us, and our past experiences mould us into the beings we are today. No doubt she played a significant part in your life, and those beautiful memories will always be there. 

Your poem beautifully articulates the melancholy of unfulfilled love. One can say it speaks voluminously about your mature understanding of the situation despite your personal feelings. This shows real strength of character. 

One thing that you should remember is that it's completely okay to embrace your past without regret and explore these feelings. You aren't alone.  The threads of emotional reflection and yearning are common themes that unite us. 

As far as you're concerned, cultural constraints are very real factors, and I want you to know that there's no judgment here. You've done the best you could within your circumstances.

Their anniversary may have stirred feelings, but always remember, moving forward doesn't negate the past.

Take care, and remember we are all here to support each other. Sharing these sentiments here is a brave start. If you ever feel like talking more about it, feel free to post or send a private message.

(Also, no need to apologize for grammatical errors, you communicate your thoughts eloquently.)"	1	0	0	0.000700831413269043	mental health forum

Apologies for any grammar errors, English is not my first language."	"Hi there,

Thanks for your openness in sharing your feelings and experiences. It sounds like you're grappling with some complex emotions which are both typical and challenging. Past relationships, fond or not, can often have lingering effects, especially if there's a lack of closure. It's normal to revisit these feelings sometimes, particularly if they're triggered by specific events or reminders, like seeing your friend's anniversary photos.

Simultaneously, it's critical to remember that while it's okay to feel sadness and regret, dwelling on ""what could have been"" often prevents us from appreciating ""what is"". Our past experiences shape who we are today - for better or worse, we grow and learn from them. 

It might be helpful to write down your feelings when they seem overwhelming. Try to focus on the positive aspects of your situation, even though it may seem difficult at times. Maintaining healthy habits and focusing on the things you can control can also be beneficial.

And remember, it's entirely okay to reach out to a trusted friend or mental health professional if you continue to struggle with these feelings or they start to interfere with your daily life. 

Stay strong, my friend. You got this!"	1	2	0	0.0006366372108459473	clinician

Apologies for any grammar errors, English is not my first language."	"Hey there, welcome to this sub. 

First off, let's just acknowledge that it's perfectly okay to have these feelings of ""what if"" or to experience a resurgence of old emotions - it doesn't mean you haven't moved on or that you're doing something wrong. Instead, it reflects the deep kindness in your heart, and the strength of the bond you had and may still have with this person. It doesn't have to be a romantic bond to be significant. 

It's clear that societal norms and restrictions played a large role in your situation. Cultural norms can heavily influence our life decisions, and while they provide a sense of belonging and identity, they can also create tension, especially when it comes to matters of the heart. This only shows the complexity of life and relationships, and there is no simplistic solution for such issues. 

In situations like these, it's important to remember that we can only control our own actions and responses, and not the circumstances or societal pressures that we face. It might help to focus on the good memories you had with this person, and how these experiences have shaped who you are today. 

You asked if anyone here had similar experiences -- I think many of us can look back and pen down some parts of our lives that could have gone a different way if a few variables changed. It's only human to do so.

Try taking some time aside to process your emotions in a healthy way. You can write in a diary, talk with a wellness counselor, meditate or practice mindfulness, whatever you feel could help you to express and deal with your feelings. 

Remember, you're not alone in feeling this way. Your feelings matter, and it's a testament to your capacity to form strong and meaningful relationships.

Stay strong and take care of your mental health.

Ps: The poem you shared is very touching, and beautifully captures the emotion you're conveying. Thank you for sharing it with us."	1	0	0	0.0006816387176513672	forum with demographics

Apologies for any grammar errors, English is not my first language."	"Hi there,

Welcome to the sub, age is certainly not an issue here, and it's great you felt comfortable enough to share your story. Our experiences can indeed be influenced so much by our individual cultural & societal norms. Your situation is relatable to many.

Firstly, it's perfectly normal to reflect and speculate about the different paths our lives could have taken, especially with relationships. While it's hard, try not to dwell too much on the 'what-ifs' and 'might-have-beens'. Focus on what you learned from that relationship - the importance of communication, understanding, and genuine friendship, for instance.

Those feelings you had coming back up when seeing her wedding pictures; it shows how deeply you cared and perhaps still care for her. That's not a negative thing, it makes you human. Such emotions can also be catalysts for personal growth, leading you to better understand what you want and don't want in your future relationships.

Overall, it's really important not to dwell too much on the past, but to learn from it and let it guide you towards happier, healthier relationships in the future. It might not feel like it now, but with time, things do get better. It's also imperative to speak about your feelings and experiences, either with a mental health professional or supportive communities like us. All thoughts and emotions are valid.

That poem you shared truly encapsulates your feelings. There's a certain beauty in longing and unfulfilled love, isn't there? It adds a depth to our persona that's otherwise hard to achieve, and the beautifully melancholic perspective it brings to our art and thoughts is priceless.

Lastly, there's no need to apologize for your English, it's more than fine. Stay strong, friend! Feel free to keep us updated or share more thoughts if you feel like it - you're not alone in these kinds of feelings, and it can be tremendously reassuring to engage with others who've had similar experiences."	1	0	0	0.0007100105285644531	forum w/o demographics

It's impressive that you're respectful of your culture and your priorities (your grades). Try to build a deeper friendship with her—this is allowed in any culture. Ask her out, not as a date, but as a friend, to study together, or share interests. This may ease any pressure and uncertainty. If indeed she has feelings for you, things will naturally progress.

It's great that you've self-reflected thus far and are considering both your feelings as well as hers. You might be young, but respect towards others shows maturity.

In order to proceed with how you're feeling, it might be beneficial if you build a stronger friendship with her. Try to engage more in class, activities or in general, keeping in mind to respect her comfort zone. It gives an opportunity to be certain of the feelings on both sides.

As you mentioned about academic pressure, maintaining a balance between personal life and studies is vital. Devote specific time for studies, perhaps with small breaks to socialize to avoid overflow of stress. 

You've mentioned cultural boundaries. It's important to respect these, but you can still express your feelings subtly. You might want to confide in your parents or other trusted adults, as they can provide you insight from experience.

No matter what happens, maintaining respect for her feelings and your studies is essential. Remember, there will be plenty of time for relationships, there's no rush at 15. Everything can be handled with calm and maturity. You got this!"	1	0	0	0.000683903694152832	mental health forum

"First of all, it's okay to feel these emotions! It sounds as though you care for this girl and your studies, both of which are significant parts of your life. It's important to balance these aspects rather than allow one to completely dominate your thoughts.

Regarding the girl, open and sincere communication is key in any relationship. In respecting cultural norms, it is critical that you approach this situation in a way that honors both your feelings and the influences of your culture. You could consider discussing your feelings to mutual friends or an adult you trust. They might provide guidance based on experience or offer different perspectives.

As for the studying, creating a schedule that allows for both social development and academic progress can be beneficial. Instead of looking these pursuits as incompatible, try considering them as different aspects that will help shape your personal growth.

Remember, every person's journey is unique. Listen to your emotions and what feels right, but also consider the implications of any decisions you make. It can be difficult to process these feelings during adolescence, especially when it involves academics and personal relationships. It's normal to feel overwhelmed, but these experiences contribute heavily to self-development and resilience."	1	0	0	0.0006155967712402344	clinician

"It sounds like you're dealing with a lot of feelings and trying to balance your personal emotions with your family expectations and cultural norms. It's not an easy situation to navigate, but the most important thing to remember is to respect your feelings, her feelings, and mutual comfort levels.

Given the context you provided, perhaps starting as friends and deepening that bond could be the initial steps. Get to know her more on a personal level without the pressure of a romantic interest hanging in the balance. This can also help gauge whether those rumors you’ve heard about her liking you bear any truth.

Doing this might also alleviate any potential discomfort she might feel, given what you mentioned about her seeming upset when teased. Open communication is key here: discuss topics you both enjoy and nurture that relationship naturally.

When it comes to balancing your studies and this blossoming relationship, remember to prioritize your education as well. You can still communicate and hang out with her while also devoting time to preparing for your boards. It's all about finding a comfortable balance and setting boundaries that work for you.

Try not to stress too much about the situation. Remember, there's no rush to figure everything out right now. You have plenty of time to navigate your feelings, foster this relationship, and focus on your studies. It's a balancing act, but with patience and understanding, you're sure to find a way that suits you best.

Remember, you are not alone in this. Reaching out on platforms like this is a great way to seek out advice, and there are plenty of people here who are more than willing to help.

Firstly, it seems like you are in a tricky situation, and I understand how culture can play a significant role in our lives. It's really great, however, to know that you are thriving in your studies and have a clear goal for your upcoming exams! Balancing academics and personal life as a teenager can be challenging.

A couple of things to remember: Firstly, rumors can sometimes be misunderstandings. If you can, try talking to her directly in a caring and kind way about how you feel. Secondly, it's okay to have crushes, but remember to respect personal boundaries and feelings. 

Lastly, keep in mind that it's a phase everyone goes through and it's important to keep your priorities clear. Since your boards are in February, it may be wise to focus on them first and consider dealing with this situation more conclusively after your exams. Discussing this with a trusted adult like your parents might help you gain perspective as well.

Stay positive and all the best for your boards! You're doing great as a balanced and thoughtful person. It sounds like you're very considerate, a quality that will serve you well in friendships, relationships, and life.
Remember that everything tends to work itself out in time. So, don't stress too much about it."	1	0	0	0.0006747245788574219	forum w/o demographics
"Hi people, 

I am from India, my sister and brother-in-law shifted to England last year in July. Brother-in-Law has a history of physical abusing my sister in India. This year too he again started troubling my sister (controlling mentally & financially), my sister called the police, and they registered it as a non-crime domestic abuse incident. This was back in April. 

Me and my parents want my sister to come back to India, but my sister decided to stay back. Mainly because of my 18 months old nephew. She is in a toxic relation; we know the guy is going to relapse and take it out on my sister for complaining to the police.

I had this idea of reporting the police incident to the corporate where my brother-in-law works. But the HR told me that even if I make the call anonymously, they will have to reveal to the guy why an investigation is taking place (keeping my identity anonymous). It will just cause more trouble for my sister, since he will immediately imply that someone from the girl's family made the call.

While I'm not individually able to place your call, you may consider contacting a professional support agency that can advocate for her.

You're in a difficult situation and your concern for your sister is completely understandable. While I can understand why you might think it's useful to request someone else to report to the corporate where your brother-in-law works on your behalf, it's important to note that disguising oneself as a Women's Help NGO might not be the best approach.

Instead, it might be more helpful to guide your sister to take action herself. She could look into local resources in England that provide assistance and support to victims of domestic violence. For instance, she might find help with Women's Aid, Refuge, or National Domestic Abuse Helpline, all of which each offer confidential support and advice. Additionally, she could consider seeking support from a mental health professional who specializes in abuse and trauma.

Another important step would be to understand her legal rights in England. The charity Rights of Women offers free legal advice, including immigration and family law, which could be crucial for her in this situation. 

Remember it's also important to listen and respect her decisions throughout this process - she's in a very difficult situation and your role as her loving family is to support her. Her safety is paramount, so help her in ways she's comfortable with, and that don't aggravate the situation.

Be strong during this tough time, you're already doing great by seeking out advice and help. Your sister is lucky to have you as an ally."	1	0	0	0.0009177923202514648	mental health forum

It can be really hard to watch someone you love be in such a difficult and potentially dangerous environment. It's clear that your intention is to help your sister, however, impersonating a Women's Help NGO can be legally tricky and even counterproductive since it can undermine the credibility of actual support organizations. 

It would be much more advisable for your sister to reach out to support services in England herself. Women's Aid or Refuge are both excellent resources that can provide advice, and immediate help if needed. Encourage her to keep records of every abusive incident and to maintain contact with the authorities if his behavior intensifies. 

Support networks play a crucial role in these situations. It's okay for you to feel overwhelmed, so reach out to local support groups or counseling services for you as well; they can provide advice and suggest actions you can take from afar.

If your sister decides that her work environment needs to know, she should be the one to discuss it with HR along with her support network's advice. For now, continue supporting your sister emotionally, and encourage her to utilize available resources to safeguard herself and her child in England."	2	0	0	0.0013211369514465332	clinician
"Hi people, 

I am from India, my sister and brother-in-law shifted to England last year in July. Brother-in-Law has a history of physical abusing my sister in India. This year too he again started troubling my sister (controlling mentally & financially), my sister called the police, and they registered it as a non-crime domestic abuse incident. This was back in April. 

Me and my parents want my sister to come back to India, but my sister decided to stay back. Mainly because of my 18 months old nephew. She is in a toxic relation; we know the guy is going to relapse and take it out on my sister for complaining to the police.

I had this idea of reporting the police incident to the corporate where my brother-in-law works. But the HR told me that even if I make the call anonymously, they will have to reveal to the guy why an investigation is taking place (keeping my identity anonymous). It will just cause more trouble for my sister, since he will immediately imply that someone from the girl's family made the call. 

Can someone complain to the corporate on my behalf? My idea is that whoever makes the call will disguise as some Women Help NGO. "	"Hello,

I'm sorry to hear about your sister's situation. This is indeed a complex issue that requires precaution and understanding. Unfortunately, I suggest not involving anyone else with filing the complaint to her husband's workplace. Although it might seem like a good idea, it could lead to escalated tension and potentially more harm for your sister, especially given that he might quickly make the connection to his family being involved.

Instead, I would encourage you to support your sister in exploring resources within her community in England to aid victims of domestic abuse. Organizations like Refuge or Women's Aid can offer information and support. Another option could be legal services that can offer advice on her situation, such as Citizens Advice. 

Help her build a strong support network outside of her immediate family, involving professionals and perhaps friends she can trust. Encourage her to prioritize her safety and her child's safety, this may also involve making a safety plan for leaving a potentially violent situation.

As it is a very sensitive topic, remember emotional support is just as important. Be there for your sister as someone she can talk to and confide in without judgment. For now, focus on providing strength and reassurance to your sister, and make sure she knows there are people ready to help her out when she needs it."	2	0	0	0.0010873079299926758	forum with demographics

I have a few recommendations based on the information you've provided. Instead of directly trying to intervene by contacting her husband's employer, it would be more beneficial to work with established organizations that have regular experience dealing with domestic abuse situations. 

In the UK, it might be worth reaching out to Women's Aid, Refuge, or the National Domestic Violence Helpline. They can provide advice and assistance in such situations, and can help to ensure your sister's safety and wellbeing. 

Additionally, communicating with local authorities and periodically checking in on your sister's status might be a helpful approach. It's important to respect her autonomy while also making sure she's safe.

Just remember, the goal should be her safety and wellbeing, so whatever steps you take should be in line with that. You're doing a good job looking out for your family, so keep going and being supportive as much as you can."	2	0	0	0.0006860494613647461	forum w/o demographics
"so i had recently told my parents about the fact that i drink socially. my mom was not okay with it and she kept overthinking over it for months. i came back to home from college and my mom was constantly talking about drinking drinking and drinking calling me a drunkard and what not, inspite of it being pretty much controlled and moderated on my end.

my dad was initially okay with this but mom kept provoking him to DO SOMETHING about it. then my dad’s ego triggered and he’s a narcissist and he asked me to cancel my flight tickets back to college or he will break my mac. i canceled the tickets but asked my bf for some money and booked fresh ones for today. dad asked me to show the bank details for who paid and i cant show because they are also not okay with me having a boyfriend. so i kept begging them to just leave it and let me go. if he got to know about the bf he would abuse him or beat him up like he did to my last bf. i was scared. i just wanted to take my flight for today and leave. he threatened to break my phone so i ran from home. he locked my mac in an almirah. he tracked me down hunted me and brought me back home, again asking for bank details. i didn’t share. i booked cab so that i can leave for airport. after the cab came, he threatened me that if i sit in the cab, he will do something reallly realllyy bad. i begged him. he pulled me. and threw my luggage outside the cab. brought me back home. told me i will never go back to college. i cried and begged to let me catch my flight. he told my how i was sooo wrong to have the audacity to book the flight and an uber all whilst he was against it. i said i am sorry to cater to his narcissistic ego. i cried to just let me go. he said ill stay, show him the bank details tomorrow and then leave after 10 days. i didn’t want to show the bank details. i asked him to pls understand, it’s private. he said what private? wtf are u hiding from me? he slapped me. i went to my room started crying. he locked my laptop and phone in an almirah and locked me in another room. i kept crying then my aunt knocked. i told her everything about why i cant show the bank details etc. she said she will try convincing them. she went and talked to them and told them that she thinks whatever is in the statements is fine. she asked them to trust her and let me go. they said fine- they will not check my statements and i can only go after 10 days. then i didn’t go for my flight and stayed against my will. today they stealthily took my passbook and they have gone to the bank to get the statement’s printed . once they get to know about my bf they are going to do the same thing to him, abuse him on call, they will also abuse me and enforce a break up and they will threaten him that if he keeps any contact with me, they will screw him and his family over. and they are also not booking my flight tickets for after 10 days as of now, saying they will see. i don’t want to stay here. i want to run away to college. my dad is a narcissist and mom has some other issues in which she gets sadistic pleasure everytime i am hurting because she thinks i am learning a lesson for drinking. i dont know what to do. should i file a complaint? but i am not financially independent yet. should i call women’s rights (i am based in india btw). or should i just live with it?"	"I'm truly sorry to hear you're going through this. It's very difficult to go through such family issues. If you feel unsafe at all, it's important to seek help. While I'm not an expert, here's what you could potentially do:

1. Seek Support: Reach out to friends, professors, or counselors at college who may help. They could potentially provide resources or support.
2. Legal Advice: Consult a women's rights organization or a lawyer. They should be able to better assist you in understanding your legal rights and steps you can potentially take, such as potentially placing a restraining order.
3. Financial Independence: Start working towards financial independence by seeking a part-time job or scholarship. This isn't a quick solution, but will serve you in the long run.
4. Hotline: There are many hotlines for women in distress in India, like Women's helpline 181, Bharosa, and others. Use these, they are there for you.

Remember, your rights and safety are important. Don't ever let anyone make you feel otherwise. Stay strong, you're not alone."	2	0	0	0.001125037670135498	social media

"I'm really sorry to hear you're having to deal with such a difficult situation. Your feelings and experiences are valid. It's crucial that your safety is prioritized, and it sounds like both your mental and physical well-being are at risk. I'd encourage you to reach out to local resources. You might consider contacting women's rights organizations, social service entities, or even police if you feel safe in doing so. I'm not sure of your age, but if you're an adult, your parents do not have the right to control you in this way. 

If it's within your capability, starting to work towards financial independence can be a powerful tool for your future. This might mean getting a part-time job or seeking scholarships and grants for your college education. Remember it may take time, so be patient with yourself.

You also mentioned drinking socially. It's completely normal for young adults to explore their boundaries, but always remember to keep it within limits for your own well-being.

The most important step is to remove yourself from this harmful situation. Reach out to close friends, other family members, or a counselor/therapist if you're able to. Hold on, and remember that things can get better with time and effort."	2	0	0	0.0015473365783691406	mental health forum

I'm really sorry to hear you're experiencing this. It sounds incredibly difficult and overwhelming, and no one should have to go through this. It's important to remember that you have rights, and abusive behavior is not okay. I would recommend reaching out to local authorities or a domestic abuse hotline to discuss options for your safety. It's best to speak to professionals who can provide you with practical, contextual support. Whether you decide to make a report is entirely your choice, but reaching out to support may provide you with some clarity and guidance. Additionally, please consider looking at resources for emotional support - consider local helplines or support groups for individuals who are also experiencing similar struggles. You might, when possible, also explore ways to become financially independent, such as jobs, internships or scholarships. Please remember, it's important to ensure your wellbeing, and it's okay to ask for help. You don't have to go through this alone.	2	0	0	0.0009156465530395508	clinician

"I'm really sorry to hear about what you're going through. It's a complicated and difficult situation. You're right, some of the actions you've described from your parents are not okay and are abusive. It's vital that your safety comes first - no matter what.

If you think you are in immediate danger or being threatened, it's okay to contact the authorities. In India, there are various organizations that are available for you to talk to, even anonymously if you prefer - consider reaching out to organizations such as National Commission for Women or Childline (if you're under 18), they are trained to help in these circumstances. 

Many colleges also have support systems in place for students experiencing difficult family situations. Reach out to a counselor or advisor, they usually have resources available for you, they might also be able to provide some kind of financial support or advice. As a student, there are often grants or scholarships that you might be eligible for. 

Additionally, consider talking to trusted friends, professors or advisors about your situation - building a support system can be instrumental in times like this. They may be able to provide you with support, opportunities, or advice. 

Remember, you have every right to your privacy and personal boundaries, these are important and should be respected. You're not alone in this, the first step is reaching out, and you've done that here. We're all here to help."	2	0	0	0.0011255145072937012	forum with demographics

"Sorry to hear that you're going through such a difficult situation. Of course, it's important to get professional advice before taking any steps, but I can certainly relay some options you might consider. If you feel you're in immediate danger, please contact local law enforcement. They are trained to handle situations like this. If physical or emotional abuse is prominent, consider notifying local women's rights groups. They are there to support individuals in situations like yours and they might be able to provide the help that you need.

Considering you're still in college, you may have access to free or inexpensive mental health resources. Reach out to your college's student health center or counselor’s office about your situation. They may be able to provide some additional guidance or resources to support you.

If your situation allows, seek employment or an internship. This can help with financial independence and potentially provide you an opportunity to move out.

Your safety, health, and mental wellbeing are most important. Make sure to prioritize them. Even though you're based in India, there are global organizations as well that can help with domestic abuse, mental health, and more. Stay strong and reach out to available help. You're not alone in this.

During the last 16 years of my parents’ marriage, my dad has been paranoid and jealous of my mom even though she’s the breadwinner and he barely works.

To which my mom called her coworkers and showed camera footages for proof, but he refused to look or listen. Last night, he terrorized my mom and gave us until Sunday to move out of the house that my mom paid for. What could I do in this situation? Who can I report this to and what evidences would I need?	In a difficult situation like this, you may want to first get in touch with domestic abuse hotlines or local law enforcement for advice, as it sounds like your mom may be dealing with verbal and emotional abuse. You might also want to consider reaching out to a legal advisor for information about your mother's rights, especially regarding the house. Remember to carefully document each incident as this can play a crucial role in legal procedures. Include dates, times, places, and details about what happened. Your mom’s co-workers’ statements and the camera footages can be an additional layer of proof that she was indeed at work. Stay strong and be supportive towards your mom, she needs it the most right now. Sending positive vibes and strength to you and your mom.	0	0	0	0.0007873773574829102	social media

"I'm really sorry to hear you're going through all of this, it sounds incredibly tough. It might be best to reach out to local law enforcement and provide them with any evidence you have, such as camera footage or even witnesses who can confirm what's happening. A lawyer could also provide additional guidance for safeguarding the house and your mother's rights. 

In terms of evidence, generally speaking, written or recorded evidences of threats/abuse, proof of the ownership of the house (if your mom indeed is the one who paid), proofs of his baseless accusations (such as camera footages of the salon) would typically be useful. A journal of the incidences can be help too. 

Simultaneously, contact local organizations that offer counseling and assistance for domestic abuse situations. These organizations can walk you through the process of collecting evidence and directing it to appropriate legal channels. 

Remember, your safety and your mom's safety are paramount. If you feel immediate threat, don't hesitate to call emergency services in your location and get to a safe location. Don't forget to get psychological support for yourself too, as this is a difficult situation to navigate."	2	0	0	0.001017153263092041	mental health forum

"I'm really sorry to hear that you're experiencing this. It sounds like a very stressful situation for you and your mother. As a mental health clinician, I'd suggest that the priority here is to make sure you and your mom are safe. Contact your local authorities or police if you genuinely feel that your safety or your mother's safety is at risk. 

Consider reaching out to your local domestic violence agency. They can provide you with information about obtaining a restraining order, if necessary, as well as other resources and supports. Evidence-wise, any kind of physical or electronic documentation of threats or violent behavior could be helpful - text messages, emails, voicemails etc. You could also keep a log of incidents that include dates, times, and a description of what happened. Remember, third-party witnesses can be valuable too, so consider sharing your experiences with trusted friends or family.  

Empower yourself by understanding your rights. A consultation with an attorney who specializes in family law might also be beneficial so you and your mom can know more about the rights and privileges afforded to you in this situation. 

Lastly, don't forget to care for your own mental health during this time. Reaching out to a therapist or counselor can provide an emotional outlet and resources to help you cope. You're not alone in this. Please reach out to the appropriate authorities if you feel unsafe. In the meantime, know that there are resources and individuals available, willing, and capable of offering you support."	2	0	0	0.000782012939453125	clinician

You also should try to document everything - write down or record these situations if it is safe to do so. This can act as evidence if you need to show someone at a later date. For legal advice, you could reach out to a family law attorney who could advise on possible options and next steps. 

Furthermore, consider reaching out to local domestic violence nonprofits that can provide advice, emotional support and practical help. They may be able to help with temporary accommodation if your mom needs to move out. 

Online counseling can also be a good option for both of you to help cope with the emotional trauma and stress. In the meantime, lean on your friends and family for support and to discuss your feelings. You're not alone - remember that there are organizations and resources out there for people in your situation."	2	0	0	0.0007829666137695312	forum with demographics
During the last 16 years of my parents’ marriage, my dad has been paranoid and jealous of my mom even though she’s the breadwinner and he barely works. Yesterday was the last straw when my mom was working at the nail salon and my dad accused my mom of cheating, saying that “the nail salon closed a long time ago”. To which my mom called her coworkers and showed camera footages for proof, but he refused to look or listen. Last night, he terrorized my mom and gave us until Sunday to move out of the house that my mom paid for. What could I do in this situation? Who can I report this to and what evidences would I need?	"I'm so sorry that you're going through this. It sounds like a very difficult and stressful situation. It's important to remember that there are resources out there that can help. If you're comfortable with it, reaching out to local law enforcement may be an immediate step you can take. Explain the situation and ask about possible restraining orders. In terms of evidence, any texts, voicemails or any record of his threats would be beneficial. 

You might also consider contacting a domestic violence hotline for advice on these situations. You need to ensure that you, your mom, and other family members are safe. Consider reaching out to a licensed counselor or therapist to talk through these issues; they can provide beneficial strategies to cope with this stress.

I'd also advise trying to gather financial records of payments your mom made towards the house, as these can support her case if needed. It's quite likely the house could be considered as her property if she's been the one primarily paying for it.

Remember, your safety and emotional wellbeing is the most important thing right now. I'm wishing you all the strength and courage. Hang in there."	2	0	0	0.0008773207664489746	forum w/o demographics
"A little context my father has been abusing me and my mother for years now. My mother at the front of verbal and physical violence, and me at the front of verbal violence. 
And yesterday my father was shouting at mother again, so I couldn't take it anymore and blew up at him. This is the first time I've ever done so. And now I don't know what he is going to do today, as he is unpredictable due to him being bipolar and it scares me so so much.
So what...can I do currently? What steps should I take to ensure that me and my mother remains safe and could have a bright future?

Immediately contact the Protection of Women and Children toll-free (24/7) helpline in Taiwan at 0800-013-995. They can provide advice and link you to resources such as emergency shelters. Try to document any instances of abuse if you can safely. Speak with a trusted friend, neighbor, or teacher for support and as a way to safely exit the situation if needed.

If you can, reach out to a local domestic abuse hotline and explain the situation. Here's the number for The Garden of Hope Foundation in Taiwan, which provides services for victims of domestic violence: +886 2 7610-8855. Your conversation with them will be confidential.

Next, depending on your age and situation, seek help from other family members, friends, or trusted adults who can potentially offer you and your mother a safe place to stay temporarily. Document instances of abuse if you're able and consider contacting the local authorities if you feel it is necessary and safe to do so.

Try to have an escape plan in place, should the situation escalate. Arrange a signal or code word with a friend or neighbor to let them know if you're in immediate danger and need them to call the police. Also remember to keep an emergency bag packed with essentials in case you need to leave quickly.

Long term, it would be beneficial for you and your mother to seek professional counselling or therapy, as this kind of situation can result in serious emotional trauma.

I'm 15 years old. I was born into a little known South Korean cult and I currently live in the main compound which is inside a mountain. I have little contact with the outside world and I have no friends (for obvious reasons). I can't make friends online. Most people I've tried to make friends with on like Discord and other places simply just don't give a shit. I'm also homeschooled so there's that. I'm isolated from the outside world and I have no one, not even online people. My interests are too abnormal (philosophy, religion) for a teenager and everyone just looks at me like I'm a freak. All my family are in the cult except for my cousins and aunt from my dad's side who I don't have contact with. I'm done.	Hey, it sounds like you're feeling really alone and isolated right now. You might feel like an outsider, but there are many people who share your interests in philosophy and religion. It can be tough to find those people on platforms like Discord, but there are other online communities where you might find a sense of belonging (philosophy and religious study forums, for example). You are not a freak, your interests make you unique and can lead to fascinating conversations. Reaching out to your relatives might also be an option, even if it feels intimidating. Sometimes, it's in the hard times we realize who actually cares. Keep on, step by step, and remember, being unique is not being abnormal.	1	0	0	0.0007890462875366211	social media

I can only imagine how difficult your situation must be and it's incredibly brave of you to reach out for support. It's perfectly alright to have interests in philosophy and religion - those are heavy, important topics and it's great that you're interested in them. While it may not seem typical among teenagers, remember there are still many out there drawn to such subjects.

As you're unable to make friends in person, continue reaching out online, even here. This might look like joining Reddit communities or forums devoted to philosophy and religion. You may find many who share the same interests as you and by participating, you'll get a sense of community. 

Next, consider reaching out to your distant family, your aunt and cousins. Who knows, they may lend emotional support or offer aid in your predicament. It's also common for people in challenging circumstances to seek help from professionals. Depending upon your resources, using the internet on a device to reach out to hotlines or organisations that can provide resources and assistance might be an option. 

Lastly, remember that your situation does not define you. You are very young and you have a whole life ahead of you. Sometimes, it requires reaching out, like you did here, to find that beacon of hope that can help change your circumstances. Stay strong. 

Remember, you are not alone. You have a community here that cares about you."	1	0	0	0.0006989240646362305	mental health forum

This sounds like a really difficult living situation, and it's totally understandable to feel overwhelmed. That sense of isolation can be heavy, but please remember that you're not alone. 

It's brave of you to reach out, even on an online space like this. It's clear that you're a very thoughtful individual with your interest in philosophy and religion, which are exciting realms to delve into. They might seem abnormal to your peers, but they are actually quite an intriguing and intellectual pursuits. 

This might not be the community for you, but there are others out there who will appreciate you for who you are. There are many forums for such intellectual discussions, such as r/philosophy and r/religion. Not being able to find people who share your interests right now doesn't mean you won't come across them in the future.

As someone in a potentially restrictive environment, it can feel like things aren’t ever going to change. But remember, your current situation isn't a reflection of what your life will always look like. You've mentioned you have relatives outside of your current community, which may be a potential start point for reaching out beyond your current environment. 

There might be local, national, or international organizations that can provide practical advice or support for people living in similar conditions, so I'd urge you to perform whatever research is safe for you to undertake.

Consider reaching out to professional help if you can. Remember, it's okay to ask for help, and there are many resources available to those in difficult situations, even if things can feel utterly hopeless."	2	0	0	0.0007030963897705078	forum with demographics

In the meantime, however, I would encourage you to explore your interests in philosophy and religion further as there are many helpful resources available online. You can also try reaching out to online communities or forums related to your interests (I know for a fact there are many people who share your passion for philosophy and talk about it online), it could provide an alternative way to connect to individuals with similar interests even if you can't physically meet them.

Remember, being different isn't wrong or something to be ashamed of, it makes you unique. Your interests in philosophy and religion at such a young age may make you feel different from your peers because these are more advanced topics usually approached in later life, but they can also be a vehicle for connection, wisdom, and self-understanding. 

Lastly, if you can, try to contact your extended family, your cousins, and aunt. Even if you don't have a lot of contact with them, they could still provide some different perspectives and potential avenues of support. Please, talk to someone -- you are not alone, even if it feels that way now. There will always be underground currents of people who feel just the way you do, and are ready to listen and connect with you."	2	0	0	0.0006810426712036133	forum w/o demographics
"24 f here,I feel like I hate my life. I've never had a serious relationship and I've never kissed a guy,I'm a virgin. This year it finally hit me how for the last 4 years my mental health was in shambles. I still live at home with my parents, because I was studying till last year and still working on my career and am not financially capable enough to move out-plus I'm Asian so it's not even considering very bad for me to still be living at home.
I'm not even confident enough to drive by myself, I'm full of self-doubt and the past 2 years I just experienced such self loathing thoughts,I'm an introvert, was a really shy kid,and I hate this about my personality, I've always wished I was different, was an extrovert but the last 2 years,these thoughts were so amplified,it made me really dislike myself and dislike so many parts of my personality-I'm a people pleaser and feel like such a pushover,all I could think over the last 2 years was,wow I'm such a loser,doormat,not confident enough to drive,and I don't even have a career or am smart enough to find a job,still living at home,plus I'm fat and ugly-
yes on top of all this,I grew up fat,I managed to lose some weight over the last 1.5 years,but I've always been insecure because of this as well and heard things like you'd look nicer if you lost weight or you'll find a guy if you lost weight as a teenager and at 18 a guy even told me you'd look better if you lost weight-really made me believe I wasn't good enough and made me all the more closed of to guys and dating in the past 4 years.
Also,because of my awkward,quiet nature,I was unable to form a proper concerte friendship in college,despite being in college for 5 years. Isn't that so abnormal? A young person who has no proper friend from college? 
This made me dislike myself a lot more last year and really made me feel like had I been not me,had I been a non-awkward extrovert I wouldn't have this problem. 
I'm finally starting to realize just how much in shambles my mental health has been for the past,especially 4 years,and I hate it. Feels like I lost a part of my life,and as a result of which I ignored my dating life and even college social life for the past few years.
I just want to ask,is this normal? To be closed off socially due to shit,shit mental health.
Am I a loser because I haven't kissed anyone at this age where even 17 year olds are having sex? Also,I'm not one to hookup,or have casual sex,I'd prefer a genuine relationship,iam already self conscious and really awkward, is this another factor that is going to make things harder for me,dating wise?
Am I a complete weirdo or outcast because of this or am I doomed to be alone because of this?
Also,since I've just realized these things,as of now my priority is to just work on getting my career sorted, and to better my mental health and make a few new friends,join the gym and focus on my physical health as well-I don't want to prioritize dating as of now after the realization of how trash my mental health was.
Is that the right thing to do? 
Idk why,I feel like if I de-prioritize dating any further, I'll just die alone with no sexual experience, and will just become a weird outcast and people my age will eventually settle down,be married,etc. and will be heavily judged for being xyz age and not having had a  proper relationship or experience with physical intimacy. 
Can anyone relate/understand?
I feel like I cannot share any of this with my closest friends because they won't really understand, and I don't want to share something and have my feelings be dismissed or invalidated.

Also,if you managed to read everything, thank you so much!"	"Hey there, sending lots of strength and positivity your way! 💪💖 It's absolutely okay to feel the way you're feeling. This journey is YOURS and everyone moves at their own pace. You're not weird or an outcast for being a virgin or for not having been in a relationship; there's no ""right"" age for these experiences to happen. If casual hookups aren't for you, stand by that choice. 

Now, it sounds like you're being overly harsh on yourself. We all have insecurities, but they needn't define us. Your worth is not determined by your relationship history or your physical appearance. That being said, prioritising your mental health and career right now is a mature decision. Also, it definitely doesn't mean that you'll end up alone! 

You're young and have plenty of time to embark on romantic relationships once you're in a better state of mind. You're dealing with a lot right now; don't rush yourself. It's completely fine to focus on your personal growth and achieving a healthy mental state. It's crucial to love and value oneself before entering a relationship.

Oftentimes, a good starting point is therapy or counselling to address the feelings of self-loathing and isolation you're experiencing. Remember, it's also okay to lean on your friends; everyone struggles, and no one will think less of you for sharing. Many can relate to what you're going through, you're not alone. 

Stick around on supportive platforms like this, where you can be open about your feelings without judgment. Keep evolving, learning, and prioritizing your own well-being. Good things will follow. Trust in your journey. 🌻🙌"	1	0	0	0.0009582638740539551	social media

I'm not even confident enough to drive by myself, I'm full of self-doubt and the past 2 years I just experienced such self loathing thoughts,I'm an introvert, was a really shy kid,and I hate this about my personality, I've always wished I was different, was an extrovert but the last 2 years,these thoughts were so amplified,it made me really dislike myself and dislike so many parts of my personality-I'm a people pleaser and feel like such a pushover,all I could think over the last 2 years was,wow I'm such a loser,doormat,not confident enough to drive,and I don't even have a career or am smart enough to find a job,still living at home,plus I'm fat and ugly-
yes on top of all this,I grew up fat,I managed to lose some weight over the last 1.5 years,but I've always been insecure because of this as well and heard things like you'd look nicer if you lost weight or you'll find a guy if you lost weight as a teenager and at 18 a guy even told me you'd look better if you lost weight-really made me believe I wasn't good enough and made me all the more closed of to guys and dating in the past 4 years.
Also,because of my awkward,quiet nature,I was unable to form a proper concerte friendship in college,despite being in college for 5 years. Isn't that so abnormal? A young person who has no proper friend from college? 
This made me dislike myself a lot more last year and really made me feel like had I been not me,had I been a non-awkward extrovert I wouldn't have this problem. 
I'm finally starting to realize just how much in shambles my mental health has been for the past,especially 4 years,and I hate it. Feels like I lost a part of my life,and as a result of which I ignored my dating life and even college social life for the past few years.
I just want to ask,is this normal? To be closed off socially due to shit,shit mental health.
Am I a loser because I haven't kissed anyone at this age where even 17 year olds are having sex? Also,I'm not one to hookup,or have casual sex,I'd prefer a genuine relationship,iam already self conscious and really awkward, is this another factor that is going to make things harder for me,dating wise?
Am I a complete weirdo or outcast because of this or am I doomed to be alone because of this?
Also,since I've just realized these things,as of now my priority is to just work on getting my career sorted, and to better my mental health and make a few new friends,join the gym and focus on my physical health as well-I don't want to prioritize dating as of now after the realization of how trash my mental health was.
Is that the right thing to do? 
Idk why,I feel like if I de-prioritize dating any further, I'll just die alone with no sexual experience, and will just become a weird outcast and people my age will eventually settle down,be married,etc. and will be heavily judged for being xyz age and not having had a  proper relationship or experience with physical intimacy. 
Can anyone relate/understand?
I feel like I cannot share any of this with my closest friends because they won't really understand, and I don't want to share something and have my feelings be dismissed or invalidated.

Also,if you managed to read everything, thank you so much!"	"I'm really glad you reached out and put your feelings into words. That's a brave step and I want you to know that your self-reflection is an immense strength. 

Firstly, understand that we all develop at our own pace and comparing yourself to others will only feed into your insecurities. It's okay to not have had a relationship or sexual experience yet; your worth is not measured by these aspects.

When it comes to living with your parents, everybody's circumstances are different. There's no definitive age to move out, especially when considering different cultural contexts. Remember that you're working towards your career and flexibility can offer opportunities for growth during this stage.

Being introverted or shy isn't something to feel ashamed of. Introverts have unique strengths - being thoughtful, observant and empathetic are just a few examples. Remember to start appreciating your qualities instead of viewing them as shortcomings.

Regarding your weight, remember health is more important than appearances. If you are happy with your progress and feel healthier, that's all that matters. You do not exist to please anyone else's visual preferences.

Social anxiety isn't unusual. It's commendable that you are prioritizing your mental and physical health. Therapy could be a great step forward, and you might want to consider this.

As for your concern about dating, priorities change and evolve. It's okay to want to focus on yourself for a while. In time, you'll know when you're ready to explore that side of life. 

Remember that it's okay to not have everything figured out. It's okay to feel lost and unsure. What matters is your determined self-improvement journey. You are not alone in this and there's plenty of support available for when you're ready. Keep going, you're stronger than you realize.

Also,if you managed to read everything, thank you so much!"	"Hi there. Your feelings of struggle and self-doubt sound really tough, and it's brave of you to reach out for support like this. It seems you're dealing with a lot all at once: questions about your identity, your place in society, your lack of experience in romantic and sexual relationships, and feeling unsatisfied with your current circumstance. 

Firstly, everyone is different and moves at their own pace; there's no right or wrong timeframe for experiencing first kisses, relationships, or independent living. It's okay to feel the way you do, and you're not alone in experiencing these feelings, especially during such an uncertain time in your life. 

You've acknowledged the challenges with your mental health and the fact you're not in the position to prioritize dating right now which I think is a very wise decision. Taking the time to work on your career, creating a new routine, taking care of your physical and mental health, and trying to form new friendships indeed are major steps you're taking towards improving your well-being. 

It's also important to remember that while our societal norms often present one type of extroverted personality as ideal, there's value in being introverted too. Introverts often have deep thought processes, are great listeners and sensitive to others' needs, and these are valued qualities in friendships and relationships.

Finally, connecting with others who have had similar experiences and sharing your thoughts and feelings with them can often provide a great deal of reassurance and comfort. Don't hesitate to look for support groups or counselling services in your community as well. Online counselling and cognitive behavioral therapy may also be beneficial. 

It's not going to be an overnight change, but taking these steps to self-improvement and self-love is already a huge victory. Keep going, be gentle with yourself, and know that it's okay to seek professional help for guidance on your journey. Best of luck!"	1	0	0	0.0006658434867858887	clinician

Also,if you managed to read everything, thank you so much!"	"First of all, sending you a virtual hug. I wish I could instantly alleviate your pain, but please remember you're not alone in feeling this way. Many people have tormented themselves with self-deprecating thoughts and I want to assure you that you're not a 'weirdo' or 'loser' for experiencing them.

When it comes to relationships, please don't rush yourself. It's perfectly okay to not have experienced certain things yet. Everyone has a different timeline for their life, and it's not a competition. It’s also healthy for you to want a genuine connection rather than casual encounters.

Your decision to concentrate on personal improvement (career, health, relationships) is a commendable step towards self-acceptance and love. Healing is not a linear process and having patience with yourself is key.

When you begin to have a healthier relationship with yourself, it will reflect onto your relationships with others as well. You could consider a therapist or counselor for professional guidance if these thoughts become unbearable and you feel they are inhibiting your daily life.

Let’s not forget that Cosmo, Vogue and every Rom-Com on Netflix aren't the be-all and end-all. They set unrealistic expectations that can take a toll on your mental health. Just go at your own pace, life is not a race.

 Remember, you are more than your looks, more than a virgin or non-virgin, more than your quiet nature. You are a unique individual with so much potential and worth. It's okay to feel lost or confused, but you are not alone. You are capable and deserving of love, friendship, and success. Please remember this on your darker days. 

Also, when you're ready, try to open up to a close friend about your feelings - you might be surprised to find out how much they can relate or provide support. We're arching our backs under fires too, even if they look different from your own.

And lastly, remember that it's okay to ask for help, and it's okay to not have everything figured out yet. Each step towards improvement, no matter how small, is a huge achievement. You're strong for reaching out, and we are here for you.

Much love to you. if you need to talk further about anything, we're always ready to lend a listening ear."	2	0	0	0.0010066628456115723	forum with demographics

Also,if you managed to read everything, thank you so much!"	"Hey there,

Firstly, I want to say that everything you're feeling is valid. Your emotions are real and no one should ever make you feel as if they aren't. It sounds like you've been going through an incredibly hard time and you've been very brave for sharing all this with us.

Let's start with the concept of normal. Normality varies widely and is more of a social construct than a definitive measure. What may seem normal to some may not to others. It is okay to have not kissed anyone yet, no matter your age. Similarly, there's no set timeline to move out, get a job, or find a significant other. You're not a weird outcast for where you currently stand in life.

While society often makes young people feel rushed to hit certain milestones, remember that life isn't a race and everyone follows their own path. It's completely okay to prioritize getting your career sorted, improving your mental health and making new friends. Also, joining the gym is a great decision! This will not only enhance your physical health but also works wonders for mental health.

In terms of dating, it's important to navigate relationships at a pace and with a mindset that feels right for you. If that’s not where your focus is right now, that's perfectly okay. There's no need to follow societal expectations of when and how to enter a romantic relationship. 

I would also like to suggest seeking professional help if you're comfortable with it. Therapists, counselors, and mental health professionals can provide you with tools and coping mechanisms to deal with self-loathing thoughts and promote a better self-image.

You're not alone in feeling like this. Many people have had similar experiences and feelings, and a lot of them are able to come out the other side feeling better about themselves. Stay strong—it's okay to give yourself time to grow and evolve at a pace that works for you. You're appreciated as you are!"	1	0	0	0.000818789005279541	forum w/o demographics
"so recently, I decided that I was going to be online full-time as a high school junior taking all college classes...due to my mental health. High school was just not for me. I've taken college classes since freshman year of high school, so I am very used to college courses. I personally prefer college courses over high school courses. I am starting on the 21st and today was my high school's first day. I loved online during Covid. I thought that I will like it even more now since I don't have to hop on Google meets.

but some thing about seeing all my classmates posting about their first day of school, makes me very sad for some reason. I didn't think that I would be this sad crying over the high school I hated so much. I'm not crying because I'm anxious over taking these college classes(which shouldn't be that hard because they are GenEds high school grad requirements). it feels like some part of me is missing. I know it's good for me that I am starting college early but some part of me is nervous that I won't have a social life. And yes, I knew what I was getting into with online, but I didn't expect it to be this sad, especially after my grandpa leaving. I've been feeling very lonely because he has been living with me for the last two months. And he was the only person I really talked to during the summer because my parents are usually working. he just always chitchat with me. there was really no one else. I didn't expect that to hit me and I feel very lonely and sad inside now that he left.

even when my parents are at work, I'm the only child, so it was just me myself and I. But with him visiting us for the summer, I felt like I finally had someone to talk to. But with him leaving, I have a hard time adapting to the lonely life I had before with no one to communicate with.

I plan on getting a job soon, so I hope that will keep me busy. It's just I was use to my grandpa being with me and I was also used to being in high school for seven hours each day. now that I am a college student with a lot of time on my hands, I feel that a part of me is missing.

I also have a very hard time adjusting to new changes. I know that online will be better for my mental health in the future. but there's just been a lot going on with my grandpa leaving and have my grandma just passed away. Since I am online, I could travel to my home country. But that is also a very big decision if I want to commit to staying there for a few months.

usually, I prefer not being in a classroom with 30 other people. I hated high school and that was the main reason why I switched to online. I felt the high school classes were difficult for absolutely no reason and the school system was not for me. I think I am more sad about being so use to my summer with my grandpa then about high school.
With starting college full-time I feel that I am somewhat of an adult. That I am no longer a kid and maybe that's why I'm feeling sad about high school. But that's just one of the small reasons why I'm feeling this way, but I think my social life is what I'm concerned with the most. And the college thing is just to pile on top of what is really the main reason.

my mom did ask if I wanted to travel to my home country which 98% of my family lives there. didn't really think about it and just said no because I thought that would be very inconvenient. but now I am considering it. And I never really spent time with my family in Vietnam that much. I haven't seen them for four years now.
Maybe that's why I am so sad about my grandpa leaving because I never felt so connected with a family member that was not my mom."	"Hey there, it sounds like you're going through a major life transition, which can understandably spark all kinds of emotions. There's immense pressure on the concept of 'high school years' being the best of your life, but everyone's journey is different. It's 100% okay to feel a sense of loss - about leaving high school and your grandpa's departure even if the logical part of your mind knows they're for the best. 

Consider joining online clubs/groups at your college, it can be a great way to find people who share your interests and create that social link you might be craving. It might also be worth looking into forms of therapy to process your feelings, they can provide useful tools for managing life changes. 

It's great that you're considering reconnecting with your family in Vietnam. It could provide a sense of familial connections and help alleviate some feelings of loneliness, and who knows, you might even be surprised at how much it can feel like home. Remember you're in control and it's ok to change your mind.

Hang in there, soldier. Change is hard, but also full of great potential and unforeseen adventures. Sending you all the good vibes. 🌼🌼🌼 Keep reaching out and keep talking about your feelings, you're definitely not alone in this.

"Firstly, let me say that the emotions you are feeling are valid and very normal. Embracing a new phase in life, such as going to college, can bring a wide range of emotions like excitement, anxiety, and in your case, feelings of sadness and loneliness. 

Missing your grandpa is completely natural. It sounds like you two bonded over the summer and it's normal to feel a void when someone you've grown close to has to leave. You might consider finding ways to keep in touch with him regularly, maybe through phone or video calls.

Starting with online classes doesn't mean you will lack social interaction. Yes, it can feel different than traditional face-to-face interaction but there are many ways to stay connected. You can join online clubs or forums, participate in class discussions, or even reach out to classmates who may also feel isolated and seek camaraderie in your shared situation.

When it comes to managing your emotions, practicing mindfulness techniques could be beneficial. These practices, such as meditation, deep breathing, and conscious awareness, may help calm your mind, manage your emotions, and bring you a sense of peace.

Considering the idea of connecting with your extended family in Vietnam could also be something to ponder more thoroughly. It could be an incredible opportunity to immerse yourself in a different culture and get to know your family better.

The flexibility of online learning could make it quite feasible to stay abroad for a prolonged period, taking this as a factor in your decision. It's good to think about what’s best for you in the short and long term, and which options align best with your goals. 

At times like this, it may help to consult a guidance counselor or mental health professional. They can provide emotional support, as well as practical advice for navigating these major life transitions.

Remember that these feelings will pass over time as you develop a new routine and find new methods to connect with others. You're embarking on an exciting stage in your life, and it's perfectly fine to feel somewhat overwhelmed at first. Best of luck on this new journey.

I've taken college classes since freshman year of high school, so I am very used to college courses. I personally prefer college courses over high school courses. I am starting on the 21st and today was my high school's first day. I loved online during Covid. I thought that I will like it even more now since I don't have to hop on Google meets.

but some thing about seeing all my classmates posting about their first day of school, makes me very sad for some reason. I didn't think that I would be this sad crying over the high school I hated so much. I'm not crying because I'm anxious over taking these college classes(which shouldn't be that hard because they are GenEds high school grad requirements). it feels like some part of me is missing. I know it's good for me that I am starting college early but some part of me is nervous that I won't have a social life. And yes, I knew what I was getting into with online, but I didn't expect it to be this sad, especially after my grandpa leaving. I've been feeling very lonely because he has been living with me for the last two months. And he was the only person I really talked to during the summer because my parents are usually working. he just always chitchat with me. there was really no one else. I didn't expect that to hit me and I feel very lonely and sad inside now that he left.

even when my parents are at work, I'm the only child, so it was just me myself and I. But with him visiting us for the summer, I felt like I finally had someone to talk to. But with him leaving, I have a hard time adapting to the lonely life I had before with no one to communicate with.

I plan on getting a job soon, so I hope that will keep me busy. It's just I was use to my grandpa being with me and I was also used to being in high school for seven hours each day. now that I am a college student with a lot of time on my hands, I feel that a part of me is missing.

I also have a very hard time adjusting to new changes. I know that online will be better for my mental health in the future. but there's just been a lot going on with my grandpa leaving and have my grandma just passed away. Since I am online, I could travel to my home country. But that is also a very big decision if I want to commit to staying there for a few months.

usually, I prefer not being in a classroom with 30 other people. I hated high school and that was the main reason why I switched to online. I felt the high school classes were difficult for absolutely no reason and the school system was not for me. I think I am more sad about being so use to my summer with my grandpa then about high school.
With starting college full-time I feel that I am somewhat of an adult. That I am no longer a kid and maybe that's why I'm feeling sad about high school. But that's just one of the small reasons why I'm feeling this way, but I think my social life is what I'm concerned with the most. And the college thing is just to pile on top of what is really the main reason.

my mom did ask if I wanted to travel to my home country which 98% of my family lives there. didn't really think about it and just said no because I thought that would be very inconvenient. but now I am considering it. And I never really spent time with my family in Vietnam that much. I haven't seen them for four years now.
Maybe that's why I am so sad about my grandpa leaving because I never felt so connected with a family member that was not my mom."

Firstly, I want to commend you for your ability to diligently take on college courses as a high school student. That's not an easy feat, and yet you're gracefully handling it. It's understandable to feel conflicted about leaving high school and the emotions that arise from seeing your peers' experiences. 

Missing the presence of your grandpa and feeling alone is a valid response. His company provided companionship, and that's a tough thing to lose. Maybe try to reserve some time every day or week to call him, this way sustain some of the bond you have built. 

Feeling like you've lost a piece of yourself by switching school environments and losing your companion - that's normal. Significant life changes can often cause us to mourn what was. Remember, it's okay to take some time to grieve, but also try to look at things from a different perspective. You may not be around your high school friends, but there are so many opportunities for meeting new people and making friends in an online environment as well. Maybe you could join a club or a study group? Having plans and engaging in various activities will often make the process of readjusting easier.

As for your concern about a lack of social life, I understand why that would worry you. Transitioning to online study can indeed feel isolating. But remember, social interactions are not only limited to in-person meetings. You can join online communities, virtual clubs, and even have remote study buddies. You can build a different, but still fulfilling, social life.

Lastly, regarding visiting Vietnam - I think it's a great idea. Family can provide a great deal of comfort and visiting them might help you process your feelings and reconnect with your roots. A change in location might also be rejuvenating and offer a fresh perspective.

Change is not easy, but it often leads us to places we never imagined we would journey to. It's okay to feel overwhelmed and unsure. Seek support, maintain connections and allow yourself to embrace the new chapter in your life with courage and confidence.

Take care."	1	0	0	0.0006436705589294434	forum w/o demographics
"I come from a dysfunctional Indian family and my parents are hitting each other. I've been shoved out of their room and they're breaking cutlery and things.

I see my younger sister on the verge of tears and it breaks my heart even more. I have an awful pit in my stomach and a constant regret that I should've taken birth in a secure happy family.

I wish this was all a nightmare and I could wake up from this into a happy world.

I promise myself that I'll never be a parent like them."	"I'm really sorry to hear that you're going through this. The first and foremost priority is your safety and your sister's. If you can, reach out to any close relatives or friends who can provide temporary shelter. If physical violence continues, you might need to involve local authorities. 

For emotional support, there are helplines available that can provide counsel and guide you. Remember, you're not alone and this isn't your burden to bear. Stay strong! You have the power to break the cycle and be the parent you wish to be in future. Take care of yourself and your little sister. 🤗🙏💪💜"	2	0	0	0.0009064674377441406	social media

Please remember that none of this is your fault. You were born into these circumstances, not chosen them, so don't carry this burden of guilt.

In these situations, it might be beneficial to find a safe space for both of you, away from the chaos if possible. This could be a private room, or even outside of the house if it gets too violent and you feel threatened. 

You may also want to involve some trusted adults, perhaps other family members or friends' parents who you trust and feel comfortable around. They could provide some guidance or be a source of support for you.

Try to maintain some sense of calm for your sister. This situation is obviously very scary for her too, and she's looking to you for reassurance. Perhaps try to distract her with some activities you both enjoy. 

Your desire to not emulate these behaviors as a parent in the future is a testament to your strength and compassion. Don't lose sight of this goal. Even if things are difficult now, remember that you have the power to break this cycle.

Lastly, consider seeking help from local services or organisations that are created to help in these situations (domestic abuse helplines, local authorities, child protection services etc.). They exist to support individuals like you, so don't hesitate to reach out to them. Your protection and mental health should be your main priority right now, so do what you need to do to ensure that.

It's clear that you're feeling an extreme amount of stress and it's important to remember that these feelings are completely valid. If you ever feel that you or your sister are in immediate physical danger, it is important to contact a local authority. Reach out to a trusted adult if possible, they could potentially offer assistance or advice. Stay strong, remember to try and care for your mental health during this difficult time - deep breathing exercises or grounding techniques can help with immediate stress. It's clear that you're very protective of your sister as well - perhaps you can find solace in each other during these hard times. Moving forwards, one step you could consider is seeking professional help to assist with the emotional distress you're experiencing. This could look like finding a local counselor or mental health hotline to discuss your situation, and they might be able to provide you with more strategies and coping mechanisms. You already show a tremendous amount of resilience and self-awareness, which are great qualities to draw upon.	2	0	0	0.0006628632545471191	clinician

The violence and turbulence you're witnessing is not your fault, it's important to remember that. Is there anyone else, like friends, family members or neighbours, who might be able to provide you and your sister with a safe place at the moment? 

No child should have to experience this. Please contact Child Protective Services or the equivalent organisation in your area. They are there to help in situations just like this one and they can ensure you and your sister are safe. 

Remember, your origins do not define your path. You have the power to break the cycle and can create a future for yourself that's completely different from what you're currently experiencing. If you can, reach out to a counselor or mental health professional who can assist you. A therapist can certainly help navigate you through this trauma and come out stronger.

I'm really sorry that you're going through such a tough time right now and my heart goes out to you. The impact of witnessing such a heated situation at your young age is undoubtedly traumatic and overwhelming. Living in a dysfunctional family can be challenging, trying to handle this situation all by yourself can be very distressing. Please remember, this is not your fault and that you're brave to be enduring all of this, and it's admirable to see you empathizing with your younger sister.

The first step could be to take immediate action when physical violence is involved. Possibly, involving law enforcement as it is not safe for you and your younger sister. You may find local organizations that can provide support to you both, emotionally and legally, after the incidence of violence. There is no shame in seeking help.

Would you feel safe speaking to a trusted adult (like a teacher, school counselor, or a relative) about what's happening? They may be able to report this to the appropriate authorities on your behalf. You should also consider reaching out to a children's helpline in India, they take such matters very seriously and can provide immediate support. 

Above all, remember to take care of your mental and emotional health at the same time. Counseling or therapy (individually or with your sister) can help you process and navigate through this difficult situation. It's understandable that you feel cheated out of a secure and happy family environment, but don't lose hope. 

You've made a strong promise to yourself about the kind of parent you wish to be and that's an inspiring attitude. It shows that you have the determination to break out of dysfunctional patterns. Keep this thought with you and use it as motivation to strive for a better and secure environment for you and your sister. Sending strength and courage your way."	2	0	0	0.0016497373580932617	forum w/o demographics
"So it goes like ....
I liked a girl from my branch (nit) , after a talking stage of 4 months I confessed her .. but she was not interested.  I gracefully accepted her decision and tried to move on .. but I see her everyday,  I feel like a complete loser , whenever I see her with  another boy , it makes me uncomfortable.  I haven't messaged her since 2 months so as to detach myself but all in vain .... sometimes I am unable to sleep at night .... going insane...

Someone pls help...
Sorry for bad English ( hindi medium )"	"Hey, I totally get how you're feeling; rejection can be really tough to get through. One thing to remember is that it doesn't define you or your worth. Distance can be really useful in helping heal, maybe try to mix up your routine a bit so you don't cross paths as much? Engaging more with friends & new activities can also help distract you and build up your self-confidence. Remember, it's okay to feel this way & it will eventually pass. Take care of yourself, first & foremost! Better times are sure to come.

Sorry for bad English ( hindi medium )"	"Hi there, it sounds like you're going through a tough time right now, and it's totally understandable feeling the way you do. Breakups, rejections and unrequited love can be really painful. It's perfectly normal to feel hurt, sad, and confused in these circumstances. 

First, remember this doesn't make you a 'loser'. Everyone experiences rejection at some point and it doesn't reflect your value as a person. You showed maturity in accepting her decision and respect for her feelings, which shows a level of emotional intelligence many lack.

Secondly, remember feelings heal over time. It may seem unbearable now, but it will get better. It might help to work on keeping your focus elsewhere. Engage in hobbies, hang out with your friends, or find new activities that you can enjoy. Find a new routine that doesn't involve her as much, look for new environments or groups where you can meet other people.

Lastly, don't suffer in silence. You've already done a great job reaching out for help here, keep up the good work. Talk to someone you trust about what you're going through, like a friend or family member. If things seem very hard, you might want to talk to a mental health professional who can provide you with proper guidance.

Remember, it's okay to grieve but also important to take care of your mental health. You are not alone and you will get through this. Keep going, friend.

Sorry for bad English ( hindi medium )"	"Hello, I'm really sorry to hear that you're struggling. It's great that you've reached out for support, it takes a lot of courage to share these feelings. Heartache is tough. That rejection can be extremely painful, and it's natural to feel down about it. 

Seeing her everyday can certainly be challenging, especially when she's with someone else. One piece of advice I'd give is to try and expand your social circle and activities, get involved in clubs and societies, where you can meet different people. Keep yourself busy with constructive activities that you enjoy doing. Also, it might be uncomfortable, but sometimes sharing your feelings with a trusted friend or family member can help lift some of the burden you're carrying.

Remember, it's okay to feel upset and it does take time to heal, but it's important to direct your mind and your energies towards your own healing. You're not a loser in any way. Attachments can take time to undo, you've shown strength by maintaining distance so far, keep going.

Lastly, I'd recommend seeking out professional help to navigate through these feelings because they're neither insignificant nor trivial. There are English-speaking mental health professionals who would be more than happy to help you navigate your feelings more effectively. 

But remember, the most important thing is to be kind to yourself during this time. It's okay to feel what you're feeling, every setback can also be an important opportunity for learning and growth."	2	0	0	0.0007047653198242188	clinician

Sorry for bad English ( hindi medium )"	"Sorry to hear that you're going through such a rough time. Heartbreak is tough and it's completely okay to feel the way you do. Activities that once brought joy can seem dull and the world might appear bleak and endless - but remember this is just a phase and it too shall pass.

Start by expressing your feelings. You've already done a good job by sharing your story here. Write it down somewhere in more detail, exactly how you feel - it could be a letter to yourself, a poem, or a song. 

Next, remind yourself that everyone encounters rejection at some point of their life, it's normal and is absolutely no indication of your worth as an individual. You may feel uncomfortable seeing her with someone else, which is natural, but remember that they have their own journey, and you have yours.

Try diverting your attention to things that you love doing or find an activity that could keep you engrossed. You might feel a lack of interest initially, but don't stop. Keep at it. Reinvent yourself, pick up a new skill or hobby, spend time with friends and family, work hard on your academic or career goals. 

As for trouble sleeping, try some relaxation techniques such as deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation or guided imagery. Regular physical exercise can help too, but avoid exercising close to bedtime as this might interfere with your sleep.

Lastly, it's important that you think about seeking professional help if your feelings are overwhelming and you find it hard to cope. Reach out to student counseling services that your college offers. 

Remember, it's okay to ask for help and talk about your feelings. This too shall pass."	2	0	0	0.0008031725883483887	forum with demographics

Sorry for bad English ( hindi medium )"	"Hey there,
I'm really empathetic to what you're going through right now. It's incredibly tough to deal with your feelings, especially when seeing that person every day. But remember, it's an important part of your growth. One very crucial thing I'd like to acknowledge is that your feelings are valid and it's okay to feel this way.
 
You did the right thing by respecting her decision. I understand how tough it must have been for you to see her with someone else, but it's essential to remember it's not a reflection of your worth or value. You're not a loser in any way, rather, you've shown great strength and maturity in handling this scenario. Often times, it's the situation that’s unfavorable and not the person. 

Try distracting yourself by engaging in hobbies, sports, or whatever interests you have. Maintaining a physical distance can also help in giving you some mental peace. It's okay to seek out professional help too if that feels right for you. Sleep deprivation can affect your mental and physical health, try some calming activities before bed, like reading or listening to soft music.
  
It’s valuable to remember that healing is a process, and it takes time. So, take care of yourself during this period .You are more than the feelings for one person and you deserve to be happy and appreciated. If you need to talk, we're all here for you. Stay strong!

Good luck,
[Your Name]

"Help me

So recently I discovered my father has 2 unregistered guns and some ammunition (pistol and rifle) (No joke) 

And I cant sleep at night comfortably knowing that any moment that I can possibly be shot and killed. 

We have no doors, our only escape is thru a big metal retractable door that is pretty old. 

Plus our house is a poorly kept ancestral house that is filled with 99% garbage with a leaky roof and low ceiling. (I'm very tall)

He does not care if he gets arrested and has audible stated this fact multiple times

At this point and time all my siblings have a job and my brother is at work... Plus my mom is on a trip to the province to visit me and my grandma. 

However my fear is that by reporting the guns, it may cause a domino effect leading to their arrest. They're good and hardworking people with dreams that were squashed by my dad's ruthless 

Also a few years ago my mom was injured by my dad pretty often leading to bruises,  and mga sugat sa May mata at katawan. Thankfully nowadays puro salita nalang pero paminsan minsan rin May nasisira na gamit due to arguments heating up.

To start, there are a few actions you can take immediately to ensure your safety. 

1. If your father is being physically abusive or threatening towards anyone in the house, calling the police should be your first step. Domestic violence is a serious matter and you have every right to ensure your own safety.

2. Even if he's not directly threatening and you're uncomfortable with the guns around, consider seeking advice from a local law enforcement agency. Gun laws differ depending on your location, but most places have a process for safely removing unregistered firearms from homes.

3. Reach out directly to local shelters or organizations that help in situations of domestic violence and unsafe living conditions. They can guide you on the best course of action and provide immediate support.

4. Lastly, consider discussing this with your siblings. It's possible they can provide support, resources, or possible solutions that you might not have considered.

Please, take care of yourself and don't hesitate to seek help. Remember, your safety is important and you don’t have to face this situation alone."	1	0	0	0.0013942122459411621	social media

So recently I discovered my father has 2 unregistered guns and some ammunition (pistol and rifle) (No joke) 

And I cant sleep at night comfortably knowing that any moment that I can possibly be shot and killed. 

We have no doors, our only escape is thru a big metal retractable door that is pretty old. 

Plus our house is a poorly kept ancestral house that is filled with 99% garbage with a leaky roof and low ceiling. (I'm very tall)

He does not care if he gets arrested and has audible stated this fact multiple times

At this point and time all my siblings have a job and my brother is at work... Plus my mom is on a trip to the province to visit me and my grandma. 

However my fear is that by reporting the guns, it may cause a domino effect leading to their arrest. They're good and hardworking people with dreams that were squashed by my dad's ruthless 

Also a few years ago my mom was injured by my dad pretty often leading to bruises,  and mga sugat sa May mata at katawan. Thankfully nowadays puro salita nalang pero paminsan minsan rin May nasisira na gamit due to arguments heating up.

It sounds like an incredibly challenging and scary situation. First, I encourage you to reach out to a trusted friend or relative who could potentially offer a place where you can stay temporarily, if possible. If there are neighbours or other community members you trust, let them know about your concern as well. Staying connected with others could potentially provide you with additional safety resources. 

It's important to acknowledge that you have every right to feel safe in your own home. If your father's behavior is threatening or abusive, please consider reaching out to local authorities or a local crisis hotline. Laws vary but unregistered firearms could be illegal in your area, and inflicting physical harm is a clear-cut case of domestic abuse. Please remember you don't have to tolerate that.

I might also suggest seeking professional advice on your situation, like from a counsellor or psychologist. They could offer you some coping mechanisms and provide you with further guidance. Counselling hotlines may be of help too, if traditional counselling may feel too intimidating or is not logistically possible at the moment.

Remember, your safety should always be your primary concern, and it's okay to put yourself first. I wish you strength and courage as you navigate through this difficult situation.

Your safety and mental well-being should always be a priority. Please know that there are resources for you during this time. 

Firstly, if you ever feel you're in immediate danger or threat, don't hesitate to call your local authority or emergency services.

For your current situation, consider reaching out to local non-profits or organizations that aid with domestic issues and querying whether they can assist you without involving law enforcement, if that is your preference. They can provide advice tailored for your situation and have experience dealing with similar cases.

Don't forget about your self-care. Try to maintain as regular a routine as possible and make a point to do things that you enjoy whenever possible. Look into grounding and relaxation techniques for when the anxiety starts to get overwhelming; these can help return some sense of control in the situation.

It's important to talk to someone about your situation. Can you speak to your siblings about it? Or, is there a close friend, a relative (other than your mom), or perhaps a school counselor or teacher who you trust and can express your worries to? Remember, it can be good just to share your thoughts and feelings.

Lastly, you mentioned that the house you're in is in a bad condition. You can, again, reach out to local resources and explain the situation, they might have solutions or help they can offer. 

Stay strong and remember that there are people who want to help."	2	0	0	0.0006818771362304688	forum with demographics

I'm really sorry to hear you're going through such a tough situation. Your fears are completely valid and I admire your strength in sharing your struggles so openly. It's vital for you to remember that your own safety should always come first. 

The fact that you're worried about your own life and the potential for violence tells me this is already a serious situation. You're so strong for having survived all you have so far, and reaching out to talk about your experiences and concerns shows a lot of self-awareness and courage.

I understand your worry about the potential consequences of reporting the guns, especially in relation to it possibly affecting your hardworking siblings and mom. You're in an incredibly tough, complicated situation and it's clear you care about your family a lot. It's not easy, but sometimes to protect ourselves and the ones we love, we have to make tough decisions.

You may be able to report the guns anonymously, eliminating any trace back to you, but you might want to contact a local legal authority, perhaps a non-emergency police line, or a lawyer, to further discuss your options and understand the potential consequences in a broader context. 

Please, try and seek support from friends, extended family members, or local resources too. You need a solid support system in place. Everything may seem insurmountable at present, but remember, just as your current residence is but one place in a vast, wide world full of possibilities for safety and happiness, your current situation is but a moment in time. 

Be strong, because things will get better. It might be stormy now, but it can't rain forever. Don't hesitate to reach out if you need more help or someone to talk with. We're here for you."	2	0	0	0.0009470582008361816	forum w/o demographics

Stranger: ill try You: okk Stranger: gimme a couple mins You: promise not to skip me tho"	"Hey, I’m genuinely sorry to hear about the difficulty you're experiencing trying to connect with new people, especially those who seem to be good potential friends. It appears like the both of you had a great conversation and a good connection, but due to the situation, you were unable to exchange contacts or continue the conversation outside of Omegle. 

Firstly, it's great you were offering support and trying to comfort them - that shows strength of character. Know that everyone goes through struggles in their lives and dealing with them varies from person to person. It's great that they found solace in talking with you despite not knowing each other previously - it highlights the power of empathy and kindness.

While it's understandably disappointing that you weren't able to maintain contact, remember that it's okay since we live in a digital age where similar conversations could happen anytime, anywhere. 

As for being unable to ""save"" the conversation, remember one of the most significant aspects of help is simply being there. Offering an ear to listen and a sincere message could create lasting effects even if it's just during a brief online chat.

Lastly, try not to internalize the feeling of being 'unable to provide the help that they need'. Sometimes the help that people need comes in different forms, and this conversation may have provided some comfort for this person. Your kindness and willingness to listen already made a difference.

Be gentle with yourself. You did a good deed in a digital world where many people are lonely and seeking a kind ear. Stay positive and continue spreading kindness - it makes the world a better place, one person at a time."	2	0	0	0.0006670355796813965	forum with demographics

Remember that it's perfectly alright to express how you feel, and it can even be beneficial to share these feelings with someone you trust. In this situation, you both seem to be comfortable with each other, so it might be helpful to continue that communication. 
   
While it's beyond my scope as a forum member to offer therapeutic help, there are many professional resources available for people your age struggling with loneliness, substance misuse or family issues. Your school could also have a counselor who you could reach out and speak to - they might be able to help you navigate some of your emotions and provide direction for appropriate professional help.

Remember, you are not alone in this - you've already shown strength in reaching out and communicating your feelings with each other, which is a very positive step towards managing these issues. Also remember to take care of your own mental health while supporting your friend - it's just as important."	1	0	0	0.0006213188171386719	forum w/o demographics
"Hi,   


I suppose the fact that this sub is in top 1% of Reddit tells a lot about the condition of our society.   


I was scouring for the right sub for this offload of experiences and emotions to crossreference with other people and it either is here or in 5 different places at the same time, but hell, here goes:  


I was born typicall middle-class family, Europe, Poland, at the begining of the 90'.  2 parents, overly present in my life, who are and were lovely but I didn't let it make me blind to certain mistakes, which undoubtedly I will also make, so worth mentioning, not worth holding grudge over. Since the very begining of my days I've been labelled as super smart and intelligent and to a certain degree I believe that, but in reality I wish learning and acquiring skills was tougher as I think it would've caused me to work harder on well, working hard. In friends department, I was quite lonely really, I've had the odd friend here and there, but I guess it's the typicall bullied fat kid story. Kindergarten - no friends that I could rememer, bullies I do. Primary school- 3 years of bullying followed by 3 years of bullying with an odd friend or two, didn't last. Then, as I thought I was making an actual friendship, we moved to suburb house, changed school, was even lonelier than before, bullying magnified but so did my resilience and I guess that was the point in my life when I chose that I don't want to fight for any kind of attention anymore, but not in a good way, I basically alienated myself for 3 years. Then highschool was the biggest let down of them all. In the middle school, I focused solely on getting to the best High school I could in my region, thinking that intellingence/ambition will finally get me surrounded by people more like me. <Insert\_Joker\_laughter>. Got in, people turned out to be either rich assholes, or suckups to those rich assholes. 4 months into the 3 years I knew I am again going for loneliness when the odd thing happend and by some sort of miracle I got a bunch of other misfits together and we were less alone. Nonetheless I changed cities for studies, which I never wanted but was to afraid to fight my parents about it, which ultimately led to nothing good in the studies department. I then changed jobs, tried to look for fun, money or anything else that would help me find like a path or a goal. Ultimately I am to this day completely unaware why are people so rude, evil and self centered. After 30 years of turning round and round on this rock, I literally have no idea why people want to live in capitalism the way it is right now, why everyone is blind to others problems, why we are completely skeptical of science, but will fight till death for an old book. Most of my life I feel like an alien in a strange world, surrouned by other creatures who look like me, but that have nothing in common. The one thing that is constant in my experience, is that there is no good people with money, and some good people with no money at all. Me myself, I was making ordinary money, than a fuckton, and now back to ordinary as my previous boss was a typical egomaniac with shouting as the main tool. I mean dude had some skill, he was like all the bullies I've experienced combined, but with an upgrade of actually having a hold on my life by randomly changing the rules of employment. Nowadays, I feel no passion, have almost no ambition and feel surrouneded by a world that just does not work well with people who wish to be good. I mean hell, I know it is always worth to be kind, and good, and compassionate, but for fuck sake, in my experience it only gets you exploited.   


So to sum it up, I am mighty sad, don't see no worth in the way we live and quite frankly think that around 10 years from now the whole system will collapse. Idk, roast me, argue with me or agree, any interaction is appreciated as it may give some insight or point of view that I never thought of. "	"Hey there,

Firstly, it sounds like you've navigated a seriously rough terrain and you're feeling lost, yet despite the struggles, your resilience shines through. Kudos for staying strong, a testament to your character. 

To help you navigate your way, you might find value in seeking professional help, such as a therapist. They can offer strategies to cope with your feelings and perspective that benefits from a distance. A support group, virtual or physical, can provide understanding and advocacy from those in a similar situation. It certainly does not devalue your intelligence, but taps into emotional intelligence.

You're also frustrated and disappointed with the socio-economic disparities and societal behavior. It's hard to change that singlehandedly, but putting your energy and focus into things you are passionate about and believe in can create a ripple effect. Remember, even embryonic steps can make a difference.

Your journey isn't over. Circumstances change, people grow, and even societal structures evolve. Keep an open mind to the opportunities life can offer. Stay strong. 💪💚"	1	0	0	0.0006682276725769043	social media

First off, thank you for your courage in sharing your experiences. It takes strength to open up about both the events from your past and your present feelings. It's evident that the hardship and isolation you've faced has moulded your current perspective, which is completely valid given your experiences. 

Your feelings of disconnect from those around you and society at large must indeed be quite disheartening, and I'm really sorry you're feeling this way, but please remember that you're not alone in feeling this, especially in a world that often seems overwhelming and unkind.

One thing that strikes me from your post is the resilience you've shown. You've faced adversity more than once and come out the other side. This resilience is a strength, even if it does not always feel that way. Now it's crucial to channel this resilience into healing and improving your quality of life.

It might be helpful to reach out to a professional, such as a therapist or counsellor, who can provide you with the tools to process your experiences and feelings. They can also help you combat feelings of isolation and alienation, teaching you coping mechanisms to deal with these feelings constructively. 

Regarding your view of the world and society's path—many people share your concerns. Exploring networks, clubs or groups that focus on this shared sentiment might help to create a sense of community for you and introduce you to people who feel similarly about the world. Being able to communicate and bond with like-minded people might help alleviate your feelings of loneliness and alienation.

The world can feel cruel at times, and it's completely okay to feel overwhelmed. Remember to take care of yourself and reach out to those who can provide support. Please keep posting and sharing your experiences. You're not alone in this."	1	0	0	0.0006709098815917969	mental health forum

Firstly, I'm really sorry that you're feeling this way, but I'm unable to provide the help that you need. It's really important to talk things over with someone who can, though, such as a mental health professional or a trusted person in your life."	2	0	0	0.0007188916206359863	clinician

Me myself, I was making ordinary money, than a fuckton, and now back to ordinary as my previous boss was a typical egomaniac with shouting as the main tool. I mean dude had some skill, he was like all the bullies I've experienced combined, but with an upgrade of actually having a hold on my life by randomly changing the rules of employment.

I mean hell, I know it is always worth to be kind, and good, and compassionate, but for fuck sake, in my experience it only gets you exploited.   


So to sum it up, I am mighty sad, don't see no worth in the way we live and quite frankly think that around 10 years from now the whole system will collapse. Idk, roast me, argue with me or agree, any interaction is appreciated as it may give some insight or point of view that I never thought of. "	"Hello there,

Firstly, I want to acknowledge your bravery in sharing your experiences and being open about your troubling thoughts. You've been through a lot in your life and it's evident that these experiences have greatly affected you.

It's interesting that you mention feeling like an outsider and being alienated. It can be really tough when we don't quite fit into the societal 'norms' or when we feel disconnected from people around us. Often, when we feel like this, it's because we have profound thoughts and observations about the world that others may not understand or agree with. Remember, it's okay to be different or feel like you don't belong - it doesn't necessarily mean there's anything wrong with you. 

I hear your frustration about the society we live in - capitalism, people's apathy, and the failure to appreciate science. It looks like you hold yourself to a higher standard, valuing kindness, compassion, and honesty. It's disappointing when the world doesn't live up to those standards, but don't let this discourage you. Instead, let it fuel your determination to aspire to those values and inspire others to do so too.

About your experience with bullying, you mention resilience - that's a very powerful attribute. Use that to help you navigate your emotions and tackle difficulties ahead. It can also guide you to advocate for others who may need support.  

Don't lose hope. It's clear from your post that you're someone who deeply cares about the world and the people in it, and the world definitely needs more people like you. Remember, it's okay to take your time and find your own path. Keep seeking out different perspectives as you've done here - you never know what spark may ignite a newfound interest or passion. Also, remember to take care of your mental health. Reach out to professionals, join supportive groups or forums, and consider therapy if you haven't already. 

Lastly, the future is uncertain and indeed can sometimes seem bleak. But we've got a lot more control over our own lives than we do the future of the entire world. Our efforts might feel small in the grand scheme of things, but concerted actions can lead to considerable change. So focus on what you can control and where you can make a difference.

Stay strong."	1	0	0	0.0007371306419372559	forum with demographics
"Hi,   


I suppose the fact that this sub is in top 1% of Reddit tells a lot about the condition of our society.   


I was scouring for the right sub for this offload of experiences and emotions to crossreference with other people and it either is here or in 5 different places at the same time, but hell, here goes:  


I was born typicall middle-class family, Europe, Poland, at the begining of the 90'.  2 parents, overly present in my life, who are and were lovely but I didn't let it make me blind to certain mistakes, which undoubtedly I will also make, so worth mentioning, not worth holding grudge over. Since the very begining of my days I've been labelled as super smart and intelligent and to a certain degree I believe that, but in reality I wish learning and acquiring skills was tougher as I think it would've caused me to work harder on well, working hard. In friends department, I was quite lonely really, I've had the odd friend here and there, but I guess it's the typicall bullied fat kid story. Kindergarten - no friends that I could rememer, bullies I do. Primary school- 3 years of bullying followed by 3 years of bullying with an odd friend or two, didn't last. Then, as I thought I was making an actual friendship, we moved to suburb house, changed school, was even lonelier than before, bullying magnified but so did my resilience and I guess that was the point in my life when I chose that I don't want to fight for any kind of attention anymore, but not in a good way, I basically alienated myself for 3 years. Then highschool was the biggest let down of them all. In the middle school, I focused solely on getting to the best High school I could in my region, thinking that intellingence/ambition will finally get me surrounded by people more like me. <Insert\_Joker\_laughter>. Got in, people turned out to be either rich assholes, or suckups to those rich assholes. 4 months into the 3 years I knew I am again going for loneliness when the odd thing happend and by some sort of miracle I got a bunch of other misfits together and we were less alone. Nonetheless I changed cities for studies, which I never wanted but was to afraid to fight my parents about it, which ultimately led to nothing good in the studies department. I then changed jobs, tried to look for fun, money or anything else that would help me find like a path or a goal. Ultimately I am to this day completely unaware why are people so rude, evil and self centered. After 30 years of turning round and round on this rock, I literally have no idea why people want to live in capitalism the way it is right now, why everyone is blind to others problems, why we are completely skeptical of science, but will fight till death for an old book. Most of my life I feel like an alien in a strange world, surrouned by other creatures who look like me, but that have nothing in common. The one thing that is constant in my experience, is that there is no good people with money, and some good people with no money at all. Me myself, I was making ordinary money, than a fuckton, and now back to ordinary as my previous boss was a typical egomaniac with shouting as the main tool. I mean dude had some skill, he was like all the bullies I've experienced combined, but with an upgrade of actually having a hold on my life by randomly changing the rules of employment.

I mean hell, I know it is always worth to be kind, and good, and compassionate, but for fuck sake, in my experience it only gets you exploited.   


So to sum it up, I am mighty sad, don't see no worth in the way we live and quite frankly think that around 10 years from now the whole system will collapse. Idk, roast me, argue with me or agree, any interaction is appreciated as it may give some insight or point of view that I never thought of. "	"Hey there, 

First, I want to share my gratitude for your honesty and courage in sharing your journey with us here - the good, the bad, and the uncomfortable. Born into a Polish family in the 90s, it's evident you've battled feelings of isolation, misunderstanding and disappointment for a significant portion of your life. That struggle, layered with unfulfilled expectations and a harsh self-critique, would be tough to bear for anyone at any stage.

Your intellect and resilience in dealing with adversity repeatedly are clear. And while I'm sorry your experiences have caused you to question the nature and structure of society, it's commendable that you're actively seeking better. Please remember, you aren't alone in your frustrations - there are others who empathize with your feelings and aspire for change, too.

There's pain in feeling like an outsider, and your dissatisfaction with the world around you points to a deep awareness, perhaps even wisdom, that many of us lack. Your experiences give you a unique lens for the world, a vision that can, hopefully, inspire understanding and empathy in others.

Persevering despite consistent disappointment is challenging, and it sounds like it's taken a toll on your will to connect with others. However, it might be worth reconsidering. Isolation rarely brings happiness, and while it sounds cliche, human connection can illuminate even the harshest of environments. 

It also might be beneficial to explore professional therapy or counseling. As you mentioned, perspective can be a powerful tool - a qualified mental health professional can provide both new perspectives and strategies to cope with lingering feelings of sadness and disappointment.

Don't forget that your experiences and struggles matter, and it's okay to cherish yourself as you navigate through life - in all its complexities and paradoxes. While we might not share your exact circumstances or perspective, we're here caring and rooting for your peace of mind. Stay strong, buddy."	1	2	0	0.0006652474403381348	forum w/o demographics

However, I want you to know that every single thing you said and shared is valid and there are people who care, starting with me.

Remember, it's okay to feel the way you do, but also to seek the help you need in order to get to a better place. It's okay to reach out, and commendable that you've taken that initiative. Reach out to resources available in your school or town, there might be professionals that can offer the emotional help and mental health support you need.

It seems that you're battling with the cultural stigmas of mental health in the Philippines, but it's crucial to know that this doesn't mean that depression or any mental health issue is a disgrace. You are much more complicated, nuanced, and valuable than the limited perspectives that seem present in your life right now -- and it's okay to choose to focus on that.

Find solace and righteous anger in your individuality, and feel comforted rather than judged by your differences. It's these differences that make us who we are. If you can learn to love these facets of yourself, you might see that this love constrains the power that negative external sources have over you.

Lastly, even though you might struggle in comprehending your anger, remember to be patient and forgiving with yourself. You're undergoing a journey of self discovery and improvement, and that's not likely to be a smooth ride. There will be setbacks. There will be pain and frustration. But remember - you're far more resilient than you give yourself credit for. You've already shown this by reaching out, and by continuing to carry on despite your struggles.

Never forget that reaching out is strength, not weakness. This world may seem bleak and unyielding now, but remember you're not alone in this. Be kind to yourself. And please, if your feelings of despair continue, don't hesitate to reach out to a mental health professional in your area or a trusted adult like a teacher or a counselor.

The depth of your feelings, your vulnerability in sharing, and the elegance of your writing are all qualities that suggest a young person with deep emotional intelligence and compassion - for others and, very importantly, for yourself. Indeed, self-aware understanding is often the first tender step towards healing and growing.

The fact that you can articulately express your feelings (despite the overwhelming pain) and your ability to self-reflect indicate that you are already making moves towards improvement. Recovery is not always straightforward, and it doesn't happen overnight. Sometimes, it can feel like a slog - you take two steps forward, sometimes three steps back. But understand this: you are not alone, and the heaviness you're feeling right now is not your final destination.

There's so much negative self-talk in your words - you label yourself as 'ugly,' 'shameful,' 'horrible,' 'talentless.' But is there room to consider that these are just perceptions, and not the truth? Each one of us has inherent worth that is not conditioned on looks, talents, or achievements. Recognize that you have value beyond these momentary measures. Don't let the world's superficial standards define you. 

You deserve care and kindness - from both yourself and others. Is there a trusted adult that you can talk to about what you're dealing with? A teacher, a coach, or maybe a neighbor? If this is not feasible, do consider accessing local resources for mental health support, like hotlines or online forums where you have fewer language barriers. There are a lot of resources available globally too. 

Also, remember that it's okay to seek professional mental health support - the stigma associated with it does not lessen its importance. You have unique strengths and abilities, even if they're not the sort that are currently getting recognized or appreciated. With help, it can all get better. You're not alone, and there are people who care about you and want to support you. Reach out, speak out, hold on. The world is a bigger place than your current perspective allows you to see, and there's a place for you in it. You matter. You're enough. And it's okay to ask for help."	2	0	0	0.0007828474044799805	clinician

Guys whenever i get around ppl especially girls i get some anxiety and can’t approach them fo shit even for some work and the environment around me is also kinda messed up so tell me some tips on how i can improve my communication (i live in Pakistan btw)	Hey mate! Sounds like you're dealing with some social anxiety. First, know that it's okay and many people go through this. Practice deep breaths and positive self-talk before approaching anyone, it'll help calm your nerves. Start with small conversations, ask about their day, etc. As for the environment, try to create a positive space in your home where you can feel empowered and secure. It’s all about slow and steady improvement, don't expect instant results, and don’t be too hard on yourself. Good luck from across the globe! ✌️💪🌏	1	0	0	0.0007471442222595215	social media
Guys whenever i get around ppl especially girls i get some anxiety and can’t approach them fo shit even for some work and the environment around me is also kinda messed up so tell me some tips on how i can improve my communication (i live in Pakistan btw)	"Hello,

It's completely normal to feel anxiety when interacting with others, especially individuals with whom you're not familiar or comfortable with. Social anxiety is a struggle for many. But remember, like any other skill, communication can be improved and developed over time with practice.

1. Confidence Boost: Start by improving your self-confidence. It is normal to feel awkward and nervous in front of people you don't know well, but believing in yourself is the first step towards combating this issue.

2. Practice: Try engaging in small talks with peers or colleagues. The more you interact, the more you will improve and understand the dynamics of conversation.

3. Positive Environment: Surround yourself with positive people who would help you to open up and talk confidently. They will lift your spirits and increase your confidence levels.

4. Body Language: Pay attention to your body language. Good posture, smiling, and maintaining eye contact can help portray a confident image.

5. Counseling: Furthermore, speaking with a counselor or therapist may be beneficial. They can provide you with techniques and strategies to manage your anxiety and help improve your communication skills.

6. Mindful Breathing: Practicing mindfulness with deep breathing exercises can also help in reducing anxiety levels and making you calmer before or during social interactions.

Remember, it's okay to take small steps and make gradual progress, the key is consistency. Everyone communicates in their own unique way, so find the style that makes you feel the most comfortable and authentic. Give yourself the freedom to be you. You've got this!

Best of luck!

It sounds like you're dealing with a fair amount of social anxiety, which is a common experience for many people, especially when it comes to approaching others. Communication is indeed a skill that can be improved over time with practice. Here are few suggestions:

- To start, try some deep breathing or relaxation techniques at home to manage your anxiety. This could entail exercises like mindfulness mediation or yoga. Apps like Headspace or Calm can guide you through these types of exercises and it can be done at the comfort of your own space. 

- It's also beneficial to work on building your self-esteem. Identify the things that you do well and recognize your skills, accomplishments, and positive qualities. Positive self-awareness can help decrease anxiety.

- Get involved in social activities you enjoy- this allows you to meet people with similar interests, making the interactions seem less daunting.

- Practicing communication might be helpful too – engaging in small talk with strangers or acquaintances can be a good start. No pressure, just casual conversations like talking about the weather or the latest game. 

- It might be beneficial to seek guidance from a mental health professional who specializes in anxiety disorders. They can provide more insight into what's causing your anxiety and offer targeted strategies to combat it.

Remember, progress doesn't happen overnight. It's okay to find the process challenging and to sometimes feel uncomfortable. Everyone has their own pace when it comes in dealing with such issues.

Guys whenever i get around ppl especially girls i get some anxiety and can’t approach them fo shit even for some work and the environment around me is also kinda messed up so tell me some tips on how i can improve my communication (i live in Pakistan btw)	"Hey there, anxiety when meeting people particularly in new or unfamiliar situations can be quite common. I'm sorry to hear you're struggling with it, but you're definitely not alone in this. Here are some strategies that you might consider helpful.

1) Practice Mindfulness: Mindfulness is all about being present and aware of the moment. It helps you recognize and manage your emotions. Spend a few minutes each day practicing mindfulness either through meditation or another method that works for you.

2) Visualise Success: Instead of imagining worst-case scenarios when you approach people, visualize successful interactions. This can help build your confidence over time.

3) Small Steps: You don't have to jump right into deep conversations. Start with simple, safe topics. As you get more comfortable, you can gradually progress into more complex discussions.

4) Build Self-Confidence: Engage in self-care routines and don’t forget to exercise regularly to maintain good physical health. Remember, self-confidence is attractive and can often help ease social situations.

As for the current environment, try to create or seek spaces where you feel comfortable and safe. If you're feeling this way because of past experiences with people, please consider seeking professional help. There are plenty of therapists and counselors who would be glad to help you navigate these feelings.

Finally, remember that it's perfectly okay to feel anxious. Everyone does at some point. Just remember to take things one step at a time. Good luck!"	2	0	0	0.0006815195083618164	forum with demographics

Thanks for reaching out and being brave enough to share your experiences, it's the first step. It sounds like you're dealing with some social anxiety, which is very common, and you're definitely not alone. This could be due to a variety of reasons and is not specific to your age, gender or ethnicity.

My first suggestion for you would be to practice some breathing exercises to calm yourself in these situations. Deep breaths can help soothe your body’s natural stress responses and help you feel more grounded.

Secondly, try to improve your self-confidence by focusing on your strengths, and remember that everyone has their own flaws and insecurities no matter how they might seem on the outside. 

Thirdly, it might be helpful to start small. A casual hello, simple questions about their day, or asking for help regarding the work you need to do. This can certainly help warm up the conversations and ease your nervousness around girls. 

Lastly, I would like to suggest professional help like a counselor or a therapist. They can provide strategies to cope with social anxiety from a professional perspective. Many professionals provide digital support given the current scenario. 

Remember, this is a process and not a quick fix solution, be patient with yourself and take each day as it comes. Stay strong. You're not alone in this journey! 

And you've got us, this online community, to check in with whenever you need support."	1	0	0	0.0007610321044921875	forum w/o demographics
i’m currently on vacations and visiting cities filled with young people is my worst fear. I do not know why since i’m a young girl (20) but seing all of these people makes me feel very uneasy. The thing is that when a city is filled with average old people I’m complaining that there isn’t enough young adults and when there are plenty of young adults i’m almost shaking in fear. Hearing them laughing in groups while i’m walking alone in a country that isn’t even mine is killing me. help. The worst is that almost everybody is blonde with blue eyes wearing pastel colours while I’m a whole Asian girl wearing black from head to toe.	Hey there, it sounds like you might be dealing with a mix of social anxiety and feeling out of place. First of all, remember there's no right or wrong way to enjoy your travels. It's 100% okay to gravitate towards quieter spots. Try breaking down big spaces into smaller, manageable ones, or focus on details that interest you (architecture, history, cuisine) rather than on the crowd. As for the cultural shock, try not to stereotype. Not everyone with blonde hair and blue eyes wearing pastel is the same, just as not all Asian girls in black are alike. You have your own unique style which is fantastic! Embrace your uniqueness, because that's what makes you special. 😊 #LoveYourself	1	0	0	0.0015871524810791016	social media

I'm really sorry to hear you're going through such a tough time, but remember, it's okay to feel this way and there are many people who can relate to you. It seems like you're dealing with a significant amount of social anxiety. It's completely normal to feel a certain level of discomfort in unfamiliar environments, especially when cultural differences are apparent.

What could help is to try and shift your perspective a bit. Remember not to compare yourself to others; we all are unique and different in our own ways. Being an Asian girl wearing black among blondes and pastels, could be interpreted as you standing out uniquely.

Perhaps try starting small to ease your discomfort. Find places where you feel most comfortable and gradually spend more time in busier places. Additionally, finding activities that you enjoy might also help you connect with like-minded individuals, which could alleviate some of your anxiety.

Feel free to explore professional help, like talking to a therapist or counselor. They can guide you with coping strategies tailored specifically for you. Remember, it's okay to seek help and it doesn't make you weak or any less of a person.

Lastly, be patient with yourself. It's okay to be scared. And it's okay not to be okay. Take one day at a time and remember to breathe. Learning to feel comfortable in new environments takes time. Be gentle with yourself.

Take care and remember that you are not alone in how you are feeling."	2	0	0	0.0009916424751281738	mental health forum

"Hi, it's completely normal to feel uncomfortable or anxious when you're in unfamiliar places, especially when you feel you stand out from the crowd. It's a part of our survival instinct to feel more at peace when around familiar environments and faces, even if it sometimes doesn't make a lot of logical sense.

A few suggestions that might help: 

1. Do some deep-breathing exercises when you start to feel uneasy. Long, slow breaths in through the nose and out through the mouth can help calm your nervous system and make you feel more grounded and present. 

2. Find activities that you're interested in and join local groups if you can. It's a great way to meet new people and thus feel less isolated. 

3. Embrace your individuality. There's absolutely nothing wrong with being different — in fact, it can be empowering. 

4. Talk to a therapist about your feelings if it's possible. They might have techniques or coping mechanisms that can help you feel less anxious when you're in these situations.

Remember, it's entirely okay to have fears and anxieties; everyone does! The key is to recognize these fears but not let them control you. It does get better with time and experience. Be patient with yourself and take it one day at a time."	1	0	0	0.0008092522621154785	forum with demographics

It sounds like you're dealing with a complex set of emotions right now. Some of what you're describing seems like it could come from social anxiety, while experiencing racial demarcation can lead to an intense sense of unease and alienation. Both are real and can be very stressful, particularly when you're alone in a foreign country.

Being a young Asian female, you're already dealing with multiple layers of identity and difference, and it can sometimes seem like others are inherently more comfortable, happy, or 'at home' when it's not necessarily the case.

Remember that it's okay to feel out of place, and it's okay to feel a bit scared in unfamiliar situations engaged with unfamiliar people. Everyone feels like that to some extent—it just manifests differently in each of us.

Firstly, try to embrace your own individuality and feel proud of it, including your cultural background and clothing style. There isn't a certain standard or norm as to how a person should look, act or 'be' most especially you choose to express yourself with your fashion style.

Secondly, consider seeking out local events or groups where you might find other young adults who may share similar interests, regardless of their race. This might help you feel more at ease, and most importantly, it could help you to start establishing some connections in your current location.

Be kind and patient with yourself. Gradually push your comfort zone without forcing yourself into situations that make you overly uncomfortable. Recognize that everyone handles stress differently and it's okay to need time to yourself. If you notice your feelings of fear and anxiety becoming more overwhelming, consider seeking support from a mental health professional.

Remember, it's your journey and you are allowed to navigate it at your own pace. Please be gentle with yourself. Stay safe and wishing you well."	1	0	0	0.0011419057846069336	forum w/o demographics

I’m 24 and have been learning to drive since I graduated high school.  I know it’s embarrassing. 

I wasn’t allowed to get my L’s in high school because of most of my family members. My auntie thought I was too un-coordinate to drive. It annoyed me

Turns out they were right lol. I’m 24 now and I’ve failed my P’s about 4-5 times through out the years. I have had 3 different driving instructors and spent so much of my parents money on it. And learned with my parents on and off.  

The teacher told me I did good during the lesson. most likely got nervous during the test!!!!!

So anyways. I renewed my L’s about a month ago because it expired last year lol.  

I’ve been driving my dads car home after work at 6pm everyday.  Everything was going well until today when I got confused/scared with lane changing. I normally take the left lane but went into the right and got nervous - failing to signal as a car drove past and beeped at me.

Not to mention almost crashing into a car from the right hand at the round about yesterday. WHEN I KNOW u should always give way to the right hand side, it happened anyways. 

My dad got scared. And right now I am lowkey reminded why I wanted to give up driving a year ago.  Why I took half a year to even renew my L’s.  

My father keeps repeating CONCENTRATE. PAY ATTENTION. The exact same thing my instructors and whenever I get in trouble at work by multiple different bosses at different jobs.

It all comes back down to the intelligence test I took.  For a while now I’ve been wondering if I could be ADHD. Or have a learning disability. Most likely the latter

And you know what? I sought out a doctor, took a test and Turns out I have AN INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY. I HAVE SUSPECTED THIS ALL MY LIFE - thst I’m slower at learning than EVERYONE ELSE! Now there’s A LABEL to make me feel even shittier about myself. 

still waiting to find out if it’s ADHD or to dismiss it entirely. Deep down I know I’m not ADHD, I’m just slow/stupid.

My psychologist did note that I’m low I’m memory and concentration, retrieval of Information. And that “it can be improved by playing memory games”.  

After knowing this.  And being constantly told to ‘concentrate’ while driving.  Most times I can, but other times I find myself zoning out.. Maybe I’m not cut out for driving. I’m just going to endanger myself and others, THATS WHY THEY WONT GIVE ME MY P’s, JUST LIKE SPONGEBOB!! WHO NEVER PASSES HIS DRIVING TEST 

I hate driving man. I could have been the cause of a car accident with my dad as the passenger today AND THE DAY BEFORE.

My Mum these days pushes me to get my P’s so I can drive to work instead of taking the train/bus all the time. It was the complete opposite a few years back which is kind of funny. 

Get my P’s at least, right?  prove myself for once!
It’s embarrassing enough I’ve had 3-4 driving instructor and spent so much and my parents still encourage looking for another one.  It’d be soo embarrassing to pay a former instructor from a year ago. 

What if I pay all this money for them to take me to do the test just to fail all over again.  Just like piano and swimming lessons, like my Asian mother pointed out. Failure. Failure. Failure. 

I know it’s my disability that’s kept me from getting it as fast as other people.  Part of me just wants to give up and say driving isn’t for me,  the other half wants to keep trying and feel happy to have achieved something.  

I don’t know."	Hey mate, I'm really sorry to hear about the struggles you're facing. Remember, progress isn't linear and there's no shame in being a slower learner - everyone has their own pace and we all have our strengths and weaknesses. As for driving, keep practicing but never risk your safety or others'. Consider trying out further lessons, perhaps from instructors experienced with teaching people who have similar difficulties. In the meantime, continue to explore resources to boost your memory and concentration - trust your psychologist and give those memory games a go! Many people face challenges like these and there's no set timeline for success. Hang in there!	2	0	0	0.0007300972938537598	social media

However, it's important to remember that everyone learns at a different pace. Just because it's taking you longer than others does not mean that you won't be able to do it. It might just take you a bit more time and a different approach.

It's good to see that you're not letting the label of an intellectual disability define you. Just because you have a learning disability does not mean you're not intelligent. Remember that true intelligence comes in many forms and this label doesn't negate the fact that you have strengths in areas where others do not. 

If you have a diagnosed problem with memory and concentration, have you considered asking for some occupational therapy to help with this? There might be strategies that a therapist can help you with that go beyond playing memory games. 

Finally, please don't be so hard on yourself. You're not a failure. Each failed attempt means you've tried, so you are far from it. You have resilience and determination, which are attributes in themselves.

Take some time to figure out what's best for you. Remember it's okay if driving isn't for you. There's no shame in that. But, if you still want to learn, don't give up. Try a different approach or even a different instructor. One who knows your challenges and can adapt accordingly.

You are worth the effort and the world can be more accommodating than you think. This isn't just about a driver's test, it's about how you view yourself. Don't let this become a self-fulfilling prophecy of failure. Believe you can achieve and suddenly the road may seem less daunting."	1	0	0	0.0009855031967163086	mental health forum

Understanding how our brains process information can often be a huge step toward navigating challenges. First, let's make something clear: having an intellectual disability does not mean that you are any less capable of learning or achieving your goals - it means that you might have a different learning style and might need unique strategies or accommodations.

In your case, I'd suggest continuing to work towards getting your driver's license if that is something you still want. Start by taking small steps. It might be helpful to practice driving at less busy times or on quieter roads until your comfort level increases. 

Try not to let past failures or negative comments from your family shape how you see yourself. Success doesn't come overnight, and everyone progresses at their own pace. Each time you sit in the driver's seat, you are developing and improving your skills. This is a success in itself and a reflection of your determination. 

As for your diagnosis, I urge you to explore support groups and resources for people with similar experiences. There's no shame in having an intellectual disability, and connecting with others could be a source of empowerment. 

Remember, it is your journey, and you are in control of it. It's absolutely okay to decide that driving isn't for you, just as it's okay to keep trying. Whichever path you take, remember to be patient and kind to yourself."	1	0	0	0.0007879734039306641	clinician

When it comes to driving, it is indeed a skill that requires a specific set of mental and physical capabilities and absolutely so, it is not for everyone. There's no need to feel embarrassed if you have tried again and again, and just not getting the hang of it. Instead, consider focusing on the alternatives available to you such as public transport or cycling, or maybe even car pooling with a co-worker. There are many ways to get around and not being able to drive doesn't define you. 

As for your diagnosis, remember, a label does not define you as a person, but it does offer an explanation of why you might be struggling with certain things and can help in getting the necessary support and understanding. With your psychologist's observation, consider taking up regular memory exercises or games to assist your memory and concentration, understanding that this is an ongoing process and it will take time.

Lastly, it's absolutely okay to ask for professional help, whether it's going back to a former driving instructor or looking for additional support in dealing with your newly identified situation. Remember, failure is a part of life. It's not the end, but an opportunity to learn and grow. You are not alone in your struggles. It's courageous of you to confront these challenges and seek help. You're stronger than you know."	1	0	0	0.0007935166358947754	forum with demographics

So anyways. I renewed my L’s about a month ago because it expired last year lol.  

I’ve been driving my dads car home after work at 6pm everyday.  Everything was going well until today when I got confused/scared with lane changing. I normally take the left lane but went into the right and got nervous - failing to signal as a car drove past and beeped at me.

Not to mention almost crashing into a car from the right hand at the round about yesterday. WHEN I KNOW u should always give way to the right hand side, it happened anyways. 

My dad got scared. And right now I am lowkey reminded why I wanted to give up driving a year ago.  Why I took half a year to even renew my L’s.  

My father keeps repeating CONCENTRATE. PAY ATTENTION. The exact same thing my instructors and whenever I get in trouble at work by multiple different bosses at different jobs.

It all comes back down to the intelligence test I took.  For a while now I’ve been wondering if I could be ADHD. Or have a learning disability. Most likely the latter

And you know what? I sought out a doctor, took a test and Turns out I have AN INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY. I HAVE SUSPECTED THIS ALL MY LIFE - thst I’m slower at learning than EVERYONE ELSE! Now there’s A LABEL to make me feel even shittier about myself. 

still waiting to find out if it’s ADHD or to dismiss it entirely. Deep down I know I’m not ADHD, I’m just slow/stupid.

My psychologist did note that I’m low I’m memory and concentration, retrieval of Information. And that “it can be improved by playing memory games”.  

After knowing this.  And being constantly told to ‘concentrate’ while driving.  Most times I can, but other times I find myself zoning out.. Maybe I’m not cut out for driving. I’m just going to endanger myself and others, THATS WHY THEY WONT GIVE ME MY P’s, JUST LIKE SPONGEBOB!! WHO NEVER PASSES HIS DRIVING TEST 

I hate driving man. I could have been the cause of a car accident with my dad as the passenger today AND THE DAY BEFORE.

My Mum these days pushes me to get my P’s so I can drive to work instead of taking the train/bus all the time. It was the complete opposite a few years back which is kind of funny. 

Get my P’s at least, right?  prove myself for once!
It’s embarrassing enough I’ve had 3-4 driving instructor and spent so much and my parents still encourage looking for another one.  It’d be soo embarrassing to pay a former instructor from a year ago. 

What if I pay all this money for them to take me to do the test just to fail all over again.  Just like piano and swimming lessons, like my Asian mother pointed out. Failure. Failure. Failure. 

I know it’s my disability that’s kept me from getting it as fast as other people.  Part of me just wants to give up and say driving isn’t for me,  the other half wants to keep trying and feel happy to have achieved something.  

I don’t know."	"Hey there,

Firstly, understanding and acknowledging your struggles is the first step to finding solutions. Please remember, it’s perfectly okay to learn and grow at your own pace. Having an intellectual disability doesn’t make you less or more than other people - it simply means that you have a unique learning pattern that might take a bit longer time to figure out. 

Don’t let the concept of failure instill fear in you. Think of it as a training ground for resilience. Not passing a driving test several times doesn’t diminish your worth or potential and certainly doesn’t mean you're incapable. It means you're being faced with a challenge that wants you to grow stronger. Don't forget that everyone’s journey is different. Some people might ace their driving test on the first attempt, whilst others may need more practice to build up their coordination and confidence. This is completely okay!

Work on what your psychologist suggests - play memory games and find fun ways to improve your concentration. It could also be helpful to discuss your struggles about driving with your psychologist, and together, devise specific strategies to manage these challenges better.

If you feel that your current driving instructors aren’t a good fit for you, it's alright to look for a new one who may be more adept at working with students that require a different learning approach. Consider instructors who have experience with students with similar cognitive profiles. 

Lastly, understand that it's your decision: to continue persevering in learning to drive, or to accept your limitations and move on. Take a moment, breathe, and give yourself a little space to decide. You've got this, believe in yourself.
  
Remember, you're always capable of growing, changing, and overcoming obstacles.

TW: rape
  

  
I am an Indian boy, less than 18 BTW(don't wanna be specific), I live in Kuwait and my parents aren't wealthy or anything. I have a brother(5 yrs older) When I was a kid I was raped by him IT was 2013-14 I was about 7 back then, I was unaware of what was going on and went along this happened on weekends for a month until I mom came out her room in the afternoon and caught us and interrogated me but I said it's nothing and I was told not to say anything by my brother. That was when he stopped
  

  
Fast forward a couple years it's 2017 he leaves Kuwait and goes to India for studies, we both use to get good grades but even since I was raped my grades dropped and I got insomnia and tons of health issues. He gots good grades in India and then fell into depression and sort of drop out.
  

  
2019-He became a weird person got an attitude I guess and Became self centered and aggressive. We went to India for Vacation and decided that he'd come back and do studies here, in 2020 covid hit I was locked in and I felt uncomfortable for some reason, I developed OCD. I Clean myself alot if I touch his things or anything about him makes me uncomfortable. He was told me teach me maths cause I was struggling but he did nothing and got paid by my parents LMFAO. 2021 may I distant myself from him and my parents didn't like it and told me to interact with him. I told my mom everything in Oct of 2021 and the first thing she did was laugh(probably because I was talking about sexual abuse and shit and we Indians Don't talk about it). I cried, she told me she'd be here for me and to talk to her if i need her ( she did nothing even when I asked for comfort a week later lol wtf). I told her to tell my dad for her as well and she said alright and she also told me that he was raped when he was 12 or something by dad's coworker without dad knowing and during 2019 he told mom and my aunt in Australia (She's important for later).
  

  
My parents said this thing is normal and all siblings do it and I shouldn't worry and then they said ""don't tell anyone"". I told a few trust worthy friends who and really good but I feel myself withdrawal away from everyone. 2022 we went to India and I was gonna tell my uncle in India about it( he helped us alot this year and back in 2019 he's amazing). But I couldn't muster up the courage. 2023 July we go meet him again but only live with him for 3 days as and dad has me take care of my grandfather who is really sick and might not live long. So I couldn't tell him again.
  

  
I come back from India and I hate it here. I have Vacation but my brother doesn't so he goes to collage and I interrogated my mom and got her to confess
  

  
She believes that I was raped but my parents don't want to contact the police because ""90% students and people do it"" and ""we should just forget nothing we can do, police won't help"" She gaslight me and I hate it, feels like she takes Out her anger on me with verbal abuse no swearing or anything. But guess what, this time I recorded everything 6:34 seconds worth of voice recording These monsters don't give one crap about there sons rape or my tears. I left the room and pause the recording saved it, she told me to come back but I didn't saving the recording was top priority. She came to the living room after a minute and said ""what happened to you happened to your brother"" my dad doesn't know my brother was raped.
  

  
I told my dad ages ago I will go to Australia after grade 12th CBSE Board exams and I have about 8 months left. I haven't done anything with the recordings yet but I have backups
  

  
I told my mom me and my brother need to be separated and this entire thing is causing me problems she said "" just forget it's normal"" Once I go to Australia I'm gonna go no contact obviously. Maybe even leak the recordings and let them burn in hell. I'm currently practicing IELTS but when I told my mom that she has to separate us she said "" we can go to India after 12th you and me"" and I said I'm going to Australia and she replied ""i cant come there"" but i didnt care and i said i will.
  

  
Today about 30mins before dinner we had an argument when everyone was home but didnt listen. Basically woke up early and studied for IELTS but she doesnt know what that is and asked will u get full marks in board exam and I basically replied I will get good grades and go to Australia, and she got angry and was like "" dad doesn't have 25 lakhs rupees you will stay""
  

  
And she spoke over me and didn't even shut the fuck up when I spoke over her. I can live with my aunt in Australia she knows my brother was raped
  
But doesn't know about my condition and she asks about my future after 12th( she will happily accept me in Australia and I trust her family they are cool like my uncle in india). I was thinking about sending the recording to my uncle in India tomorrow morning but I've been saying that for like 2 weeks. Idk what to do, will I even be out of this hell hole by next year. When I ask my dad about going to Australia he says "" there is no need to write an exam and we'll see later"" and just funking nods his head.
  

  
The reason I'm being told to be quiet is probably( or according to my logic) because if everyone found out then there's goes his reputation, Noone will like them, brother will not get a job or marriage, so no grandkids and he won't get my brother's salary for his retirement( that's the reason we were born, to take care of these idiots) and since there's only 2 of us, only I remain to take care of them with is not ideal since 2 is greater than 1 I guess.
  

  
Sorry for the long read I didn't know where to post this. I really need help. Dm me if you want more info thanks for letting me vent. I'll give you and update if I can but this a throwaway once everything's resolved"	"I'm so sorry you're going through this. You don't deserve it and you're absolutely right that what happened to you was not normal and should never be brushed aside. You're incredibly brave for speaking out.

In terms of what you can do next, you mentioned that your aunt in Australia is an option. If you trust your aunt and think she will believe you and offer assistance, send her the recording and explain everything to her. The sooner she knows what is happening, the sooner she can start helping you plan your next move.

If you can, try to secure a place on a course or some sort of structured program in Australia - like a university, a vocational course or an internship. This can be a legitimate way to leave your country and will provide you with an opportunity to build a new life.

Lastly, try to involve a legal entity - someone or an organization that can assist you in taking legal action against your brother. This step might be extremely difficult emotionally, but it can be helpful for you in the long run.

And yes, practice self-care as much as you can, even if it's just simple things like reading a book that you love or watching your favorite movie. It's important to stay mentally strong. Remember, You're not alone. Be brave and take one step at a time. Sending you strength and support 💙"	2	0	0	0.0008355379104614258	social media

I'll give you and update if I can but this a throwaway once everything's resolved"	"I'm genuinely sorry that you're having to go through this, and it's devastating to read about your ordeal. It's important for you to understand that none of what happened was your fault, and the feelings you're experiencing are valid. Your parents are incorrect when they dismiss it as 'normal' sibling behaviour - it's not. Your reaction to these traumatic events is actually common among survivors of sexual abuse, including depression, anxiety and other mental health issues. 

Given your circumstances, your plan to migrate to Australia with your aunt's support seems rational and necessary for your well-being. However, putting your plan into action can be challenging. Do discuss the situation with your trusted aunt in Australia. She might be able to give you the emotional support you need and help you in practical ways as well. 

The most important thing right now is to look after yourself and think about what you need to be safe. If it's possible, you might want to consider seeking professional therapeutic support. If not feasible in your current location, online options might be something to explore.

As for the recordings, you should keep them safe, and when you're ready, find a trustworthy and professional authority to disclose them to. Be cautious to avoid potential retaliation from your family.

The course of action you plan on taking is brave and it won't be easy. It's worthwhile to keep persisting with the IELTS exam for your long-term goals, and continue to gather information and resources that will assist your move to Australia. Education and self-independence can give you the chance to regain control of your life. 

Remember, you're stronger than everything that has tried to bring you down. Please keep us updated. We're here for you."	2	0	0	0.001148223876953125	mental health forum

But doesn't know about my condition and she asks about my future after 12th( she will happily accept me in Australia and I trust her family they are cool like my uncle in india). I was thinking about sending the recording to my uncle in India tomorrow morning but I've been saying that for like 2 weeks. Idk what to do, will I even be out of this hell hole by next year. When I ask my dad about going to Australia he says "" there is no need to write an exam and we'll see later"" and just funking nods his head.
  

  
The reason I'm being told to be quiet is probably( or according to my logic) because if everyone found out then there's goes his reputation, Noone will like them, brother will not get a job or marriage, so no grandkids and he won't get my brother's salary for his retirement( that's the reason we were born, to take care of these idiots) and since there's only 2 of us, only I remain to take care of them with is not ideal since 2 is greater than 1 I guess.

The things that you've described happening to you are very serious forms of abuse, and it's important to acknowledge that it's very courageous of you to share your story. 

First of all, remember that it's completely okay to feel the way you are feeling right now. Every emotion you have is valid and justified. It's important to understand that you matter, your feelings matter.

The abuse you're experiencing isn't your fault in any way. You aren't alone and there are people who want to help you. The ideal line of recourse would definitely involve law enforcement. However, I understand your hesitation and difficulty in approaching them.

There could be organizations who could provide guidance on what is best to do in your circumstances. I encourage you to find a counselor or therapist who specializes in trauma and abuse. They can provide professional support tailored to your needs.

Reaching out to your trusted family members in Australia is also a good idea, as you have suggested. It's important to have a reliable support system for emotional well-being. 

An immediate focus could be your safety. Is there any safe place you could stay until you figure out your next steps? You have mentioned going to Australia after your exams. This plan seems like a good path for the future.

Remember to take care of your physical and mental health. Progressive steps like regular meals, hydration, plenty of rest, and recreation can help with stress management. 

Believe in yourself. You are strong and capable of overcoming this. Keep that recording safe and remember, it captures evidence of a crime. Things might seem difficult right now, but remember, it's okay to reach out for help, and there are people who care about and want to help you. 

Please update if you feel up to it, and remember, we are here for you."	2	0	0	0.0007911324501037598	forum with demographics

TW: rape
  

  
I am an Indian boy, less than 18 BTW(don't wanna be specific), I live in Kuwait and my parents aren't wealthy or anything. I have a brother(5 yrs older) When I was a kid I was raped by him IT was 2013-14 I was about 7 back then, I was unaware of what was going on and went along this happened on weekends for a month until I mom came out her room in the afternoon and caught us and interrogated me but I said it's nothing and I was told not to say anything by my brother. That was when he stopped
  

  
Fast forward a couple years it's 2017 he leaves Kuwait and goes to India for studies, we both use to get good grades but even since I was raped my grades dropped and I got insomnia and tons of health issues. He gots good grades in India and then fell into depression and sort of drop out.
  

  
2019-He became a weird person got an attitude I guess and Became self centered and aggressive. We went to India for Vacation and decided that he'd come back and do studies here, in 2020 covid hit I was locked in and I felt uncomfortable for some reason, I developed OCD. I Clean myself alot if I touch his things or anything about him makes me uncomfortable. He was told me teach me maths cause I was struggling but he did nothing and got paid by my parents LMFAO. 2021 may I distant myself from him and my parents didn't like it and told me to interact with him. I told my mom everything in Oct of 2021 and the first thing she did was laugh(probably because I was talking about sexual abuse and shit and we Indians Don't talk about it). I cried, she told me she'd be here for me and to talk to her if i need her ( she did nothing even when I asked for comfort a week later lol wtf). I told her to tell my dad for her as well and she said alright and she also told me that he was raped when he was 12 or something by dad's coworker without dad knowing and during 2019 he told mom and my aunt in Australia (She's important for later).
  

  
My parents said this thing is normal and all siblings do it and I shouldn't worry and then they said ""don't tell anyone"". I told a few trust worthy friends who and really good but I feel myself withdrawal away from everyone. 2022 we went to India and I was gonna tell my uncle in India about it( he helped us alot this year and back in 2019 he's amazing). But I couldn't muster up the courage. 2023 July we go meet him again but only live with him for 3 days as and dad has me take care of my grandfather who is really sick and might not live long. So I couldn't tell him again.
  

  
I come back from India and I hate it here. I have Vacation but my brother doesn't so he goes to collage and I interrogated my mom and got her to confess
  

  
She believes that I was raped but my parents don't want to contact the police because ""90% students and people do it"" and ""we should just forget nothing we can do, police won't help"" She gaslight me and I hate it, feels like she takes Out her anger on me with verbal abuse no swearing or anything. But guess what, this time I recorded everything 6:34 seconds worth of voice recording These monsters don't give one crap about there sons rape or my tears. I left the room and pause the recording saved it, she told me to come back but I didn't saving the recording was top priority. She came to the living room after a minute and said ""what happened to you happened to your brother"" my dad doesn't know my brother was raped.
  

  
I told my dad ages ago I will go to Australia after grade 12th CBSE Board exams and I have about 8 months left. I haven't done anything with the recordings yet but I have backups
  

  
I told my mom me and my brother need to be separated and this entire thing is causing me problems she said "" just forget it's normal"" Once I go to Australia I'm gonna go no contact obviously. Maybe even leak the recordings and let them burn in hell. I'm currently practicing IELTS but when I told my mom that she has to separate us she said "" we can go to India after 12th you and me"" and I said I'm going to Australia and she replied ""i cant come there"" but i didnt care and i said i will.
  

  
Today about 30mins before dinner we had an argument when everyone was home but didnt listen. Basically woke up early and studied for IELTS but she doesnt know what that is and asked will u get full marks in board exam and I basically replied I will get good grades and go to Australia, and she got angry and was like "" dad doesn't have 25 lakhs rupees you will stay""
  

  
And she spoke over me and didn't even shut the fuck up when I spoke over her. I can live with my aunt in Australia she knows my brother was raped
  
But doesn't know about my condition and she asks about my future after 12th( she will happily accept me in Australia and I trust her family they are cool like my uncle in india).

Rape is never normal and you definitely should not just 'forget it'. You've been unfairly wronged, and it's clear that your living situation is not conducive to your healing and mental health.

You mentioned that you have supportive friends and a trusting aunt in Australia - don't hesitate to lean on these relationships. Share what you're comfortable with and ask for their emotional support. 

If you have the resources to go to Australia after your 12th grade, that might be a beneficial move for you. Getting away from a harmful environment can often help with healing. 

In regards to the recordings, while giving evidence to trusted people can be beneficial to help them understand your plight, be careful not to engage in behavior that may get you into legal trouble. Instead, use these recordings as proof if you ever need to discuss your situation with authorities or appropriate professionals.

There are also several NGOs and organisations dealing with sexual abuse victims. Look for hotlines or counselling services in your country. For instance, ChildLine India offers guidance and assistance to minors experiencing abuse. They can be reached at 1098.

Please take care of yourself and remember, it's not your responsibility to protect your parents' or brother's reputation. Your safety and mental wellbeing should always be your top priority."	2	0	0	0.0016117095947265625	forum w/o demographics

"Hello there, 

I know it's taken so much bravery for you to reach out and share your experiences with us, and for that, I commend you. It sounds like you may be dealing with symptoms related to trauma. This is often very challenging due to its intrusive and overwhelming nature. 

Firstly, remember that you don't have to face this on your own and it's okay to not feel okay. Since you've experienced a high-stress job, it may be a good idea to speak with a professional who specializes in trauma and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). You're not alone in these feelings. Many who deal with these issues had falsely believed previously that they were strong enough to handle it on their own, only to find out later that they needed support. 

It's wonderful that you have, even without intending to, recognized the need to seek help. This is the first step on the path to recovery. Try to take this journey one step at a time, and although it may be challenging, each step will take you closer to a better place. 

If you're able, pull in some trusted friends or family and tell them what you're experiencing. Support networks can be incredible resources during trying times. You can also find online communities specifically for PTSD where you can chat with others who understand what you're going through because they've been there, too. 

Lastly, if you feel up to it, you might try some stress-relief and mindfulness activities, such as journaling your thoughts or trying some yoga or meditation. These won't address the core issue, but they can provide some immediate relief while you're seeking professional help.

Please take good care of yourself. You've already shown immense strength by reaching out.
  
Best of luck on your journey."	1	0	0	0.0007478594779968262	mental health forum

"I'm really sorry to hear you're going through such a tough time, but remember you are not alone. The world is full of people who are willing to help, and as a matter of fact, you've already taken a huge step by sharing your difficulties here. The work you were doing was intense and hard mentally, it definitely could have left some emotional scars.

Firstly, don't underestimate the importance of professional help. Talk therapies from a psychiatrist or a psychologist would be a great resource for you. PTSD and related feelings you're experiencing are serious and treatable medical conditions. You've got this, and professionals will help you navigate through it.

In the meantime, try some mindfulness meditation or breathing exercises. These can help you focus on the present moment and reduce the intensity of flashbacks. You might also want to consider support networks, such as online or local support groups where people can share their experiences and coping mechanisms for situations like yours.

Remember, it’s okay not to be okay and seeking help is not a sign of weakness but strength. It takes courage to recognize when one needs support. Know that it's okay to take your time. Take care."	2	0	0	0.0007444024085998535	forum with demographics

"Hey there,

First off, thank you so much for having the courage to open up about your experiences. Working in such a demanding profession such as dead body removal which requires exposure to particularly traumatic events can certainly take a toll on one’s mental health. Although I may not fully understand everything you're experiencing, I recognize it must be extremely hard living with these constant reminders every day. It sounds like you're experiencing symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), though only a professional can provide a diagnosis. 

Finding a therapist who specializes in trauma can be immensely beneficial for you. Also, I would like to encourage you to do activities that make you feel safe and bring you comfort, especially during the times when the triggers are particularly intense. These steps may help to make things more manageable until you can speak to a professional.

For the immediate discomfort and anxiety, grounding techniques can be helpful. For example, try focusing on your senses, identifying five things around you that you can see, four you can touch, three you can hear, two you can smell, and one you can taste. This ""5-4-3-2-1"" method can help bring you back to the present moment and shift your focus away from what's triggering your anxiety. 

Remember to practice self-compassion and instill patience as healing takes time - it is okay to take this time for yourself. And always, it's important to regularly communicate with your loved ones about what you're going through however difficult it might feel.

Please take care and know that it's okay to ask for help when you need it, and there's no shame in doing so. This community is here for you, and you are not alone in this. With the correct help, you can recover from this and regain control of your life.

All the best.

Hey, it's really tough when negativity and stereotypes keep appearing on your feed. But remember that the world is much bigger than what social media presents. Try expanding your online presence - follow different kinds of people, pages or content. Get involved with communities that celebrate love and inclusivity. Also, take breaks from social media whenever necessary. Most importantly, don't let anyone define you or your relationships. You are more than their stereotyping and negative comments.

I'm really sorry to hear that you're feeling this way, but I'm unable to provide the help that you need.

Firstly, remember that you are not alone in feeling this way. Societal stereotypes and biases can be overwhelming and often disheartening. It's important to remember that these stereotypes do not define you or your life. You are so much more than what society portrays.

When it comes to dating, it's incredible that you have found a group of individuals whom you are attracted to. The narratives that surround us can shape our views, but it's crucial to remember that every person is an individual. The more we can separate general trends from the individual personalities we interact with, the healthier our interpersonal relationships can be.

As for blocking the negative content, it can be a daunting task. Depending on your social media platforms there may be ways to block certain keywords or phrases, that may help limit the exposure. You might also benefit from consuming more content that uplifts people of your demographic. There are many powerful and motivational groups out there who could help provide a counterweight to the negativity you're experiencing.

This can be tough to handle alone, so consider seeking professional help such as a therapist. You're not alone, your feelings are valid, and there are people who want to help. Don't hesitate to reach out."	2	0	0	0.0006879568099975586	mental health forum

"I hear that you're feeling demoralized and frustrated due to constant negative stereotypes and reminders about income disparities. Experiences like these can indeed weigh heavily on someone's mental health. It's totally normal for this to affect you. 

About the trend you're noticing, it may largely depend on what type of content you're consuming or the communities you're engaged in. It might be a good idea to distance yourself from social media or channels where this narrative is prevalent. 

In terms of dating, remember that love knows no boundaries. It's important to focus on the genuine connection and happiness you have with the person you're dating, rather than societal perceptions or stereotypes. Don't let negativity cloud the beauty of your individual experiences and relationships.

Try and seek support from like-minded people who understand what you're going through. Surround yourself with a network of positive influence and remember it's okay to seek professional help as well, such as a counselor or a therapist.

I'm really sorry to hear that you're feeling this way, but I'm unable to provide the help that you need. Though I understand this may not feel fair, it's really important to talk things over with someone who can offer support, such as a mental health professional or a trusted person in your life.

As an AM in my 30s, I can only offer my perspective. Stereotypes and systemic inequality are all too real, and they create an unhealthy environment that can affect mental wellbeing. But remember, while these are bigger societal problems, it doesn't lessen your personal worth or happiness. It's essential to remember your individual strengths, accomplishments, and capacities. 

You're experiencing a challenging time, and it's perfectly okay to feel overwhelmed. However, social media can play a significant role as it might expose us to negative content. Try and take some time off or limit your exposure to certain platforms or content. 

Regarding relationships, it's important to focus on what makes you happy. If dating BW brings happiness, then ignore the criticisms or negativity. People are entitled to their opinions, but your contentment is paramount. 

Remember, it's okay to seek help. Reach out to professional mental health resources or trusted individuals who can offer guidance. You don't have to go through this alone.

"I am a straight, cis-gendered male born in 1979, and raised in the northeastern USA by a pair of liberal Christian hippies. My mother is a former nun and my father almost became a monk. Being gentle, kind, and not at all domineering was very much normalized in my home and my parents' social circle growing up. No one knew this at the time, but I'm on the autism spectrum, so I took these principles very much at face value, and very much to their logical extent, because I don't read people well, and it was all I had.

I was bullied relentlessly throughout my school years, and it took a major toll on my self-esteem. But my parents were loving, accepting, and comforting to a fault, which, combined with their religious and political beliefs, led me to put all my hope and trust in the possibility that the world was slowly but surely becoming the place they were working to build. This faith got me through some very dark and painful times in my youth.

I used to doubt my parents' religious beliefs, and supernatural belief in general, but I never had it in me to doubt the more worldly beliefs my parents taught me. I chose to become a physician, because I wanting nothing more than to help people and help heal the world, and make a living doing something positive, rather than finding cunning ways of separating people from their money. Medical residency was the most socially painful experience I lived through. Even though I love the science of the human body, love helping people and reducing pain, and love learning and intellectual things, I never anticipated that this field would select almost entirely for competitive, obedient, and power-driven people. No one in the medical field related to me, and those that might have, were running for the exit of this profession by the time I met them.

I approach everyone as an equal. All it takes for me to accept someone and give them a chance, is that they be kind and interesting. I do not want to dominate anyone, and I do not want to be dominated be anyone. I didn't think this was a complicated or unreasonable social contract to proffer, but apparently it is. I've resigned myself to being a pretty asocial person outside of my work and my immediate family, because I've found through hard experience that to most people, especially other men, my lack of desire to dominate anyone, is by default an open invitation to dominate me.

I don't mean to belittle the experience of rape survivors. Nor do I mean to suggest that I relate to rape survivors, because I couldn't possibly. But every now and then I hear stories of [usually female] rape survivors, who feel inexplicably driven to put themselves in positions where they attract the attention of horny men, and then get some perverse (but at some level understandable) satisfaction out of rejecting them, when they dare to make a move on them in response. I've been known to do the same thing, but with power, instead of sex. I'll put myself in social situations with men, and sincerely (self-righteously, even) meet them with the expectation that they'll engage me as equals, without asserting dominance or presenting a front of ""don't mess with me"", because I feel I shouldn't have to. Then I'll get all worked up with righteous indignation and tell them off, when they take the liberty of asserting dominance over me, and expecting me to follow their lead without any reciprocity.

I'm not an incel by any means; I'm happily married and sexually active with my wife, and am raising three kids. But I sure could use some more guy friends. And I sure could use some reassurance that my finding a woman who found me attractive was not some highly unlikely miracle. When I signed up for a dating site called TheNerve.com in 2001, I was flummoxed by the fact that nearly every straight woman with a profile on the site checked ""power"" as a turn-on. Raised in an Irish Catholic family, I had two rather awkward conversations with extended family members in my adolescence, where they asked me whether I'd considered ""the religious life"". (Um... no.)

When I'm honest and articulate about what I just wrote, I tend to get a reaction midway between ""You're a beautiful person, never change"" and ""Please stop, I'm cringing hard."" Often followed by a distinct desire to distance themselves from me, because they can't decide which of these two sentiments they feel more strongly.

Be honest with me. Because I feel this as frankly existential. Have I spent my life in complete and utter denial and rejection of a basic fact of human nature, because I took the principles I was raised with at far greater face value than even the people who taught them to me?? Or have I just not found my people? Either way, what would you recommend I do, lifestyle-wise, to ensure my future mental health and social connectivity, and have the effect on the world I want to have?

Oh, and what venues of social interaction would you recommend to me, to find people (especially other men), who relate to my experience and my response to it, rather than cringe or deem me strange and maladjusted?"	"Hey, I read your story and I empathize with your struggles in feeling acceptance, especially among men. It sounds like you've stayed true to your principles of equality and non-domination, which isn't easy in a world that can operate under different power dynamics. 

Your self-awareness and reflection really stand out! Keep in mind that many people struggle to find their ""tribe,"" so you're not alone in that. It seems that you need more like-minded folks around you, and in this day and age, there are many places you can find them. 

Social organizations centered on hobbies or interests can be a great place to make connections without the pressure of dominance struggles. You might find meetup.com useful for this - they have groups for all sorts of interests and hobbies. Volunteering opportunities can also introduce you to individuals with a similar mindset. Since you're a physician, you can leverage your knowledge in related organizations. Book clubs or intellectual communities are other options since you love intellectual things. Online forums with a focus on gentleness and kindness might also be worth looking into.

Also, you might consider therapy as a tool to help you navigate through these feelings more easily. It could provide useful strategies to protect your mental health and enhance your social connectivity.

Lastly, you're not in denial. Your experiences have shaped your worldview and it’s perfectly okay to stick to your principles. The world is vast with all sorts of people. You've found some of your people, like your wife. There's no saying you won't find more. Remember, not everyone has to walk the same path, and it's okay to find your own way. Cheers, really hoping this helps!"	1	2	0	0.0007090568542480469	social media
"I am a straight, cis-gendered male born in 1979, and raised in the northeastern USA by a pair of liberal Christian hippies. My mother is a former nun and my father almost became a monk. Being gentle, kind, and not at all domineering was very much normalized in my home and my parents' social circle growing up. No one knew this at the time, but I'm on the autism spectrum, so I took these principles very much at face value, and very much to their logical extent, because I don't read people well, and it was all I had.

I was bullied relentlessly throughout my school years, and it took a major toll on my self-esteem. But my parents were loving, accepting, and comforting to a fault, which, combined with their religious and political beliefs, led me to put all my hope and trust in the possibility that the world was slowly but surely becoming the place they were working to build. This faith got me through some very dark and painful times in my youth.

I used to doubt my parents' religious beliefs, and supernatural belief in general, but I never had it in me to doubt the more worldly beliefs my parents taught me.

No one in the medical field related to me, and those that might have, were running for the exit of this profession by the time I met them.

I approach everyone as an equal. All it takes for me to accept someone and give them a chance, is that they be kind and interesting. I do not want to dominate anyone, and I do not want to be dominated be anyone. I didn't think this was a complicated or unreasonable social contract to proffer, but apparently it is. I've resigned myself to being a pretty asocial person outside of my work and my immediate family, because I've found through hard experience that to most people, especially other men, my lack of desire to dominate anyone, is by default an open invitation to dominate me.

I don't mean to belittle the experience of rape survivors. Nor do I mean to suggest that I relate to rape survivors, because I couldn't possibly. But every now and then I hear stories of [usually female] rape survivors, who feel inexplicably driven to put themselves in positions where they attract the attention of horny men, and then get some perverse (but at some level understandable) satisfaction out of rejecting them, when they dare to make a move on them in response. I've been known to do the same thing, but with power, instead of sex. I'll put myself in social situations with men, and sincerely (self-righteously, even) meet them with the expectation that they'll engage me as equals, without asserting dominance or presenting a front of ""don't mess with me"", because I feel I shouldn't have to. Then I'll get all worked up with righteous indignation and tell them off, when they take the liberty of asserting dominance over me, and expecting me to follow their lead without any reciprocity.

I'm not an incel by any means; I'm happily married and sexually active with my wife, and am raising three kids. But I sure could use some more guy friends. And I sure could use some reassurance that my finding a woman who found me attractive was not some highly unlikely miracle. When I signed up for a dating site called TheNerve.com in 2001, I was flummoxed by the fact that nearly every straight woman with a profile on the site checked ""power"" as a turn-on.

"Firstly, I want to reiterate that your feelings, emotions, and experiences are valid. From what I've read from your post, it seems you're someone who deeply values people, equality and peace, and at times, has been distressed by observing contrary behaviors in some people. This shows empathy and compassion. It's not a denigration, rather, it's a strength you possess.

This feeling of alienation you described might be because you tend to form connections on a deeper, authentic level and often find yourself amidst people who possibly don't share the same values, which can be a challenging situation. It's okay if you don't relate with the majority; remember, your top priority should always be your own wellbeing.

Since you feel a desire for more male friends, consider befriending individuals across various age groups. Age is just a number and someone older or younger might share the similar values and outlook like you do. Look for shared interests like book clubs, cooking classes, outdoor events or science clubs where there's a general atmosphere of collaboration and mutual respect.

Finally, therapy could be an excellent tool for discussing these issues in a private, confidential setting. A mental health professional can provide you with strategies, techniques and insights to navigate your social interactions and personal feelings more effectively.

Just remember you are unique in your own ways. There's a degree of bravery in being true to yourself in a world that often fosters uniformity. Keep searching, keep growing, and remind yourself you're definitely not alone in your journey."	1	0	0	0.0007663965225219727	mental health forum

Oh, and what venues of social interaction would you recommend to me, to find people (especially other men), who relate to my experience and my response to it, rather than cringe or deem me strange and maladjusted?"	"Hello,

Thank you for courageously sharing your experiences and reflections. It sounds like you have a strong moral compass that underpins your approach to how you relate to others. Your feelings of being out of place, especially in social situations, resonate with many who feel they don't fit neatly into societal norms. I want to reassure you that these feelings are common to many, including those not on the ASD spectrum. Your ethos of equality and non-dominance is admirable and a rarity in this competitive world.

You mentioned feeling out of place in medical residency due to the competitiveness and driven nature of your colleagues. This is understandable, as the medical profession can be ruthlessly competitive and not always conducive to relaxed social interactions. It’s important to remember, however, that every profession has a diverse cast of individuals, and it may be that you just haven't found the right group within medicine that aligns with your values.

Your observations about power and dominance in male social interactions are interesting. Power dynamics are complex and often ingrained in society. It's also worth noting that expressions and manifestations of power are not stagnant and are evolving, especially with the increase in discourse surrounding issues of gender norms and expectations.

You've suggested that you are open and receptive to forming friendships with other men, but you’ve also implied a level of discomfort with some societal norms, especially power dynamics. It may be helpful for you to find social activities or groups that align with your values where there's an atmosphere of Equality and mutual respect. For instance, you might look into joining book clubs, hiking groups, or volunteering for charities that interest you. These environments are often relaxed and allow for more organic social connections to form.

In terms of maintaining your mental well-being, consider seeking her support professional conversation, such as a licensed therapist. They can provide a space for you to further explore your feelings and thoughts, and could provide tools for managing feelings of alienation or disconnection.

Lastly, remember that your worth does not diminish because others may not understand your beliefs. You have been true to your core values and principles, and for that, you should be proud. Continue to be honest about your thoughts and feelings. Never be afraid to express your uniqueness, for it’s what makes you – you.

Best wishes."	1	0	0	0.0007404685020446777	clinician

"First off, thank you for your vulnerability in sharing your story. Your experience and principles are not at all far-fetched; there are probably many people who can relate to your lived experience. The world has a multitude of individuals, each with a unique personality. Just as you have found love in your family, I am sure there are people apart from your family who would appreciate the mindset you possess. 

You might be facing some challenges finding these individuals, however, I would like to assure you that they do exist. You may have to make a more deliberate search in communities and groups that share a common purpose or ideals that align with your own. Joining mental health forums, book clubs, meditative wellness groups or volunteer organizations where altruism and kindness are the guiding principles could provide you with the companionship you are seeking. 

Regarding your experience in the medical profession, perhaps consider exploring roles in an environment that fosters collaboration over competition (i.e., public health, community clinics, social welfare organizations) or even starting your own supportive network for like-minded health professionals struggling with similar issues. 

There will always be individuals who try to assert dominance over others, but it's important to remember that this is not necessarily a reflection of everyone. Maintaining your ideals in a world that often values power and control takes immense courage. You don't have to change who you are, or compromise your principles to achieve social connectivity. 

Finally, keep communicating! There is power in sharing your experiences and feelings, as you may find others who resonate with your path. Remember, it takes time to find your tribe. Your strong sense of self-understanding and the authenticity you've demonstrated here are things to be applauded in and of themselves. Remember that self-care and fostering positive affirmations from within yourself is crucial. You're not alone in this journey."	1	0	0	0.000648200511932373	forum with demographics

I really appreciate your honesty and vulnerability in sharing your story, and I want to assure you that you're not alone in your experiences. It sounds like you're grappling with the tough realizations of societal expectations versus your personal beliefs and values, which can be incredibly difficult. 

Although I don't know all the nuances of your life, it seems like you've stayed true to the principles you were taught growing up and you have nobly stuck to your guns regarding your interactions with others. This is not a weakness, but a sign of strength, integrity, and respect for others. It's crucial to remember that societal values of dominance and competitiveness are not universally accepted or valued, and you are not alone in feeling out of sync with those. 

The world is vastly diverse, and I believe there is a space for everyone to comfortably exist in. It appears to me that a large part of your struggle comes from distancing yourself from societal norms. Embrace your difference and see it as a strength. Not wanting to dominate or be dominated is admirable and should not be considered a flaw or weakness. 

Finding like-minded individuals could play a significant role in improving your mental health and social connectivity. Have you considered joining groups or communities related to liberal Christianity, autism spectrum or even unique interests/hobbies? Online platforms such as Meetup or even niche forums on sites like Reddit could help you connect with people who share similar experiences and perspectives.

Also, pursuing therapy can assist in processing your feelings and experiences and equip you with strategies to cope with challenging situations. This can also provide reassurance that your outlook isn't inherently wrong - it's different, which in and of itself doesn't denote any defect. 

And finally, remember to appreciate the positives in your life. You have a loving wife and children, and evidently a compassionate heart - these are blessings that not everyone has the privilege of possessing.

I wish you nothing but strength, peace and clarity as you navigate this journey. And remember, it's perfectly okay to be different and walk your own path. 

Stay strong and know that you're not alone."	1	0	0	0.0007427334785461426	forum w/o demographics

On top of that my parents are financially dependent on me to an extent too and I can't keep supporting them to the level I am doing now with my current income since my child needs schooling and that's a newly added expense column in the monthly budget.

TOO many demons to run away from, not enough places to run."	"Hey there, sorry to hear you're feeling this way. Life sure can be overwhelming sometimes. Please know that it's okay to take a time-out when you need to. Maybe try some calming activities to ease the pressure, like yoga or meditation? Also, build a routine that incorporates time just for yourself - even if it's just 10 minutes a day. 

About the financial stress, it might be helpful to seek professional advice or research about financial planning. You could find part-time/freelance work to help transition to something more fulfilling or use online resources to upskill at your own pace. Remember, career changes or new learning can happen at any age. 

It seems like the main issue is communication. Maybe consider seeking professional help, like a therapist or counselor, to navigate through this feeling of being trapped. Remember, it's okay to take help, it doesn't make you less capable!

I'm really sorry you're going through this. It sounds like you're under an enormous amount of pressure juggling so many responsibilities. It's normal to feel burnt out under such circumstances. Remember, it's okay to feel down and overwhelmed; we all have those moments. 

First, I'd advise you to try getting back into cycling. It might seem tough initially as you're not feeling up to it, but it's a healthy way to manage stress and can make a remarkable difference. Physical activities like cycling can help to release endorphins, the body's natural mood boosters, and can provide a much-needed break from worries and pressures.

Regarding your concerns about financial stability, have you considered seeking advice from a financial counsellor? They can assist you to understand your financial situation better and make plans for the future. 

As for your job and up-skilling concerns, the industry is constantly evolving and it may feel hard to keep up. However, many platforms offer free or low-cost resources for people wanting to learn new, relevant skills at their own pace. It will take time, but it's never too late to learn and grow.

Your worries about your wife's employment status and your aging parents are clearly taxing on you. It might be worth seeking out support groups or communities (possibly online) of people in similar situations. Sharing experiences, concerns and coping methods with people who genuinely understand can be tremendously helpful.

Facing so many challenges at once is tough. Consider seeking professional mental health support if the overwhelming feelings persist. In these hard times, a professional can provide coping strategies specifically catered to your situation. 

Remember, there's no harm in seeking help, and there's always a way out of the toughest situation. It might just take some time to find it. 

Take care, you're not alone in this."	2	0	0	0.0007113218307495117	mental health forum
"I'm not sure how to put this across... I'm feeling really down about everything.. Don't feel like doing ANYTHING.. 

I do workout (I cycle but haven't been going out on rides since the last 7-10 days since I don't feel like it at all) and have an angel of a daughter who's two years old.

I can't speak about it with my wife since she ends up feeling guilty about it but doesn't do anything to help - she herself is low on confidence and feels like she cannot land any job with her current skills.

My skills are getting outdated too (Indian IT employee here) but I'm just not up for upskilling myself and the thought of becoming irrelevant kills me.

I want to run away from everything and explore the world but can't do that unless I take care of responsibilities towards family first.

On top of that my parents are financially dependent on me to an extent too and I can't keep supporting them to the level I am doing now with my current income since my child needs schooling and that's a newly added expense column in the monthly budget.

I also do not have any savings whatsoever and the thought of not being financially independent is scary AF.

It sounds like you're dealing with an overwhelming amount of stress and feelings of burnout. You're not alone in feeling this way, many people do. 

It's really important to talk things over with someone who can provide support, whether they're a trusted friend, colleague, or a professional. Have you considered speaking to a mental health professional about how you're feeling? There are online and over the phone services available, if you would prefer not to meet with someone face-to-face. 

In terms of the financial stress and worries about your job, are there any courses or workshops you could take to help update your skills? It might seem overwhelming right now, but taking small steps can make a big difference. 

Also, practicing self-care can be really helpful when you're feeling overwhelmed. This doesn't just mean physical exercises like cycling, but also caring for your mental health. Activities like meditation, reading a book, or even taking a warm bath can help to reduce stress and improve your mood.

And please, if you're feeling suicidal or very down, get immediate help. There are hotlines available in most countries, remember you're not alone and there are people that care deeply about your wellbeing."	2	0	0	0.0007303357124328613	forum with demographics

TOO many demons to run away from, not enough places to run."	"Hi there, 

I really hear you when you say you're feeling down and burnt out. It sounds like you've got a lot on your shoulders right now. Recognizing you're in a challenging place is an important first step. 

Feeling unmotivated or lack of interest in things that you once enjoyed, is something quite common when feeling stressed or depressed. Continuing to exercise, even when you don't feel like it, is one important method to help combat feelings of depression. You might not feel it immediately, but in the long run, it can help to lift your mood. 

Sometimes it can be helpful to connect with others who are experiencing similar stressors. This can act as a sounding board, provide useful tips or resources for managing stress, and also to give the reassurance that you are not alone in what you are going through. You might find our monthly virtual meetup ""Support for everyone feeling burnt out"" helpful for you.

Also, remember it's okay to ask for help. If you're financially supporting your parents, it's not selfish to have a conversation with them about reducing your contributions if it's impacting your own finances and mental wellbeing drastically. They might have other resources available to them that they weren’t aware of or haven’t considered before.

The pressure of needing to always upgrade skills in the IT industry can definitely be overwhelming. Try not to let the fear of becoming irrelevant block your path forward. Exploring new methods of learning can make the process of upskilling less daunting. 

As far as your desire to explore and feel freedom, it might be helpful to start by exploring small and closer to home. A day trip to a nearby town or city, perhaps a family picnic, it might provide you the mini escape you need, without having to tear apart your whole life.

Finally, there's no shame in seeking professional help, especially when things seem frightening. A talk with a counselor or therapist could give you more tools to tackle what you're facing. You don't have to deal with this alone, there's help available.

Wishing you all the best in this challenging journey."	1	0	0	0.0007465481758117676	forum w/o demographics
"While desperately looking for that chic ethnic FIT I can slay in for Diwali, I came across this awesome sleeveless Kurti which was perfect...but it was sleeveless that means SHAVING! 
God, why! But wait why do we HAVE to shave if we hate it so much. Let's be honest making ourselves go through hot wax and exorcist level yanking or bleeding to death while shaving is like self-torture just to look good (in the eyes of society). If it is that painful why do we make ourselves go through it? 

Did you see the movie Khiladi? The one where Akshay Kumar was seen flaunting his body hair. Wouldn't it be amazing if we saw women flaunting theirs too? 

Have you seen animals shave their body hair? There's a reason why we have body hair. It keeps mammals warm. It protects the body against trauma and also against ultraviolet damage. In human beings, specialized hairs such as eyelashes and hairs inside the nostrils and external ears afford some protection from the environment. Eyebrows prevent sweat from getting into the eyes. Scalp hairs may assist in stabilizing the temperature of the brain. Hairs can also excrete toxic substances like arsenic, and are thus of use in forensic medicines. As every dermatologist knows, the physiological functions of hairs are immeasurable.

We all go through puberty. Hairy or otherwise it's one's choice to either keep the hair on our body or not. Society or your friends can't shame you for your body hair. There is a reason why we were born with the same. It protects us from so many unimaginable things. Imagine not having eyelashes or nostril hair, then how will you survive the dust that affects your body? All I want to say is let's continue to break the barriers and show that beauty is diverse and you don't have to be a certain stereotype to be beautiful. 

When you look at the world, the world isn't just one palette. It's a rainbow. So, say goodbye to your inner critic and take a pledge to be kinder to yourself and others too.

-Debapriya, intern at u/just_lemmebe1"	"Hey Debapriya, it sounds like your frustration is something many can relate to. It's essential to keep in mind that beauty standards differ globally and are mainly crafted by society than any biological necessity. You're spot on about body hair, it exists for a reason and is purely natural. Flaunt that ethnic FIT you found for Diwali, sleeveless and hair full (if that's what you prefer) and make a statement.

Remember Akshay in Khiladi? Just like him, proudly displaying your body hair can pave the way for broader acceptance and help to challenge outdated beauty norms. Embrace your body hair if you so wish, or shave/wax if that is what makes you confident and happy.

Body hair isn't shameful to have, neither in public nor alone. Let’s champion diversity and redefine beauty, it's high time we did. Let's add more colors to our beauty-palette and make it as vibrant as a rainbow. Don’t let societal norms and expectations dictate how you present yourself. Embrace your uniqueness, love your body and shine bold and beautiful this Diwali.

-Debapriya, intern at u/just_lemmebe1"	"Hey there, Debapriya,

I 100% agree with your reflections and I believe many others reading this will as well. Beauty standards have been pressuring both men and women across cultures and societies. It's high time we make our own decisions based on what makes us happy and comfortable, rather than what's expected by societal norms.

Akshay Kumar in Khiladi did indeed pave the way for a dialogue around this subject matter, and why can't we have a range of expressions of beauty that includes all kinds of natural looks?

Your concern about the health benefits of hair is also valid. Our bodies are designed the way they are for a range of reasons, many protective or supportive of our overall well-being. The existence of body hair, from eyelashes to those elsewhere, serves various functions and it's essential that we value our bodies in their natural form. 

If you feel confident and beautiful in your sleeveless Kurti without going through the painful routine of shaving, then go ahead and rock it! Your comfort and satisfaction should always come first.

The world indeed is a diverse palette. Your words have power and can inspire so many out there who are hesitant to step outside the confines of societal beauty standards. Keep being you, keep empowering and most importantly, keep being kind to yourself and others.

Stay strong and shine on.

-Debapriya, intern at u/just_lemmebe1"	"Hi Debapriya, 

You've managed to bring forth some really great points in regard to societal standards of beauty, and I wholeheartedly agree with your perspective. The pressure of adhering to certain beauty norms can indeed feel a bit much at times, and it's a part of the conversation we all need to have more often.

Celebrating body hair is about celebrating our body in its natural state, and it's truly inspiring to see you speaking up against the unnecessary pressures we inflict upon ourselves. You've also made an important point about the physiological benefits of body hair, it does serve vital roles in our overall body function.

So, whether it's about choosing to wear that sleeveless Kurti without shaving, or loving yourself as you are, remember, it's all about you and your comfort, not about societal expectations. It's time to flaunt your confidence, not just your clothes. 

One's beauty is truly diverse and is not bound by stereotypes. And it's only when we acknowledge and appreciate this diversity that we can truly celebrate beauty in its many forms. 

Remember, it's not just about conforming or non-conforming to societal norms but about celebrating who we are, in our most authentic form. Continue to spread this message of acceptance and diversity, and hopefully, more people will resonate with it. 

Be kind to yourself and others, always. You're a unique individual with your own beauty, and that's absolutely worth celebrating.

Best,

-Debapriya, intern at u/just_lemmebe1"	"Hi Debapriya,

Thank you for your thoughtful post and the meaningful perspective you're bringing to the table about societal beauty expectations. You're completely right; dealing with the physical discomfort and potential health risks of hair removal can often feel like a great deal just to fit into a certain beauty standard.

Embracing our natural bodies and loving ourselves as we are is indeed a powerful act. Moreover, challenging societal norms and advocating for acceptance of all bodies, regardless of body hair, is also an essential mindset change needed in society. 

Remember, your body, your rules - you don't have to do something you aren't comfortable with. If you want to rock that sleeveless Kurti without shaving - go for it! Beauty comes in all forms, not just the ones dictated by societal norms. It’s how you feel about yourself that truly matters. 

You're making a great point about the functional aspects of our body hair too. We maintain our eyebrows, eyelashes, and other body hairs for many practical reasons beyond just aesthetic ones. The same way, the decision to keep or remove body hair should be a personal one, not forced upon us by societal pressure. 

Continue to voice these important topics, promote acceptance, and challenge beauty stereotypes. You're doing a great job, and your efforts at breaking barriers are appreciated! 

Keep being you, and never let anyone tell you that you're not beautiful just as you are!

Stay Strong!

-Debapriya, intern at u/just_lemmebe1"	"Hi Debapriya,
You've managed to touch on an issue so many people struggle with, particularly women of South Asian descent. So first, I'd like to say: You're on the right track, fiercely addressing the societal pressures on women to conform.

Why indeed should we cause ourselves discomfort or pain, through waxing or shaving, to fulfil societal expectations of how we 'should' look? Representation in media, such as the movie 'Khiladi' you mentioned, is so important because it breaks the stereotype, allowing body hair to be seen as natural, which can help encourage acceptance.

We all have different comfort levels with body hair, and that's okay. Pressures to look a certain way can be overwhelming, but the natural functions of body hair are indeed unique and important. Every individual should have the right to decide about their body hair as they see fit.

It's great that you're promoting self-love and body acceptance in such a progressive way. Encouraging everyone to 'break the barriers' and redefine what beauty means to them can lead towards a more inclusive and understanding society. Your statement should resonate with every young woman, regardless of their ethnic background. 

The world indeed isn't a singular palette, but a rainbow made up of diverse, unique individuals. Now, it's about empowering each other to embrace that diversity and celebrating our individuality.
Keep spreading the positive message - you're doing amazing, Debapriya!

"I don't have many friends, but I ended up being the odd one out of the only college class I have with them today. Met with a therapist I've been meeting for about a year for the last time today because I am getting too old for youth services and completed a transition. Went onto a poc discord channel for the first time in months and saw that a yt person was using that channel to interview poc about ""recognizing race with bad vision"" or smthn, and I realized almost nobody in that tiny toxic channel is actually black, just mostly other races who aren't happy with ""black people being the only race represented in poc"". One of two of my closest friends is a guy and my parents have taught me unconsciously that it is awkward, so I am ashamed, and my other closest friend has drifted away from me because she feels like she's ""been a bad influence"" (she hasn't).

The only things that made me more introverted are my insecurities. I need people to talk to but I guess I have too many boyish hobbies to relate to girls my age and am too weird to fit into my own race.

Knowing who you are, being secure and confident in that, matters- doesn't matter what your race, interests or hobbies are. Gender norms shouldn't dictate what your hobbies should be and everyone moves at their own pace when it comes to making friends. They are hard to come by, but not impossible. Try to be patient and kind to yourself - it's okay to feel the way you do. Find hobbies that interest you and it's more than likely you'll find others with similar interests there. Sometimes we find our closest friends in the most unexpected places. It's important to remember that you ARE enough, just as you are. 🤗💪🙏💖	2	0	0	0.000735938549041748	social media

(I'll delete if offensive in any way)"	"Hi, it sounds like you're going through a rough patch. School transitions and changes in treatment services can be challenging. It seems you are also dealing with some struggles related to identity and feeling like you fit into certain groups, be they racial, gender, or hobby-related. It's common to face such struggles, so please note that you're not alone.

Though I can't be there to provide as much support as a mental health professional can, here are a few suggestions. Firstly, continue reaching out for support in online communities like this Reddit. You might find others who are going through or have been through similar circumstances and can offer empathy and guidance. Secondly, consider finding groups or clubs within or outside of school related to your interests. This can help you meet a more diverse group of people who share your hobbies.

You've mentioned a history of working with a therapist. If that has been helpful for you, it might be a good idea to seek out adult counseling or therapy services. It could be beneficial to talk about these thoughts and feelings in a safe, therapeutic setting. Lastly, practicing something like mindfulness or yoga could help manage your emotional well-being during this time. This might help you feel more grounded and less isolated.

Remember, it's okay to question and explore your own identity. Being different doesn't mean being weird. You are unique, and that's something to be celebrated. Take care of yourself.

Went onto a poc discord channel for the first time in months and saw that a yt person was using that channel to interview poc about ""recognizing race with bad vision"" or smthn, and I realized almost nobody in that tiny toxic channel is actually black, just mostly other races who aren't happy with ""black people being the only race represented in poc"". One of two of my closest friends is a guy and my parents have taught me unconsciously that it is awkward, so I am ashamed, and my other closest friend has drifted away from me because she feels like she's ""been a bad influence"" (she hasn't).

The only things that made me more introverted are my insecurities. I need people to talk to but I guess I have too many boyish hobbies to relate to girls my age and am too weird to fit into my own race.

(I'll delete if offensive in any way)"	"Hey there, it seems like you're going through a really tough time right now and I'm really sorry to hear that. Just remember that it's okay to feel what you're feeling and that it's valid. You're not weird for having hobbies that are typically associated with boys - we are all unique in our own ways and have things that set us apart. Your hobbies should be something you enjoy and don’t have to be gender specific.

Regrettably, not all online spaces are supportive or positive and it sounds like the Discord channel you participated in was quite toxic. Online platforms can be both a source of support and stress; maybe it would be beneficial to find other channels or groups that align better with your experiences and values. 

It's also understandable that you're feeling isolated from your friends. It sounds like there are some complex feelings going on here. Perhaps having an open and honest conversation with them could help clarify things. If standing up for yourself feels too daunting at first, maybe write it out in a letter or a message.

Therapist transitions are difficult and it's understandable you may be feeling lost or uncertain right now. There are adult services that may be able to continue the work you started in youth services. It could be worthwhile to reach out and explore potential options. 

It's clear that you are a thoughtful and intelligent individual. It's okay to feel isolated sometimes, but reaching out to make connections is a big step and I believe you have the courage to take it. Praying for a good support group is good, but also remember to make active efforts to find or build one, it might surprise you how many people are out there who share your feelings or interests. 

You're not alone. Remember to be kind to yourself during this period and seek the support you need. Don't hesitate to reach out here whenever you need as well. Take care."	2	0	0	0.0007907748222351074	forum with demographics

The transition from youth services can be challenging, and your feelings of not being understood or fitting in anywhere are valid; you're not alone in this. It is tough to feel like the odd one out, but there's something beautiful and unique about everyone which makes them 'the odd one'. Embrace your uniqueness.

As for your hobbies, there's no such thing as 'boyish' or 'girlish' hobbies. Interests are personal, not gender specific, and it's wonderful to have hobbies - it shows passion and curiosity. There's a world of people who would engage in those hobbies with you irrespective of age, race, or gender; you just haven't connected with them yet.

When it comes to racial representation, it's powerful to share your experience and perspective as a woman of color. Try not to let the opinions of others detract from your uniqueness. 

Concerning your friends, consider connecting with other friends or folks who love and appreciate you as you are. It's an unfortunate fact of life that people come and go, but there will always be those genuine ones who like you for who you are.

Finally, try to remember that even though societies, even smaller ones like online channels, have this inclination to label and group individuals, that doesn't define you. It is important to know your worth, and that you are priceless and irreplaceable as you are.

It sounds like you're dealing with a lot of pressure right now and it's commendable that you're looking out for your own feelings in such a challenging situation. 

A marriage is an important life decision and it's completely normal to feel anxious or unsure. However, remember, it's YOUR decision in the end. It might help to take some time alone to sort your thoughts, or even talk to a trusted friend. 

Try to communicate openly with your parents about your doubts as they might not fully realize your discomfort. They care about you and ultimately want you to be happy. 

Moreover, arranging a second meeting might give you another chance to get to know the man better, maybe in a more casual setting. This might help you either develop a connection or confirm your feelings of reluctance.

Also, it's crucial to take care of yourself, especially when stress is impacting your work. Consider some mindfulness techniques, yoga or even speaking with a mental health professional if the stress feels overwhelming. 

Remember - this is a big decision, and it's important that you feel comfortable with it. It's okay to take your time to figure out what's best for you."	1	0	0	0.0006805658340454102	mental health forum

It might be helpful to list down what you're looking for in a life partner. How do they align with the boy your parents have chosen? Talking to a trusted friend or family member might also help clear your mind. Try some mindfulness exercises to find some relief from distracting thoughts, allowing you to focus better on your work. If these concerns persist, you may consider seeking professional help.

Arranged marriages can be complex, especially when it involves meeting societal and family expectations. However, you are the one who matters most in this situation – it's your life. It's important to express your concerns openly to your parents. They want what's best for you and might not be aware of your hesitation.

Regardless of what societal or family pressure you may be facing, always remember to prioritize your happiness and mental health. Because ultimately, the decision should be yours and yours alone. 

In terms of staying focused on your work, try to allocate specific times to ponder over your situation and other times to focus solely on your work. This might help to compartmentalize and manage these stresses a bit more effectively.

I hear you and it can undoubtedly be challenging to go against family expectations, especially around such a significant decision like marriage. Many individuals might find themselves in the same situation you are, struggling between familial obligation and their own feelings. It's essential, and entirely okay, to prioritize your feelings above anything else in such scenarios. There's no rush to get married if you're not ready or if the person doesn't feel right for you. 

Try and communicate your feelings with your family, express the concerns you've mentioned here. While they may have their hopes, remember it's you who will live with this person - your happiness should take precedence. Some open and honest discussion can be beneficial, and if you feel comfortable, perhaps even a moderated session with a family counselor or therapist could provide a neutral ground for communication.

Just remember, not all decisions have to be taken in haste, take your time. It's okay to be unsure and seek guidance. Professional help can make a difference too, so don't hesitate to reach out to therapists or helplines. Your feelings are valid, and it's okay to put yourself first.

Wishing you all the best in navigating this situation. Please continue to reach out if you need to talk."	1	0	0	0.0006673932075500488	forum w/o demographics
"i’ve never had a diagnosed mental illness but for a few months now, since summer started i’ve been feeling this background numbness. it feels like i no longer have any zest for life. 

here are some things i think are sources of this:

1. everyone ard me is getting internships at elite companies while my own is not very impressive
2. my best friend is studying overseas with an awkward time difference
3. all my other friends here are in happy relationships and i feel like i’m no one’s top priority 
4. i ended up using part time work as a distraction from thinking of these feelings properly(which i nvr did before, i used to be very in tune with my feelings)

a small argument with a close friend over text(who is not a very emotional person) triggered a panic attack in public, and that had triggered me into thinking of a way to fix this. 

im saving up so i don’t have money to spend on therapy, my parents are very asian and very unemotional and i feel like ive trauma dumped on my friends enough. 

i’m planning on going to my university’s free counselling service but i heard it’s not great. 

does anyone have any suggestions? especially since i’m not diagnosed with anyth and i’m not sure how to do deal with this with my limited resources."	"Hey there! First off, I just wanted to say that it's really brave of you to be so open about your feelings. It's okay to feel off, even if you're not diagnosed with anything. Everyone's mental health fluctuates and deserves attention. 

As for some suggestions, try talking to your university's counseling service anyway! Each counselor is different, so you might find one who's a good fit for you, despite what you might have heard. Also, there are lots of online resources and communities that offer support and advice for various mental health issues - you're not alone in what you're feeling.

Nevertheless, focusing on self-care can be beneficial. Engage in activities you love, get regular exercise, adequate sleep and maintain a balanced diet. And even though it's painful right now, remember that comparison is the thief of joy. Your journey is uniquely yours and everybody's path and pace are different. 

Lastly, remember it's okay to seek help and there's no shame in it. If things get worse, consider exploring options like sliding-scale therapists or mental health apps that could be more affordable. Take care!"	1	0	0	0.000752568244934082	social media

I'm really sorry to hear that you're going through this tough time. Remember, it's completely natural to compare ourselves to others, especially with the competitive world we live in. However, it's also important to remember that everyone moves at their own pace and success isn't measured solely by materialistic achievements. It's okay if your internships are different from your friends' - what matters is the experience you gain, and the personal growth you achieve from it.

With your best friend studying overseas, the feeling of loneliness might be amplified. Does your university offer any clubs or activities that interest you? That can be a good way to meet new people and form connections. It's great you're planning on reaching out to your university's counselling service, sometimes a neutral party can provide perspectives that your friends and family may not be able to provide. Even if the service isn’t considered great, it could still be of help — it’s better than having no support at all.

As to not having money for therapy and avoiding burdening your friends, there are a number of free online mental health forums and hotlines you can try. They may not be as comprehensive as traditional therapy, but they can still provide a platform for voicing out your feelings without judgment.

Remember, mental health issues do not necessarily come with a clinical diagnosis. Feelings of numbness, persistent sadness, or lack of interest in life could be symptoms of a mental health issue. It's great that you're recognizing these signs and realizing the need for help. The first step towards recovery is acknowledging there's a problem, and you're already there. Please keep seeking help, and remember it's okay to not be ok.

Please take care of yourself and I truly hope things get better for you soon.

Best wishes."	2	0	0	0.0007703304290771484	forum w/o demographics
"I used to have many misunderstandings about surrendering. It felt like giving up or not pushing hard enough. But recently, I stumbled upon the book ""The Surrender Experiment,"" and it completely changed my perspective. Surrendering, it turns out, is the exact opposite of what I thought. 

&#x200B;

What truly inspired me in the book was the author's decision to embrace new experiences, even those he initially resisted. He chose to surrender and be open to life's opportunities, and the results were far beyond his imagination. That, to me, is the genuine essence of surrendering. **It doesn't mean giving up on life; instead, it's about releasing our ego and personal preferences, facing our fears, and having the courage to step outside our comfort zone. It's about relinquishing control and wholeheartedly embracing whatever life presents us with.**

&#x200B;

Looking back on my own life, I realized that most of my successes came from confronting these challenges head-on, while most of my suffering arose when I clung to comfort based on personal preferences. Now, having experienced this breakthrough, I've made the most crucial decision of my life: to surrender. I am choosing to participate in life with a calm mind and an open heart.

&#x200B;

A calm mind entails letting go of constant self-analysis, personal preferences, and ego-driven thoughts. So much of our suffering comes from obsessing about ourselves. However, if we shift our focus to serving others and let go of our own desires, we can find instant relief. The happiest people in the world are not those who achieve greatness solely for themselves, but those who enrich the lives of others. Surrendering allows life to grant us gifts beyond our wildest dreams.

&#x200B;

An open heart means being open-minded, flexible, and courageous. It may sound simple, but it's a challenging endeavor. Confronting our fears and being willing to do things we initially resist are significant parts of this process. **Sometimes, the most remarkable outcomes come from things we never wanted or considered in the first place.** So, if you're considering surrendering, start by addressing your fears. Instead of avoiding them, confront them and take on the tasks you don't want to do. This is the path to surrendering to life.

&#x200B;

When we take greater risks, we also reap greater rewards. As we do this, it's essential to quiet our minds. This means letting go of judgments and opinions and creating mental clarity to see things as they are without overanalyzing. To start, pay close attention to your thoughts and become aware of them. Whenever you catch yourself engrossed in a negative thought, pause, take a breath, and acknowledge that it's just your mind spinning a tale—it doesn't come from your heart. Let it go and refocus on the task at hand. Surrendering is not a one-time event; it is a continuous process of growth and self-discovery. So, be patient with yourself and celebrate every step forward, no matter how small it may seem.

&#x200B;

In the end, surrendering is about finding harmony within ourselves and with the world around us. It is about aligning with the natural rhythms of life and trusting that the universe has our best interests at heart. So, let go of the need for control, quiet your mind, and embrace the beauty of surrender. As you do so, you will unlock the door to a life of fulfillment, purpose, and boundless possibilities.

If you're ready to take the first step towards a more fulfilling life, DM me today to schedule a free consultation.* "	"It's wonderful to read that you've had such a profound realization about the concept of surrendering and how it can be instrumental in personal growth. 

You're right, surrendering isn't about giving up, it's about unburdening ourselves from the constraints of our own expectations and fears. It's wonderful to see that you're ready to embrace uncertainty and accept life wholeheartedly.

As you embark on this journey of self-discovery, remember to regularly practice mindfulness. Recognize your thoughts and feelings, but avoid getting entangled in them. Gradually, you'll find yourself at peace with the present moment, and better able to accept life as it is, rather than how you think it should be.

Don't forget, growth is a process, not a destination. As you shift towards this mindset, there may be moments of discomfort. Relish in them, they’re a sign you're growing. Look at errors not as failures, but as opportunities to learn and become better.

Ultimately, true surrender elicits a sense of freedom and clarity that can cultivate large-scale transformations in our lives. Keep your mind open to the wonders surrendering can bring. Wishing you all the best in your journey towards a richer, more fulfilling life.

P.S. Tracey Zhang, it sounds like your life coaching work aligns perfectly with this mindset. I wish you all the best in your mission to help others appreciate surrendering as a powerful act of personal growth."	1	0	0	0.000682830810546875	mental health forum
"I used to have many misunderstandings about surrendering. It felt like giving up or not pushing hard enough. But recently, I stumbled upon the book ""The Surrender Experiment,"" and it completely changed my perspective. Surrendering, it turns out, is the exact opposite of what I thought. 

&#x200B;

What truly inspired me in the book was the author's decision to embrace new experiences, even those he initially resisted. He chose to surrender and be open to life's opportunities, and the results were far beyond his imagination. That, to me, is the genuine essence of surrendering. **It doesn't mean giving up on life; instead, it's about releasing our ego and personal preferences, facing our fears, and having the courage to step outside our comfort zone. It's about relinquishing control and wholeheartedly embracing whatever life presents us with.**

&#x200B;

Looking back on my own life, I realized that most of my successes came from confronting these challenges head-on, while most of my suffering arose when I clung to comfort based on personal preferences. Now, having experienced this breakthrough, I've made the most crucial decision of my life: to surrender. I am choosing to participate in life with a calm mind and an open heart.

&#x200B;

A calm mind entails letting go of constant self-analysis, personal preferences, and ego-driven thoughts. So much of our suffering comes from obsessing about ourselves. However, if we shift our focus to serving others and let go of our own desires, we can find instant relief. The happiest people in the world are not those who achieve greatness solely for themselves, but those who enrich the lives of others. Surrendering allows life to grant us gifts beyond our wildest dreams.

&#x200B;

An open heart means being open-minded, flexible, and courageous. It may sound simple, but it's a challenging endeavor. Confronting our fears and being willing to do things we initially resist are significant parts of this process. **Sometimes, the most remarkable outcomes come from things we never wanted or considered in the first place.** So, if you're considering surrendering, start by addressing your fears. Instead of avoiding them, confront them and take on the tasks you don't want to do. This is the path to surrendering to life.

&#x200B;

When we take greater risks, we also reap greater rewards. As we do this, it's essential to quiet our minds. This means letting go of judgments and opinions and creating mental clarity to see things as they are without overanalyzing. To start, pay close attention to your thoughts and become aware of them. Whenever you catch yourself engrossed in a negative thought, pause, take a breath, and acknowledge that it's just your mind spinning a tale—it doesn't come from your heart. Let it go and refocus on the task at hand. Surrendering is not a one-time event; it is a continuous process of growth and self-discovery. So, be patient with yourself and celebrate every step forward, no matter how small it may seem.

&#x200B;

In the end, surrendering is about finding harmony within ourselves and with the world around us. It is about aligning with the natural rhythms of life and trusting that the universe has our best interests at heart. So, let go of the need for control, quiet your mind, and embrace the beauty of surrender. As you do so, you will unlock the door to a life of fulfillment, purpose, and boundless possibilities.

If you're ready to take the first step towards a more fulfilling life, DM me today to schedule a free consultation.* "	"Your reflections on surrendering and the transformation it inspired in your understanding of control, fear, and growth are truly insightful. The process of embracing new experiences, the courage it requires to leave one's comfort zone, and the humility it takes to maintain a calm mind while participating fully in life's encounters are indeed challenging tasks, and I commend you for your willingness to embark on this journey. 

The path to surrendering, as you've described it, involves a continuous process of growth and self-discovery. It's easy to get overwhelmed, so remember to take your journey one step at a time. As you mentioned, paying attention to your thoughts, being aware and patient with yourself, and celebrating every step you take, no matter how small, are crucial elements in this process. 

Also, it might help to reflect on your motivations and explore the reason behind your decision to approach life with this new perspective. Understanding the 'why' can help to justify the difficult periods and challenges this process could present. 

If you feel comfortable, try journaling. It can be an invaluable tool for tracing and understanding your personal growth journey. Remember, mental health is not always about removing all discomfort; sometimes, it's about learning how to navigate it while cultivating resilience and adaptability. 

Lastly, it is okay to lean on others for support and guidance during this process. Seek guidance from a trusted friend, a mentor or a professional if you feel the need. Balanced and critical feedback can help contextualize your reflections and progress along your journey. Remember that seeking help is not a sign of weakness, but a critical step in the process of growth and self-discovery. 

Best of luck on your journey. Please remember to practice self-compassion, be patient, and celebrate every step you make. 

Also, thank you for sharing your insights and inspiring others to reflect about surrendering and personal growth."	1	0	0	0.0006097555160522461	clinician

Congrats on deciding to surrender and open yourself up to life's experiences. Channeling this new perspective of surrendering involves a lot of inner work taking baby steps and being patient with oneself. Given that it's not a single event but a continuous self-discovery journey, it's essential to celebrate even small victories. 

One practical approach to practicing surrendering could be incorporating mindfulness and meditation into your routine. They can help quiet your mind, become aware of your thoughts, and let them slip away without engaging with them. Jessica Morey's ""Beginner's Guide to Meditation"" could be a good starting point. 

Another thing you can try is a simple yet effective practice called the ""5,4,3,2,1 Grounding Exercise"" whenever you find yourself overwhelmed. It helps bring you back to the moment and away from any daunting tasks or fears. Start by recognizing five things you can see, four things you can touch, three things you can hear, two things you can smell, and one thing you can taste. 

Lastly, seeking support during this process is valuable. Whether it's from trusted friends, a counselor, or a professional life coach like Tracey Zhang, such support can provide a sounding board for your thoughts and emotions. Keep in mind that adapting to this new perspective might be a challenging journey, but it's one well worth embracing. Keep going!"	1	0	0	0.0006648898124694824	forum with demographics

Indeed, it does involve letting go of our egos, controlling tendencies, and stepping outside our comfort zones. It's heartening to see how you've embraced this leap with courage and an open heart. 

Maintaining a serene mind in the face of obstacles can be challenging, but it's essential for mindful living. And allowing your heart to stay open, despite the inherent difficulty, is indeed a courageous feat. Confronting your fears is an important part of this journey, and it's admirable that you're already recognizing this.

Remember, surrendering doesn't mean you're weak or giving up, but it's acknowledging that some things are beyond our control, and sometimes, those things can turn out to be life's greatest gifts.

However, I would advise you to keep patience at the core of your endeavor. Surrendering is a continual journey of growth and self-discovery. So, don't be too hard on yourself if progress seems slow. Celebrate every small achievement, as every step forward is a victory. 

You may find it helpful to maintain a journal to document your thoughts, feelings, and progress. It can act a reflective mirror to help you realize your growth over time.

Thank you for sharing your powerful realization and journey with us. We're here to support you. Remember, there is strength in vulnerability, and your story might be the inspiration someone else needs to grasp the essence of surrender.

"She  constantly blames me for being vulnerable and crying, insisting that  I'm oversensitive, rude, and not allowed to express my emotions freely.  This has caused me to put my emotions on autopilot, hiding them even  from myself, and convincing myself that I'm just too sensitive. Whenever  I try to address her behavior, she gaslights me, deflects the issue,  and scolds me for no apparent reason. If I stand up to her, she  dismisses me as a rude child, leaving me feeling silenced and unable to  express myself.

Her consistent low  opinion of me deeply hurts, leading to a significant blow to my  self-esteem. Subconsciously, I'm terrified of making even the slightest  mistake, as I know she'll demean me, calling me an idiot who can't do  anything right. She communicates with unclear expectations, expecting me  to understand without her needing to say anything, making me feel like a  constant disappointment to her. Her anger can be so intense that it  breaks my heart and leaves me feeling emotionally numb.

However,  amidst all the negativity, I can't deny that she cares about me in her  own way. She cooks my favorite meals and offers advice to reduce stress  when I study. But, she becomes disappointed if my grades aren't perfect,  even though I am actually an honored student. She takes care of me  physically, but emotionally, her words can be cruel, especially when she  mocks my passion for singing.

Approval  from her is a constant need in my life. Her words can be incredibly  cutting, as she keeps bringing up my past mistakes and refuses to  believe in me or have faith in my abilities. The rare moments of pride  she shows are when I achieve something notable, but she tends to  prioritize sharing these achievements on social media rather than  expressing her joy directly to me.

It's  a typical Asian mom situation, and feeling particularly down today, I  decided to pour out my feelings while sobbing quietly in my room.  Writing this has helped me feel somewhat better.

And what hurts the most is that she doesn't believe in me .She's not faithful in me ."	"Hey there, sending virtual hugs your way! 🤗 Know that each person's expression of emotions is valid and it's okay to be sensitive or emotional, it makes you human. Dealing with constant criticism is incredibly tough, but remember that you are not solely defined by her words. Your worth is not determined by her expectations.

Take some time each day to validate yourself and focus on your achievements, not just academically but in all aspects. Do something you're passionate about, like singing, to help boost your self-esteem.

Though it may seem difficult to break from wanting her approval, understand that your happiness isn't reliant on her validation. Surround yourself with others who appreciate and respect your feelings. 

And while confronting her directly may not yield the desired result, opening a conversation about the way her actions affect you might be beneficial.You can seek help from a trusted adult, perhaps a teacher or a relative, or look into professional help like therapy if you feel comfortable doing so. 

Please remember, you're not alone and there are people who genuinely care for you and believe in you. Don't let her define your worth or dampen your passion for singing. You are stronger than you think. Remember, patience, bravery, and the strong will to take control of your self-worth in your own hands are your tools to navigate this. 💖💪"	1	0	0	0.000914454460144043	social media

Learning to handle criticism, however, constant and harsh, can take time and patience, and it's okay to struggle. Remember, it's normal to feel upset and vulnerable, those are valid emotions. 

You may need to try to detach from her negative comments and focus on your accomplishments and the things that bring you joy like your singing. A good way to combat low self-esteem is through self-love practices, like talking to yourself kindly and compassionately. 

It's clearly important to you to make her proud, but also remember that you're not obligated to meet every expectation she has. This doesn't mean you shouldn't strive to achieve your goals, but it's also about setting personal boundaries and knowing your self-worth. 

As time goes by, continue to assert yourself calmly and as respectively as possible, and limit the amount of emotional energy you afford her negative behavior. Write down your feelings, like you're doing now, and consider seeking help from a counselor or a therapist. You are not alone in feeling this way.

Lastly, the fact that you got through this and penned this emotional piece shows your resilience and your strength. Hang on to that, things will, and always do, change. Keep believing in yourself."	2	0	0	0.0007888078689575195	mental health forum

It sounds like you're going through a tough time trying to express your emotions and stand up for yourself, but being undermined by a significant figure in your life. 

Firstly, it's important to realize that it's okay to be vulnerable, and it's okay to cry. We all have emotions, and they're valid - no one else has the right to tell you how to feel, or to discredit your emotions. 

Gaslighting is an immense psychological strain. If you're not familiar with the term, it involves manipulative tactics that make the victim question their own sanity. It's mentally and emotionally exhausting, but recognizing these tactics can be a step towards standing up against them. Educating her about her communication style might help, but also take into account she might not be open to changing it or even acknowledging it.

It's clearly apparent that you crave her approval, a perfectly human thing to do. But remember, while her opinion matters to you, it's not the raometer of your self-worth or abilities. You are accomplished and have much to be proud of. Hold on to what you know to be true about yourself, your passions, and your abilities, and remember that her perceptions don't define them.

Finding a trusted person to talk with, such as a mental health professional, could be beneficial, as could setting boundaries to protect your emotional wellbeing. Singing seems to be a passion of yours – continue to use it as an outlet. Always make time to engage in activities that you enjoy and that help you feel good about yourself.

Take care of yourself, it's the most important thing. You are not alone, and the courage you demonstrated by sharing your feelings is commendable."	2	0	0	0.001169741153717041	forum with demographics

I'm really sorry to hear that you're going through this. I just wanted to say that it's okay to feel vulnerable and express your emotions; you are not oversensitive, and no one has the right to belittle your feelings or tell you otherwise. Your feelings are valid, and remember, there is no shame in crying or expressing pain.

At the same time, it's completely natural to seek approval from our parents, but it's important to remember that their approval doesn't define your worth. You're an honored student and you have a passion for singing - these are wonderful things! Don't let anything or anyone take that joy away from you.

Try expressing your feelings to your mom when the both of you are calm. Use ""I"" statements to convey how you feel. For example, ""I feel hurt when you disregard my passion for singing."" It might be tough to communicate this, but it's important for your emotional wellbeing.

Also, please consider getting professional advice from a counselor or a therapist. They can provide guidance and coping mechanisms to help navigate through this situation. 

You are not alone. You are more strong, capable and resilient than you give yourself credit for. Don't stop believing in yourself, even if it feels your own family doesn't. Your strength does not rely on her belief in you, but in your own belief in yourself.

Stay safe and take care of yourself."	2	0	0	0.0008819699287414551	forum w/o demographics

I'm really sorry to hear about your situation, it sounds like you're carrying a lot both emotionally and physically. The best advice I can give you is to reach out to professional organizations or hotlines that support individuals who are experiencing domestic abuse. Given that you're in SEA, different countries have different resources available, so make sure to look for local organizations. Remember, it's never acceptable for anyone to harm you in the name of 'discipline'. In terms of finances, you could consider applying for scholarships or grants to continue your education. You could even try to sell your art online to make a bit more. Stay strong and remember, you're not alone. Thousands had made it out, and so can you! 💪Your resilience is truly admirable, and I believe brighter days will come.

"Hey there, thank you for opening up about your current situation - it takes a lot of courage to do so. It sounds like you're going through an extremely difficult time right now, so it's important to remember that it's okay to feel overwhelmed. Your feelings are valid, and it's okay to ask for help when you need it.

As for getting out of a difficult household - yes, many people have successfully managed to do it and are now leading happier, healthier lives. It's important to understand that each person's journey is different, but that doesn't mean that it's impossible for you to create a safer environment for yourself in the future. 

It sounds like you're taking on a lot of responsibilities right now. While it's commendable that you are trying to take care of your family, it's also crucial to take care of yourself. Practice self-care, engage in things you enjoy, and remember to take breaks when you need to. If your situation allows, reaching out to a local organization or a trusted person about your situation may also provide you with further assistance.

Earning from your art is a great achievement already, and you could start saving a little bit at a time towards your goal of leaving an unsafe household. Additionally, it might be beneficial to build a support network around you - even if they're online friends, they can provide a lot of comfort, encouragement, and advice during tough times like these. 

Finally, remember to stay hopeful. Things may look bleak right now, but they won't always be this way. You're much stronger than you realize. You're brave for reaching out, keep going. You're not alone in this journey."	1	0	0	0.0007222294807434082	mental health forum

"I'm really sorry to hear about the struggles you're experiencing. Although I can't fully understand what you're going through, please know that your feelings are entirely valid. It sounds incredibly challenging and stressful to manage your family's welfare while also dealing with your personal struggles. Assessing whether your environment is safe for you is an important first step in understanding what you need to do to take care of yourself.

Chronically stressful environments can indeed exacerbate physical health issues like eczema. While I can't endorse specific remedies here, it might be worth exploring stress-reduction techniques or speaking with a clinician if it's safe and possible for you to do so.

As for your question on pursuing academic or work options, it's ultimately your decision. Both routes have their benefits and challenges, dependent on your individual circumstances. It could be useful to list out the pros and cons of each option to provide yourself with a clearer understanding.

Many people have walked this sort of path before you and have made it out. Please take some hope in knowing that it's entirely feasible to create a healthier, safer life for yourself. Everyone's journey will be unique, remember to take one step at a time, focus on what you can control, and seek out supportive communities and resources that can provide you with guidance and understanding.

Please know that it's okay to feel exhausted and overwhelmed by your circumstances. But remember, even in the most challenging times, you're not alone. There are communities and people out there ready to lend you support. Please take care of yourself, your feelings and safety should always be your priority."	2	0	0	0.0006664395332336426	clinician

"I'm really sorry to hear that you're going through such a tough time, and it's really brave of you to share your experience here. 

I can't fully grasp what you're feeling, but it's clear that the stress and expectations placed on you are taking a heavy toll. You don't deserve the treatment from your father, no one does. Remember, his behavior is a reflection of him, not you.

Remember to take care of your own mental and physical health amidst everything. Finding local resources, whether that be a counselor, social worker, or even organisations that specialise in family/domestic situations could be invaluable. They can provide advice, resources, or just a supportive listener. 

Look into resources at your school as well. Some schools have programs or professionals that can provide assistance.

Focusing on your art can be a great outlet for your stress as well. Not only can it bring a sense of calm, but it also can open doors for potential earnings and opportunities. 

You may be feeling hopeless now, but please remember, this is not forever. You are strong and resilient, and there are brighter days ahead. I'm sure others here with similar experiences can chime in and share how they've managed to leave unsafe environments. You're not alone in this.

Your story echoes with so many who have walked this difficult path before you. Regardless of country, race, or age, these are shared human experiences that shake us to our core but also push us to grow stronger. Despite the terrors you face at home, you should know that you are incredibly strong for persistently taking steps towards your well-being and that of your family.

Coming from a 24 year old male from Europe, I resonated with your story in ways I couldn't have imagined. My father was also abusive, and I too felt trapped between the need to escape and the call to protect my younger sibling. Earlier last year I was in a tough situation, much like yourself right now, and it seemed almost impossible to see the light at the end of the tunnel. But guess what? I did manage to step out of my toxic household and am now working towards building a safer environment for myself and my sibling.

I understand that it is difficult to stay hopeful, but please hang in there! Because hope is worth holding onto. Reach out to student support services at your college for assistance, they are often equipped with resources that can prove very beneficial in situations like yours. Don't be afraid to ask for help.

Creating art can be an outlet, a way to release stress and also earn money. I personally found solace in volunteering at various organizations. It helped me build a support network which played a crucial role in my bid for freedom.

Remember to take care of yourself in the midst of all your responsibilities; drink water, eat well, give yourself a pat on the back for every little progress, and importantly, take moments to breathe. You are not alone, and you can rise above your circumstances.

Sending strength and peace your way."	1	0	0	0.0007536411285400391	forum w/o demographics

Please remember that it's not your fault, and you didn't deserve what happened to you. It's a cruel world sometimes, but there are resources for both emotional support and/or legal action. Consider reaching out to a counselor or a local women's shelter for help and advice, never feel shy in doing so. You're stronger than you know, and you will come out of this stronger and wiser.

It must be very painful to feel like you're treated so differently, and it is absolutely not fair at all. Remember that what you're feeling is a perfectly normal response to such a traumatizing experience. This is not your fault, and it's okay to feel upset and angry.

Reach out to the people you trust, talk to them about what you're going through if you feel comfortable. You're not alone in this, and there are people who genuinely care about your well-being. If you can, consider reaching out to a counselor or a therapist who can help you navigate these feelings in a safe, professional environment.

Social media can often portray an unrealistic view of people's lives. It's important to remember that everyone has their own struggles, and what you see on social media doesn't always reflect the complete truth. 

Take some time for self-care - whatever that may mean for you. This could include engaging in activities that you enjoy or that help you relax, spending time with loved ones, or just focusing on your physical health – eating nutritious meals, getting enough sleep, and exercising regularly.

You are stronger than you think, and it is okay to ask for help. You've already made such a brave step by reaching out here, and that's evidence of your strength and resilience. Don't lose hope, things will get better.

It sounds incredibly tough and you are absolutely permitted to feel upset and overwhelmed. It's not at all surprising that you're finding it hard to cope with all of this, considering how traumatic these experiences have been. 
Remember, you are not defined by your financial status, your race, your age, or your appearance. You are a person who deserves respect and dignity. Just because someone is rich or appears to be happy on social media, it doesn't mean they're superior or better than you. Everyone has their personal battles, though some are better at masking them than others. 
You're enduring an incredibly difficult time, but know that there are many people who care, though it might not feel like that now. Please consider reaching out to local mental health services, charities, or organizations that can perhaps provide support. Don't hesitate to call a crisis hotline if you're feeling lost and alone, and most importantly, remember that this matter deserves legal attention as well. You're brave for speaking up about your assault and I hope you consider reporting it if you haven't already.

"life is different than what it was 30 years ago when our parents were our age, they want you to lead theife the same way as they did.

I'm a teenager and I recently im noticing so many things that my parents do which i feel are really weird.

Once my mom forcefully pulled me into the kitchen, screaming at me asking me to learn to cook, of course cooking is a basic life skill that everyone should know to survive but do you know what my mum said instead? she told me if I dont learn to cook the in laws will blame her for not teaching me to cook. This felt totally disgusting. 

She keeps saving gold jewellery so that she could give it as dowry for my marriage (im still a teenager), they don't understand the world isn't like what it was in the 90s, i have the right to choose my partner, if they demand for dowry i can simply reject the marriage proposal, i can find someone who is genuinely interested in cooking, work can be shared between couples, if he cooks then i can clean, as simple as that.

My mom never lets me wear Western dresses, even if she does she allows only very modest outfits like jeans tshirt etc. Looking at kids my age dress up like how i want to dress up i feel really inferior and ugly infront of them. wanting to wear modern dresses doesn't mean i want to show my boobs to people, wanting to wear trousers doesn't mean I'm trying to look sexy infront of guys. 

Also recently I've noticed this, usually in my home each person has a list of household work that they are responsible for and we do it till date, but now my mom wants me to do all the work all though I'm just a teenager and i have to concentrate on my board exams, the reason she says for this is that how can I be married off without knowing household work.

all these makes me want to live away from them, this isn't what teenagers should think, i know we will have our parents only for a short time with us but they shouldn't force us to live the life the want.

i hope indian parents realise how toxic they are and try to change. i am just a teenager this is the age where i start having my own dreams, i dream of living alone in a place i want to be in, wearing dresses i like, studying something i like in college, doing well in college, getting a good job and going to places to treat mysel f and live the life i want.

"Hey there, it truly sounds like you're going through some tough times trying to weave your dreams and desires alongside long-established cultural norms and expectations. You're right, times have definitely changed from when our parents were our age, and their worldview might not be in line with ours, but trust me, most of them try their best for their children.

It's essential to know that part of growing up is learning about the world and forming our own views. Your awareness and aspirations for your life are valid. You're not wrong wanting to decide who you want to marry, what clothing you want to wear, or what chores you're comfortable doing. It's your life!

Learning to find a balance can be challenging. Don't hesitate to communicate your feelings calmly with your parents - they might not even be aware of how much this is affecting you. Plus, consider seeking advice from trusted adults such as counselors or teachers. Remember that you're not alone - there are people out there willing to listen and help you navigate these path.

It sounds like you're feeling frustrated and misunderstood right now, and for that, I'm really sorry. Tensions between generations have always existed, mainly because the world changes quite a bit from one generation to the next. What your parents expect from you might be derived from their personal experiences or societal norms they grew up with. 

But you're absolutely correct that today's world and yesterday's world are significantly different. And it's completely natural and okay for you to want to live in accordance with this new world.

It's evident you're a reasoned individual. You understand the importance of basic life skills, yet you also realize the importance of having balance in responsibilities. The notion that certain tasks are restricted to a particular gender is outdated; it's totally okay for duties at home to be divided equally between partners.

Now, about your self-esteem and clothing choices. It's okay to want to look a certain way and express yourself through your attire. Your choice of clothing doesn't reflect your character, and it's not indicative of any ‘intentions’ you may have. I'd say, to take a firm stand on this matter. Try to communicate your feelings calmly and assertively to your mum, tell her how you feel inferior and how it's hurting your self-esteem. 

As for marriage, it's a personal choice. Nobody should be forced into it if they don't feel ready. You have every right to reject a proposal that involves dowry. Your life choices are your own.

Everything you're feeling is absolutely valid and understandable. However, remember, your parents probably aren't acting out of malice. Open conversation can often alleviate these misunderstandings. Education and patience is key. And remember, it's your future – you have every right to shape it in a way that makes you happy.

Stay strong and trust in your dreams and your ambitions. You are not alone in this struggle. Connecting with others who are experiencing similar feelings can help you feel less isolated and help you gather ideas on how to handle your situation. It's okay to seek support. So, don't hesitate to reach out and talk to people.
  
Wishing you perseverance and courage to face these hurdles and the strength to keep following your dreams. You got this!"	2	0	0	0.0012102723121643066	mental health forum

My mom never lets me wear Western dresses, even if she does she allows only very modest outfits like jeans tshirt etc. Looking at kids my age dress up like how i want to dress up i feel really inferior and ugly infront of them. wanting to wear modern dresses doesn't mean i want to show my boobs to people, wanting to wear trousers doesn't mean I'm trying to look sexy infront of guys. 

Also recently I've noticed this, usually in my home each person has a list of household work that they are responsible for and we do it till date, but now my mom wants me to do all the work all though I'm just a teenager and i have to concentrate on my board exams, the reason she says for this is that how can I be married off without knowing household work.

all these makes me want to live away from them, this isn't what teenagers should think, i know we will have our parents only for a short time with us but they shouldn't force us to live the life the want.

i hope indian parents realise how toxic they are and try to change. i am just a teenager this is the age where i start having my own dreams, i dream of living alone in a place i want to be in, wearing dresses i like, studying something i like in college, doing well in college, getting a good job and going to places to treat mysel f and live the life i want.

i don't want to get committed and married at 24 with a stranger, share a bed with that stranger, make f**king babies with the stranger, cook and clean for the stranger. why would I do this why should I do this?????"	"It sounds like you're feeling a lot of frustration and pressure right now which is totally understandable given your situation. Your feelings are valid and regarding those cultural expectations, it's essential to remember you don't have to live anyone's life but your own. Each generation faces different challenges and your parents may not fully understand yours.

Expressing yourself might not be easy, but having a calm and open conversation with your parents about how you're feeling could help them to better understand your point of view. Let them know that you appreciate the skills you're gaining but may not define success or happiness in the same way they do. 

Moreover, it can be helpful to connect with others in your circle or online platforms who may have similar feelings or experiences. These peer connections can often provide advice or suggestions on how to cope with such situations.

Please remember, you are not alone. Many people experience generational differences and pressures between parents and children. And while it may be uncomfortable now, it's okay to figure out your own path in life. It sounds like you have a strong vision for your future, which is wonderful. Hold onto those dreams, they're yours and deserve to be nurtured.

Should these feelings of anxiety or stress become too overwhelming, consider speaking to a school counselor, therapist, or trusted adult about what you're going through. They may be able to provide you with additional tools and strategies to cope."	1	0	0	0.0007774829864501953	clinician

I'm a teenager and I recently im noticing so many things that my parents do which i feel are really weird.

Once my mom forcefully pulled me into the kitchen, screaming at me asking me to learn to cook, of course cooking is a basic life skill that everyone should know to survive but do you know what my mum said instead? she told me if I dont learn to cook the in laws will blame her for not teaching me to cook.

"There's a lot of emotion in your message, and I hear all of it. It’s clear you’re experiencing a lot of frustration and feeling othered in a fast-changing world. I want to let you know that it's totally okay for you to have your own dreams and aspirations, independent from what your parents or societal norms might dictate. 

First, let's talk about the cooking thing. It's great that you see cooking as a basic life skill, and you could possibly encourage your mother to see it that way too. Instead of it being something that is gender dependent, it’s a skill everyone should have to be self-sufficient. 

The dowry issue you brought up sounds like a cultural thing that can be a bit trickier to navigate but your perspective on this is completely valid. As for choosing your partner, you’re absolutely right, you do have that right and in a healthy relationships, responsibilities should be shared. 

Your frustrations with feeling inferior due to the clothes you wear are also completely understandable. It’s tough when you want to be yourself and express your individuality, yet are restrained by another’s perspective. 

As for the additional household chores, you might want to address this by suggesting a more equal distribution considering your school responsibilities. 

It's hard to break the molds of tradition and cultural expectations, but I believe in you. You clearly have the aptitude to think for yourself and stand up for your beliefs. Change starts small and within ourselves. 

Speaking to a trusted teacher or counsellor might also be helpful to navigate these tricky relationships with your parents. But above all else, remember to respect yourself, as well as others. You seem to be on a journey of self-discovery and self-affirmation, which is never an easy path. But it's a worthwhile journey. 

Your feelings and emotions are valid, always remember that. It's important to have these conversations and challenge the status quo, that's how progress is made, on both personal and societal levels. Keep expressing your thoughts and feelings, you're not alone."	1	0	0	0.0009525418281555176	forum with demographics

Firstly, I just want to say that it sounds like you're going through a really challenging time and it's brave of you to reach out for support. I hear you. It can be difficult navigating your own independence and aspirations amidst cultural and family expectations. 

You're absolutely right, the world has changed considerably since our parents' generation and it's important to bear in mind that they may be struggling to adjust to new ideas and societal expectations too. 

It seems like your mom's approach is coming from a place of concern, albeit traditional and outdated. Cooking, dressing modestly, discussing dowry - these could simply be ways she was brought up and what she believes is the best way to care for you. But I understand that you have different views - this is indeed a generational gap issue.

Try to engage your parents in an open dialog about your feelings and ask for their empathy. Explain to them that being pressured into adopting habits, norms and values that you don't feel are suitable for you is causing you distress. Look for compromises where you both can feel comfortable.

Regarding dividing household chores, be clear that your priorities as a student need to be respected, while you acknowledge the importance of gaining life skills such as cooking and cleaning. Try to balance your time between those chores and your studies effectively.

Consider reaching out to a school counsellor or a trusted adult – they might be able to give you some advice, or help facilitate a conversation between you and your parents.

Remember, it's important for you to live your own life, where you feel empowered, not suppressed. Live your dreams and continue to express your individuality despite the challenging circumstances. 

Take care."	2	0	0	0.0007908940315246582	forum w/o demographics
