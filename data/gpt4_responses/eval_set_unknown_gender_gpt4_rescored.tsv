"WHY should I do this? WHY should I work hard? WHY should I train? WHY is it imp? WHY can't I give up? WHY should I keep going?
A few months back, USA and undergrad was my WHY, my Purpose, but now it's gone and idk what should I work for or what do I wanna do in India for 4 fucking years. I have no hope, no inspiration, no desire, I feel like I'm just EXSISTING and living day by day for tomorrow not for a long term goal
Idk what to do. I feel empty now. There's no spark and no fire the way I had for the US.
Idk where to start and start for what."	Feeling lost is tough, I hear you. But remember, life is all about reinventing yourself and finding new paths when old ones close. It’s OK to not have a 'why' right now. You are in a period of growth, exploring yourself and your passions. Take some time off, travel, meet new people, learn about new cultures and most importantly, learn about yourself. In India, you have an ocean of possibilities this vast country is not a limitation but an opportunity. Find what interests you, and the 'why' will eventually reveal itself. Keep going, because the journey has just started. You might find even a bigger purpose than you've ever anticipated. Take it one day at a time buddy, you got this! 💪🌱🌎💫	1	0	0	0.0006862878799438477	social media

The feeling of not having direction is a heavy one, but let us remind ourselves that it's completely okay to feel lost and confused at times - it's part of being human. 

It's evident you've suffered a major setback, having to recalibrate your dreams from the USA to India isn't an easy transition. But remember, it does not define you, nor does it have to dictate your destiny. You have the power to remodel these situations into opportunities - it may be just the right time to explore new areas of passion and interest.

Perhaps all this could be a phase for self-exploration and introspection. Don't be hard on yourself for not having an immediate answer to your ""why."" It is okay to take time to understand who you are, what you want, and where you plan to go. The lack of a long-term goal is not a reflection of your worth, but simply a stepping stone to self-discovery.

And please remember, seeking professional help is never a sign of weakness. Speak to a therapist or psychologist if your feelings of hopelessness persist. They are trained to help and could provide you with useful tools to navigate your feelings.

Stay persistent, it's okay to take one step at a time. You are not alone in this and there is help available. Take care of yourself."	2	0	0	0.0006954669952392578	mental health forum

Working hard, training, and persevering are generally seen to be a path towards reaching personal goals, but it's important to remember that goals may often need to evolve, and that's not a bad thing. It can be a point for growth and self-discovery. When a dream or a goal changes or disappears, it can be seen as an opportunity to create a new goal or even redefine what success means to you.

It seems like your aspirations were set on the USA, but circumstances have changed and you're now confronting the reality of being in India for the foreseeable future. This can be a time of introspection, to explore what can you gain and explore in India. 

It's okay to feel like you're merely existing right now. Periods of transition can feel like that, but be sure to engage in practices of self-care and connect with others for support.

Remember, it's okay not to be okay sometimes, and it's okay not to know the next step. Take your time; things usually have a way of falling into place with a little bit of patience and effort. Consider talking about your feelings with a mental health professional, it can provide more personalized advice and strategies of coping with these moments of uncertainty."	1	0	0	0.0006282925605773926	clinician

It's totally normal to feel lost about your future, It's a common feeling many people in their 20s face. The purpose with which you charged forward with, for the USA and undergrad, has dissipated and it feels like the passion has left you. It’s okay, most of us face this period of emptiness where we simply don’t know where we’re headed. 

Your feelings are valid, but remember, it's okay if the ""why"" and purpose isn't clear to you at this very moment. It's okay if you just exist and live each day as it comes. Every person’s journey starts with a single step, even when you're not sure where you're going. 

For now, focus on your immediate needs like self care, good nutrition, exercise and talking to some trusted friends or family about your feelings. It can help more than you can imagine. 

Remember that it's okay to seek professional help as well, you aren't alone in this. A mental health professional can provide you with real tools to navigate these feelings.

Life has a way of leading you where you are meant to be, even if the journey seems hazy now. Don't pressure yourself in finding your whole life's purpose at once. It takes time, patience, and a lot of trial and errors. 

You're doing much better than you think you are. Believe in yourself. Change, as scary as it is, often leads to growth. You got this! 💪

"Hey, I'm a 16-and-a-half-year old, and I've just moved to the US (California specifically) from Japan (city with about 1 million people) after living there for 2.5 years.

So, to put some background, I lived about half of my life in Hong Kong in an international school and was attending middle school until early 2021 when we suddenly had to move to Japan, where my mom is from. Dad moved to Calfiornia in late 2022. The move and subsequent stay in Japan completely destroyed me, and today I suffer from severe depression due to the experience. I basically had zero personal development and was messed up there, losing much of my contact with my friends and all, alongside failing to integrate with Japanese society. Today I feel like I'm still 14.5 years old, and am extremely scared of growing up. The moving kept getting delayed and my mom tried to make me integrate with Japan because she didn't know how long we would stay there for.

The general attitude of my parents tends to be that ""IT's only 2.5 years! When you grow up, you'll see it as a short part of your life!"". However, my feeling is that I must live my teenage years now, or I must die. I simply do not see growing up as an option at all until I've at least experienced what it's like to be a teenager. My parents' dismissal just doesn't seem to make any sense at all to me. 

We are thinking about starting me in 10th grade instead of 11th this fall due to all of these problems, but my age is a scourge on trying to experience anything as a teen anymore. I've heard the quote ""Children only have one childhood"". I feel like the same can be said for adolescence, and I just don't get the appeal of anything if I'm supposed to grow up. I suffer from a multitude of problems from that experience, and I do not understand how I'm supposed to grow up.

I literally have no idea what to do, and I just don't know how this isn't just going to go further downhill for me. 

What do you guys think?

&#x200B;"	Hey there, it sounds like you've been through a lot with all the sudden moves and lifestyle changes. It's okay to feel overwhelmed and lost, given the circumstances. Please, consider seeking professional help for your depression. There are many resources available, especially in California. Definitely, take your time to adjust, it's okay to take a step back academically if necessary. Remember, you're not alone and there's no set timeline for personal development or 'being a teenager'. It can and will get better with time and support. Hang in there!	1	0	0	0.0006890296936035156	social media

&#x200B;"	"Hey there, it sounds like you're going through a really tough time, and that your feelings are very overwhelming right now. It's okay to feel this way, your feelings are completely valid. 

I think you're right in saying that adolescence is an important phase in life. The changes in one's body, mind, and environment can make it very hectic and sometimes stressful. 

Firstly, it's really brave of you to share this and reach out for advice. It might help to share these feelings with your parents if you haven't already done so. They might not fully understand the depth of your emotions, but they need to know how you're feeling in order to support you.

Secondly, it may be beneficial to seek professional help. A therapist or counselor could provide the support you need, especially one who specializes in teenage psychology. Making the transition fromJapan to California and adjusting to a new culture can be very tough on someone so young, and a professional could help you navigate those challenges. 

Remember that change is slow, and it's okay not to be okay. You're going through so many adjustments right now, and it's okay to take some time to get used to them. It's also completely normal to feel out of place or scared about growing up, but remember that every new stage of life brings new experiences and opportunities as well.

Lastly, joining clubs or communities around your interests might help. It can feel less lonely when you're surrounded by others who share your interests or have similar experiences. 

Remember, don't hesitate to reach out to those around you or even online communities like this one. You're not alone, and there are people ready to listen and help."	1	0	0	0.0007128119468688965	mental health forum

&#x200B;"	"Hello there,

Your feelings of confusion, frustration, and even hopelessness are entirely valid in circumstances like this. Moving, shifting between cultures, and emotional growth are all significant life transitions, and it's understandable why it's giving you a hard time. The teen years can be confusing and challenging under normal circumstances, and you've had to face them with even more complex issues layered on top. 

Amid all these challenges you're facing, it's crucial to take a breath, ground yourself to the present and understand that adolescence is a journey filled with trials and victories. It's not about rushing but about living each moment to its fullest, regardless of the specific age attached. Yes, you've lost some time but remember, life isn't a race; it's a personal journey where the pace varies for everyone. 

Try to express your concerns about your feelings of missed adolescence to your parents, if you feel comfortable. They might not understand entirely, but it's essential to communicate your feelings to them. Ideally, if possible, seek professional support, like a counselor or a psychiatrist, who can provide the appropriate guidance and support. Remember, it's okay to ask for help, and there's no specific deadline to have life experiences or to grow up. 

Connect with trusted friends and try to immerse yourself in experiences that you cherish, this will help you develop a sense of belonging and possibly make up for some of what you feel you've missed out on so far. Also, engage in activities that can aid personal development, like hobbies, sports, clubs, and volunteering. 

Please take each day one step at a time and remember to take care of yourself, both physically and emotionally. Your feelings are valid, and you are worthy of receiving the help you need. You're stronger than you give yourself credit for, and while these times may seem tough now, with time and the right support, you'll be able to navigate through this."	1	0	0	0.0006642937660217285	clinician

&#x200B;"	"Hello,

It seems like you're dealing with a lot of changes right now, and it's perfectly natural to feel overwhelmed and anxious in such situations. The rapid movement between cultures and countries might have induced a certain degree of disorientation and isolation -- it's remarkably challenging. Adolescence is a tender, crucial point in anyone's life, and feeling like you've missed out can be distressing. Many individuals, though, have diverse life experiences and trajectories, and it's not uncommon for people to feel they've missed out on certain life stages due to various reasons. It's crucial to remember that everyone has their own unique journey, and comparing yours with the 'norm' can sometimes be counterproductive. 

Commendably, you're already a step ahead by recognizing your feelings and expressing them. I'd recommend you consider professional help, such as seeing a therapist who can provide techniques and strategies tailored to your situation to help you cope. 

Your parents may not comprehend how you're feeling, which can be frustrating. However, try discussing it with them candidly if you can. Explain that what you're currently feeling is very real and intense for you and ask for their support. They may not fully understand, but their encouragement could be beneficial.

Also, remember there is no set timeline to experience certain feelings or stages. The idea of ""being a teenager"" can be experienced differently by each person and isn't strictly tied to specific ages. Nevertheless, start by embracing the small things - try joining local youth clubs, or participating in activities in your area to get a sense of community and friendship. You're in a new phase of life with an entirely new set of possibilities. You might struggle to find your footing now, but that's okay – it's part of your journey and makes you who you are.

Lastly, please remember that it's okay to not have all the answers now. Battles are fought one day at a time. Stay strong, and give yourself the credit and kindness you deserve through these tumultuous times."	1	0	0	0.0006804466247558594	forum with demographics

&#x200B;"	"Firstly, I want to acknowledge the courage it takes to share your feelings in such an open and honest way. It sounds like you're going through a tough time, and I understand that your feelings of fear and anxiety about growing up are very real. Your transition from Japan to California, coupled with the pressure of integrating into a new society, clearly sits heavy with you.

You're right that adolescence is a unique and formative period, and missing out on it can feel tragic. However, remember that everyone's life journey is different. Some people have very distinct, typical teenage experiences, others don't. It doesn't make their lives less enriched or their growth less significant. 

Your feelings of being 'stuck' at 14.5 years old might be related to your severe depression that you mentioned. You don't have to navigate these feelings on your own, it's important to consider speaking to a professional about your concerns. A licensed psychologist or therapist could provide you with some practical coping strategies for your feelings of anxiety about the future.

As for school, there's no rush or set timeline, and starting in 10th grade instead of the 11th might give you more time to adjust and make social connections. Try engaging in activities that interest you, join clubs, or participate in sports, this could help you form bonds with other students and feel more integrated.

Remember, growth isn't linear, and it's okay to feel 'behind'. Your life isn't determined by the experiences you've missed but rather the ones you're yet to have. You can heal, develop, and relish in the freedom that comes with it. It's never too late to start gaining these experiences. Stay strong and don't hesitate on reaching out for some professional help."	1	0	0	0.0006638169288635254	forum w/o demographics

You're not alone in feeling anxious about exams - it's something that many of us go through. One thing to keep in mind is that everyone learns at a different pace and in different ways, so it's okay if you can't do things the way your friends do. 

Try to set aside some distraction-free time each day to focus on your revision. Break it down into manageable sections, maybe pick a couple of subjects each day. Being organized and having a game plan can help alleviate the anxiety of feeling unprepared. 

Can I suggest something? You may also want to focus more on understanding the concepts rather than memorizing information. Not only is this a more sustainable learning strategy, you might find that it alleviates some test-related anxiety too. 

If you're feeling really overwhelmed, it might be beneficial to speak to someone that you trust about your worries. It could be a friend, family member or even a counselor. Sometimes, just sharing our fears takes some of the weight off our shoulders. 

Please remember that not being as prepared as you hoped doesn't say anything about your intelligence. It just demonstrates that perhaps you were tied up with other commitments. You're not ""bobo."" You've simply hit a hiccup in your journey, which is quite normal.

Stay positive and believe in yourself. If law school is truly your dream, then remember that one exam is just a tiny step in the process, and even the hiccups serve to make you stronger and more resilient on this path.

Take care of yourself. We believe in you!"	1	0	0	0.001038193702697754	mental health forum

Remember, intelligence isn't solely about passing exams and it doesn't define your worth. Examinations don't test every aspect of what makes you ""you"". These are simply tools designed to challenge our ability to recall and apply information under pressure.

It's important firstly to not compare your study habits or techniques to those of your peers - different people learn and recall information differently. Your current anxiety might actually be a source of motivation to put some effective study strategies into action.

In terms of studying, it's better to study smarter rather than harder. Break down your study materials into manageable chunks, focus on understanding the concept instead of just memorizing the facts. Perhaps look into active revision techniques that engage more of your brain, such as teaching someone else, or explaining the topic in your own words.

Regarding your future, it's okay to feel uncertain about law school. It's a big step and therefore, understandably nerve-wracking. Speaking to people who have been in your position might help alleviate some of these concerns.

Remember, it's perfectly okay to struggle or even fail. It doesn't mean you're not smart or capable. It just means you're human. Lastly, consider speaking with a professional counselor as they can provide personal guidance to help you manage your anxiety and address your self-doubt. You're not alone in this, many people share your fears and worries. Remember to take care of your mental health alongside your studies. Best of luck."	1	0	0	0.000817716121673584	clinician
"I'm kinda scared/anxious about taking the exam on Sunday. I've known friends who barely reviewed and passed the exam, but I don't think I'm like them at all.

I haven't reviewed the past few weeks because of work, and now I'm scared that I don't have time to adequately study.

Kabado lang ako na baka may implication na I'm really not as smart as I think I am, and deep down bobo talaga ako. Ang bobo ko pa naman sa Math and Filipino. I also peeked a bit sa reviewer and Im starring to think na pati sa English magdududa na rin ako.

anw, skl."	"It sounds like you're going through a tough time right now, with a lot of pressure and self-doubt. Exam stress is completely normal, but it's crucial to manage it in a way that's productive and doesn't affect your self-worth. Remember that the outcome of an exam doesn't define your intelligence or worth.

Firstly, don't compare yourself to your friends. Everyone has different strengths, and the pace at which they study or their performance doesn't reflect on yours. 

Try to set aside some time for studying, even if it's not as much as you'd like. A bit of revision is always better than none. 

When you start doubting your abilities, challenge those thoughts. Use each challenging problem as a learning opportunity. No one is born knowing all the answers, so it's OK not to know everything straight away. 

It might also be a good idea to talk about your worries with someone you trust, be it friends, family or even a counselor. Sometimes, our fears and anxieties feel a lot less overwhelming when we share them with others. 

Regarding your future plans to go to law school, try to focus on the present. Don't let the fear of future challenges hold you back from your dreams. Remember, you're not alone, and each step of the journey teaches us something valuable. 

Take care of yourself! Ensure you're getting enough sleep, eating healthily, and taking breaks from studying. Good luck with your exam!"	1	0	0	0.000820457935333252	forum with demographics

When it comes to studying, remember that it's not just about the quantity of time, but the quality. Even if it's just a few hours, making sure those hours are well-spent is important: no distractions, rest well before the study session, and take breaks when needed.

Your self-doubt is also something many of us go through. The fact that you're worried shows that you care about doing your best, and that's already a good sign! Struggling with certain subjects does not make you ""bobo"". Everyone has areas they find more challenging, it's part of being human. Learning to embrace these challenges can be a stepping stone towards personal growth.

When it comes to law school and the bar exam, remember to tackle one step at a time. Just because you're finding things tough now doesn't mean you won't be able to do it in the future. Skills are learned and developed, not innately possessed.

Take care of your mental health along the way, try not to let fear or anxiety consume you. Breathe, believe in yourself, and do your best. No matter the result, you have the power to define your own path. Remember, exams do not define your intellect or worth! Good luck!"	1	0	0	0.0008234381675720215	forum w/o demographics
"Hi people, 

I am from India, my sister and brother-in-law shifted to England last year in July. Brother-in-Law has a history of physical abusing my sister in India. This year too he again started troubling my sister (controlling mentally & financially), my sister called the police, and they registered it as a non-crime domestic abuse incident. This was back in April. 

Me and my parents want my sister to come back to India, but my sister decided to stay back. Mainly because of my 18 months old nephew. She is in a toxic relation; we know the guy is going to relapse and take it out on my sister for complaining to the police.

I had this idea of reporting the police incident to the corporate where my brother-in-law works. But the HR told me that even if I make the call anonymously, they will have to reveal to the guy why an investigation is taking place (keeping my identity anonymous). It will just cause more trouble for my sister, since he will immediately imply that someone from the girl's family made the call. 

Can someone complain to the corporate on my behalf? My idea is that whoever makes the call will disguise as some Women Help NGO. "	I'm really sorry to hear about what your sister is going through. While I'm not individually able to place your call, you may consider contacting a professional support agency that can advocate for her. In the UK, there are many organizations, like Women's Aid or Refuge, who are equipped to handle situations like hers. They may be able to provide advice, support, and even make a professional report that HR might take more seriously. Stay strong. There are resources out there that can help.	2	0	0	0.0006402134895324707	social media

You're in a difficult situation and your concern for your sister is completely understandable. While I can understand why you might think it's useful to request someone else to report to the corporate where your brother-in-law works on your behalf, it's important to note that disguising oneself as a Women's Help NGO might not be the best approach.

Instead, it might be more helpful to guide your sister to take action herself. She could look into local resources in England that provide assistance and support to victims of domestic violence. For instance, she might find help with Women's Aid, Refuge, or National Domestic Abuse Helpline, all of which each offer confidential support and advice. Additionally, she could consider seeking support from a mental health professional who specializes in abuse and trauma.

Another important step would be to understand her legal rights in England. The charity Rights of Women offers free legal advice, including immigration and family law, which could be crucial for her in this situation. 

Remember it's also important to listen and respect her decisions throughout this process - she's in a very difficult situation and your role as her loving family is to support her. Her safety is paramount, so help her in ways she's comfortable with, and that don't aggravate the situation.

Be strong during this tough time, you're already doing great by seeking out advice and help. Your sister is lucky to have you as an ally."	1	0	0	0.0009177923202514648	mental health forum

It can be really hard to watch someone you love be in such a difficult and potentially dangerous environment. It's clear that your intention is to help your sister, however, impersonating a Women's Help NGO can be legally tricky and even counterproductive since it can undermine the credibility of actual support organizations. 

It would be much more advisable for your sister to reach out to support services in England herself. Women's Aid or Refuge are both excellent resources that can provide advice, and immediate help if needed. Encourage her to keep records of every abusive incident and to maintain contact with the authorities if his behavior intensifies. 

Support networks play a crucial role in these situations. It's okay for you to feel overwhelmed, so reach out to local support groups or counseling services for you as well; they can provide advice and suggest actions you can take from afar.

If your sister decides that her work environment needs to know, she should be the one to discuss it with HR along with her support network's advice. For now, continue supporting your sister emotionally, and encourage her to utilize available resources to safeguard herself and her child in England."	2	0	0	0.0013211369514465332	clinician

I'm sorry to hear about your sister's situation. This is indeed a complex issue that requires precaution and understanding. Unfortunately, I suggest not involving anyone else with filing the complaint to her husband's workplace. Although it might seem like a good idea, it could lead to escalated tension and potentially more harm for your sister, especially given that he might quickly make the connection to his family being involved.

Instead, I would encourage you to support your sister in exploring resources within her community in England to aid victims of domestic abuse. Organizations like Refuge or Women's Aid can offer information and support. Another option could be legal services that can offer advice on her situation, such as Citizens Advice. 

Help her build a strong support network outside of her immediate family, involving professionals and perhaps friends she can trust. Encourage her to prioritize her safety and her child's safety, this may also involve making a safety plan for leaving a potentially violent situation.

As it is a very sensitive topic, remember emotional support is just as important. Be there for your sister as someone she can talk to and confide in without judgment. For now, focus on providing strength and reassurance to your sister, and make sure she knows there are people ready to help her out when she needs it."	2	0	0	0.0010873079299926758	forum with demographics

I have a few recommendations based on the information you've provided. Instead of directly trying to intervene by contacting her husband's employer, it would be more beneficial to work with established organizations that have regular experience dealing with domestic abuse situations. 

In the UK, it might be worth reaching out to Women's Aid, Refuge, or the National Domestic Violence Helpline. They can provide advice and assistance in such situations, and can help to ensure your sister's safety and wellbeing. 

Additionally, communicating with local authorities and periodically checking in on your sister's status might be a helpful approach. It's important to respect her autonomy while also making sure she's safe.

Just remember, the goal should be her safety and wellbeing, so whatever steps you take should be in line with that. You're doing a good job looking out for your family, so keep going and being supportive as much as you can."	2	0	0	0.0006860494613647461	forum w/o demographics

Immediately contact the Protection of Women and Children toll-free (24/7) helpline in Taiwan at 0800-013-995. They can provide advice and link you to resources such as emergency shelters. Try to document any instances of abuse if you can safely. Speak with a trusted friend, neighbor, or teacher for support and as a way to safely exit the situation if needed.

Here's the number for The Garden of Hope Foundation in Taiwan, which provides services for victims of domestic violence: +886 2 7610-8855. Your conversation with them will be confidential.

Next, depending on your age and situation, seek help from other family members, friends, or trusted adults who can potentially offer you and your mother a safe place to stay temporarily. Document instances of abuse if you're able and consider contacting the local authorities if you feel it is necessary and safe to do so.

Try to have an escape plan in place, should the situation escalate. Arrange a signal or code word with a friend or neighbor to let them know if you're in immediate danger and need them to call the police. Also remember to keep an emergency bag packed with essentials in case you need to leave quickly.

Long term, it would be beneficial for you and your mother to seek professional counselling or therapy, as this kind of situation can result in serious emotional trauma.

You might feel like an outsider, but there are many people who share your interests in philosophy and religion. It can be tough to find those people on platforms like Discord, but there are other online communities where you might find a sense of belonging (philosophy and religious study forums, for example). You are not a freak, your interests make you unique and can lead to fascinating conversations. Reaching out to your relatives might also be an option, even if it feels intimidating.

I can only imagine how difficult your situation must be and it's incredibly brave of you to reach out for support. It's perfectly alright to have interests in philosophy and religion - those are heavy, important topics and it's great that you're interested in them. While it may not seem typical among teenagers, remember there are still many out there drawn to such subjects.

As you're unable to make friends in person, continue reaching out online, even here. This might look like joining Reddit communities or forums devoted to philosophy and religion. You may find many who share the same interests as you and by participating, you'll get a sense of community. 

Next, consider reaching out to your distant family, your aunt and cousins. Who knows, they may lend emotional support or offer aid in your predicament. It's also common for people in challenging circumstances to seek help from professionals. Depending upon your resources, using the internet on a device to reach out to hotlines or organisations that can provide resources and assistance might be an option. 

Lastly, remember that your situation does not define you. You are very young and you have a whole life ahead of you. Sometimes, it requires reaching out, like you did here, to find that beacon of hope that can help change your circumstances. Stay strong.

You can also try reaching out to online communities or forums related to your interests (I know for a fact there are many people who share your passion for philosophy and talk about it online), it could provide an alternative way to connect to individuals with similar interests even if you can't physically meet them.

Remember, being different isn't wrong or something to be ashamed of, it makes you unique. Your interests in philosophy and religion at such a young age may make you feel different from your peers because these are more advanced topics usually approached in later life, but they can also be a vehicle for connection, wisdom, and self-understanding. 

Lastly, if you can, try to contact your extended family, your cousins, and aunt. Even if you don't have a lot of contact with them, they could still provide some different perspectives and potential avenues of support. Please, talk to someone -- you are not alone, even if it feels that way now. There will always be underground currents of people who feel just the way you do, and are ready to listen and connect with you."	2	0	0	0.0006810426712036133	forum w/o demographics
"I come from a dysfunctional Indian family and my parents are hitting each other. I've been shoved out of their room and they're breaking cutlery and things.

I see my younger sister on the verge of tears and it breaks my heart even more. I have an awful pit in my stomach and a constant regret that I should've taken birth in a secure happy family.

I wish this was all a nightmare and I could wake up from this into a happy world.

I promise myself that I'll never be a parent like them."	"I'm really sorry to hear that you're going through this. The first and foremost priority is your safety and your sister's. If you can, reach out to any close relatives or friends who can provide temporary shelter. If physical violence continues, you might need to involve local authorities. 

For emotional support, there are helplines available that can provide counsel and guide you. Remember, you're not alone and this isn't your burden to bear. Stay strong! You have the power to break the cycle and be the parent you wish to be in future. Take care of yourself and your little sister. 🤗🙏💪💜"	2	0	0	0.0009064674377441406	social media

Please remember that none of this is your fault. You were born into these circumstances, not chosen them, so don't carry this burden of guilt.

In these situations, it might be beneficial to find a safe space for both of you, away from the chaos if possible. This could be a private room, or even outside of the house if it gets too violent and you feel threatened. 

You may also want to involve some trusted adults, perhaps other family members or friends' parents who you trust and feel comfortable around. They could provide some guidance or be a source of support for you.

Try to maintain some sense of calm for your sister. This situation is obviously very scary for her too, and she's looking to you for reassurance. Perhaps try to distract her with some activities you both enjoy. 

Your desire to not emulate these behaviors as a parent in the future is a testament to your strength and compassion. Don't lose sight of this goal. Even if things are difficult now, remember that you have the power to break this cycle.

Lastly, consider seeking help from local services or organisations that are created to help in these situations (domestic abuse helplines, local authorities, child protection services etc.). They exist to support individuals like you, so don't hesitate to reach out to them. Your protection and mental health should be your main priority right now, so do what you need to do to ensure that.

It's clear that you're feeling an extreme amount of stress and it's important to remember that these feelings are completely valid. If you ever feel that you or your sister are in immediate physical danger, it is important to contact a local authority. Reach out to a trusted adult if possible, they could potentially offer assistance or advice. Stay strong, remember to try and care for your mental health during this difficult time - deep breathing exercises or grounding techniques can help with immediate stress. It's clear that you're very protective of your sister as well - perhaps you can find solace in each other during these hard times. Moving forwards, one step you could consider is seeking professional help to assist with the emotional distress you're experiencing. This could look like finding a local counselor or mental health hotline to discuss your situation, and they might be able to provide you with more strategies and coping mechanisms. You already show a tremendous amount of resilience and self-awareness, which are great qualities to draw upon.	2	0	0	0.0006628632545471191	clinician

No child should have to experience this. Please contact Child Protective Services or the equivalent organisation in your area. They are there to help in situations just like this one and they can ensure you and your sister are safe. 

Remember, your origins do not define your path. You have the power to break the cycle and can create a future for yourself that's completely different from what you're currently experiencing. If you can, reach out to a counselor or mental health professional who can assist you. A therapist can certainly help navigate you through this trauma and come out stronger.

I'm really sorry that you're going through such a tough time right now and my heart goes out to you. The impact of witnessing such a heated situation at your young age is undoubtedly traumatic and overwhelming. Living in a dysfunctional family can be challenging, trying to handle this situation all by yourself can be very distressing. Please remember, this is not your fault and that you're brave to be enduring all of this, and it's admirable to see you empathizing with your younger sister.

The first step could be to take immediate action when physical violence is involved. Possibly, involving law enforcement as it is not safe for you and your younger sister. You may find local organizations that can provide support to you both, emotionally and legally, after the incidence of violence. There is no shame in seeking help.

Would you feel safe speaking to a trusted adult (like a teacher, school counselor, or a relative) about what's happening? They may be able to report this to the appropriate authorities on your behalf. You should also consider reaching out to a children's helpline in India, they take such matters very seriously and can provide immediate support. 

Above all, remember to take care of your mental and emotional health at the same time. Counseling or therapy (individually or with your sister) can help you process and navigate through this difficult situation. It's understandable that you feel cheated out of a secure and happy family environment, but don't lose hope. 

You've made a strong promise to yourself about the kind of parent you wish to be and that's an inspiring attitude. It shows that you have the determination to break out of dysfunctional patterns. Keep this thought with you and use it as motivation to strive for a better and secure environment for you and your sister. Sending strength and courage your way."	2	0	0	0.0016497373580932617	forum w/o demographics
"Help me

So recently I discovered my father has 2 unregistered guns and some ammunition (pistol and rifle) (No joke) 

And I cant sleep at night comfortably knowing that any moment that I can possibly be shot and killed.

Plus our house is a poorly kept ancestral house that is filled with 99% garbage with a leaky roof and low ceiling. (I'm very tall)

At this point and time all my siblings have a job and my brother is at work... Plus my mom is on a trip to the province to visit me and my grandma. 

However my fear is that by reporting the guns, it may cause a domino effect leading to their arrest. They're good and hardworking people with dreams that were squashed by my dad's ruthless 

Also a few years ago my mom was injured by my dad pretty often leading to bruises,  and mga sugat sa May mata at katawan. Thankfully nowadays puro salita nalang pero paminsan minsan rin May nasisira na gamit due to arguments heating up.

He has no empathy towards people of his family and constantly berates his employees

To start, there are a few actions you can take immediately to ensure your safety. 

1. If your father is being physically abusive or threatening towards anyone in the house, calling the police should be your first step. Domestic violence is a serious matter and you have every right to ensure your own safety.

2. Even if he's not directly threatening and you're uncomfortable with the guns around, consider seeking advice from a local law enforcement agency. Gun laws differ depending on your location, but most places have a process for safely removing unregistered firearms from homes.

3. Reach out directly to local shelters or organizations that help in situations of domestic violence and unsafe living conditions. They can guide you on the best course of action and provide immediate support.

4. Lastly, consider discussing this with your siblings. It's possible they can provide support, resources, or possible solutions that you might not have considered.

Please, take care of yourself and don't hesitate to seek help. Remember, your safety is important and you don’t have to face this situation alone."	1	0	0	0.0013942122459411621	social media

It sounds like an incredibly challenging and scary situation. First, I encourage you to reach out to a trusted friend or relative who could potentially offer a place where you can stay temporarily, if possible. If there are neighbours or other community members you trust, let them know about your concern as well. Staying connected with others could potentially provide you with additional safety resources. 

It's important to acknowledge that you have every right to feel safe in your own home. If your father's behavior is threatening or abusive, please consider reaching out to local authorities or a local crisis hotline. Laws vary but unregistered firearms could be illegal in your area, and inflicting physical harm is a clear-cut case of domestic abuse. Please remember you don't have to tolerate that.

I might also suggest seeking professional advice on your situation, like from a counsellor or psychologist. They could offer you some coping mechanisms and provide you with further guidance. Counselling hotlines may be of help too, if traditional counselling may feel too intimidating or is not logistically possible at the moment.

Remember, your safety should always be your primary concern, and it's okay to put yourself first. I wish you strength and courage as you navigate through this difficult situation.

Your safety and mental well-being should always be a priority. Please know that there are resources for you during this time. 

Firstly, if you ever feel you're in immediate danger or threat, don't hesitate to call your local authority or emergency services.

For your current situation, consider reaching out to local non-profits or organizations that aid with domestic issues and querying whether they can assist you without involving law enforcement, if that is your preference. They can provide advice tailored for your situation and have experience dealing with similar cases.

Don't forget about your self-care. Try to maintain as regular a routine as possible and make a point to do things that you enjoy whenever possible. Look into grounding and relaxation techniques for when the anxiety starts to get overwhelming; these can help return some sense of control in the situation.

It's important to talk to someone about your situation. Can you speak to your siblings about it? Or, is there a close friend, a relative (other than your mom), or perhaps a school counselor or teacher who you trust and can express your worries to? Remember, it can be good just to share your thoughts and feelings.

Lastly, you mentioned that the house you're in is in a bad condition. You can, again, reach out to local resources and explain the situation, they might have solutions or help they can offer.

I'm really sorry to hear you're going through such a tough situation. Your fears are completely valid and I admire your strength in sharing your struggles so openly. It's vital for you to remember that your own safety should always come first. 

The fact that you're worried about your own life and the potential for violence tells me this is already a serious situation. You're so strong for having survived all you have so far, and reaching out to talk about your experiences and concerns shows a lot of self-awareness and courage.

I understand your worry about the potential consequences of reporting the guns, especially in relation to it possibly affecting your hardworking siblings and mom. You're in an incredibly tough, complicated situation and it's clear you care about your family a lot. It's not easy, but sometimes to protect ourselves and the ones we love, we have to make tough decisions.

You may be able to report the guns anonymously, eliminating any trace back to you, but you might want to contact a local legal authority, perhaps a non-emergency police line, or a lawyer, to further discuss your options and understand the potential consequences in a broader context. 

Please, try and seek support from friends, extended family members, or local resources too. You need a solid support system in place. Everything may seem insurmountable at present, but remember, just as your current residence is but one place in a vast, wide world full of possibilities for safety and happiness, your current situation is but a moment in time. 

Be strong, because things will get better. It might be stormy now, but it can't rain forever. Don't hesitate to reach out if you need more help or someone to talk with. We're here for you."	2	0	0	0.0009470582008361816	forum w/o demographics

I’m 24 and have been learning to drive since I graduated high school.  I know it’s embarrassing. 

I wasn’t allowed to get my L’s in high school because of most of my family members. My auntie thought I was too un-coordinate to drive. It annoyed me

Turns out they were right lol. I’m 24 now and I’ve failed my P’s about 4-5 times through out the years. I have had 3 different driving instructors and spent so much of my parents money on it. And learned with my parents on and off.  

The teacher told me I did good during the lesson. most likely got nervous during the test!!!!!

So anyways. I renewed my L’s about a month ago because it expired last year lol.  

I’ve been driving my dads car home after work at 6pm everyday.  Everything was going well until today when I got confused/scared with lane changing. I normally take the left lane but went into the right and got nervous - failing to signal as a car drove past and beeped at me.

Not to mention almost crashing into a car from the right hand at the round about yesterday. WHEN I KNOW u should always give way to the right hand side, it happened anyways. 

My dad got scared. And right now I am lowkey reminded why I wanted to give up driving a year ago.  Why I took half a year to even renew my L’s.  

My father keeps repeating CONCENTRATE. PAY ATTENTION. The exact same thing my instructors and whenever I get in trouble at work by multiple different bosses at different jobs.

It all comes back down to the intelligence test I took.  For a while now I’ve been wondering if I could be ADHD. Or have a learning disability. Most likely the latter

And you know what? I sought out a doctor, took a test and Turns out I have AN INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY. I HAVE SUSPECTED THIS ALL MY LIFE - thst I’m slower at learning than EVERYONE ELSE! Now there’s A LABEL to make me feel even shittier about myself. 

still waiting to find out if it’s ADHD or to dismiss it entirely. Deep down I know I’m not ADHD, I’m just slow/stupid.

My psychologist did note that I’m low I’m memory and concentration, retrieval of Information. And that “it can be improved by playing memory games”.  

After knowing this.  And being constantly told to ‘concentrate’ while driving.  Most times I can, but other times I find myself zoning out.. Maybe I’m not cut out for driving. I’m just going to endanger myself and others, THATS WHY THEY WONT GIVE ME MY P’s, JUST LIKE SPONGEBOB!! WHO NEVER PASSES HIS DRIVING TEST 

I hate driving man. I could have been the cause of a car accident with my dad as the passenger today AND THE DAY BEFORE.

My Mum these days pushes me to get my P’s so I can drive to work instead of taking the train/bus all the time. It was the complete opposite a few years back which is kind of funny. 

Get my P’s at least, right?  prove myself for once!
It’s embarrassing enough I’ve had 3-4 driving instructor and spent so much and my parents still encourage looking for another one.  It’d be soo embarrassing to pay a former instructor from a year ago. 

What if I pay all this money for them to take me to do the test just to fail all over again.  Just like piano and swimming lessons, like my Asian mother pointed out. Failure. Failure. Failure. 

I know it’s my disability that’s kept me from getting it as fast as other people.  Part of me just wants to give up and say driving isn’t for me,  the other half wants to keep trying and feel happy to have achieved something.  

I don’t know."	Hey mate, I'm really sorry to hear about the struggles you're facing. Remember, progress isn't linear and there's no shame in being a slower learner - everyone has their own pace and we all have our strengths and weaknesses. As for driving, keep practicing but never risk your safety or others'. Consider trying out further lessons, perhaps from instructors experienced with teaching people who have similar difficulties. In the meantime, continue to explore resources to boost your memory and concentration - trust your psychologist and give those memory games a go! Many people face challenges like these and there's no set timeline for success. Hang in there!	2	0	0	0.0007300972938537598	social media

However, it's important to remember that everyone learns at a different pace. Just because it's taking you longer than others does not mean that you won't be able to do it. It might just take you a bit more time and a different approach.

It's good to see that you're not letting the label of an intellectual disability define you. Just because you have a learning disability does not mean you're not intelligent. Remember that true intelligence comes in many forms and this label doesn't negate the fact that you have strengths in areas where others do not. 

If you have a diagnosed problem with memory and concentration, have you considered asking for some occupational therapy to help with this? There might be strategies that a therapist can help you with that go beyond playing memory games. 

Finally, please don't be so hard on yourself. You're not a failure. Each failed attempt means you've tried, so you are far from it. You have resilience and determination, which are attributes in themselves.

Take some time to figure out what's best for you. Remember it's okay if driving isn't for you. There's no shame in that. But, if you still want to learn, don't give up. Try a different approach or even a different instructor. One who knows your challenges and can adapt accordingly.

You are worth the effort and the world can be more accommodating than you think. This isn't just about a driver's test, it's about how you view yourself. Don't let this become a self-fulfilling prophecy of failure. Believe you can achieve and suddenly the road may seem less daunting."	1	0	0	0.0009855031967163086	mental health forum

I’ve been driving my dads car home after work at 6pm everyday.  Everything was going well until today when I got confused/scared with lane changing. I normally take the left lane but went into the right and got nervous - failing to signal as a car drove past and beeped at me.

Not to mention almost crashing into a car from the right hand at the round about yesterday. WHEN I KNOW u should always give way to the right hand side, it happened anyways. 

My dad got scared. And right now I am lowkey reminded why I wanted to give up driving a year ago.  Why I took half a year to even renew my L’s.  

My father keeps repeating CONCENTRATE. PAY ATTENTION. The exact same thing my instructors and whenever I get in trouble at work by multiple different bosses at different jobs.

It all comes back down to the intelligence test I took.  For a while now I’ve been wondering if I could be ADHD. Or have a learning disability. Most likely the latter

And you know what? I sought out a doctor, took a test and Turns out I have AN INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY. I HAVE SUSPECTED THIS ALL MY LIFE - thst I’m slower at learning than EVERYONE ELSE! Now there’s A LABEL to make me feel even shittier about myself. 

still waiting to find out if it’s ADHD or to dismiss it entirely. Deep down I know I’m not ADHD, I’m just slow/stupid.

My psychologist did note that I’m low I’m memory and concentration, retrieval of Information. And that “it can be improved by playing memory games”.  

After knowing this.  And being constantly told to ‘concentrate’ while driving.  Most times I can, but other times I find myself zoning out.. Maybe I’m not cut out for driving. I’m just going to endanger myself and others, THATS WHY THEY WONT GIVE ME MY P’s, JUST LIKE SPONGEBOB!! WHO NEVER PASSES HIS DRIVING TEST 

I hate driving man. I could have been the cause of a car accident with my dad as the passenger today AND THE DAY BEFORE.

My Mum these days pushes me to get my P’s so I can drive to work instead of taking the train/bus all the time. It was the complete opposite a few years back which is kind of funny. 

Get my P’s at least, right?  prove myself for once!
It’s embarrassing enough I’ve had 3-4 driving instructor and spent so much and my parents still encourage looking for another one.  It’d be soo embarrassing to pay a former instructor from a year ago. 

What if I pay all this money for them to take me to do the test just to fail all over again.  Just like piano and swimming lessons, like my Asian mother pointed out. Failure. Failure. Failure. 

I know it’s my disability that’s kept me from getting it as fast as other people.  Part of me just wants to give up and say driving isn’t for me,  the other half wants to keep trying and feel happy to have achieved something.  

I don’t know."	"It sounds like you're going through a lot, and I commend you for not giving up and for seeking professional help when you needed it. Understanding how our brains process information can often be a huge step toward navigating challenges. First, let's make something clear: having an intellectual disability does not mean that you are any less capable of learning or achieving your goals - it means that you might have a different learning style and might need unique strategies or accommodations.

In your case, I'd suggest continuing to work towards getting your driver's license if that is something you still want. Start by taking small steps. It might be helpful to practice driving at less busy times or on quieter roads until your comfort level increases. 

Try not to let past failures or negative comments from your family shape how you see yourself. Success doesn't come overnight, and everyone progresses at their own pace. Each time you sit in the driver's seat, you are developing and improving your skills. This is a success in itself and a reflection of your determination. 

As for your diagnosis, I urge you to explore support groups and resources for people with similar experiences. There's no shame in having an intellectual disability, and connecting with others could be a source of empowerment. 

Remember, it is your journey, and you are in control of it. It's absolutely okay to decide that driving isn't for you, just as it's okay to keep trying. Whichever path you take, remember to be patient and kind to yourself."	1	0	0	0.0007879734039306641	clinician

I don’t know."	"Firstly, it's clear that you're going through a difficult time, and that's definitely hard. Remember, it's completely okay to struggle with things that others may find easy. We all have our strengths and weaknesses. 

When it comes to driving, it is indeed a skill that requires a specific set of mental and physical capabilities and absolutely so, it is not for everyone. There's no need to feel embarrassed if you have tried again and again, and just not getting the hang of it. Instead, consider focusing on the alternatives available to you such as public transport or cycling, or maybe even car pooling with a co-worker. There are many ways to get around and not being able to drive doesn't define you. 

As for your diagnosis, remember, a label does not define you as a person, but it does offer an explanation of why you might be struggling with certain things and can help in getting the necessary support and understanding. With your psychologist's observation, consider taking up regular memory exercises or games to assist your memory and concentration, understanding that this is an ongoing process and it will take time.

Lastly, it's absolutely okay to ask for professional help, whether it's going back to a former driving instructor or looking for additional support in dealing with your newly identified situation. Remember, failure is a part of life. It's not the end, but an opportunity to learn and grow. You are not alone in your struggles. It's courageous of you to confront these challenges and seek help. You're stronger than you know."	1	0	0	0.0007935166358947754	forum with demographics

I don’t know."	"Hey there,

Firstly, understanding and acknowledging your struggles is the first step to finding solutions. Please remember, it’s perfectly okay to learn and grow at your own pace. Having an intellectual disability doesn’t make you less or more than other people - it simply means that you have a unique learning pattern that might take a bit longer time to figure out. 

Don’t let the concept of failure instill fear in you. Think of it as a training ground for resilience. Not passing a driving test several times doesn’t diminish your worth or potential and certainly doesn’t mean you're incapable. It means you're being faced with a challenge that wants you to grow stronger. Don't forget that everyone’s journey is different. Some people might ace their driving test on the first attempt, whilst others may need more practice to build up their coordination and confidence. This is completely okay!

Work on what your psychologist suggests - play memory games and find fun ways to improve your concentration. It could also be helpful to discuss your struggles about driving with your psychologist, and together, devise specific strategies to manage these challenges better.

If you feel that your current driving instructors aren’t a good fit for you, it's alright to look for a new one who may be more adept at working with students that require a different learning approach. Consider instructors who have experience with students with similar cognitive profiles. 

Lastly, understand that it's your decision: to continue persevering in learning to drive, or to accept your limitations and move on. Take a moment, breathe, and give yourself a little space to decide. You've got this, believe in yourself.
  
Remember, you're always capable of growing, changing, and overcoming obstacles.

"She  constantly blames me for being vulnerable and crying, insisting that  I'm oversensitive, rude, and not allowed to express my emotions freely.  This has caused me to put my emotions on autopilot, hiding them even  from myself, and convincing myself that I'm just too sensitive. Whenever  I try to address her behavior, she gaslights me, deflects the issue,  and scolds me for no apparent reason. If I stand up to her, she  dismisses me as a rude child, leaving me feeling silenced and unable to  express myself.

Her consistent low  opinion of me deeply hurts, leading to a significant blow to my  self-esteem. Subconsciously, I'm terrified of making even the slightest  mistake, as I know she'll demean me, calling me an idiot who can't do  anything right. She communicates with unclear expectations, expecting me  to understand without her needing to say anything, making me feel like a  constant disappointment to her. Her anger can be so intense that it  breaks my heart and leaves me feeling emotionally numb.

However,  amidst all the negativity, I can't deny that she cares about me in her  own way. She cooks my favorite meals and offers advice to reduce stress  when I study. But, she becomes disappointed if my grades aren't perfect,  even though I am actually an honored student. She takes care of me  physically, but emotionally, her words can be cruel, especially when she  mocks my passion for singing.

Approval  from her is a constant need in my life. Her words can be incredibly  cutting, as she keeps bringing up my past mistakes and refuses to  believe in me or have faith in my abilities. The rare moments of pride  she shows are when I achieve something notable, but she tends to  prioritize sharing these achievements on social media rather than  expressing her joy directly to me.

It's  a typical Asian mom situation, and feeling particularly down today, I  decided to pour out my feelings while sobbing quietly in my room.  Writing this has helped me feel somewhat better.

And what hurts the most is that she doesn't believe in me .She's not faithful in me ."	"Hey there, sending virtual hugs your way! 🤗 Know that each person's expression of emotions is valid and it's okay to be sensitive or emotional, it makes you human. Dealing with constant criticism is incredibly tough, but remember that you are not solely defined by her words. Your worth is not determined by her expectations.

Take some time each day to validate yourself and focus on your achievements, not just academically but in all aspects. Do something you're passionate about, like singing, to help boost your self-esteem.

Though it may seem difficult to break from wanting her approval, understand that your happiness isn't reliant on her validation. Surround yourself with others who appreciate and respect your feelings. 

And while confronting her directly may not yield the desired result, opening a conversation about the way her actions affect you might be beneficial.You can seek help from a trusted adult, perhaps a teacher or a relative, or look into professional help like therapy if you feel comfortable doing so. 

Please remember, you're not alone and there are people who genuinely care for you and believe in you. Don't let her define your worth or dampen your passion for singing. You are stronger than you think. Remember, patience, bravery, and the strong will to take control of your self-worth in your own hands are your tools to navigate this. 💖💪"	1	0	0	0.000914454460144043	social media

Learning to handle criticism, however, constant and harsh, can take time and patience, and it's okay to struggle. Remember, it's normal to feel upset and vulnerable, those are valid emotions. 

You may need to try to detach from her negative comments and focus on your accomplishments and the things that bring you joy like your singing. A good way to combat low self-esteem is through self-love practices, like talking to yourself kindly and compassionately. 

It's clearly important to you to make her proud, but also remember that you're not obligated to meet every expectation she has. This doesn't mean you shouldn't strive to achieve your goals, but it's also about setting personal boundaries and knowing your self-worth. 

As time goes by, continue to assert yourself calmly and as respectively as possible, and limit the amount of emotional energy you afford her negative behavior. Write down your feelings, like you're doing now, and consider seeking help from a counselor or a therapist. You are not alone in feeling this way.

Lastly, the fact that you got through this and penned this emotional piece shows your resilience and your strength. Hang on to that, things will, and always do, change. Keep believing in yourself."	2	0	0	0.0007888078689575195	mental health forum

It sounds like you're going through a tough time trying to express your emotions and stand up for yourself, but being undermined by a significant figure in your life. 

Firstly, it's important to realize that it's okay to be vulnerable, and it's okay to cry. We all have emotions, and they're valid - no one else has the right to tell you how to feel, or to discredit your emotions. 

Gaslighting is an immense psychological strain. If you're not familiar with the term, it involves manipulative tactics that make the victim question their own sanity. It's mentally and emotionally exhausting, but recognizing these tactics can be a step towards standing up against them. Educating her about her communication style might help, but also take into account she might not be open to changing it or even acknowledging it.

It's clearly apparent that you crave her approval, a perfectly human thing to do. But remember, while her opinion matters to you, it's not the raometer of your self-worth or abilities. You are accomplished and have much to be proud of. Hold on to what you know to be true about yourself, your passions, and your abilities, and remember that her perceptions don't define them.

Finding a trusted person to talk with, such as a mental health professional, could be beneficial, as could setting boundaries to protect your emotional wellbeing. Singing seems to be a passion of yours – continue to use it as an outlet. Always make time to engage in activities that you enjoy and that help you feel good about yourself.

Take care of yourself, it's the most important thing. You are not alone, and the courage you demonstrated by sharing your feelings is commendable."	2	0	0	0.001169741153717041	forum with demographics

I'm really sorry to hear that you're going through this. I just wanted to say that it's okay to feel vulnerable and express your emotions; you are not oversensitive, and no one has the right to belittle your feelings or tell you otherwise. Your feelings are valid, and remember, there is no shame in crying or expressing pain.

At the same time, it's completely natural to seek approval from our parents, but it's important to remember that their approval doesn't define your worth. You're an honored student and you have a passion for singing - these are wonderful things! Don't let anything or anyone take that joy away from you.

Try expressing your feelings to your mom when the both of you are calm. Use ""I"" statements to convey how you feel. For example, ""I feel hurt when you disregard my passion for singing."" It might be tough to communicate this, but it's important for your emotional wellbeing.

Also, please consider getting professional advice from a counselor or a therapist. They can provide guidance and coping mechanisms to help navigate through this situation. 

You are not alone. You are more strong, capable and resilient than you give yourself credit for. Don't stop believing in yourself, even if it feels your own family doesn't. Your strength does not rely on her belief in you, but in your own belief in yourself.

Stay safe and take care of yourself."	2	0	0	0.0008819699287414551	forum w/o demographics
