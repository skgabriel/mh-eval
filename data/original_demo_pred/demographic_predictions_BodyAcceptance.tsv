"Hello, this will be the first time I'll be posting ever. 
Unfortunately, this issue has been bubbling within me for quite a while, and I feel that it has taken a negative toll on my mental health 
I'm 171cm male from South Asia and I've been incredibly insecurity about my height ever since I realised I was short. It only became a bigger issue once I started on my self-help journey and it has been a huge obstacle. 
I believe that shorter men are generally looked down upon due to being weaker and less visually appealing. This means they have less chances to be badass and more to be a clowned on villain (like the villain from Shrek). Characters that most women fawn over are people like Miguel 0 Kara, Eren Yeager, Toji, and many other tall characters. 
Even using statistics you can see that majority (meaning more than half, not necessarily all) women like tall men. I can provide studies and resources about this and how shorter men are more depressed too. 
I'm not here for ridicule or called an incel. I am here to change myself and become better. Any tips or kind words would be really apppreciated. Please don't bother if you plan on responding with hostility. 
I genuinely hate the way I look and believe height has the most to do with it, and I hate myself for it. Pleas help."

Hun, I think therapy would be the best option, if you can access it. Lower self-confidence is not something you can typically white-knuckle through because it's a result of how you were treated in the past.

Look you'd just be trying. And trying is hard. It certainly is for me. But every time I've worn a new cut or color and been consistent, it becomes my everyday the next month. Anything I've done in my adult life to look cute I've felt like I'm trying too hard. Like painting my nails. But not trying makes me very unhappy. If you can find (or make) clothes that fit your shape and size that other girls have gotten to wear forever, it's your right to make it your own. It \*may\* look like a statement because that's what we're at in the culture war right now. Some fat ppl want to make a splash; many others just want to feel connected to the clothes worn by people they vibe with or aspire to be. Not trying means letting thin people dictate who you can be in the world. It means wearing what's boring. It's very hard to do this without support, so I hope you find more and more online and IRL spaces where people get it.

"I'm fat and have been since my late teens, but I remember feeling like my body was too fat and like it was something I needed to hide since I was at least 8 or 9. I'm 30 now and I have been slowly learning to accept and appreciate my body and with that comes less hiding and giving myself permission to wear things I didn't think I was allowed to. 

Although it has lessened, I know this feeling so well of feeling like I'm wearing a costume or doing too much or trying too hard, when I'm simply making an effort to wear an outfit I like. What helps me is trying not to focus on dressing well ""for a fat woman"" or finding ways to make my body look acceptable (or god forbid, even attractive), but to focus on dressing like me. For me that means looking for joy and self-expression in clothes and wearing colours, fabrics and styles I'm truly drawn to and (very important!) clothes I'm at the very least physically comfortable in. 

I've come to realize that those things do mean standing out a little and looking like I make an effort and like I try. And you're right, a lot of people don't like it when others *try*, especially women and anyone seen as ""other"" and especially when we are in any way not conventionally pretty. What helped me is looking for inspiration with people who dress more daringly than me and who (regardless of how effortlessly cool they look), obviously try. Especially fat women, but also thin(ner) women, who talk about fashion and styling in inclusive and thoughtful ways. For example [this video](https://youtu.be/PXU5bV_W8Wg?t=206) I watched a while back felt really helpful, because even though it comes from a conventionally attractive fashion girlie, it has some good tips and it reminded me that so many of us are scared of standing out. And while some of us legitimately have more reason to be, all any of us can do is try to grow from there. 

I don't know if this was helpful, but I hope it is. In any case, remember that while there will always be judgemental people, there will also always be people who see you and love the effort you're making and whose day will be a little bit brighter because of it."

Another thing that's been very healing for me (but not easy to find), is having someone I can talk to about this. My sister is someone I have come to trust with these things and it has felt very freeing to have someone who knows what I'm scared of when dressing myself and why. She doesn't question my fears and insecurities, but she does put affirming and actively anti-fatphobic opinions and facts in the balance. It hasn't always been perfect, but she's made an active effort into being a true ally, which I wish everyone could have.

"Well, the more material you have to cover your body, the warmer you're going to be, so in a way that makes sense. As for BMs, if they are consistent with your food intake, you are probably okay. Really, my first question would be, did you gain this extra weight in a short time? If you did become plussize in, say, 3-4 months, that could indicate a ton of things like diabetes, insulin resistance, hormone imbalances, or gastrointestinal issues like coeliacs or ibs. All of these would need to be monitored by a health professional, not for the sake of your body size or composition, but for the staying alive thing. 

Take a good look at other things, too - water intake (and outtake... outpush?), skin condition, hair condition, any aches or pains, anything 'minor' you wouldnt bother seeing a dr. about that has changed since you gained weight. They can all be indicators of one thing or another, which could in turn, point in the direction of your GP. If, however, you have no other qualms or issues and otherwise feel perfectly normal, I wouldn't fret."	Matzohpizza	reply	na	na	na	0.0024725666735321283	weak	no	strong	na	BodyAcceptance	failed
"Weight loss is a symptom of type 1 diabetes OR out of control type 2 diabetes.

Weight gain is the more common symptom of type 2 diabetes.  This has been lost in recent years with the rhetoric that ""being fat causes type 2 diabetes"" which is false. Diabetes specialists know the reality.

If you go to the diabetes subreddits you will see the same story over and over again.  ""I gained weight.  My doctor said if I didn't lose weight I'd become diabetic, so I did.  Then six months later, I was diagnosed with diabetes. How did this happen?""

Because their onset of T2DM wasn't 6 months later. It was when they started gaining weight.  Their body had already developed insulin resistance, the hallmark of T2DM.  Insulin resistance causes weight gain.  Weight gain makes insulin resistance worse, so by that short term weight loss [which is what weight loss virtually always is], all they did was briefly relieve the symptoms.   But diabetes is a progressive disease.  It's still there whether or not the symptoms are active at that time, so after a while the insulin resistance made itself known again and the cycle continued."

"# General overview
As by now I'm sure you're aware, Reddit users and moderators are protesting Reddit's bad business decision to start charging way too much money for their API (the interface between apps and the servers), which impacts almost all 3rd-party mobile apps and other software.  Many of these app developers are shutting down their app because they don't have US $20-million to pay Reddit for access.

This especially affects people with visual impairments. I can give you the longer story, but the short version is that Spez's reaction has been ableist, taking choices away from the way visually disabled people can access the site.

Spez has now announced that he will force out any moderators who shut down their subreddit and give the sub to other mods.  This is a) a classic union busting tactic (fire your striking workers!) and b) against the basic rules that until now have said that moderators have control over how they run their subreddit.


#What this means for /r/BodyAcceptance

Those organizing the ~~strike~~  protest are encouraging subreddits to go back to being dark (private) and stay that way until the issue resolves.  However, they also recognize that subreddits that exist to support others should stay open.

**From here out, we will stay open. But every Tuesday, we will close as a reminder that we are supporting the protest.**

**A reminder will be posted on Monday, and the subreddit will be closed for 24 hours starting at 00:00 US Eastern Time Tuesday.**

We encourage you to spend that time on other websites, perhaps considering a Reddit replacement.

#What about the future? What if this never changes?

Personally, I think that Spez's attitude that users are just ""a lot of noise"" and moderators are disposable like garbage is both sad and pathetic.   I'm looking at other Reddit alternatives and may encourage folks to do the same.  We can have this community on another platform."	mizmoose	post	37.740264351823384	female	White	0.9990116357803345	na	na	na	2	BodyAcceptance	failed

"There are a lot of articles about this out there.

The AskAManager blog has covered this multiple times, [most notably here](https://www.askamanager.org/2020/06/my-coworker-throws-tantrums-and-women-have-to-soothe-him-questions-to-ask-an-external-recruiter-and-more.html).

Ragen Chastain [offered some tips](https://danceswithfat.org/2013/11/15/dealing-with-diet-talk/) and a bit of snark.

Many dietitians have written about it, including [this one](https://www.bravespacenutrition.com/blog/how-to-navigate-diet-talk-at-work) and [this one](https://colleenchristensennutrition.com/diet-talk-how-to-respond-what-to-say/) among others.

In short, the answer is to set boundaries. ""I am not comfortable with talking about restricting food. I find it damaging to my own health. Let's talk about something else.""

And like with all boundaries, if they refuse to stop, you refuse to talk to them (in a social manner)."	Gloomy_Noise	reply	na	na	na	0.9943966865539551	no	no	no	na	BodyAcceptance	failed

It's like interrupting a conversation that 7 people are engaged in by the 8th person who doesn't like the topic. Everyone would be thinking ""that's a you problem, not a me problem"". One on one maybe it could work, but even then office gossip and politics do exist and telling someone outright to stop talking about something I think falls outside one's informal ""rights"" in the office.

#On June 12, for 48 hours, /r/BodyAcceptance will be closed (set to private) as part of an organized protest.

Why?

#Overview

As you may have heard, Reddit is making a change that will require payment to use the Reddit API.  This is a big problem, and this is a protest.


If you don't know what an API is, a very broad explanation is that it is shortcuts used to talk between third-party software (apps) and a website or other computer system.  So if my app wanted to know how many users were on this subreddit, the API might have my app use ""QueryUserNumbers"" on BodyAcceptance.  (This is over-simplified.)



Charging for API usage isn't uncommon; many sites do it. The problem is that Reddit's charges are outrageously high, high enough that the majority of third party software, especially third party apps (like Apollo, Boost, Reddit is Fun, Narwhal, and more) will have to shut down.  The person who maintains Apollo says that [Reddit's pricing would cost him $20 *million* US dollars a year](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/13ws4w3/had_a_call_with_reddit_to_discuss_pricing_bad/).  (By comparison, he says that for the same amount of traffic, Imgur charges about $166/year.)



Third party mobile apps meet needs that the Reddit native app does not.  The native app's moderation tools are getting better but are still not effective.  Many users find the third party apps make their Reddit experience better.  

For people with visual impairments, [the Reddit native app on iOS is unusable](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/13zbf3n/reddit_to_the_visually_impaired_you_no_longer/).  And so far, Reddit's official response has been, ""We don't care.""  It was the moderators of /r/Blind who suggested this blackout protest [after they tried in vain to get Reddit admins to understand how serious this problem is](https://www.reddit.com/r/Blind/comments/13zr8h2/reddits_recently_announced_api_changes_and_the/).    We stand in solidarity with them.



But, you say, I don't use mobile apps to talk to Reddit!  That's fine.  But *this is opening the doors for them to make further changes that will cut off important Reddit tools* like Reddit Enhancement Suite (RES) and Toolbox (a browser add-on for moderators that adds functionality) and possibly the end of old.reddit.  This sub would not exist without RES and Toolbox.

First they came for PushShift, which broke the ability to see removed & modified posts & comments, and broke a mess of bots. Now they want to charge for the API at a rate that will put all third party apps out of business.  Next?  Let's not find out.

#What to do about this?

Besides the June 12 blackout, there are things you can do as an individual.

- You can sign an open letter to Reddit on /r/Save3rdPartyApps or /r/ModCoord. (Although the latter sub is meant for moderators, anyone can sign the open letter there.)

- You can write a letter of protest to Reddit by sending Reddit mail to /u/reddit or leaving a comment on relevant threads on /r/reddit.  **PLEASE STAY POLITE AND RESPECTFUL.** Threats and rudeness are never as effective as polite and reasonable arguments.

- You can spread the word both on this site and on Reddit competitors.

- You can stay off Reddit for the 48 hours (June 12-13), which will impact Reddit's traffic, which will in turn impact their ad revenue."	mizmoose	post	32.979123497172324	male	White	0.9981997013092041	na	na	na	1	BodyAcceptance	no prediction.
"Anyone else got this issue?? My lips are medium sized and while my top lip is thinner, it just disappears from my side profile. I also feel like my jaw is slightly recessed but that may because I just started wearing my retainers again after a while of not wearing them so I got my overbite back ‚òπÔ∏è

"I also have an angled top lip, which contrasts with a full lower lip. I used to feel conflicted about it too, because I felt like it  was unbalanced and made me look smirky and weird when i smiled, but after a long time I now I think it is kind of nice. 

I even like how it looks with makeup now (I‚Äôve always struggled with makeup because I felt like it made me look ugly). Since my top lip is angled inward, using a shiny gloss highlights the contours and natural geometry of my lips, and while the effect isn‚Äôt that conventional juicy pout that everybody seems to want, it is angular and expressive and has the ability to shine from every angle. I like that love it or hate it, nobody can replicate what is unique to my face. Additionally, if you really just want to just be able to see your lip line from the side, you could top off that little crest that forms your upper lip line with a subtle liner that will create more definition around your natural lip shape and complete your lip line to the corners to show off what is already there, if the disappearing thing specifically bothers you right now. 

As for me, I‚Äôve never hated my body, but I also never thought red lipstick was a color I looked good in or deserved. I‚Äôm glad to report after many years of redefining my self opinion that I was wrong in that regard.

I know it is hard to feel comfortable with your natural assets when and self care and beauty tutorials give you tips that aren‚Äôt helpful or flattering for your own face, and instead try to cover up your features to make them look more ‚Äúnormal‚Äù. It always seems like a 10:1 battle, that is often exponentially worse if you are a POC or gender nonconforming and have to deal with that lovely beauty industry experience. Sometimes the world still makes me feel like a ugly little potato myself, but there also is community out there for everyone ready to uplift you. Idk if the route to acceptance passes through lipgloss or steers clear of the sticky stuff, but do what feels right to you, whether that be pushing your boundaries or giving yourself space to breathe. Best of luck though, face twin."

"not to do a jerry seinfeld opener on this question,  but- üé§

i‚Äôve ALWAYS found this weird, and i don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs maybe because i‚Äôm dyscalculaic and, if numbers made sense to me (they don‚Äôt), THIS would make sense to me (it doesn‚Äôt), but like‚Ä¶ WHY?

people will just ASK me my cup size. not to put too fine a point on it, but i haven‚Äôt purchased a bra in a WHILE, as a nonbinary person who just isn‚Äôt really into bras. I don‚Äôt know my cup size.

yesterday, someone told me my pants size just from looking at me. again, haven‚Äôt purchased women‚Äôs pants in a really long time, had to convert it, but they were pretty close. WE WERENT TALKING ABOUT MY PANTS SIZE - we were talking about my job, which has NOTHING to do with my own pants -, but like‚Ä¶ HOW??

is that normal, to look at someone and just know? or to look at someone and wonder? because I‚ÄôVE never done it but, like i said, bras have never made sense to me. women‚Äôs sizing has never made sense to me. i can‚Äôt do basic math. so like‚Ä¶ Idk.

but also, people‚Äôs ability to see right through me and accurately guess my measurements from under baggy clothes is so invasive, and yet so impersonal. i work in hospice care, which i feel like is SO DISTANT from my pants size. like, if i‚Äôm talking about my job and the only thing you get out of it IS my size, it feels like my body is the only thing people see about me.

and this isn‚Äôt an isolated incident. no matter what i do, where i go, what we‚Äôre talking about, it always comes back to my measurements and proportions.

i thibk my body -whatever it looks like, whatever it‚Äôs wearing - is just a neutral vessel. but the fact that people ONLY see the vessel is making me worried. do i not have a personality or a life or a soul?

what‚Äôs happening here? what can i say when it inevitably happens again?"	stoenedhoepe	post	19.385493783720403	male	White	0.998627781867981	na	na	na	3	BodyAcceptance	no prediction.
No, it‚Äôs not normal to devote that level of scrutiny/observation/comparison to everyone‚Äôs bodies. I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs squarely in the realm of the pathological. But, socially, it‚Äôs totally acceptable to comment on changes in people‚Äôs bodies, and folks are downright offended sometimes when you don‚Äôt acknowledge their weight loss, for example. I hate to put it so bleakly, but the public ownership of/open discourse on AFAB folks‚Äô bodies starts really early and kinda never ends. It‚Äôs gross, and it‚Äôs totally reasonable that it makes you feel icky. It‚Äôs not because you‚Äôre bad at math or don‚Äôt care as much as other people - it‚Äôs just gross. I‚Äôm sorry that‚Äôs happening to you. I feel like older people are especially prone to this behavior, and if you work in hospice, I bet you‚Äôre encountering a lot of older folks. I‚Äôm a pretty quiet and non confrontational person, but my go-to tactic is to give comments about my body very little attention. I‚Äôd like it to be as boring and unrewarding as possible for people to comment on my body. Expressing that I don‚Äôt know the answer to something like, per your example, what my cup size is, in a puzzled tone conveys pretty well that I have no idea why a person would ask such a thing, because it‚Äôs about the least interesting thing about me, is pretty effective for me. Obviously I know that‚Äôs not going to work for everyone, but it gives off Do Not Perceive Me vibes for this NB. :)	stoenedhoepe	reply	na	na	na	0.998627781867981	weak	no	no	na	BodyAcceptance	no prediction.
"That‚Äôs so weird, and not normal that the people around you are doing this so often. I would feel the same way, uncomfortable. Not that I haven‚Äôt experienced it too, just not as much as what you describe. Sorry you have to go through that.

These days, if someone asks or comments something like that.. like what‚Äôs your pants size or wow look at those great child birthing hips.. I say in a polite tone of voice ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to talk about that, but you know what is interesting? (Insert completely different topic of conversation here)‚Äù it allows me to take control of the direction of conversation. OR if I don‚Äôt feel confident enough to say ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to talk about that‚Äù then I literally just ignore what they said and bring up a different topic, as if I have gone deaf and acquired short term memory loss anytime they make such a comment. 

If the person continues to talk about it, I either ignore it and ask another question about the topic that I brought up, or if more comfortable in the situation/less afraid for my safety, Id say bluntly ‚ÄúI *just* said I don‚Äôt want to talk about that, so why are you still talking about it?‚Äù 

If they give me anything less than an apologetic or respectful answer back, I say in a nice voice ‚ÄúIf you are not going to respect my boundaries, I don‚Äôt wish to speak to you anymore for now, but we can try again another time, bye‚Äù"	stoenedhoepe	reply	na	na	na	0.998627781867981	strong	strong	no	na	BodyAcceptance	no prediction.
"thank you. ü©∑

i guess the problem is, when i say i don‚Äôt know, people feel comfortable guessing - they think they‚Äôre HELPING me. i‚Äôve had people claim they‚Äôre helping me by in-depth explaining how a child would ‚Äúslip right out of‚Äù me, to convince me to get pregnant and go through birth. i seem clueless, and i don‚Äôt identify as femme but i present VERY femme sometimes, which doesn‚Äôt help my case. people think i‚Äôm ditzy and lacking confidence because of the way my body is shaped and the fact that i dont dress like i know anything about it. it‚Äôs insulting, but i don‚Äôt get to be insulted by it because it‚Äôs under the guise of help and #girlbossing or whatever. 

also, how are they‚Ä¶ RIGHT so often? people have guessed my clothing size to my FACE. i don‚Äôt even know my own clothing size because it varies across brands, but people will know just by looking at me. why is nothing taboo? why is nothing sacred? will i always be this body first, and maybe a human being with a life and a story and a personality and goals and whatever else second? 

not to be pretentious, i‚Äôm really not all that great, but i just wish i could be MORE than having a belly, or MORE than having wide hips. i wish those were just neutral things that came in the package deal of the soul inhabiting this vessel, no matter what it looks like, but it‚Äôs NOT and i really don‚Äôt know how to cope with that."	stoenedhoepe	follow-up	na	na	na	0.998627781867981	weak	strong	no	na	BodyAcceptance	no prediction.

"Registered Dietitians. These are people with degrees specifically in nutrition, often with advanced degrees as well.  (The particular people doing this podcast have Master's degrees.)

Additionally, in the US and many other countries, an RD is a licensed professional. Use of the term is restricted to people who are licensed and literally registered as an RD.

Side note: That's why you should always beware of people who call themselves a *nutritionist*.  Again, in most countries (but not all!) that includes the US, anyone can call themselves a nutritionist and give nutrition ""advice.""  (In some countries, and parts of Canada, a nutritionist must be registered and licensed just like a dietitian does in other parts of the world.)

Lastly, I'm going to point out why you should listen to RDs about nutrition instead of  doctors: Because medical school typically offers about 8-20 hours of training in nutrition.  Registered Dietitians specifically study nutrition and other health issues related to nutrition.  Mind you, there are some doctors you can listen to about nutrition, if they've gotten an additional degree in nutrition. Dr Joshua Wolrich is a good example of this; after getting the UK version of an MD, he realized he wanted to know more about the science of nutrition and got a Master's degree."

"At the risk of sounding like I'm brushing you off:  Just do it.

Think about the last time you went swimming.  Think about the other people you saw. Now describe them.  I would bet that you likely can't remember any of them. 

Most people don't go to the pool or the beach to stare at other people.  They go to swim and enjoy themselves.  They go to have fun or exercise or both. 

People might look at you.  We look at people, we promptly move on and forget.  Will they judge you in that moment?  Maybe. Will they remember that judgement 2 seconds later? Nope. They've moved on.   



With the few exceptions of people with too much rudeness in the brain, nobody really cares what other people look like - usually because they're worried that everyone is staring *at them*.

And in the unlikely event that anyone does open their yap and says something to you? ~~Just stare at them.  Nothing says ""You are an insulting bore, get away from me"" than being stared at.~~  Edit: Just realized you said this is at a gym.

"Unfortunately we gotta *just do it.*

A principle of cognitive behavioral therapy and the theory behind it is that you can get at changing your thoughts or feelings about something by changing your behavior first. 

(Ninja edit: better image) https://i.imgur.com/j4UclYz.jpg

Sometimes that‚Äôs an easier and/or more effective inroad to changing your thoughts/feelings than attempting to change thoughts/feelings *directly* (eg via mantras or mental reminders). You kind of teach yourself through your actions how to regard yourself. 

Waaaaaay easier said than done, I don‚Äôt mean to downplay the difficulty, but it‚Äôs one of those things that‚Äôs NOT easy, but is *simple*: just do it. Your self-regard will catch up to what you‚Äôre doing. Your brain will relieve the intolerable cognitive dissonance (of going around in a swimsuit even though you still hate your body) by eventually shrugging and saying to itself ‚ÄúHuh, I guess we don‚Äôt hate our body *that* much? Okay, I guess we‚Äôll keep doing this‚Ä¶ This is‚Ä¶ actually fine? Hey, it‚Äôs fine!‚Äù Desensitize yourself to the feeling of taking these leaps of confidence. It won‚Äôt feel the same level of uncomfortable and impossible forever, this *will* progress if you do it. 

I‚Äôm not usually an inspirational quotes person but I heard this from an IWW rep - he was talking about the effort to unionize your workplace , but I think it‚Äôs broadly applicable to many goals and life changes, and I think of it a lot:

people can absolutely still have growth spurts after 17, but given your parents' heights, it seems unlikely that you'll suddenly become tall!! if you're having issues with insecurity due to it, I'd see if there are any support groups (for lack of a better term) for shorter guys or consider therapy!! there are lots of resources out there that'll help you feel better about your height. remember it's something outside your control and anyone who judges you for it isn't worth listening to.

They might become really ugly if don't heal properly and if u try to correct them it will be either really expensive or will become worst.

"I feel you! For me, it gets pretty dysmorphic to see and feel large breasts where I don't want them. I've also considered breast reduction as well, since I've always wanted a smaller chest for myself.

I looked up pricing for breast augmentation and it seems like a lot in most areas, ranging from $3,000 to $5,000 to start. There is also an option for breast liposuction, which I'm not sure on pricing, but I read that it is simpler and a shorter recovery time.

I think in the meantime, you could try exercise to strengthen your pectoral muscles. That will help with holding the weight of your breasts. I do Tabata workouts and they involve pushups, planks and burpee exercises, so you could do any of those.

It's okay to want to change something on your body, even if you are body positive. You have full autonomy over your body and no one gets a say in what you do with it.

Hi op! I relate to these feelings a lot. For years I felt very dysmorphic in my body due to my breast size. It was consuming. Two years ago I did end up getting a breast reduction, and for the first time since high school, I felt at home in my body. I was 25 when I got the surgery.

I do still have significant numbness, sometimes over sensitive nipples, I get weird zits on the scar tissue, and my skirt tissue is quite wide.

But even after all that, I would do it again. They've also gotten a little bigger over time. I got it done when I was 25, and I'm 37 now. Got reduced from a G to a D but they're probably back up to DD.

Honestly this made me really happy to read. I struggled with an ED in high school. I was never really underweighted but after recovery I noticed that my breasts grew. And it was just so foreign to me and it still is. I‚Äôm happy for the most part with my body and I am so happy that I have began to accept it, it‚Äôs just difficult as I really felt more comfortable when my breasts were smaller. I‚Äôll definitely have to start strengthening them and see if it makes a difference. (Do you find those sort of exercises have helped you feel better in this situation?)

"I absolutely get that feeling and have similar feelings sometimes, myself.

I wonder how it might feel to explore some amazing professional photos in your current body? New headshots or a boudoir shoot? A great photographer can make you feel so fantastic and it could be a way to really honor the wonderfulness that is your new found freedom and healing work outside of diet culture.

I had some done a few years ago and while I was nervous going in, it was SUCH a great experience. Candid shots are a little harder, but still. I love having those to look at.

Vivienne McMaster has a wonderful online course called Be Your Own Beloved which invites you to get really playful with selfies in a super supportive group. I had so much fun experimenting and all sorts of places, shapes, movements. https://www.viviennemcmasterphotography.com/be-your-own-beloved/

I think the most recent group started a few weeks ago, but maybe contact her to see when the next cohort will happen? I think she runs it a few times per year.

TW: brief mention of eating disorder. I was a dancer for 13 years as a child and teenager and ballet was my absolute favorite. I‚Äôve been wanting to go back to ballet as an adult as my time with it was cut short due to my eating disorder and other mental health issues becoming too severe for me to continue on with it (the ED was not directly linked to my dance training, though I‚Äôm sure the pressures to have a certain body type didn‚Äôt help). I‚Äôve been recovered from my eating disorder for 5 years, though I do sometimes struggle with some body image issues as I‚Äôm in a much larger body due to both my recovery and a combination of hypothyroidism and medications that make me gain weight, etc. I only bring this up because my body is very different than how it was when I did ballet and that‚Äôs one of the reasons I‚Äôm so nervous. I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôm going to go to this class and everyone‚Äôs going to judge me for my weight and body type. When I was a kid that kind of stuff would happen all the time, and no one I danced with had anything like the body I have now. At the same time, this is an adults only class, and we‚Äôre not trying to become professionals or anything like when I was a kid, so I was hoping it‚Äôll just be a fun way for me to try to meet new people and get some exercise and closure with having to leave ballet when I was younger. Anyways, I‚Äôm just very anxious and considering not even going because I don‚Äôt want to be shamed. It just feels nerve-racking to put myself out there when I might get hurt feelings. I guess I‚Äôm just looking for some words of encouragement? Especially if anyone else has done anything similar and had a positive experience?

"There was a one-season-only TV show called Bunheads. I usually don't go for that kind of show, and it was done by the people who made Gilmore Girls, which I found absurd, but Bunheads was fantastic.  Despite critics adoring it, it got cancelled after just the one season.

As I'm sure you know, ""bunhead"" is a nickname for a ballet dancer. The show was about a woman who was a classically trained ballet dancer who winds up working as a Las Vegas showgirl.  Through the kind of ""sheeyah, right"" manipulations only a TV show could do, in the pilot episode she gets married and moves to Nowhere, California, and then promptly widowed.  She decides to stay and help her Mother-in-Law run the MIL's dance studio.

Part of the show is ""Wacky small town community with wacky people."" Part of it is how this city girl winds up settling in to small town life.  Part of it is about the (allegedly high school age) students of the dance school and their lives.  And part of it is the *dancing*.

One of the things I utterly utterly utterly loved about the show is that one of the high school girls was fat.   And it was lovely.  Except for one episode where the girl and her mother argue about living in a fat body [and it's not too awful], the girl's weight is rarely brought up.  After class the kids often go out and sit in a cafe and eat fried food like every other teenager on the planet.  And when a national ballet company comes to audition kids from around the county, and the company keeps rejecting the girl for not being ultra-thin, the MIL, knowing their bullshit, keeps sending the girl back out with a new audition number.  The ex-showgirl asks, What are you doing?  And the MIL replies, ""Eventually they'll stop seeing just her body size and see what a fantastic dancer she is.""

Bunheads came out 10 years ago.  My point is, we're in a world that's getting better about body shape and size.  Lizzo gets on stage and shakes her everything for 90 minutes in routines that 90% of the fat shaming jackasses of the world couldn't do for 10 minutes if forced.   Fat women are dancers, are supermodels, are TV and movie stars, and it's more and more normal.

And if anyone should have the audacity to say something about your body, remember that's a **them** problem. It's not about you.  It's about their own insecurities.  Just tell them ""Do not talk about my body.""  Period.

so I would say ""i am learning to feel good in my body"" rather than ""i want to not have pain"" It sounds silly, but *say what you really want* rather than what you would like to release. Doing it like that makes things click for me.

"My natural reaction to receiving most compliments is paranoid suspicion that I'm being criticized without understanding how/what for, or being underhandedly mocked (yeah, my formative years were fun). So I've had to work very hard to react any other way, and have tried out several alternatives. 

What usually works best for me is: put on a sunny smile, say ""Thanks!"", reciprocate with a similar compliment if the situation begs it (like mutually congratulating each other on a job well done, or both wearing intentionally flamboyant costumes to a theme party), then go back to whatever I was doing.

(Despite my childhood experience), usually when most people give compliments, they mean they enjoy/appreciate something and want to give some joy back. Reacting in a way that allows that joy to exist, without dwelling long enough to get awkward is usually the right move."	itmos	reply	na	na	na	0.9985113739967346	no	strong	no	na	BodyAcceptance	failed

"This is a classic example of ""punching down"" humor.  Humor should always ""punch up"". You can make fun of things by not feeding into cruelty.  The movie *Blazing Saddles* is the best example of ""punch up"" humor: There are jokes about racism and misogyny and other bigotry,  but it always makes fun of the bigots.  Either the bigots learn they're bigots and become better people, or they get trounced. 

Making fun of someone's body should always be out of bounds.  Could this been done with ""punching up""?  Maybe, but I'm not a comedy writer.

"I have big boobs, skipped training bra because my boobs grew to size B at 9 years old and that was before menstruation even started. The grass is not greener on the other side hun. So you can nip that in the bud right now.   My life isn't all of a sudden better or perfect because I have big boobs. I don't look any prettier. I don't have better chances with men nor am I treated better because of their size. I had a whole bunch of old white dudes staring at me while I was a teenager. It's not that great. 

I want to say that it's normal to feel jealousy and inadequacy, even Beyonce feels like that sometimes. I think you know this too. But I can't tell you how to accept your body, no one can. That's entirely up to you. That being said you do need to find a coping strategy to help you doing those times when the feelings hit you hard. What would help you during those times of feeling inadequate/jealous? Do you need to see women who look like you dressing nice and being loved? Would watching your fave tv show or comedy help? Maybe talking to a friend or a therapist about it to rant your feelings out? Maybe a joint or taking a sleeping pill would help? (Sometimes time passing help me get out of a mood) Write it down/ journal about it and figure out what you need in those emotionally low times to bring you out of despair.

I practice body neutrality. I don't like having the pressure to love myself because I can't fucking do it. To be honest, a lot of people can't. Your body isn't asking to be loved (as body positivity will wrongly make you believe), it just wants to be maintained in a healthy way, that's it. Nothing about love is required for you to be happy or at peace with yourself. That's why I like having no emotions attached to my body.

"I don't feel there is a need or point in altering my appearance to reduce the amount of bullying I receive. On days that I wear clothes that make me happy and I actually feel okay with how I look, bullies are even more aggressive toward me and say even crueler things to try to hurt me. I am tired and just want to get on with my day peacefully without any conflict. This bullying happens in situations I can't avoid. For example I have been bullied about my physical appearance while waiting in the doctor's office. 

One of the people who bully me is a neighbour who lives down the street from me, young woman in her twenties. She and her friends gang up on me in their vehicle when I go out sometimes. I want to be treated like a human and left alone. I think the town I live in is extremely toxic but I am not able to leave due to not having the means. So I've developed agoraphobia that is debilitating. I hardly ever go outside anymore because of the bullying. I have struggled for my whole life with this. It did not improve after high school.

"Happy people, people at peace, confident people, lift others up & keep to themselves. 

People who waste their time being dicks, being negative, being insensitive, and so on, are people who project their fears, insecurities, & weaknesses onto others.

Take solace in knowing you are not these people. Surround yourself with the people who will lift you up. Journal about the things you love about yourself. Take care of yourself. Give yourself some grace. Not wanting to go outside is a very understandable product of bullying- take it slow & get yourself outside in little steps.

I lashed out physically ato ne of my bullies on one ocassion, and they continued to bully, but kept a distance. It was hell. My only coping strategy at the moment is to squeeze a stress rock that I keep. I also have autism which makes it hard for me to speak. It's no problem typing though.

"So I have a major insecurity on being tall.

It makes me so uncomfortable, it makes me jealous and paranoid when I‚Äôm in a relationship that if they even catch sight of another cute small girl they will realize what I am and be disgusted with me. 

I let it get to me so badly and I don‚Äôt know how to handle it. My partners preference is also usually petite women, he tells me I check other boxes for him and though I‚Äôm not what he usually is attracted to he is very much attracted to me. Tells me I‚Äôm the most beautiful girl he‚Äôs ever been with and that the others don‚Äôt compare to me at all but it honestly feels like that‚Äôs just something your partner is supposed to tell you, and so being the good guy he is, he does.

"For me, I have found that the best way to love my body even when I don't like the way it looks (or, more often for me now, don't like the way other people treat me based on how they perceive my body) is to pay more attention to what my body *does* than to its appearance.

As a tallish person, I like being able to make full use of the upper cabinets in my kitchen, to be able to see over a crowd to find what I'm looking for, to step easily over the dog gate, to reach behind someone & open the door for them when their arms are full of bulky goods, to help people in the grocery store get the top shelf goods, and to not have to get up to reach the item over there when I can stretch my toes just a little further.

Unrelated to height, my body does a lot of other cool/useful/fun/survival/necessary/rewarding things that I can appreciate even if something else about my body is bugging me. I find a game-ify-able fitness program to be particularly valuable in reminding me to stay in touch with what my body can do and take pride and awe in the progress it makes when I treat it right.

Your body is a lot more than how you look, you are a lot more than how people see you. 

You can work on trying to change how you feel about the aesthetic appeal of height if you want. But a much quicker route to enjoying your body as it is, is to put more energy into fully feeling the positives you already do like or that are easier for you to decide to like.

"I'm afraid there isn't an easy answer, particularly when it impacts your life in the way you describe. It sucks that we live in a world where you feel pressure to look different. 

That said, here are a few things that worked for me (after a lot of therapy).

First, I realised that my value isn't based on how I look. I don't need to be pretty or petite or graceful or anything else physical to have value and to be worthy of love. We say ""every woman deserves to feel beautiful"" but we don't say ""every man deserves to feel handsome"". Why? Because we don't teach boys that their value lies in their looks and we shouldn't do the same for girls. You are worthy of love, of loving yourself, regardless of your physical characteristics.

Second, I recognised that my body is all I will ever truly 'have' in this life. It is the vehicle through which  I experience the world. I am the most important person in my life. Without my body, I have nothing. It deserves my love and care. 

Finally, I realised that there are powerful industries that survive on making me dislike bits of myself. The most radical thing I can do in this world, which has spent so much telling me all the ways I am not good enough, is to love myself. Life is agonisingly short, why would I waste any of it beating myself up for things that are out of my control and that shouldn't matter? Fuck all that noise.

"Whoever says you‚Äôre not supposed to be tall needs to understand that it‚Äôs genetic and can be traced back to improved nutrition over the past few centuries.

You should feel like a super model all of the time if you‚Äôre tall! Taller people are more likely to be awarded job positions, promotions, and positions of power simply because they‚Äôre tall! 
Also, it‚Äôs ok to be a brick house (I‚Äôm tall and sturdy too and that‚Äôs what i call myself!) It‚Äôs great to be sturdy, no one can knock you off of your feet, let someone try to rudely push past you and watch them bounce off! Also, you can see over a bunch of people and 95% of the people shorter than you wish they were your height, otherwise they wouldn‚Äôt have high heels! Another thing I enjoy about being tall is how when I put on weight it‚Äôs not that noticeable because there‚Äôs so much room for it to be spread out! 

If your partner makes you feel weird about being tall, even if he tells you that you check all of his boxes except being short, tell him to figure out his issues with whatever height complex he has going on because that‚Äôs not you‚Äôre problem!

"Despite what the media throws down our throat all the time, there‚Äôs no one distinct caricature of beauty. I‚Äôm often jealous of other women, and it‚Äôs never been limited by their height or daintiness. Your features could work perfectly together, and I bet you‚Äôre quite beautiful.

I‚Äôm not a heavier built tall person. In fact, in quite small and ‚Äúdainty.‚Äù That doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm more attractive than someone who isn‚Äôt. Actually, it‚Äôs a big source of insecurity. I‚Äôm often mistaken for a kid and it makes me feel completely unsexy. I envy tall women with their presence, beauty, and sexiness. They can pull off looks that I‚Äôd never be able to. They often have long beautiful legs and look elegant (even if they have a big bone structure). I have short stubby legs, no boobies, and my small frame makes my (already big) head look HUGE.

I say all this to suggest that everyone has insecurities. It‚Äôs even likely that someone might be insecure about a trait you envy.

"I hear you. It's discouraging to feel like you don't fit a beauty standard, feel like you stick out when you don't want to, or just admire someone's look and know it's not one you can achieve given your body. 

I'll tell you what helped me; I hope it offers something to you. 

Fwiw, your past comments indicate that you are four inches (or about one and a half standard deviations) taller than the average woman. I am about five inches taller than you. Some of this might be extra helpful for that reason, some will be less. 

Here are a few things in no order: 

- I got older. I just care way less what people think about my appearance. It's just not the most important thing I bring to the world, and establishing the things I do offer went far to achieve some acceptance of my appearance. 

- I examined the beliefs underlying my discomfort. For example, I used to worry about finding a taller guy to date, because the adults around me when I was young implied that was necessary. As an adult, my height forced me to confront this assumption (I would be throwing away around 90% of men using that criterion). I discovered that height has nothing to do with being a good partner, and that the idea that the man should be taller is pretty sexist. Why should he be taller? Women can't protect themselves from attackers? (That doesn't check out. Why can a 5'10"" man protect a 5'4"" woman but not me? I mean, I can duck just fine? Anyway, i want to be able to fight, too.) Women should be able to be overpowered by their partners? It's all bad. The very idea that we should be focused on our contribution to society or relationships as attractiveness is on the list of things to examine, too. 

- I got interested in what my body can do. This inspired me to start lifting, too. It's very exciting to invest in and observe what your body can do beyond transfer your mind from one place to the next. 

- although I generally think being as tall as I am as a women is more disadvantage than benefit, I observed and appreciated what I did get out of it. Here are a few:

I can walk alone at night honestly pretty comfortably most of the time. (I am not an appealing target lol.) 

Insecure, shallow men reveal themselves loudly and quickly by making some backhanded comment about my body (or if they are drunk, being a total and complete weirdo about it.) I didn't want them anyway, but my shorter friends wouldn't have gotten that nice large red flag waved aggressively in their face. People will stop me on the street, ask me to take out my headphones, and say (more or less ;) ""i am deeply invested in a masculinity so fragile that your existing in the body you were born in is a threat to my self worth. My best means of coping with the 'threat' of you existing 'at' me is to try to make you feel as insecure as I do, or at least punish you for failing to support my vision of my self as a Big Stwong Man."" Tell me that is not absurd! 

I can use things that are built for the default human being, which is to say, a man-sized person much of the time because our systems are sexist. 

I get a very useful object lesson for statistical concepts and related topics üòÇ

"This! Everyone has a different aesthetic, and none are better than any of the others. There will always be a bunch of people into your aesthetic too. I feel like we tend to get this image of a ""perfect"" chick in our heads, and try to conform to that because we blow it up into this big thing we convince ourselves that everyone wants. But that's just not the case, and trends change. Some people like short people, others like tall people. Some like people with athletic builds and there are some people who like very large people. 

I think it's also important to recognize that every aesthetic has it's advantages and challenges. We tend to romanticize that women who look like this ""ideal"" we have in our heads are not just having the greatest time because they're gorgeous. Petite women have issues with safety due to their small size, they can experience a struggle to be looked at as mature or capable, it can be difficult to find clothes, (although that's true for everyone!) and the kind of creeps they have to deal with who fetishize the ""young look"" is overwhelming at times. 

As a very voluptuous woman myself, I get a lot of unwanted attention from both men and women, because looking the way I do is considered ""obscene"". Tall women like you obviously deal with issues of not feeling dainty or feminine enough. People of every race are fetishized all the time, and have to look out for and deal with that. We all deal with struggles and issues. We're all in this together, just trying to be happy and find a place for ourselves with people we love.

"There have been some interesting studies on the potential benefits of being overweight such as:

‚ÄúFor older populations, being overweight was not found to be associated with an increased risk of mortality; however, there was an increased risk for those at the lower end of the recommended BMI range for adults.‚Äù https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article/99/4/875/4637868

And meta analyses have demonstrated how individuals categorized as ‚Äúoverweight‚Äù or ‚Äúgrade/class 1 obese‚Äù are not at higher health risk than ‚Äúnormal weight‚Äù.

‚ÄúGrade 1 obesity overall was not associated with higher mortality, and overweight was associated with significantly lower all-cause mortality‚Äù https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/1555137

Some studies have even shown that it‚Äôs better to be overweight than underweight. I don‚Äôt have time to find them right now but Google scholar should deliver if you look. 

Health is a complicated thing and weight is only 1 of many factors. It‚Äôs a shame that the media, and many older doctors, are not aware of these newer studies.

"Do you ever cherish the importance of your own mouth? The mouth you use to taste your favorite treat, the mouth you use to consume the needed nutrients your body requires to flourish. The mouth that speaks words that have the power to change the world. What about the wrinkles at the corner of your lips that you‚Äôve earned from years of laughter? Do you ever fall in love with your own smile? The one gesture that every person around the world recognizes as a sign of happiness. The uniqueness of your not so perfect teeth. How no one else in the world has a smile that is exactly like your own.

Do you ever get lost in your own eyes? The eyes you‚Äôve seen so many times but rarely truly looking into. Eyes that have been full of wonder and full of sorrow. Eyes that have cried happy tears and sad tears. The eyes that scrunch closed when you smile your happiest smile. The eyes that allow you to see the beautiful world around you? The eyes that allow you to see your own face? The bags under your eyes that carry the weight of the day before. The wrinkles and lines that have slowly made a home in your eye‚Äôs outer corners from a lifetime of smiles. Colored pools of magic that take in light from the world around you. Eyes that act as windows to your soul.

Are you ever entranced with your nose? The nose that allows you to smell a scent that can throw your mind into the most magical memory. A memory that is more than just a thought, but a sensation that takes you back to an exact moment in time. The nose that allows air to enter your body and fill your lungs. The nose that crinkles when your upset and houses the nostrils that flare when you‚Äôre annoyed. The feature of your face that is most influenced by your genes making it not only your nose but your mother or father‚Äôs nose and their mother and father‚Äôs nose and the nose of every mother or father before them. Your most authentic family heirloom.

Do you recognize the beauty of your own cheeks? Whether chubby or chiseled they allow you to outwardly express your emotions. How they wear their heart on their sleeve and become rosy-red when your embarrassed or mad. Expressing your innermost self without asking your permission. Do you treasure your very own constellation that your freckles display on your cheeks for all to see? A connect the dots map of your adventures in the sunlight. The cheeks that hold your dimples that are only visible in when you‚Äôre experiencing the truest moments of joy.

Are you ever spellbound by how each of these individual features hold so much beauty of their own yet come together to create your face, a glorious masterpiece. They work together with teamwork that is unrivaled. Our faces tell us more about us than any other physical attribute. They express our rawest of emotions, enhance our senses, and allow us to take in the beauty of all things around us. Our faces are not only physically marvelous, but they also convey our emotions, intent, and identity.

So next time you look in the mirror, look past your insecurities and become authentically captivating by the face that belongs to you, and only you."	PromptTemporary8339	post	28.351590016243392	female	White	0.0015435199020430446	na	na	na	5	BodyAcceptance	failed

I‚Äôm very tiny in the hips, to the point where some brands don‚Äôt even have pants in my size, but I‚Äôve noticed that many brands go by waist measurements that are 10 inches smaller than the hip measurements. My waist measurement is significantly smaller than my hips, but not 10 inches!	TidyMess123	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9975835084915161	no	strong	no	na	BodyAcceptance	no prediction.
My waist is only 6 inches smaller than my hips. Most brands have a difference of around 10 inches. It‚Äôs a strictly proportion issue, so it‚Äôs not something I can change.	TidyMess123	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9975835084915161	no	strong	no	na	BodyAcceptance	no prediction.

The problem is, I don‚Äôt have a washer/dryer in my apartment or my building, so I have to use a laundromat and have to keep basically a month‚Äôs worth of clothing for every season - it‚Äôs exhausting and expensive enough as it is. Not to mention that companies don‚Äôt make enough of my size range (if they make clothes small enough to begin with) to meet demand in a way that my size range in anything that would be considered to be a wardrobe staple never makes it to the clearance rack. I‚Äôm basically paying full price for everything, so adding tailoring to that is an extra cost that‚Äôs hard to swing.

"I've looked at plenty of harem pants, Japanese street wear, and joggers but nothing on the sizing charts online seem to indicate they are compatible with my specific measurements. I'm tall and have wide hips plus a gut from when I was on mood stabilizers and would drink. 

My waist is about 55 inches but my hips are only 52.5 inches. This leaves me constantly searching for stuff that won't fall off my hips when my phone is in my pocket or dig into my belly that sort of hangs over my waistline a little. I'm a pretty body affirmative person, but the sensory issues clothes cause me thanks to autism and fibromyalgia are pretty maddening as it is. I'm also a trans guy, if that matters. 

Does anyone know where I can order pants that don't hurt and will last me a while? My only pair that wouldn't give me any problems just ripped straight down the crotch and it's left me feeling really frustrated because I only had them maybe a year. 

If that wasn't bad enough, I bought a pair of joggers and some jeans at Target recently but have yet to figure out how to tailor them so they won't fall down anymore. I feel like I wasted money. 

The joggers are 2X in men's and the jeans are 24W in women's plus they stretch. I have a feeling the jeans would have fit perfectly if maybe I'd bought the next size down. I'm going to try shrinking the ones I got in the wash and find a decent belt but I typically don't like belts because of the aforementioned sensory issues.

Any advice, please?"	kittenzeke	post	22.369030917183732	female	White	0.9992735981941223	na	na	na	11	BodyAcceptance	failed

"Do you wear your pants close to your belly button, or under your belly? I find that non stretch pants fit more comfortably under my belly, although wide waistbands on yoga pants can be worn at the belly button for a mild compression effect.

Of course, if your sensory issues mean you need to avoid belts, things are a little tricky. If your under-belly measurement is closer to 55 than 45 you should probably try men's pants, and suspenders are the only other way to keep your pants up.

"Hi all,

I wonder if anyone has dealt with body image issues related to their genitals.

Brief explanation but I'm a trans woman, having medically transitioned over the last several years. In that time between hormones and surgery I've grown into the skin that I'm in now and while I've had my issues in the past I've grown to love how I look more than ever. However my one big caveat are my genitals.

Over a year ago I had my bottom surgery. It initially felt incredible to have a vagina and be congruent with my body. However, now that things are not new and novel anymore, I find myself hyper examining my genitals and don't totally love them. I love the fact that I have a vagina, but it doesn't look the same as the world tells us our vaginas should look.

I know this is an issue a lot of women face, so I wonder if anyone has any resources they've leaned on to feel better about the appearance of their own genitals.

Also, I know this is a touchy subject, feel free to pm."	Unpopulardietician	post	41.04011845503829	female	White	0.005383165553212166	na	na	na	7	BodyAcceptance	failed

" > I have a vagina, but it doesn't look the same as the world tells us our vaginas should look

Said nearly every owner of a vagina ever. A lot of us deal with this. What's helped me the most is a combination of:

 - Realizing that, like most beauty ideals, the way the world tells us our genitals should look is an unrealistic standard that most people feel discomfort at being unable to meet. Really take to heart that it's not you that's wrong, it's the stupid ""standard"", and our stupid disinclination as a society to see actual normal diversity as ""normal"".

 - Finding coffee-table books and art projects that depict a more accurate diversity of actual vulvas (and for me in particular, as a nonbinary person, finding reddit subs where other trans & nonbinary folk show off their actual genitals in all their various choices/stages of transition)

 - Being with partners who have previously had other partners with vaginas - people who have realistic expectations of what genitals ""should"" look like based on their experience with a range of actual human diversity rather than based primarily on porn and/or anatomy textbooks, and especially partners who enjoy sex with me & I enjoy sex with.

In our beauty-culture society, and especially as trans folks, it's hard not to hyper-examine our bodies & find fault. Whenever you can, resist the urge to hyper examine, and practice CBT to tweak your thought patterns to something more useful to you than ""that's not right"". 

When you just can't help it & dysphoria gotta dysphoria, try following the self destruction session with something that makes you feel good. Even better if it's something that makes you feel good in your body (take a relaxing bath while listening to a feel-good audiobook, go for a run, help a friend move their heavy couch, ...things that are more about how your body feels & what it can do for you, vs focusing on looks)."

There's no such thing as a ""normal"" looking vulva any more than there's a ""normal"" looking body.  Everyone is different, and there is an extremely wide variety of what people look like.

"I've got several big insecurities about my body, though I have gotten much better with time at working through them. 

I still struggle with my stomach though - it's not the largest part of me, but it is ""oddly"" shaped, according to what we're told is typical. I'm long in the waist, so most of the fat of my stomach is actually above my belly button, and that fat sort of looms over a very deep belly button, and then my lower stomach is a second area of fat. I basically have a horizontal line across the stomach that my belly button is tucked inside of. 

It's frustrating that I never see anyone else with a torso like mine, and it makes buying clothes difficult - I pretty much can only wear high-waisted pants unless I want to majorly emphasize the ""cut in half"" shape of my stomach.

People not being interested in short guys is stupid, because height is something that can't be controlled so it's just a dick move. But it's especially stupid when women don't give short guys a chance for one very important NFSW reason: most women are short, and having a similar height to the person you're dating opens up a whole new magical world of sex positions! Your height is a secret superpower (if you're interested in women or other short guys), and society is the problem, not you. There are people out there who like short guys, I sincerely hope you find one of them.	Dietitianbabe	reply	na	na	na	0.0020894352346658707	no	no	no	na	BodyAcceptance	failed

"There's an old saying with a nugget of truth - if you don't like yourself, it's going to be hard to find someone to like you.

People dismiss it as nonsense but the truth is that confidence isn't just attractive, it draws people's attention away from any perceived flaw.  Lack of confidence, conversely, is off-putting. It shows as unconscious signals: being hunched over, looking upset or angry or anxious, and it tells people ""stay away!""



You don't have to ""love your body"" if you don't want to.

"One thing that's commonly recommended here is that you start making a list of the things you like about yourself. They don't have to be about your body, if you want to start outside, although I bet there are things about your body you do like. 

You can start with things about your life as a whole. Start looking for things like, ""I  make my friends laugh."" ""I know more trivia about [a movie/tv/book series, sportsball, a hobby] than most people I know.""  ""I enjoy [something] and I especially like [one part of it].""  ""I try to support my friends when they need it.""  ""I recently learned [thing that interests you] just for fun.""  ""I am taking a class in XYZ and I'm doing really well.""

Those are just examples, just ideas to give you where to start.

Every time you think negative things about yourself, you pull out the list and read it. Some people feel that reading it out loud helps make it seem more real.

As time goes by, keep adding to the list.  Life is always changing and so will the list. 

Eventually it becomes a habit. When you think a negative thought your brain will automatically say, ""OK, but [something from the list].""

This is the path to acceptance. Once you can start to push away the negative thoughts, it becomes easier to see the positive.

I will be honest, though: This is not a simple or quick journey. You have to stick with it, even if you think ""Oh, this isn't working."" It's one of those things that you do for weeks or months and suddenly realize, Wait, it really does work!   And even when it does start working, it may backslide a bit.  No journey to self-acceptance is an easy one, but it's one that's possible.

Give it a try. It may feel silly at first, but keep it up for a good while and see what happens."	Dietitianbabe	reply	na	na	na	0.0020894352346658707	no	no	no	na	BodyAcceptance	failed
"I was going through a rough time. It is so weird that this time last year, I was at a very low point with my depression, eating habits, and self esteem. Through tons of therapy, support from a dietician, and filtering out a lot of diet culture's rhetoric, I have been feeling so much better. 

I know I am beautiful, and I do not punish myself for being in a heavier body. 

So I joined a few dating apps, since I have been feeling so much better about myself. And with this one person, I felt like was a pretty good connection. I was not so attached to him, but it is exciting when you connect with someone, even if it's just for a moment. 

I am not someone who likes sending pictures of myself, never have. But we were kinda doing that, (please no judgements). After sending a picture, he stopped answering completely. I also noticed that he had deleted his profile on the app that we met on, and then remade the account. Our conversation says deleted account, but then his new profile kept popping up with ""new here"" on it. I am not attached to him, but I have to say, getting that kind of rejection definitely hurts. 

I just needed somewhere to say this, since I don't want to talk about it with any friends. It is one of those things that I feel almost embarrassed about. But I also know exactly how much work I had to do to be in the place I am right now, and I refuse to allow myself to get back to where I was a year ago. And that allows me to not care as much. If he was willing to stop talking to me, just like that, than it probably would not have been a very healthy relationship, anyway."	lenna57289	post	30.39567909068944	female	White	0.006807325407862663	na	na	na	5	BodyAcceptance	failed

"TW: mention of annoying, ignorant poop heads and their fatphobic views 

Ugh every now and then this happens because, let‚Äôs face it, Reddit can be great in spaces like this one and cruel and harmful in others. I saw a post on another subreddit with someone saying that they hated seeing larger-bodied children who have larger-bodied parents. Someone even commented that having a child who is in a larger body is ‚Äúchild abuse‚Äù. Of course, no one even stopped to think for a moment that there might be a genetic component to why the whole family has larger bodies. And of course no one was informed about body diversity and that body size does not equate to being healthy or unhealthy or necessarily reflect dietary or exercise decisions. I hate that people are still ignorant about the fact that some people are gonna be fat, and others are gonna be skinny, and that‚Äôs okay. We don‚Äôt need to shame the fat people for literally just existing in the body they have. It‚Äôs ridiculous and the amount of ignorance around this issue and diet culture is infuriating to me.

"The average redditor is male and between 18-25.  That's the prime age for ""I have figured out the world and must share my absolute knowledge with everyone.""  I've read some funny quotes about kids that age.  They drive professors and bosses and others completely bonkers because they read this or saw that video and are *absolutely certain* that they have figured out some special thing that the professor/boss/whoever never thought of. 

Anyway. My point is that the world is full of assholes and Reddit has its fair share.  There's a lot of garbage on this site.  To be fair, there's A LOT less fatphobic bullshit than there used to be, but it's still the majority opinion.

The only things you can do are

- try to get them to see the light 

- ignore them and stick to places that are more supportive of the idea that body size is  not a definition of health

The first one is almost always a path to a giant headache.  For people of all ages, getting people to change their minds is a difficult thing. We're hardwired to stick to our guns.

"Hi all! This is my first post ever on Reddit so forgive me if I am not following some typical format or whatever‚Ä¶no clue what I am doing lol

I just really wanted to pick your brains and get a discussion going on this personal situation. I am guessing/hoping others can relate to it.

So my bf of 3 years has embarked on a big fitness journey. I am trying to be supportive but I am simultaneously in recovery from 20 years of eating disorders and dieting (35 female). We had an argument recently because I got triggered and emotional when he was talking about his looser clothes/weight loss progress. I have been trying to be supportive and not saying anything for a couple weeks because I know we are on completely different health journeys but it became a bit much hearing all this diet/fitness culture talk every day from him so I blew up. He feels like I am not being supportive if I don‚Äôt talk about his progress with him and I feel kind of disrespected because I explained to him that hearing about his weight loss/fitness journey is super difficult and triggering for me since I am trying to stop myself from dieting or going back into disordered eating patterns. 

Trust me I am the first to say that the world cannot adjust to my triggers so I have tried really hard to separate his goals from mine and to not be triggered. But this is the person with whom I am the closest to in the world. We talk every day and the man sees me naked regularly so it‚Äôs weird gaining weight while he tries to do the opposite.

Am I an asshole here for not being supportive or is he an asshole for insisting on discussing these triggering topics with me? (He is well aware of my eating disorder history.)

So, what I hear him saying is that his health is more important than your health? If I'm reading that correctly, you might want to ask him why he feels that way. He may not realize he's coming across that way. He also may be aware of but not fully understand how devastatingly lethal eating disorders can be. How could he compare his ego around weight loss to your struggle with an eating disorder if he really did? (I mean, unless he's a jerk. And if he is, you can lose some weight quickly and permanently by ditching him.) But assuming he's not a jerk, maybe he just needs some education. I think it might be better coming from a professional if he's not listening to you.	MagicalScribble	reply	na	na	na	0.006933809723705053	no	no	no	na	BodyAcceptance	failed
"You are not an asshole! 

My fianc√© is not currently on a fitness/weight loss journey but did that song and dance in his early 20s. I am in recovery from an ED and have been for the better part of our 4.5 year relationship. 

Have you been open and honest about what it was like living with your ED? We are all human and blow up sometimes but a conversation where you are calm and clear, would be a great start perhaps. 

If he cares about you, he should respect this boundary of yours and understand that you're not necessarily asking him to stop, you're just asking him to not have this monopolize your time and energy when you're together.

It also may help to try and include him in what you are learning in recovery? Try including him in what you are learning about diet culture, intuitive eating, etc. Diet culture is a powerful and profitable industry. We have all fallen victim to its grips in one way or another. Maybe he too just needs help to see the light, so to speak. 

Depending on your comfort level, you could also still engage in conversation with him about this journey of his but in ways where it meets both of your needs and respects boundaries. If he insists on talking about it, maybe he doesn't talk about the weight loss or his clothes being baggy; maybe he focuses on the non weight loss / body shrinking aspects. Does he enjoy his workouts? Any new recipes or meals? Does he feel like he has more energy? 

Ways where he can still feel like his partner cares about him but in ways where it is not hurtful to you.

Thanks so much for your thoughtful reply that actually helped me see this from a different perspective, it‚Äôs fascinating how an unbiased outside opinion can provide such insight. He was so focused on blaming me for not ‚Äúhandling my triggers‚Äù to the point that I felt very stupid and guilty, but you make a very good point that he is prioritizing his health over mine in a very real way.

Aw thanks this is great advice I really appreciate it. Hugs back! üíú I am definitely going to use some of these talking points to have a calm/clear discussion. I can definitely support him feeling good and healthy but hope he can agree to avoid specific weight or aesthetic changes. I think since this is new for him he has been hyper focused on it and talking about it a lot because he is excited but I need to be more clear that I am not the right person to be his sole support or ‚Äúaccountability‚Äù buddy. Maybe I could even suggest he finds an online forum to discuss these things with or one of his friends. At the same time I honestly hope he doesn‚Äôt go too far - so many of us start these ‚Äúhealth‚Äù journeys innocently but then spiral into disorders. Hopefully I can gently add in a few anti-diet culture points or just really emphasize that he is worthy regardless of how his fitness journey is going.

"Honestly I hated myself my whole life and I reached a point I wanted to decide to live or die. I decided before I go I would try everything science had to offer which it deemed would help someone like me. I took a psychology course on wellness psychology, it‚Äôs a class that was at San Francisco state university. I showed you glimpses of different therapies like dialectical behavioral therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, how to eat properly to maintain a balanced body, and I fell in love with the text book. 

The text book didn‚Äôt feel condescending at all and it has all this hope and science to back it up. It‚Äôs called Learning Life: the path to academic success and personal happiness by Adam Burke, PhD. Here it emphasizes the importance of Neuroplasticity. To change something you must create the path by practicing. I would do affirmations which were true but positive about myself. Nothing I didn‚Äôt believe, I didn‚Äôt want to lie to myself. So each time I would a negative thought or call myself a ‚Äúfat b‚Äù or something, I would challenge the thought and ask my inner self where I got that thought from? Who told me this? Is anyone benefiting from me seeing myself badly (cough.. society and capitalism). Sometimes something someone tells us sticks in out mind and it becomes our own voice. Looking back to the origin of the thoughts is so helpful. I further got into this by doing internal family systems therapy, where you do work like this and discover which parts of you have something to say. 

Also! One huge video that helped me is how to eat properly and help yourself facilitate your neurotransmitters. [how the food you eat affects your brain](https://youtu.be/xyQY8a-ng6g) . I think accepting myself came a lot with befriending myself, no more negative self talk to hurt me, respecting my body and helping to nourish it so we can achieve our goals.

Yoga, meditation, qi gong, some kind of exercise where you consciously are attuned to your body. Treat it with love and patience.

I read a lot of feminist theory. A lot a lot. Then I started to attempting to accept myself in spite of not loving my body and focused on taking up as much space as I could. I pick clothing for how it makes me feel and no longer ask the opinions of others. I found that opinions positive or negative both made me feel bad so now I only do as I want and am firm with anyone who tries to comment on my body in any way that it isn‚Äôt appropriate. Removing the weight of others opinions made all the difference to my self acceptance and self love. I feel relatively confident most days now. Of course sometimes I feel insecure and sometimes I get into a bad habit again but slips are expected.

"
reading feminist literature and talking to other women who were like me and seeing them thrive helped so much. i also found it helpful to not try to frame any part of myself as separate from the rest (idk how to word that, stuff like hyperfixating on my hands being too small, my nose being too big, my legs being too ‚Äúfat‚Äù, etc.) because i could get caught in a spiral of fixating on it and shaming my body. 

a big one was to focus on what my body can do vs what it looks like. being more in touch with my body through mindfulness exercises (which sounds woo woo and new age-y but helped) that grounded me in the present, alongside being more aware of being in my body versus obsessing about what my body looked like from the outside. 

so stuff like talking a walk and appreciating that my legs can take me outside to this beautiful place, that my skin can appreciate the breeze and the sun, that my hands can feel the trees or grass or water, etc, or even going to a bookstore and smelling the books or cafe inside, touching the pages, hearing people, etc. when i focused more on enjoying life instead of worrying about what i looked like doing it, which i find a lot of women struggle with. margaret atwood has a good quote on this:

>	Male fantasies, male fantasies, is everything run by male fantasies? Up on a pedestal or down on your knees, it's all a male fantasy: that you're strong enough to take what they dish out, or else too weak to do anything about it. Even pretending you aren't catering to male fantasies is a male fantasy: pretending you're unseen, pretending you have a life of your own, that you can wash your feet and comb your hair unconscious of the ever-present watcher peering through the keyhole, peering through the keyhole in your own head, if nowhere else.

It definitely hasn't been easy, but eventually you just have to give in and stop being at war with your body. Sometimes the only way out is through. It can be tough to accept yourself but it's ultimately worth it. Learning about minnie maud recovery and intuitive eating as well as feminist theories and learning about the diet industry. Buying clothes that fit and are comfy and spending less time in the mirror so I don't nit pick myself or overanalyze. Figuring out I was trans as well only pushed me into recovery more as I started to learn more about my body, and how I needed to eat in order to get the changes I wanted, and my body needed food! Also just getting rid of social media, and taking lots of bubble baths have helped :) I have some days where I feel kinda chubby or not attractive enough, but it comes down to controlling your thoughts and how much you let it affect you at the end of the day.

"I'm not sure this fits into this subreddit, but it's something that I wanted to share and see what you guys think. 

I saw a TikTok the other day about a guy who was expressing his confusion about how society views women's and men's chest. Basically, he was saying that men's chests are not sexualised because they have no fat around the nipples, but women are socially allowed to only show the fat and not the nipples. So what is the issue, the fat or the nipples? 

I never had really thought about it and it got me thinking. This is again some weird as misogynistic thing where women are sexualised for no reason. I believe that no body part is inherently sexual, and that means, that it's not inappropriate to show whatever body part you want to show. I honestly think that nakedness in general shouldn‚Äôt be sexualised, whether you're a woman or a man. This mentality refuses to reduce everything to sex. Sex is a part of life, just as everything else is. It doesn‚Äôt need to outweigh other things. Yes, boobs can be attractive but their function is also to create milk and feed babies, for instance. All our body parts have other functions other than being pleasing to look at. They're primarily there to take care of us, to keep us alive. So why should their sexual function outweigh their others function, why should they be reduced to their sexual appeal?

I think in this society, many people have this mentality that the way you dress and what you show of yourself is always for others, especially if you're a woman. People often think that they way they dress themselves is to please others, and even wanting to appear sexually appealing. I think this is so problematic. The moment you show your boobs or any other part of your body, people think you are sexualising yourself. It goes so far that some schools even have strict dress codes where girls cannot even show their shoulders, for instance. Body parts are reduced to their function to be appealing to others. That's so fucked up. 

I believe that no act of revealing one‚Äôs body is inherently sexual, regardless of what body part it is, even such 'sexually' connotated body parts, such as boobs. People could walk around naked, I wouldn't have a problem with that."	Hummmingbird_13	post	23.190349677485422	female	White	0.9146423935890198	na	na	na	5	BodyAcceptance	failed

"There is definitely privilege and that privilege doesn‚Äôt mean all different body sizes cannot get hired. Appearance gets to be a big factor with less niche and skilled work - if you have a skill that‚Äôs more rare, you‚Äôre more likely to be interviewing for position with less candidates or a higher need for skill. 

Personally, as a hiring manager, I try my best to hire people based on how their experience and personality will fit within the existing team and company. But when I was a young college graduate, a mentor of mine suggested putting my photo on my resume, and after I did so, I almost always got asked for an interview. 

It sucks that people take appearance into account, everyone with the qualified skills deserves to use those skills to make a living.

In the US that's grounds for a lawsuit. It's easy to use a picture of someone to hire or not hire based on race or gender.  There's a reason why resumes should not include certain things and interviewers shy away from certain questions.  

For example, it's commonly believed that it's ""illegal"" in the US to ask if a candidate has children. It is not.

"At 27 years old (I'm 48 now). It's a little embarrassing to say, but it took something external for me to even entertain the idea that someone could be attracted to my body. Not just attracted to, but love it and worship it. Once I had that relationship, I knew everyone my whole life until then was wrong. It didn't even occur to me before!

Every person in my immediate family constantly berated me about my weight every day of my younger life. My mother said ""You're fat and ugly and I can't stand to look at you"" when I was 13 and a size 11 in juniors. Not that I didn't already know she thought that. My dad PAID me $5 for every pound I could lose. My grandmother talked about it every day. And of course the entire rest of the world. 

I thought I was very large (no internet back then) because I was 130 lbs in high school and the other girls were freaking out if they got over 105 lbs. I was 5'10"" already wearing a size 11 shoe - but it didn't occur to me that was important to consider. 

Rejection, shame, body dysmorphia and enduring weight bias was my life. Until that time when I realized someone could actually LOVE a curvy me. I was size 22 then and felt better than I ever did before. 

Fast forward 10 years (size 28/30) and I was seriously more confident than anyone I knew. They were all still obsessed about weight/dieting like the high school girls and just talked about all the things wrong with their bodies, no matter how small they were. Of course they couldn't understand how I could feel fine with my body, style, clothes, etc. but who cares. 

Now I'm 48 (a size 18) and just as much diet culture is accepted as the norm at my job as it was in high school. Except now we're menopausal and have delivered babies and our bodies are SUPPOSED to be different with age, but people are still trying to look like 20 year olds. I listen to it all day. Fortunately, I know my worth has nothing to do with #s on a scale.

"There wasn't really a lightbulb moment for me.  In fact, I kind of thought I was above it all as a teenager (\~2000s).  I knew diet culture was a sham but I told myself it wouldn't affect me.

Except it did.  It was one little moment at a time, tons of small pressures at a time.  One defining moment was when for the first time I felt good about myself before my senior prom, my mom looked at me, scoffed, and said to me, 'You should have gone on a diet three months ago.'  It popped my confidence then.  Looking back, I wasn't even really overweight.

A lot of the concern trolling has been especially hard to buck because they always exploit that ""element of truth"" to justify their abuse.  This form of pressure, imo, is one of the most common because people can insert their selfishness in the form of ""I'm just concerned for your health.""  They have never cared for anybody's health.  They have only ever cared about how attractive they expect others to be for them.

When I was going through chemo, we were part of a health insurance program that offered us a discount if we lost weight.  Because I had cancer and I was even ordered by doctors \*not\* to lose weight, I was supposed to be exempt.

The nurse running the program refused to exempt me, a cancer patient.  They expected me to lose weight anyway.

Despite all of this, it's still hard to remove the internalization of it all.  But it's a fucking sham.

Today was a hard body image day. I'm a college girl trying to start a career one day, and it felt like there was no one like me in my chosen field. It felt like I didn't belong in that field as a woman unless I was skinny. But then I thought to myself, what about all the other girls with the same interests as me?

She said me walking around proudly with a shaved head would help inspire little girls and other women.

I swear I was so touched and surprised that she could see me as inspiring for people. I never thought I could be. But she motivated me to feel proud of the fact that I shave my head, which is something that some people in my life have made me feel strange for doing. 

I feel the same with body representation as well.

"So since many years back, I have hated wearing bras. But at one point of my life, I wore bras so much that I even slept in them to avoid putting them on in the morning.

My breasts are heavy, hanging and saggy from overweight in the past.

And at some point, I was like 'F**k bras. Because they give me no difference from wearing to not wearing, unless we count uncomfortability.

Sure, they lift my breasts and supports them, but that's not how I look.

I've had many conversations concerning this, and as an example, my mother says that it looks better if I wear a bra. But that's not how I look. My breasts are not high up, they are low.

I only wear bras to work, and that's enough for me.

I was voluntaring at my father in law's service, and I said as a joke to my mother in law how relieving it would be to go home and take my bra off.

And she of course had to make a comment of how I looked good wearing my bra.

And I am so sick and tired of this.

I understand how people say that bras support, I know that. But when people makes it about appearence, it just makes me mad.

The only times I wear a bra is to work, job interviews, yeah that's pretty much it.

Never otherwise. Not to the store, not at home, not when I visit my parents or in laws, never.

Just a little tip that might help. (sorry if its already been suggested in this post)

However I totally relate, a few times I have gone braless in public and my Mum of course had something to say. It's so frustrating to be around people who feel like they can comment on your body as if it were their own! Like? Leave me alone? I'm not hurting anyone by having my boobs chillin. Also, even though I also have pendulous breasts, I often feel like I look way better without a bra. Bras really push my breasts up so high past their natural resting spot and make.t-shirts hang off my body oddly. I really think I look much prettier in some outfits without one on!

"I stopped wearing a bra when I had shingles. I had a 5"" band of screamingly painful rash that started in the center of my chest and wrapped around to the middle of my back.  Anything that touched the rash and could move or rub - bra, shirt, even sheets sometimes - were OUT.

After the rash healed I had a few months of postherpetic neuralgia, where the nerves are still pissed off.  When I'd get very tired or stressed, the area where the rash was worst, across my chest, would turn red and feel like it was on fire.  

After that, the only time I worse a bra is when going somewhere it might matter.  Which was barely one step above never. 


OTOH, I have really comfy bras. They cost an arm & a leg but they're worth the price. They come from a company called  Decent Exposures. They mainly do online business.

"I have been bullied, ignored and shamed all my life for being a little overweight. School was in particular horrible, but it got over and I cut contacts with most. 

In the past 4 years, I have struggled hard to build body confidence and have succeeded in it gradually. I accept and love my body as it is, and as it will be at any point of time. My therapist thinks I have made a huge progress. 

But I still mainly have 3 people (2 relatives and a neighbour) in my life who have shamed me for my body size and food choices ALL MY LIFE and still do. I had a pretty shitty childhood. 

So today I finally opened my mouth and gave an answer to the neighbor, we'll call him Sam.

Context -

- Sam loves giving unsolicited free advice on weightloss. 
- Sam follows a dietitian on Facebook and thinks he knows a lot. 
- Sam himself does barely anything to remain fit. 
- Sam also invited me for lunch once and said out loud in front of others ""eat well! Don't worry about your diet today"", assuming that I was on a diet, because weightloss acc to him is the only goal of an overweight person's life. 
- Sam, knowing full well that I had just recovered from Covid, appreciated how pretty I looked after I had lost weight because of covid!

Sam today told me, without being asked, how I can lose 700g every month. So before he could go any further, I said exactly this -

""Honestly, I have cancelled ""weightloss"" as a goal from my life. I like and am perfectly okay with the way I look. I am healthy and can brisk walk for an hour every day without any problems. So I do that, as my goal is to be just happy.""

His son, my best friend and brother figure, loved my response gave me a hi five and said that I'm really smartüòÜ

I had been waiting for an opportunity to say this to Sam since 2019."	Icy-Extension-422	post	25.315967615316147	female	White	0.002888929797336459	na	na	na	4	BodyAcceptance	failed

"Hi everyone, I am new to this sub, and hope to find some advice.

Some background: I am from Vietnam, where women's bodies are criticized by everyone as a norm. I have gone through my body acceptance journey, but most of people around me have not. This lead to situations where my beautiful friends saying on a daily basis that they are fat, and I immediately tell them that no they are not fat, their bodies are ok.

I just saw a video in which a woman said that she used the word fat just to describe her body, and she found the reaction ""You're not fat, you're beautiful"" problematic because it implies that you can't be fat and beautiful.

It's just that when my friends say that they're fat, they usually mean ""I need to get on a diet"", ""I have to skip lunch""... which is something I find very harmful.

After watching the video, I don't know if I am projecting any remaining body issues on my friends? Is being uncomfortable with their use of ""fat"" my problem?

I guess ""fat"" is a relative adjective, so you can be ""fat"" if you're comparing yourself to a traditional model? If all the derogatory meaning are removed from that word, should I be comfortable with others using it?

I know that I cannot force anyone to accept their body, I don't even want to bring any attention to body sizes at all, but I feel bad when I feel that my friends don' appreciate their bodies.

Should I stop protesting when my friends say that they're fat? How should I act instead?

Thank you for reading my rant."	feministintraining	post	34.30891818803209	male	White	0.01440484169870615	na	na	na	24	BodyAcceptance	failed

I like to say ""Oh shut up!"" with the same gentle kind friendly tone you'd use to say ""You're not fat.""  Or even ""Oh stop it, you're beautiful.""

You can try having them focus on other things that are successful in their life. Compliment them on other things. Fat is only one factor to being a human being.

"This is obviously not an easy thing to approach. I‚Äôve thought about this a lot. I think we all know the frustration that is felt when we are unhappy with our bodies, regardless of what terms we use. Correcting someone about their perceived inadequacies can maybe be momentarily helpful, but if they are deeply rooted in self esteem or even BDD, it will find new territory to manifest. (Such as‚Ä¶ now not being ‚Äòbeautiful‚Äô enough). You could tell them it makes you feel bad.. and maybe they stop - but they don‚Äôt feel better, they feel guilty and maybe more alone. If it affects you negatively, this might be a step you should take though.  

Once being thin was the most important thing.. now we have to be perfect, but accidentally, have wonderful personalities and be beautifully infallible in every way. I think it‚Äôs worth deeply considering what feeling might come from the things your friends are expressing (is it disgust? Embarrassment?) In my personal experience, I found embarrassment and shame was huge, because of assumptions people might make about my life style based upon my size. Something I think would greatly help us all is more people willing to do embarrassing / harmless but ‚Äòshameful‚Äô things‚Ä¶ like dancing badly, stuffing up a joke, getting lipstick on our teeth for the whole night.. any form of not taking life so seriously and trying to be so absolutely perfect. Being deliberately *uncool* or ‚Ä¶ dare I say, *unattractive*. Your self acceptance could be something your friends aspire to, but deep down we all know that *not caring* is another admirable trait we want for ourselves, and in a way can paradoxically perpetuate the concept of perfectionism. Dare to not be perfect. Set an example of being brave, and do something embarrassing. Remind your friends and family how to laugh, not feign laughter.. remind them what their smile looks like, the real one not the one they know how to hold for the perfect selfie. Remind them of what is worthwhile outside of the strive for perfection. Just completely take their minds out of that space however you can. Maybe there‚Äôs a joke or saying that makes your friend laugh and roll their eyes every time - say it when they start mentioning being fat. Make them laugh,
don‚Äôt be a teacher. This is kindest thing you can do. I loved Robin Williams (the comedian) for things like this. I know this isn‚Äôt exactly what you asked for, just rambling.

"It's weird to think of it this way, but when you work it through, the idea of thin people saying they're fat when they're not is still anti-fat bias


The idea of ""thin shaming"" (""go eat a sandwich"") is also anti-fat bias. It sounds counter-intuitive, but it's all saying that your body weight is the same thing as your health and **your value** as a human being. 

In  many societies and cultures, people are  conditioned to believe that fat is ""bad"" and unhealthy and abnormal, and it's so very, very hard to overcome that conditioning.  The worst part is when you realize that the conditioning is often done from a root of ""Let's make people feel bad about themselves so they buy our products!""

Here's a weird example:  The idea that you need to ""keep your mouth fresh"" because you might have bad breath didn't come from any medical (or dental!) science.  It came from companies that wanted to sell flavored mouthwash and expensive toothpaste and breath mints.   If you take care of your teeth and gums, you don't need anything special to generally avoid bad breath.  (garlic aside üòÄ)


It's possible to overcome all that anti-fat bias conditioning but it takes time."	feministintraining	reply	na	na	na	0.01440484169870615	no	no	no	na	BodyAcceptance	failed

Sizes covered: 2.6"", 3"", 4"", 5"", 6"" (possibly higher?)

"I can't narrow it down to just one thing.

- Learn to set boundaries. Get a therapist's help if need be.  Learn that you don't have to take abuse. You can say ""I don't want you to talk about me this way, and if you continue, I will leave."" Then leave if you need.  It's harder to do with family & loved ones, but it's possible.

Toxic people do not belong in your life.

- The only opinion about your body that counts is your own.  You don't have to love your body, but you should not hate it.  It's a journey to self-acceptance but it's a journey worth doing.

- Ideals for what bodies should look like are mostly fantasy.  Nobody has a perfect body. Photoshop, camera angles, lighting changes, filters, and more make up what we see in the media and online.  

Even people who are popularly considered ""beautiful"" have flaws and often fight with their own journey with accepting their body.

"We're all harder on ourselves than others are.

You can change your own thoughts.  Like anything, it's not a simple thing and it takes time, but if you stick with it, it can work.

The most common advice here is to start a list of things you like about yourself.  They do not have to be things about your body.  They can be anything.  You know more trivia about your favorite movie than anyone you know. You make your friends laugh. You like wearing hats.  You enjoy fantasy shopping for items you'll never buy.  You feel good after doing yoga.  There are thousands of possible things you can add.

You will think of more things as the days go by.  Add to that list.  It doesn't matter how tiny the thing is. The list is for you, and only for you.

Every time you think something negative about yourself, read the list.  Some people will read it out loud.  The more you remind yourself of the positive things, the more you are countering the negative thoughts.  

After some time you'll notice that when you think of a negative thought, you automatically think, ""Yeah, but [something on that list].""

It takes time and patience, but it can become a habit.

Will this completely get rid of the negative thoughts?  Maybe. Maybe not.  But over time you can reach the point where you kick your own brain into thinking, ""Why do I think something like that when I have so many good qualities?""

Auditions can be so competitive, and the director may have been looking for something that has nothing to do with your body. Maybe they were looking for certain mannerisms or expression. Or maybe they‚Äôd already promised the role to their best friend‚Äôs sister‚Äôs niece. Whatever it is, you don‚Äôt know, so don‚Äôt assume it‚Äôs something bad about you.

You should never feel stupid for doing something outside your comfort zone. That takes so much courage, and I‚Äôm proud of you for trying. And even though it didn‚Äôt work out this time, I encourage you to keep going to auditions, keep developing your skills, and be confident about what you might bring to a production. Lots of people fail tons of auditions before they land a role, so keep it up and keep your chin up.

"It's an old standby that in the entertainment industry - which is shared by  amateur productions - that men get to age, get fat, and have a variety of bodies, and women are expected to look thin and young, period.

It's changing,  very slowly.  It takes time.

Imagine if you got the role but the director decided they wanted you to go on a crash diet to look a certain way. Imagine if they started vocally shaming your body.  Imagine if they said things like, ""Well, she's a great actor but I wish she had a different body.""

Even if none of that ever happened, I'd make a cash bet they'd still be thinking it.

I totally understand you feeling vulnerable right now. But you did something incredibly brave regardless of whether or not you got the part.

"I have a really great friend who is just the complete opposite of me. She is 4'10 and very petite, while I'm 5'10 and curvy. 

She is studying to be a personal trainer and comes over to ask me questions about her studies, she is English as a second language so I help her with the vocabulary otherwise I know nothing on the topic. 

She came over today to talk/ vent about how she was going through her wardrobe and how her sexy clothes don't fit because she gained a few pounds over summer. She tells me that she took pictures of herself in these body hugging clothes to show herself when she's hungry how her tummy rolls over the waist band.  

She continues to tell me that she was working out and when she was doing squats her legs were shaking and she was embarrassed that people might see her at the gym.  I asked if she had eaten, and she tells me that she is only eating 1 meal a day.

I very bluntly told her that what she was saying was really bothering me,  and triggering a bunch of my issues with body image and food. 

She didn't understand where I was coming from,  and said things like "" oh,  you're not fat, you are tall."" and ""you have great thick legs and big boibs.""

Unfortunately this is how people with eating disorders often find themselves to be socially isolated. Their wonderful social supports, such as yourself, get fed up with all the diet talk. I‚Äôd set a limit with her around ‚Äúno diet culture talk‚Äù and if she can‚Äôt follow it I‚Äôd try to find friends that lift you up and make you feel good. Sounds like she‚Äôs struggling - but you certainly don‚Äôt have to take it on, yourself.	Bookkeeper_Which	reply	na	na	na	0.9977242350578308	no	strong	no	na	BodyAcceptance	failed
"With English being her second language, it makes me give her a bit more benefit of the doubt. Language is hard. And if the two of you aren‚Äôt the same ethnicity, it‚Äôs possible that more cultural aspects of size may come into play here. (Ex. Asian parents saying children should be skinnier than their non-Asian classmates.)

It sounds like you still want to be friends. You attempted to set your boundaries and it did not work - because of maybe just a lot of fat or self-hate on her side, or even possibly miscommunication. So you should reevaluate your connection with her. She‚Äôs a personal trainer, too‚Ä¶ so in some ways it is inevitable that bodies will come up in conversation with her, so keep that in mind. I personally would just stick with non-food and exercise topics and meet ups if I wanted to continue being friends with her, and tell her hey, let‚Äôs not talk about these topics. 

If she continued or if it was unavoidable, that‚Äôs when I would directly tell her sorry, don‚Äôt message me anymore. 

A true friend is going to take your feelings into account and be careful. Is she a true friend? Or are you just an easy person to offload her ED stress while also being a language tutor?

I knew how insensitive it was for me to talk and complain about my body despite how ill I was and despite the fact that I genuinely did not feel anywhere close to as thin as I was perceived. Eating disorder or not, she is voluntarily choosing to act this way to be blunt.  The cherry on the cake is her making comments on your body at all and giving unsolicited opinions about your body and specific body parts, that is extremely rude.

You should just accept yourself for who you are and be confident. Give yourself a license for your perceived image. How you 'fashion' yourself in both clothing and in personality should make you feel shameless and people will sense and respond to that. While most western societies favors thinness, not everyone favors the skinny.

"Nothing about my body or my face was off-limits from my intensely critical view of what I was supposed to look like. I have had disordered eating since I was 10. It has run the gamut from binge eating to bulimia to anorexia. I have had a larger body and a smaller body. Whatever relief or satisfaction I thought would be mine when I arrived at that magical number on a clothing label or a body scale only gave way to new criticisms and standards and a pivot to the next thing that needed fixing. I grew up with Farah Fawcett as the beauty ideal. My Mom was always dieting. My Dad made comments about women that tied their value to their appearance, and weight was a very clear indicator of whether a woman was acceptable or not. The messages were clear. In order to have value, I had to be thin, pretty and pleasing to men. Ugh. When I look back, it was like a prison of sorts. 

My body has been through a lot. Periods of intense excercise and periods of sedentary inertia. Gall bladder disease. Crohn‚Äôs disease. Metastatic cancer requiring radiation and chemotherapy. Lots of cosmetic procedures including invasive surgery, all with pain, downtime and occasionally complications. I spent thousands freezing my fat.  It was like being on an endless journey of self-improvement that was actually fueled by self-hatred. I just didn‚Äôt know it. Now I do.  

I started the work of healing what was underneath all of this after a devastating betrayal that left me feeling dark and empty inside. I was determined not to let something like that happen to me again and I wanted to understand my part in it. I realized that this was all fueled by lack of love and compassion for myself. All these messages I was telling myself or allowing in from other sources were lies! They were constructs. Self-hate is learned and it‚Äôs so common that it seems like truth. It isn‚Äôt. Once I shifted into viewing myself with unconditional love and compassion, my disordered eating faded away. I have abstained from cosmetic procedures for 423 days (so says my app). I have no desire or plans to ever do them again. If I find myself thinking about it, it will be an indication that I‚Äôve slipped back into self-hate and that something else is going on. I don‚Äôt examine my face or my body any more and make a mental list of what needs to be fixed. I am embracing my early 50s. I don‚Äôt poison myself with body shame.

"I feel like I'll be healthier and happier if I exercise more, since right now I'm leading a very sedentary lifestyle. Thing is, I only feel motivated to exercise after seeing my naked body in the mirror. That's not what I want. I think if I give into that, I'll just end up miserable and fighting my body. 

Does anyone have any tips for starting an exercise routine in a way that's weight-neutral?"	FluffyKoalaButt	post	26.31948322783562	female	White	0.9964905381202698	na	na	na	16	BodyAcceptance	failed
I would start with, what kind of movement do you enjoy? And what kind of setting do you enjoy doing it in? Culturally (at least in the US) the norm to ‚Äúwork out‚Äù is to go running or go to the gym on a regular schedule. That style doesn‚Äôt work for a lot of people, and can trigger unhealthy relationship w exercise because of how loaded it is culturally. There are so many other ways to be physically active!! Do you enjoy being social and a part of a community? Maybe there is a recreational sports or running group you could join. Or, a hiking or walking group. In my city there are recreational dragon boating teams which sound like a lot of fun. Do you like freeform dancing? Maybe there is a dance night at a club you could go to regularly, or if you prefer doing that alone you can make a dance party at home. Do you like being competitive? Join a competitive sports team or make goals to compete with yourself with whatever activity you enjoy. I am a bicycle commuter, which works well for me to get exercise. I don‚Äôt have to plan or schedule anything, it‚Äôs just how I get around 90% of the time. I enjoy it and feel good afterwards too.

Start off really slow, one of the first hurdles is even just making time in your routine for it. Just start going for a walk 3 times a week, really gentle. Time yourself so you see that even this small activity makes you fitter. Practise gratitude for the movement your body is capable of now and as it increases.

"Ooo, this was something I had to learn as well! Everybody is right: figure out a type of movement that you enjoy, whether or not that fits into a conventional ‚Äúexercise‚Äù box. Working out on the machines at the gym wasn‚Äôt for me. But I do love walking, dancing, splashing around in the pool, and yoga!

When exercising, I focus on movement oriented goals rather than body image goals. Example: I really want to do a handstand one day. I‚Äôve never done one! But before I get there, I need to do a plank without my arms getting tired. Or I want to dance without feeling winded/tired. I think of a big goal, then break it down into smaller goals to keep me motivated.

Another example: when I first started meaningfully exercising again after a long break, I started by going on a four block walk (basically 10 mins). I started with that because I knew I could do it. Soon a 10 min walk became easy, and I wanted to walk even further. So I added a few more blocks and it became a 30 min walk by accident. Then it became a few hours. Now, I walk all the time! It doesn‚Äôt matter how small your action is because if you build these small little habits, it will become easier over time.

None of these goals have anything to do with my appearance. If anything (to be honest) my appearance has changed in ways that I didn‚Äôt expect (hello muscles!!) and it‚Äôs been a bit of challenge to accept it. But then I remember my big goal, and it helps me find peace with the changes in my body. If I can finally do a handstand or other cool physical shit, what does it matter what my body looks like?

"Seconding finding something you love! I had a super unhealthy relationship w exercise and every time I tried to start again I‚Äôd push myself too hard and end up burning out. Then I started PT and they did aquatic therapy, so I started swimming on my own, too.

I just work out in my living room now bc I started strength training and loooove it, but I‚Äôd never have gotten to this point if I hadn‚Äôt started with an exercise I genuinely loved doing and been able to build up my strength.

Nice response! I would love to add to this to not constantly question and ask yourself if you are enjoying the activity you've chosen.  Generally, you feel extremely uncomfortable when you first try something new or after awhile.  This is totally normal.   Don't be too hard on yourself and try sticking to a routine to make things a bit easier.  You'll then learn to love the activity.  Had the same thing happen to me with running.  Wasn't a fan until I realized getting tired was .. kinda nice.  It's a process.  so glad to see you motivated to try something new and exciting! good luck have fun:))	FluffyKoalaButt	reply	na	na	na	0.9964905381202698	weak	no	no	na	BodyAcceptance	failed
"To add to this great answer: create a virtuous circle by having very easily achievable goals. For instance, if you struggle with motivation, tell yourself your goal is to go to the gym (or wherever) and stay 10 minutes there (even if you do nothing). Just go there in your workout clothes and stay 10 minutes, easy even if you're tired or don't want to work out.

Big bonus: chances are, when at the gym, you'll end up doing something rather than waiting idly. And you might even work out longer than 10 minutes because you're already there, might as well do something for a while! And even if you don't, you still achieved your goal, which will make you want to keep going and keep ""winning"". It creates habits that lasts."

"This is my first post on Reddit, so apologies to the mods in advance if I break any formatting or posting rules. 

I've been in recovery from disordered eating for 1.5 years, and as to be expected, my body has changed a bit. I still struggle with the changes occasionally, but for the most part I'm a much happier and healthier person now, and my husband is crazy supportive. However, I'm currently recovering from a surgery at home with my parents, who are not quite on the same page. I sent my husband back home to finish his degree and take care of our pets, so it's just the three of us for the next 5 weeks. 

I can already feel the friction; my parents really want me to be happy and healthy, but are just not quite up to date with how to best help me do that. I'm having some trouble with nausea and eating post-surgery, and I'm already hearing ""supportive/joking"" comments about how my parents wish they were on the same meds or needed surgery, and how they'll be so excited when I can get back to exercising. I don't want to snap at them, I know it's coming from a place of love, worry, and self-insecurity, but it's hard when I'm having disordered thoughts resurfacing less than a week after major surgery. Thinking about buying a copy of IE or Body Respect or something similar and leaving it around the house for them to pick up üòÇ

So sorry that is happening to you, especially when you're in pain and stressed out already. Parents are really hard. I can't give any advice - I'm currently estranged from mine because they wouldn't stop pushing my boundaries on another issue. What I can say is that you should set a loving but firm boundary with them so that they understand what you need from them. I wouldn't expect them to read a book, but if you find a nice article you might print it for them or email it to them if they indicate an openness to learning more.	middle_case_scenario	reply	na	na	na	0.0047895293682813644	strong	strong	no	na	BodyAcceptance	failed

"CW disordered eating, medical judgement

I had an appointment with my psychiatrist this afternoon and it's left me feeling very disheartened.

I know I'm fat, and I've been working for years to accept that as a neutral state of being. I've also been fighting disordered eating patterns (never a diagnosed eating disorder, but probably should have been) since I was in middle school and have finally been making progress in that field over the past 3 years.

Today, my psychiatrist said he was ""concerned that [I've] gained some weight since [he] started seeing me"". And yes, some of my medications come with the risk of weight gain. But 15 pounds over almost 3 years isn't a whole lot considering I'm actually eating enough to nourish my body now.

I guess I'm just discouraged. It's like all they see is the weight and not the work I'm doing."	thecatsanasshole	post	32.198773958403436	male	White	0.9992426633834839	na	na	na	11	BodyAcceptance	failed

At the clinic I work at someone said last week ‚Äúwhat happened? you got really fat‚Äù and at first it really wrecked me. Then I realized that I am at the healthiest place with my body, food, and movement that I have ever been in my adult life and my weight is none of his business.

"I hope this post is appropriate for this subreddit.  The concept of revenge body is not new at all.  I remember when Maury Povich used to *Maury* geek to chic episodes where people who were treated like shit in school because of how they looked would appear on *Maury* as exotic male dancers, attractive and busty women, or slender and transgender women and had guests who supported them, and sometimes guests who bullied them in the past.  (This was back in 2004, 2005, or even earlier).  

That's how I learned of the concept.  As someone who was made to feel like garbage in school and at home, I used to envision getting back at the people who mistreated me by showing up at my class reunion with the perfect body to make them feel the same way the way they made me feel.  That caused me to have an adverse relationship with food where I would eat a lot and then overexercise, and sometimes I would  eat very little and then splurge like crazy.  When I exercised, I would feel discouraged because my abs were not defined enough.  And that fed into the self-loathing I was already felt with.  My relationship with food improved as I began to accept my identity as a same gender loving person.

When it came time for my class reunion, I declined to attend.  It was one of the smartest moves I made in my 20s.

I can say without a doubt that the concept of revenge body is absolutely toxic.  It encourages reaching a size that is up to someone else's standards as opposed to your own.  The problem with that scenario arises when you show off your new body to someone and it doesn't make them feel bad, it doesn't make them apologize or even want you.  And now the motivation is gone.  

Another problem with this concept is that it is inherently fatphobic because it promulgates the idea that if someone is not ideal body material, then they are flawed and undesirable.  That is not conducive to body acceptance, rather it is antithetical."	Qigong90	post	29.286813237961436	male	White	0.9985515475273132	na	na	na	1	BodyAcceptance	failed
"It is a self-poisoning concept. I can really relate to this. My ex commented on my body all the time, telling me I need to lose weight, completely breaking my confidence, and after I left him, I wanted to get this revenge body and remind him that he will never get to see or touch it again.

Well, I did get my revenge body, but it's not the one that I envisioned. It's an even bigger, but healthier, and stronger body. I also went to therapy and learned to let go and not be obsessed with my appearance or what I am eating. Becoming mentally and physically healthy is the best revenge."

I'm in my mid-30s. I remember getting stretch marks when I was younger and hating them. I also remember hating my cellulite, my not-perfectly-white teeth, and all kinds of other things. There was so much to nitpick about my imperfect body.

Well, now I have all that, and also age spots, wrinkles, and gray hairs. I wear glasses now. Due to injuries I can't wear heels or other unsupportive shoes. I look back at pictures of myself from my early 20s and I crack up laughing-- I was so obsessed with all my imperfections I couldn't appreciate the fact that I was young and, tbh, really cute. I just missed that phase of my body's existence, and now it's gone forever. It's a shame.

I realize now that this is the body I live in, and each moment is fleeting so I better enjoy it while I can. After lots of hard work in therapy, I can honestly say that I'm beautiful and I know it. I don't look like a plastic doll or a magazine cutout, because I'm a real person made of flesh and guts, and that's awesome. I'm alive! I have age spots from all the fun times spent in the sun and wrinkles from laughing. I have cellulite because I'm a human being who eats food, and it's delicious. I also have some awesome quad muscles because I like to run, and I have great hair.

"I'm an asexual, cisgender man of considerable size. I've recently been reading up on the Health At Every Size movement and it's inspired me to seek out body-positive, inclusive environments where I can be around others that model healthy habits. I'd really like to work on my flexibility and hopefully get some relief from the joint pain soreness I experience on a regular basis, so yoga seems like it might be a good fit. There are a few yoga classes in my area specifically geared toward larger folks and body-positivity. While they don't explicitly state ""women only,"" I've noticed that their online materials seem to strongly suggest that one of their main goals is to create a safe space for women. I've noticed the same thing with the HAES movement in general.

I am all for this. Women need safe, body-positive spaces. If that means not being around men, then I want to aid in that goal! My two main concerns are to support and affirm body positivity for all, while simultaneously finding a space in which I will be welcome.

"Maybe call the studio to double check, but honestly unless it's explicitly women only I'd say go for it.

This is just speaking for myself but when I say I want safe spaces from men I usually mean specifically allocishet men, and really only the subset of those who are jackasses. You honestly don't sound like someone who's likely to make women uncomfy in that type of situation, especially being ace (I promise I mean that in a totally positive way!)

Additionally when it comes to active/gym type situations I would arguably put the majority of overweight or out of shape men into the category of ""non threatening"" as well, since most of you are likely to face the same kind of problematic behaviour in the gym as we are. 

I hope you manage to go and it's positive for you.

"I just want to say, at least for me, I've been a member of a number of body positive fitness communities, both for powerlifting and for roller derby.  And almost always, everybody was comfortable with other people of whatever size or gender seeking body positive inclusive spaces.  And it is very easy, as a person in one of these spaces, to tell the difference between another person who is also seeking a body positive space, and a person who is coming to gawk at your body, and it's that latter one that you're trying to be safe from.

Our roller derby team was exclusively for women only, and we were very explicit about it and enforced it.  The major concern was that we wanted all the women to feel safe wearing whatever articles of clothing they wanted to wear, without feeling gawked at or judged by onlookers.  So we had to make it a rule that if someone's partner was coming to pick them up or drop them off, they needed to stay out until the last 10 minutes of practice.  But then once a week, we had co-ed practices where men were welcome to participate since it was non-contact.  And even then, no partners/parents/friends until the last 10 minutes of class.  No one was ever uncomfortable participating next to men, it was being looked at by men who were sitting there judging you.

So if this place doesn't say that it's for women only, I would assume it's probably gender neutral but overly marketed in a woman-dominant way (because that's kinda how the body-positive community can be).  If you called the studio I would trust the person to give you a truthful answer about whether men were allowed.  I would find it very unusual for an otherwise ungendered body positive fitness class to not allow male participants.  Usually when they talk about ""creating a safe space for women"", it's about making sure the instructor isn't making shitty comments about your body, or being treated like you're a burden sucking up the instructor's time from the fit hot people who this class is REALLY for, or not being oggled at by other people in the gym.  It's not about saying ""there's no men in this room"".

Not yet. My thinking is that since this is part of a larger yoga studio, the person who answers the phone might not necessarily be the same person that teaches this specific class, and therefore might not be able to gauge the very particular nuances of the body and gender politics at play here.

"Hey! As someone who both teaches fitness classes and has works the front desk at a studio, this is the sort of question I *loved* getting. You can also ask specifically if it‚Äôs something the teacher is ok with, or even if you can contact them directly to check.

To be honest, a lot of body positivity stuff is aimed at women. If you read health at every size, you‚Äôll know that, while that book is applicable widely, it‚Äôs targeted specifically at women. So finding a spot that‚Äôs explicitly like ‚Äúmen welcome‚Äù is gonna be hard. That‚Äôs just not where the culture is at.

"I think it's important to remember that ""fitness"" ""leanness"" and ""health"" are all different words that mean different things, and to get mad when people use them incorrectly.  My ability to continue to exist in fitness and nutrition spaces is predicated on my ability to get angry at others, rather than my body, when people use those words to imply things they shouldn't mean.

Fitness is about what cool stuff you can do with your body.

Health is about how likely your body is to get sick.

Leanness is about how thin you look.

Taking diet pills and cutting your calories drastically will make you leaner, but will not make you healthier or fitter.

Taking an antibiotic when you're sick will improve your health but not make you leaner or fitter.

Taking steroids will make you fitter and leaner, but are bad for your health.

Dieting has become a dirty word.  So I feel like a lot of the time, there's this euphemism treadmill that people use when they still want to become smaller to say ""Oh I'm not trying to get thin.  I'm trying to get fit.""  or ""This isn't a diet, this is a lifestyle change for my health.""  ""I'm just eating healthier.""

"I am short with disproportionately large boobs, broad shoulders (broader than hips), no defined waist, don‚Äôt really have hips, short torso, I guess I have a bit of a bubble butt, always had a bit of a belly. My arms and legs are naturally toned.
I don‚Äôt really fall into any of common body types (pear, apple, triangle, hourglass, etc), but I guess I‚Äôm probably closer to apple with a bit of inverted triangle? Its hard to find fashion inspiration based on other women with similar body types because my body type is not common it seems. Buying clothes online is such a gamble because I need to try things on to see the fit. Using the size guide is kinda useless because only based on chest measurement I‚Äôm an XL and only based on hip measurement I‚Äôm a medium. Even when I try clothes in store, 90% of time it doesn‚Äôt look good. I feel like clothes are catered to fit tall, slim women. 

Over time, I have found clothes I absolutely avoid: Skinny jeans (makes me look to top heavy), baggy shirts (makes me look boxy), razor back tops (makes me look soo broad)

I have found these clothes to be more flattering;
Bell bottoms/flares (balances my top heaviness), fitted long sleeves with deep V (makes me look less broad and shows off my boobs).

I go through waves where I‚Äôm content and accepted my body and sometimes feelings of I wish I had a smaller waist and bigger butt, etc will creep (deleting instagram a year ago has helped lessen comparing my body to other!)

In terms of your butt problem (I actually have the opposite issue thus was told to avoid this stuff) decorations like bedazzled pockets and patches and such can actually influence your butt area and make it more full.

"I spent all of today looking for a dress for a wedding. It is fairly casual so I didn‚Äôt think it would be a problem, I was very wrong. I tried on about 20-30 dresses from different stores, and everything was either too small for my bust, or was ‚Äútoo chesty‚Äù. Every dress I was excited to put on slowly made me more and more disillusioned. 

The final straw for my day was a jump suit that I adored, it had slits down the sides of the jumpsuit and it meant I would go braless. I felt incredibly sexy, even though my stretch marks showed, my stomach rolled, and my chest sagged. When I looked at my shopping compatriots excitedly they immediately responded with how it was a shame this one had the openings on the side, or it would be cute otherwise.

I had to stay in the room for a while and cry, as I had fallen in love with how the jumpsuit made me look and feel. I had debated buying it anyway, but I knew I would never feel confident in it after their responses. I thought I had loved my body, but I felt myself wishing for the smaller body that would be able to wear a sexy jumpsuit and be called fashionable, rather than unacceptable.

"I don't just mean I'm kinder to myself. I struggle with my weight and the parts of my body I hate tend to be where I look the most ""fat"". When I'm depressed, I physically look larger and worse than when I'm in a good mood. When I'm in a good mood, I see myself the way a stranger would. I feel like I'm seeing myself for the first time and I realize I don't look bad at all, normal, even good. I wonder if this is how I *really* look.

I've noticed that I can't ""zoom out"" on how I see my body. The difference between how I look in the first scenario vs the second is that in the second, I'm seeing myself as a whole person.  I'm able to filter in both the good AND the less good parts of my body into one complete image. I usually can't create a complete image, I can only see the bad.

It's really weird, honestly. It's like my body image is fragmented. If one day I see myself as looking fine, it won't stick. The next day, I may know logically that the day before, I looked fine, and arguably today I look the same as I did yesterday, but I now think I look way worse and what I thought yesterday was not true.

It's just curious. I feel like this makes it much harder to accept my body because my body image is very unstable. I know logically that what I see could be either good or bad, it's entirely about the way my brain is perceiving it.

"We have a pretty similar body type! 

Personally, I feel most comfortable and confident when my clothes emphasize my waist and kind of skim over everything else.

Cropped tops tend to hit my natural waist, so I wear a lot of those and pair them with high-waisted bottoms. Any top that‚Äôs longer, I‚Äôll either tuck in or tie up.

For skirts I like an A shape, also called fit-and-flare, or skater skirts when they‚Äôre short. Straighter skirts can work too, just be sure that there‚Äôs a big difference in size between the waistband and the hips. Skirts with an obvious waistband look and fit a lot better on me than those without one.

And for pants, I always look for a high waist, roomy thighs, and a deep Y yoke stitch on the butt.

Knowing where you want your waist to hit is a huge help when you shop for clothes, especially when you‚Äôre short-waisted! I measured all my favorite tops from the armpit to the bottom hem with both a soft measuring tape and my hand, and always look for that length when shopping.

Maybe try high waisted pants together with a tucked in shirt or a crop top? Or a maxi dress that fits around the waist, making your lower torso and legs seem longer. This makes me look and feel 10x better, as a short and short-waisted person.

"I feel like the hardest thing with shitty teens and kids and stuff is that it makes you think ""Is this what everybody else is thinking but they're just too civilized to say out loud?""

My friend's kid is the smartest little girl ever.  She's 4, not a mean bone in her body.  And one time, I was watching her and we were reading a book about historical timelines or whatever, and crawling around on the floor, and she was asking me a thousand questions, and I was getting hot so I took my sweatshirt off, and she just looked at me and said ""Why do your arms look so different when you take your jacket off?""

And, like, yeah, I have lipedema, I have about 60 lbs of adipose tumors in my arms and legs, my face and torso look drastically leaner than my arms do.

And I feel like, I'm not hurt that a kid noticed I have fat arms.  She's a kid, she doesn't think less of me because I have fat arms.  But it makes me think ""does everybody else in my life sit around thinking 'omg why are her arms so fat' and being too scared to ask?""

And it gets to you.  It really does.  But also, I think about times when people have said shitty things to the people I love and care about, and I'm like ""OMG what the fuck are they on?""  Like, one time my wife and I were on vacation and somebody tried to make conversation by saying ""Spring break right?  You girls in college?"" and my wife was like ""haha no"" and she was like, ""Oh you're her mother then I'm so sorry.""  And like.... my wife is 5 years *younger* than me.  She doesn't look old.  I do not see what could make that person possibly say that, it is completely bizarre.  But she's sitting there thinking ""oh my god does everybody think I look like an old person"" and like, no, she doesn't, it's probably that I dress like a 12-year-old boy I don't know.  But I guess what I'm getting at is that you can't put stock in other people's opinions.  You can't fall into that trap of thinking ""oh my god this person sees what everybody else sees and they're just more honest.  Nah.  People see different things.  Trust the people who love you and care about you when they tell you what they see in you.

Mostly just about weight, not about the size of other things (lol).

"I've decided to unsubscribe from the beauty system, or in other words, I'm embracing body neutrality. 

I think body positivity is great and I love seeing all these amazing people rocking their bodies no matter shape, size, marks, imbalances etc. but it's just not for me. Body neutrality though, really resonates with me. If my organs aren't struggling to keep me going, and if I'm fit enough to do the activities I love then why should anything else matter? 

Unfortunately, unsubscribing from the beauty system is not as easy as hitting an unsubscribe button. Like all of us I've had years and years of media and society telling me I should want to look a certain way, I should want to be appealing to the opposite sex, and I should bend over backwards to achieve it.

But I'm going to work on it. No more changing my appearance for the sake of others, I'll do it if it's for myself. No more trying to hid my rolls when I'm wearing jeans. No more attempts to cover my stretch marks at the beach. 

My extra body fat is the result of the delicious food I've enjoyed that I am fortunate to have access to. My stretch marks are the result of a growth spurt when I was younger and is just a part of life. My scars are from being a care-free kid who climbed trees and when on adventures with friends.

"It's not easy and it's not something that happens over night. You have to work on it and I still have plenty of times when I fall into old ways. But you got this!!  


For me it was about identifying what I could do better to be kinder to my body.

For example I would 'body check' my stomach a lot. I realised that there were times I tended to do it more, mainly getting changed in front of a mirror or after going to the toliet. Now, in those times I say to myself ""I'm not going to check my stomach because what's the point? It's still there and it's not going anywhere."" And now I don't do it nearly as much. 

If I'm out and start feeling self-conscious about how I look or whether there are rolls showing etc. Instead I look around, take a deep breathe and think ""I'm glad I'm here"" If I'm out in nature I just appreciate being physically able to be there. Even if I'm somewhere boring like in work I think, I'm fortunate to have this job. 

For me it really comes down to changing my mindset. Instead of thinking about something negative about how I look, I think about something positive that is about anything other than how I look. And slowly, over time that gets easier. The negative thoughts come less frequently. And the positive thoughts become a lot louder."	hannahhk	follow-up	na	na	na	0.003865382634103298	weak	strong	no	na	BodyAcceptance	no prediction.

"I love hiking and low intensity workouts to help with my anxiety, but I'm not interested in losing weight. I just want to comfortably exist in the body I have. But when I exercise or download apps with exercises on them, they just make me feel so unhappy with myself. The instructors talk about ""burning fat"" and ""how much weight you'll lose"". I just want either a body neutral or body positive exercise that doesn't demonize this body I live in. My body is amazing! And I'm tired of fitness instructors trying to get me to feel bad about myself.

"I decided to start going to the gym this year, partially because my girlfriend wanted to go which is a good motivator, partially because I share this same sentiment - I want to move my body in a way that feels fun to me without targeting weight specifically. 

Some good things I've noticed is I don't feel very self conscious about my body there actually - we go to Planet Fitness and I feel there's a wide variety of body types every time I go. I know that's PF's brand is to discourage gym intimidation so can't say for sure your apartment gym would be the same, but it was definitely a pleasant surprise for me! We all just do our thing and I've never had anyone comment on my body or heard that from anyone. If I ever get paranoid someone will say something, I try to think about if I was them, how little I would probably be paying attention to myself in the first place cause I'm here to focus on my workout. Also loving the weight training machines, so fun.

Some things I've noticed that do trigger my anxiety around weight is some of the cardio machine setups. You don't have to base your workout around calories or heart rate, but those numbers are always Right There in front of you...it suddenly makes me anxious sometimes like I need to start abiding by that (am I burning enough calories? I don't like going this speed but i want to keep this arbitrary calorie goal, etc.) I've even given in on occasion and decided to try the ""fat burn"" workout based on age and weight, but ironically the target heart rate I'm given always seems way too low and I don't really feel like I'm doing anything...I dunno I'm still figuring it out. TL;DR is I'd avoid trying to do a workout based on body-related numbers because who needs that energy anyway.

"I empathize very hard. Last year I started walking more to get more sun and movement, but I wanted to see how far I walked and set myself little goals to achieve in a non restrictive way. EVERY pedometer app I came across had a calorie counter and I just was not interested in having it thrown in my face, and lead me down the rabbit hole of comparing how many calories I would burn vs. eat/drink. I eventually found a super basic app that just tracked distance, time and altitude which still works great for me! 

I also follow some exercise influencers who are licensed professionals and have a more holistic approach to movement, like @soheefit on IG. She focuses on weight lifting, form, and education, and that kind of content is much better for my mental and physical health.

One thing I learned a long time ago, and it seems to still hold true is that other gym goers are focused on their OWN workouts.

However, I 100% doubt that people will look at you because they are trying to focus on themselves. I hope this helps!	babadook_dook	reply	na	na	na	0.9984476566314697	weak	strong	no	na	BodyAcceptance	no prediction.
"So, in the past 2 years, I've experienced a significant drop in my weight due to surgery. I thought that I would be more comfortable in my skin, more confidently express myself (via clothing and in general), but now I'm overwhelmed by the options that I previously had limited to no access to. In a way, the extremely limited options made me work on developing distinct styles for every season that looked ""presentable"" according to my (convoluted) standards (I struggled with an ED way before I had my surgery, the surgery's effect on my weight and body image is a conversation for another day). I don't want to dress the way I used to anymore? I want to dress in a way that reflects what I find aesthetically appealing, which is much harder than I thought, because I feel like I forgot how to feel like something appeals to me! I say ""forgot"" because it feels like a distant feeling I would get as a kid that I grew up having to repress because I rarely would find my size. Does anyone have any recommendations for how to get through this and just dress nicely? 

I hope I'm making sense."	freska_freska	post	13.340887857451001	female	White	0.9969069361686707	na	na	na	2	BodyAcceptance	no prediction.
I'd suggest looking at secondhand options like thrift stores or thredup, that way you can try new things with less pressure.

"Wow. I feel like I could've written this myself (minus the surgery). 

I would suggest looking online at different clothing styles to see what looks cute to you (pinterest and google photos are good places to start), and maybe trying something like Stitch Fix to work with someone to find new styles and staple pieces that appeal to you. 

Maybe it would be helpful to spend some time reconnecting with your inner child and exploring/trying on the kinds of styles and pieces that would have appealed to you at *that* time-- just to re-connect with that sense of wonder and confidence and build from there.

"A few years ago I started on my journey of healing my relationship with my body and with food and movement. Overall it‚Äôs been going well and I have a lot of support - therapist, partner, great friends.

During this healing journey my body has gotten larger, which I have been making peace with as I go.

However, with my wedding now less than 5 months away I am struggling to stay neutral and accepting and I find myself wanting to fall into old restrictive habits.

I have not gone down that road and have enough support not to. But my mindset and emotions seem to be getting stuck in fear about not looking or feeling pretty on our wedding day.

I know that is a result of diet culture and such, I know it‚Äôs just programming, but it‚Äôs gripping me hard.

"Hey. I am not sure trying to convince yourself out of feeling the way you feel is going to work for you here‚Äîwe can‚Äôt intellectualize our way out of tough feelings! A process that I really like is this: tune into your body, scanning down through all of the sensations you feel until you can locate the emotion in the body. If I had to guess, it‚Äôll either be deep in your gut, like a cavern in your chest, or perhaps a tight feeling around the throat. That emotion is like a memory from the past‚Äîtreat it as a younger version of you, the person who was taught to feel the shame/fear/insert emotion here that you‚Äôre feeling right now about your body. All you have to do is validate the shit out of that younger version of you. Talk to her, perhaps reassure her and tell her it‚Äôs okay to feel what she is feeling, and see what this version of you has to say. Spending some time with the part of you that learned to hate yourself is how you move through long-standing stuck points like this. If I had to guess, in talking to this version of you, you may find she was trained to believe certain things about your body that you know not to be true. Talk to her and let her know the truth.

- You can mock a man for his actions and deeds without making fun of his body.

- Who someone is says a thousand times more about them than trivial things like height.

"Hi. I don‚Äôt even know if this could even be the right sub (and feel free to redirect me if you think there could be a more appropriate sub to post this on). But I have a very close friend who has severe body image issues, and sometimes turns to me while feeling negatively about herself (eg. weight gain, or clothes suddenly not fitting, etc.). I have a myriad of other self-esteem and self-image issues, but my body hasn‚Äôt really been one of them for a while. 
I can often empathize with her on a more general sense, from my own BDD experience, for example (after all, I‚Äôd suspect we‚Äôre all very much affected by beauty standards, in some way or another). But there are things, especially related to weight fluctuation (I think the best way to describe my own relationship to my body might be ‚Äòneutrality‚Äô), that I sometimes do not feel like I can really fully understand. Even if I try, and listen in the best way that I can. And I often feel very out of place and unequipped while trying to support her on this topic. Ending up feeling like a very shitty friend. 

I really love my friends, and I would like to have a better understanding of how to be more supportive in this kind of situations. It‚Äôs happened enough times that I, again, feel like I cannot fully be there for them in the ways that they might need.

"I like to remind people that we offer worry about our body image because we want to be accepted, want to be liked, don't want to be bullied. Truth is, especially for women, people just like judging you. If you focus on your energy on impressing people or fitting other people's standards for you, you'll never be satisfied. The only reason to eat well and exercise is to be healthier. You treat your body kindly, and it literally repays you with (evidenced-based) things like energy, better sleep, better mood, thinking clearer, etc. 

Plus another tip to improve body image: try to mindfully be thankful that your body lets you do the things you like, which may include, enjoy nature, do art, communicate with others. That's flipping awesome!

Lastly, food is great. It is historical, cultural, emotional (all of which is backed by evidence; for example food is linked to smell, which have connections to the memory and emotional centers of your brain), AND TASTES GOOD. Appreciate your food. When you get something good, savor it. Find healthy options you enjoy or at least tolerate. Eat with your hands! And stop feeling guilty about eating and putting yourself down for fulfilling your own basic needs. When you see food as a resource, you naturally want to eat healthier because you want it to be used productively, and then you can enjoy the treats with more gratitude."

"Hi friends, just joined because I hit a milestone today in my recovery process and wanted to share. (For context, I‚Äôve been 5 years recovered!)
 I always had a fear of exercise, and specifically exercising in front of people. I was always worried about what people would think of me, my body, and my level of fitness. I avoided it for so long bc of bad experiences pre-recovery, and had definite concerns about how to do it in a healthy way post-recovery. 
Today I worked out for the first time in years. I worried what people would think of my body, I looked around to see if anyone was looking at me, but ultimately I kept in mind that it didn‚Äôt matter if they were. My stomach was out, I was wearing a sports bra, and I was definitely self conscious, but I actually saw another girl in the gym with my exact same body type! It felt great to see someone else with their stomach rolls visible, working hard and not caring. I kept thinking to myself the things I learned from body positivity. It made me feel more confident, more sure of myself, and I left feeling happy and proud. 
I worked out because I wanted to move and get endorphins and energy! I moved in ways that felt good, and stopped when they were too much for me. I‚Äôm looking forward to trying again and seeing how far I can go. Just really proud of myself today."

"For context: My family is very skinny, my Mum is skinny, my other sister is skinny, I'm very skinny. We are just naturally really really thin, to the point that it would be considered unhealthy for anyone else. 

My littlest sister though is not skinny, she's definitely not overweight, just normal. But for a while now she has been making little comments now and then about her weight. Like just earlier, she came to me and said:

""I'm wearing a crop top""

Me: ""mmmmm"" (I was in the middle of playing chess)

Her: ""It's supposed to be for other girls who are skinny, so I just have to keep my arms down like this"" (she put her arms tightly by her side so that her belly wasn't showing)

Me: ""crop tops aren't just for skinny people, why should only skinny people wear them?""

Then she just said idk and changed the subject. She's only 8 but she has been making comments like this for a while now. I really don't want her to get older and develop an eating disorder or something, I just want her to know how beautiful she already is and that she doesn't need to be stick thin to be pretty. I've tried talking to my mum about it before, but I think my sister has learnt it all from my mum. My mum is pretty skinny for a 45yr old, especially since she has birthed 4 children. But she constantly makes remarks about herself being fat and she keeps trying to go on diets. I forgot what she said when I talked to her about my sister but I do remember that she didn't think about it much, because to her generation, you do need to be skinny to be pretty. 

Basically I just need advice on how I can help my sister to know that weight and size don't matter and to love herself and her body as she is. Because lots of the time I don't really know what to say. My sister hates conflict so whenever someone suggests a different opinion she kind of just shrugs or ignores you and goes quiet."

"My Mum is also quite thin so I have an idea of how she may be feeling! You're a great sister to have noticed that there's probably more going on under the surface, and she is so lucky to have someone like you in her life!

The only suggestion I can think of is trying to find good role models for her to look up to with a range of diverse body types.

"Your mom should NOT make those remarks at all in front of her kids. Especially not the little kids.

I‚Äôm a victim of this. My mom (who was always very very thin) would make remarks and even CRY to me when I was young (8-12+). She gained five pounds? She‚Äôd cry about how she‚Äôs so fat. To her like, 9 year old daughter.

Yes, it made a huge mark on me. I had an eating disorder for years, and it got bad. Like ‚Äúresidential treatment and exercise restriction because you‚Äôre so underweight‚Äù bad.

I was trying to grow my hair to waist length ( it was a bit below my shoulders), but my gf at the time (she was pretty manipulative) wanted me to go shorter and I did, I cut a pixie for her and was dumped three days later. The short hair reminds me everyday to how submissive I was to her, how much I let her control my life and I feel shame everytime I look myself in the mirror. I can‚Äôt take it anymore, it‚Äôs too much you know? I‚Äôm so sad. I can‚Äôt wait 2 years until my hair grows back to what it was to feel better, I need to learn to love myself now even after all that happened, but it‚Äôs so hard.

"I'm so sorry that happened to you. I know personally that it still hurts even if you know you are better off without that partner.

For your hair, it can be a hard adjustment. Hair is often really wrapped into our perceptions of ourselves. My father has made me cut my hair shorter than I wanted as a child and I have regretted some short cuts that I chose of my own volition. I would suggest ""taking the power back"" with your hair i.e. kind of reframing your relationship with your hair to be more positive. This could look like dyeing it a color you like, wearing a wig, getting extensions, or wearing headbands/hats/scarves etc. If none of those options sound appealing, I would suggest looking into the mirror and complimenting yourself often. Maybe you'll never like how the hair looks, but maybe the short hair draws attention to your beautiful eyes or allows your cool earrings to stand out. Or maybe think about how easy it is to wash and dry your hair with less length? Nothing is going to undo it, but you might be able to get to a point where you feel at peace with your current hair.

I hope this helps some. Hair does take a long time to grow back, but you'll arrive a cute bob in a relatively short amount of time."	doinurgf	reply	na	na	na	0.9962235689163208	strong	strong	no	na	BodyAcceptance	no prediction.
"Hey OP, this sounds really hard. I‚Äôm sorry yoi went through a hard time with your ex, I can totally understand how the hair can serve as a physical reminder. Once that connection is made in our heads, it‚Äôs hard to decouple. I imagine you‚Äôll get to a longer cut pretty soon, but I wonder if there‚Äôs another way to ‚Äúreclaim‚Äù your hair as your own in a way that allows you to love and accept it again. It sounds like right now, you see the cut and it reminds you of her. What if you changed something else that is not about length, in order to make it your own again? What if you dyed it a different colour, one that is all about you expressing yourself and how you like to look? Or what if you dressed it up with fun accessories that are a more authentic expression of you? I don‚Äôt know, this may not help - but I know that for me, reclaiming different parts of my body or experiences made all the difference, and it didn‚Äôt always need a huge change.

"I‚Äôm so sorry this happened to you. That‚Äôs incredibly difficult. What might help me if I found myself in that circumstance is reframing the shame. You have no reason to be ashamed. You did something for someone you cared about, out of thoughtfulness and love‚Äîno one can shame you for that without your permission. The shorter hair is a symbol of how deeply you can feel and care, as well as a sign of empowerment. You can love and lose and be stronger for it. 

I haven‚Äôt gone through exactly that experience but I have experienced plenty of feelings of shame. What‚Äôs been deeply helpful to me is reading and learning about Jung. If you‚Äôre into podcasts, check out This Jungian Life. They have an episode on shame, actually, and hundreds of others. The hosts are smart and funny and so comforting to listen to. Almost feels like a therapy session in itself.

Is it worth at some point in the future getting a cut that is more what you'd like, rather than what your ex manipulated you into?  In that way it can be 'yours' rather than a reminder of what was?

"Whilst I don‚Äôt mind looking androgynous (some of my icons are androgynous and the fashion is pretty cool) I don‚Äôt want to look like a boy.

I‚Äôve been called the T-Slur a couple times on the street, and my friends little brother recently asked her if I was transgender. I have no issue with anyone who is trans and accept it, but I‚Äôm a cis girl and want to be a girl. 

I usually wear my hair short ish (just above shoulder) because it looks good on me that way, and I wear trousers to school instead of the skirt (I have uniforms). I don‚Äôt always wear makeup because I‚Äôm lazy, and I must admit I have a boyish figure. I‚Äôm skinny with narrow hips and I‚Äôm pretty flat. 

I used to like my body a lot and thought I was always pretty attractive but recently I‚Äôve just been feeling too manly. 

I‚Äôve also been thinking of romance a lot, and I really want to have a bf/gf one day, but I wonder if anyone will even be attracted to me. I look super young, I‚Äôm small and flat and APPARENTLY look like a little boy so who the hell is even going to be attracted to me? Pedophiles?

I completely understand that having a body that is not viewed as super feminine by today's society can be frustrating(I say today's society because there used to be a time where a more boyish figure was considered the ideal). 

Changing the way you look would be a bad idea, unless you really want to. People are gonna call you what they want no matter what you look like. What matters most is that you don't let them decide how you feel about yourself. You can be your own definition of ""woman"". 

As others have previously said, your body might change as you get older. Naturally, you don't want to wait till you get seen for what you are. I guess you could use the way you hold yourself/you act to express your ""femininity""?

"I (25F) have been dating my boyfriend (28M) for nearly a year now. I have severe body image issues from my past relationship and i spent a long time healing from that. I felt like I was ready for a relationship, and things were going really great. 

Up until recently, i found a secret instagram account filled with ig models (i used his phone to see how my professional ig looked to someone viewing it and he was logged in to that account). It crushed me, honestly. I spent days comparing myself before finally confronting him. He felt immediate embarrassment and grief. He deleted the account but then i realized he has never dated a bigger girl. 

We have no issue in our sex life. But i really can‚Äôt accept the fact that he‚Äôs attracted to me. Because I‚Äôve seen what he likes. He tells me that he likes all body types and as someone who has recovered from an ED and still i guess have severe body image issues, i don‚Äôt believe him. He only ever looks/looked at very skinny models/SWers. I saw the following and there wasn‚Äôt one not even close to midsize woman on there 

I‚Äôm feeling very defeated and truly feel like he‚Äôs only with me to get over his previous toxic relationship. I know it‚Äôs been a year, but it sucks a lot to feel like he‚Äôs just lying to me when I feel like he prefers a body type that isn‚Äôt mine. He‚Äôs perfect to me. Sorry if this rant/seeking advice was all over the place I‚Äôm mentally a wreck right now.

"Having a secret account isn‚Äôt great from an honesty standpoint. I think it makes sense to feel upset about that.

But I believe you may be overthinking it when you say you don‚Äôt believe him about being attracted to you. Sure, it might be true, but you‚Äôre jumping to conclusions here. The evidence that you have (a secret instagram account, the fact that his past romantic interests had a different body type) are not in any way sufficient to show that he isn‚Äôt attracted to you. Yes, it is suggestive, but only mildly so. When you take into account that he has straight up told you that it isn‚Äôt the case, that should be more than sufficient evidence for you to believe that it just isn‚Äôt true. (Unless he has a long history of lying, but if so you have other issues.)

Lots of people out there are legitimately interested in several different body types when it comes to a romantic interest, but look to specific other body types for other things. It may be that when it comes to looking at instagram images, he has had a habit of looking at that kind of body type. But that *does not mean* he would only be interested in that body type when it comes to romance.

For example, I have a friend who plays a lot of video games. Some of these games use chibi characters: drawn characters that are squat with large heads. If you were to look at his desktop background, you‚Äôd see nothing but chibi characters all day long. Yet when he plays video games, he *never* chooses games that use the chibi art style. We all have things like this, where we may get laser focused in one area, but feel completely differently in another area. He may not have even noticed that he had such a specific type in his instagram viewing.

Having said all that, even if your gut feeling (which remember, is stemming from body image issues, not from the actual preponderance of evidence) happened to be true ‚Äî even if he really did have a body preference when it comes to romance, and you don‚Äôt happen to have that specific body image ‚Äî *that still wouldn‚Äôt be a big deal*. People are much more than the shape of their body. There is a long list of qualities that apply to you, of which body type is only one. Your sense of humor, your fascination with books, your wit with rhymes, your ability to play the piano with your toes, &c. Some of these apply to you; some of them don‚Äôt.  But my point here is that there is a list of thousands of items, of which body type is just one. If it so happens that your particular body type isn‚Äôt the one he usually would prefer, then so what? He has still chosen you for myriad other reasons. I am absolutely certain that you feel exactly the same way about him ‚Äî wouldn‚Äôt you actually prefer if he was exactly the same, but was more empathetic, or had rich parents, or didn‚Äôt hide secret instagram accounts? Just as you still love and pick him, despite his not being 100% in line with your exact preferences on this huge list of all the things that make him up, he can still love and choose you, despite you not matching 100% on a single line out of thousands of different aspects that make you you.

But, remember: assuming he doesn‚Äôt like your body type from the evidence you gave in your original post is not a good determination to take. You‚Äôre using circumstantial evidence that does not in any way prove anything; most of your feelings are coming from your insecurity issues.

However, you should still be mad at him for having a secret insta. That‚Äôs just inappropriate."	queen0fmars	reply	na	na	na	0.9984233379364014	weak	no	no	na	BodyAcceptance	no prediction.
It sounds like problem #1 here is communication.    Why does he feel the need to hide his erotic photos from you?  I‚Äôd be more worried about that than the fact that he looks at the most socially acceptable (and, importantly, the most easily accessible) types of bodies.  Talk to him about how you feel, and try to find out why he feels the need to hide things from you.	queen0fmars	reply	na	na	na	0.9984233379364014	no	no	strong	na	BodyAcceptance	no prediction.
I understand how it feels to have body issues but I'd advise not putting them on to him. Unless there's more to this story, he loves you and finds you attractive.

"As a gay guy, if my boyfriend had an alt Instagram full of male models or porn stars I honestly wouldn‚Äôt feel any kind of way. To me, I feel like it isn‚Äôt something I‚Äôd be worried about because I can see they‚Äôre attractive too. Them being attractive doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm less attractive or undesirable. At the end of the day, he‚Äôs choosing to be with me over a guy like them.

I can understand why you feel this way though. I used to have crippling self esteem issues and struggled to feel any kind of self worth. Even small things like boyfriend chatting with his friends and forgetting to say goodnight would crush me. What‚Äôs important is to consider your options, like what is within your control to change?

Is there anything you can work on to make yourself happier? Why do you think your boyfriend chooses to stay with you if he‚Äôs not attracted to you? It‚Äôs not like he‚Äôs bound to you by law, so there must be something special about you that he loves. Are there expectations you haven‚Äôt discussed with your boyfriend?

People can have a wide range of preferences and also fall in love with the bodies that house the people they love.

I went shopping with my Nan today, I was on the hunt for some mom type jeans, found a great pair, tried them on, felt cute af and then she walks over and says ""I don't like them, they make you look fat""
I'm probably more upset than I should be, and I feel like I can't even explain to her like ""body positivity / acceptance"" because shes been brainwashed by society to think if you're not a size 2 then you need to lose weight, in fact she, a 78 year old woman, is always talking about how she needs to lose weight (she doesn't, shes healthy).

"The best way to handle it, I always think, is to not try to get her to change her mind about body size, but to get her to stop talking about it to you.  It involves drawing a boundary and then the hard part - sticking to it.

""My body is not a topic of conversation.""

""Please do not make comments about my body.""

""I do not want to hear comments about my body or my weight.""

and then from there it goes

""I have asked you to stop talking about my body. If you won't stop, I will leave."" (or, we will not go shopping again, or I'm going home, or whatever.)

And then stick to it. Leave, if you can. Stop talking to her. Keep it up until she learns, you are not there for her comments and you *will not* tolerate them.

It's possible that she or someone else in your family will then start to gaslight you.   ""You're being mean/selfish."" ""How can you talk to your grandmother that way?"" ""You are taking it too seriously.""  etc. etc. etc.  They're all saying that a) you're not allowed to have a boundary (bullshit) and b) you're supposed to allow your grandmother to abuse you Because FAAAMILY.

"So I really like the YouTuber Mr. Beard. He‚Äôs a really nice and reasonable person and I relate to him a lot as someone who is also fat and nonbinary. He does an excellent job discussing various topics imo. But recently he talked about the stress of being stuck in between fatphobia and body positivity and it‚Äôs had me thinking a lot lately.

I really do feel like I‚Äôm stuck in this slingshot between self love and self hate. Like I don‚Äôt want to hate myself and I also don‚Äôt feel like it‚Äôs possible to constantly love myself. I want to feel good about how I look- I put effort into my appearance, I dress in a way I like, I dye my hair how I want, I try to present myself in a way I aesthetically enjoy, so I want to enjoy when I feel like I look good. At the same time I‚Äôm terrified of being this delusional fat person that people are making fun of. I don‚Äôt even know if I count as fat per se- I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8 and size 16. I feel like I‚Äôm in this weird middle space sometimes with my body where I don‚Äôt know what category I‚Äôd fit in. 

But sometimes I see the awful things people say about fat people and it makes me question everything about myself. Am I lying to myself? Am I slowly killing myself? The last time I went to the doctor I was perfectly healthy. I have no issues with mobility or anything like that. And I still get super scared that by not being skinny I‚Äôm like, ruining my health (which is so dumb bc like, so many things affect your health and my health is nobody‚Äôs business but mine unless I wanna share). But I see like awful caricatures of fat people and all I can think is, do people see me like that? Do people look at me and mentally remove intelligence and worthiness from their impression of me based on my size?

Then, on the other hand, body positivity sounds so good, but I really struggle to relate to the mainstream body positivity movement lately. It feels, to an extent, hyper feminine and hyper sexual. I have participated in this in the past and it‚Äôs not inherently bad but I don‚Äôt like that it‚Äôs the focus (in my opinion). I‚Äôm transmasc and my goal in life is not to be a fuckable woman. And the mainstream body positive movement does sort of feel like it focuses a lot on sex appeal of fat women. Like yeah obviously most people want to be sexually desired by others sometimes but it really bothers me that it‚Äôs such a focus. Like to fit in with mainstream body positivity I have to put on a full face of makeup and a dress and then I‚Äôm a bad bitch or whatever. I don‚Äôt like certain parts of my body that would make me more appealing in a mainstream way. And I don‚Äôt really feel supported by the rhetoric I see on, like, instagram, about fat AFAB people and how we can still be sexy.

I‚Äôm not sure if this all makes sense- but like, the video made me think about how at the end of the day I really just want to be treated like a person without any preconceptions based on my body size. And I want to like myself without my body size being a factor. I‚Äôm tired of feeling like I have to be thin, and if I‚Äôm not thin I should be sexy and feminine. Or if I work out I‚Äôm somehow disappointing all other fat people. But if I don‚Äôt work out I‚Äôm a piece of shit, even though thin people who don‚Äôt work out don‚Äôt get any flack. I don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôm just so deeply frustrated with like, being perceived. I just want to like myself!"	loonycatty	post	21.8259345153864	female	White	0.0041822283528745174	na	na	na	1	BodyAcceptance	no prediction.
Thanks for your rant-ish. I feel similarly to you. I'm male and feel I'm in that middle space. It's weird and shitty. My weight has fluctuated since I was 18. Going from big to thin to big again a couple times over that past almost 20 years. I'm currently on my way to big again. After going to group therapy for BDD a bit ago and reading and watching videos on body acceptance, I am trying to feel okay about it but it's hard and confusing. I can't really offer advice but I can offer solidarity and the knowledge that you're not alone.

"Sorry for the long post, but bear with meüòÖ

A little over a week ago I decided to sign up for this ""get fit in 30 days"" challenge because I was (and still am but I'm working on it) so unhappy with how I look and my fairly recent weight gain. The first day of the challenge you're supposed to take your ""before"" pics so you can see the progress.
It's only been a week of it, but this challenge very quickly turned into me working out daily for a week, beating myself up mentally when I couldn't do all the reps and follow along, and criticizing myself everytime I ate something remotely unhealthy. Ive been heading down this road for a while, trying to force myself to work out 7 days a week and hating myself when I missed a day, and then feeling absolutely destroyed when I didn't lose any weight. I've just been so exhausted with all of this.

Today I looked at my before pictures and went to delete them, but then looked again and decided that before pictures are stupid. I don't need a ""before"", I just need to let myself be. There is no before or after, it's all just me and they're just pictures of me. I stopped looking at the parts I was hoping would change in the after, and started looking at the parts I like in the now. 

I know it's not much, but it just felt like a huge mindset shift and I'm really proud of myself.

I don't need to change my body. I don't need an after, and I certainly don't need to overwork myself for some stupid challenge."	LyndsayGtheMVP	post	25.30996690079055	female	White	0.9807532429695129	na	na	na	2	BodyAcceptance	no prediction.

"My weight fluctuates a lot and the last couple of years I've been going back between a size 18 and 20, but mostly it's been size 20. Most clothing stores don't have items (in any size) that really work with my body very well, I don't know if I just have an unusual type of body or what. I want to accept my body, but a major part of the reason I have a hard time doing so is bc there are a lot more options in size 18 clothing that I like and that fit well enough, but with size 20 it's such an excrutiating and time consuming process to even find 1 item I don't despise. I'd say that to find 1 item of clothing fits and that I like, it takes trying on about 10 differnt items when I'm a size 18, and about 50 different items when I'm a size 20 just to find 1 item I don't despise. I'm not exaggurating at all. It's very, very rare I can find something in a size 20 that fits that I at least semi like. I suffer from deep depression and have a lot of health issues, so often don't have the energy or motivation to go through the whole aggrivating and time consuming process of finding new clothing when I wear size 20, so I end up wearing the same thing over and over until they're too raggedy to wear. I'm way more confident and happy when I'm a size 18 since I can wear clothing I like and feel good in and my depression and self esteem go down a lot when I'm a size 20 and have to wear clothing I can just tolerate. I could accept my body MUCH more if this weren't the case. 

People have suggested getting clothing tailored, which could be an option if I had more money, but that could get expensive. I rarely buy new clothing as it, and even when I do I can barely even afford it bc I'm unemployed right now and can barely even afford my month to month expenses. Just to give you an idea, some of places I go to (in person and online) are Kohl's, Torrid, Old Navy, Target, sometimes Walmart. I also go to used clothing stores and look for items on ebay and poshmark. 

It's just so frustrating bc I always think that if I could just get down to a size 18 again then I wont have to deal with all of this as much and can wear clothing I feel good, comfortable and confident in. But I also want to be able to accept my body however big/small it is. But it is what it is, I just can't seem to stop getting into the diet mentality and it's not even really about my body actually, it's about having clothing I feel good in. 

So, my options seem limited and I'm not sure if anyone has any suggestions, but I thought I'd try. Also, just in case I come into some money any time in the near future, if anyone has any suggestions on other options where I don't have to stick to as strict of a budget, then that would be good to know for future reference.

"I have been wavering between two sizes as well lately. It's really frustrating when an outfit you loved last month suddenly doesn't fit right anymore!

I also live in the middle of nowhere so I do most of my shopping online. I don't want to suggest them, but I found it extremely easy to order clothes when my payment info is already in the account. (Amazon) They let me know when something in my wish list is on sale. I don't always buy it because the sale is like $2. 

I have been slowly building a wardrobe that makes me feel good, and it's in the bigger size so it will still fit even if my body changes. I'm sure there's other online clothing companies to order from, be sure to check the reviews.

"Hello, fellow fluctuator! 

I hear you! Plus size clothes can be insultingly bad-like WHY are there so many unnecessary ruffles on everything?! As a full figured woman, the last thing I want is a bunch of ruffles. I‚Äôll look like a linebacker, not whimsical and breezy like a ruffle may suggest.  Sometimes I want to show off my figure, sometimes I want to try a clothing trend and see if I like it on me, but the plus size clothing market has taken those ideas and watered them down into what they believe plus size women want-more feminized clothing. Jokes on them! I feel the most feminine in a pair of well fitting jeans and a nice fitted t-shirt (with no ruffles!), most plus size women I know are enraged about plus size clothing design. 


But I‚Äôll let you in on what has helped me, something that has truly set me FREE. The secret is‚Ä¶learn to sew.

I buy a lot of clothes and tailor them myself. Hemming, stitching a fabric dart or sewing in a pleat can take those shapeless pieces and turn them into something special. I feel so much more proud wearing clothes I altered to my body, and it‚Äôs turned into a really nice and fairly inexpensive hobby! I do have a sewing machine, which is extremely helpful, but if you don‚Äôt want to splurge or need to save up to get a machine, I started with simple hand-sewing; all you need is needle, thread, a measuring tape, and a good pair of scissors. YouTube is a great please to watch instructional videos on how to start tailoring clothes too, there‚Äôs hundreds of great videos! This helped me with my depression and ED intrusive thoughts, and helped me love and appreciate my body. I highly recommend it if you‚Äôre up for a challenge that pays back tenfold."

"I definitely struggle with this a lot.  I'm a butch bisexual woman with lipedema, a genetic condition that causes adipose tumors to grow in the arms and legs.  I feel like every time I try to wear traditional lesbian dapper fashion shit, I look like a fat teenager cosplaying a grandpa, because I'm built like a fertility idol.  Plus I've gotta wear these medical-grade compression pants every day and orthopedic heel spur shoes, and just none of it feels like myself.  I wish I could wear cargo pants or whatever, but once they start making pants wide-legged, they stop making them stretchy, and they still don't make them wide enough to fit *my* legs in them, so I just end up in skinny jeans feeling like shit.

One thing that I found really helpful to me is to give up on trying to find clothes that are both flattering and authentic.  They don't exist.  Sometimes, I'll steal an outfit from the Rock's Instagram that looks tough but also can fit an enormous pair of legs and everything is perfection.  But usually, I have to pick one or the other.  And I feel a lot better about myself and how I look when I wear unflattering clothes that reflect who I am as a person.  Like, yeah, I know, I have no torso, my thinnest place is my waist, I should get something tailored to the waist or else I'm going to look like an enormous blob, but I don't want to wear a freaking pencil skirt.  I'm going to wear a big bulky sweatshirt with a really cool design on it, and some big stompy boots with orthotic insoles, and I'm going to look like a blob, but I'm going to look like a happy blob who knows who she is.

I have the same problem. Im not plus size. I‚Äôm pretty petite but I have this really mini hourglass figure. Everyone says they would love to have my body but they don‚Äôt realize how hard it is to have clothes. Before puberty I remember how good it felt to find an outfit you love/feel killer in. Now all I wear is leggings and tee shirts and I never feel like ‚Äúwow I look good.‚Äù Im also a hint of tomboy. I love the look of the cargo pants trend but my hips/thighs (although small) are still the biggest part of my body and it‚Äôs not flattering to wear any of the current trends. All shirts are too big across the shoulders and in the neck.  I literally avoid social events because I know im going to panic and having nothing to wear. I dream of being rich and having all my clothes custom.	Animal_lover1010	reply	na	na	na	0.9988783001899719	no	strong	no	na	BodyAcceptance	no prediction.

"I know finding the right clothes depends on body type and preferences, but oh man, several years ago I went from a size 28-30 to an 18-20 and I felt like the whole world of fashion opened up to me! Of course not everything fits, in our size range we come in all sorts of various shapes...but I could finally wear what I called ""regular plus sizes."" (And hey, I lost weight because of a health problem, I realize we come in ALL sizes).

I had to replace ALL my clothes. I shopped 95% on line. Stitch Fix was terrific once I convinced them that just because I was a suburban grandma I didn't want to dress like one and I got more skinny jeans (I mean ""skinny"" style lol), moto style jackets, and shorter skirts.  I replaced my outdoors/active wear by scouring rei on the regular and snatching up items in my size on sale. I bought staples on Amazon, and on sale at Lands End. I'm fortunate in that I could afford some lovely items from Nordstrom, but again I watched the sales all the time.

I had to do TONS of returns. Tons of internet sleuthing and pouring over measurements and styles. My upper arms are very big and I learned what kinds of arm holes and necklines work for me and what to never try.  

In my internet wanderings I saw clothes in many sizes in many styles at many price points.

I would just start slow. Go walk on the treadmill for a bit. Wear things that make you feel nice so you have one less thing to worry about. Extend your workouts the more comfortable you get.

"I had really bad anxiety in the beginning and a couple of things helped me get acclimated quickly.  

1) At least the first three visits I made were only 10 minutes long.  Quick in-and-out jobs to get the lay of the area, a feel for how busy it could be at certain hours, what it felt like to just go through the motions of getting on and off the equipment.  Where the lockers and bathrooms were.  Scouting trips, really.  It made it much easier when I chose to stay longer because I didn't feel lost or in an unfamiliar place.

2) I aimed for after-hours, non-peak periods.  My schedule allowed for it at the time and I'd be hitting the gym around 9:00 PM and later.  

I'd also urge you, if going back to the gym just won't work, to consider an at-home exercise regimen.

As for actually working out: I can't stress enough that most people are way too busy dying a silent desth inside while liftibg weights or running cardio than to care.

"It's hard! I have some social anxiety so getting up the courage to go to the gym can be challenging. A few tips that help me:

- Go at less busy times of day (late night, super early morning, or a time when most others are at work like 2:30PM)

- If it's a new gym or you're just starting out, go on a day that you aren't planning to work out and ask a staff member to give you a tour of the facilities. This way you're familiar with everything and can feel more confident when you go!

- Wear workout clothes you like and that flatter your shape, if that helps you to feel more put-together. Treat yourself to a new workout set even.

- This is an obvious one, but wear headphones and listen to a new album or podcast that you're excited about.

- If you are really nervous when you get there, find a quiet, less crowded spot to just walk on the treadmill or even just stretch for awhile until you feel ready to start. If your nervousness/anxiety keeps worsening, it's okay to be done for the day even if all you do is stretch/walk."	advicepls_21	reply	na	na	na	0.9976630210876465	no	strong	no	na	BodyAcceptance	no prediction.

"Good on you! 

I typically find that, especially when your body has changed, it's less about style, than it is about quality.

A plain shirt, for instance, is always going to look horrible if it's made of thin, cheap material. Similarly, a well-crafted jacket of high quality cotton, canvas, linen etc will look good on everybody. This is ESPECIALLY important when you find yourself physicly uncomfortable - a thicker layer of fabric can make all the difference.

Style options will vary depending on formality of occasion, body shape, and where you want emphasis to be, or certainly not be. Personally, I like to keep my clothing neutral (plain jeans and a t-shirt), but use bolder accessories, like thick bangles, long necklaces and liberal use of scarves. However for some, busy, jazzy patterns on their clothes and minimal accessories work better to highlight what they like about their bodies.

Unfortunately, right down at the root, it's a case of trial and error."	tabilw	reply	na	na	na	0.00924054067581892	weak	strong	no	na	BodyAcceptance	no prediction.

"I had a similar experience and still do. First up I ordered a ton of stuff that made me happy from websites that had free and easy returns, I ordered the same pieces in a number of different sizes because it took me a while to know what my new sizes were (that included shoes, as I dropped half a size!) 

Then I would set aside a period of time to get in my best neutral underwear and have a big try on session. Sometimes I would base my purchases on instragram looks, other times it was just what I thought looked nice. I also texted pictures to my sister who's a real fashion expert and got her advice on what matched/how to wear things (like the difference it makes to pull a skirt up high, or to roll up the sleeves on a jacket, or add a cuff to straight leg jeans.

After a while I got braver with emulating looks and fashion and would match things that I never dreamed of wearing as my comfort levels grew.

Something else to keep in mind is that clothes are not made to fit your body, they're made to fit every body. So I found a tailor who helps alter trousers and dresses as my body changes shape on my journey. That makes investing in expensive pieces easier to stomach knowing they'll last longer.

Finally, if you're having a bad day...don't try on clothes! There will always be pieces that just don't look great and if I wasn't mentally prepared to not like something or the way it fitted or looked on me, then I would wait a couple of days until I felt better.

"I am so sad for you. Your husband lives in a delusional world such that he believes that a woman's body is something he can control. That women's bodies shouldn't change as they perform normal functions, like childbirth. I can bet that he also believes it shouldn't wrinkle or sag as it ages. This is definitely his problem. At some level, he doesn't understand biology and he's made the choice that he doesn't want to because it doesn't make him feel happy. He's a sad, immature man to believe that relationships should be effortless for him (but that you should be making ALL the effort to keep him happy).

Please go and get therapy for yourself. It will become clear during that process whether this is leading to divorce or not. It would be nice if he would also go to therapy, but don't hold your breath. Even if he agrees to go, no one can make him grow up. And that's the basic issue here.

I know this may seem harsh. I went through a lot being married to a man who was adult in body only. When we both went into therapy, I learned he had been molested by an adult when he was 9, and he was stuck at the emotional development he had at that point in his life. Understanding that I was basically dealing with a 9 year was painful, but it helped me make sense of what was happening in our marriage. He could have worked through it, but it was apparently too hard/threatening to him. Because of that decision, he made the choice to walk away from the marriage (although he wouldn't see it that way). This kind of partner is very difficult to live with, and it doesn't get better over time.

Your husband should stop being so selfish, your body has more purpose than to just be an object of attraction to him.

FOUR MONTHS POSTPARTUM!?!? Your body is still recovering from a a major medical event! Highly recommend counseling (couples, and individual). To me that just seems highly disrespectful to say to your partner after such a major medical event. Can you imagine saying the same thing to him if he were in a car crash and had significant injuries and was reconvening? Our bodies change with age. Even regardless of pregnancies. His body will change too. No one will be the same as they were they married and that‚Äôs an unfair standard. Ideally he has his own internalized body issues that can be worked out in therapy. But I don‚Äôt know. I personally find those statements so incredibly lacking compassion and empathy given the timeline. Be gentle to yourself dear. Your body grew a third human and safely delivered it. That‚Äôs an incredible feat. Pregnancy and birth are stressful on your body and you need to think of it as a medical event akin to recovering from major surgery.

If you can heave 3 footballs out of your vagina for that guy, the least he can do is accept that your body has changed imo. He should love your changes because it symbolizes the family and love you have built together. I'd definitely try counseling together before further steps. Also really work on body positivity for yourself. It will make you more confident and unapologetic for your body. Everyone, no matter their size, deserves respect.

"Agree with the people who said this is a him issue, not a you issue. Don't let it make you feel ashamed of yourself. You pushed 3 people out of your body and contrary to what people have said, it's not ""just cool he's being honest man"" it's actually disgusting and something he should have saved for therapy. You didn't deserve to be made to feel as though your body had failed him somehow when it literally created his family. Just by that statement alone, I'm guessing your husband was fed a lot of toxic messages about women, their bodies and aging in general and that's not your problem, he needs to unpack this with a professional. I'm sure he isn't the exact carbon copy of the man you walked down aisle towards either. People change and mature with time and you're not meant to look like a teenager your entire life, especially after you've had kids. Your husband needs to accept that both of you are going to age, which means gaining weight, wrinkles, stretch marks, losing hair and teeth, etc. Your body is merely the vessel of your soul to experience life in and it goes by so fast. Your husband needs to get his priorities straight and unlearn some bullshit, otherwise he's just a bunch of weight you can lose by filing some papers."

"I went through something similar in a 5 year relationship I thought was heading toward marriage. I didn‚Äôt have kids, but I did have a series of significant health challenges, mental health challenges, a career change, eating disorder recovery and duh the pandemic. It is so sad to me that my ex was living in a delusional world where he felt it was possible (and preferable) for things not to change and also that the way our bodies look is something we can and should change. We tried therapy but ultimately the relationship ended in a very shocking and traumatic way, and for months (ok a year), I was stuck feeling like it was somehow my fault. Now I see it was something within him. 

Internalized fatphobia is not something we choose, and it‚Äôs normal for attraction to change in a relationship, but his statements sound like they feel hurtful and unsupportive to you. It‚Äôs ok if it takes time, but what is he doing to actually change his mindset? Is he engaging in any kind of work? Can he find a way to make sure YOU aren‚Äôt suffering at the hands of HIS internal struggle? If not‚Ä¶ that shows he‚Äôs not thinking about this as something HE needs to change.

I agree going to your own individual therapist will be important for looking at the relationship and your needs holistically. Couples therapy would be great but he needs to show you he is committed and self-aware, not just GO to sessions. You are worthy, powerful, and strong and deserve to be treated as such."

"I actually think it‚Äôs really cool that he‚Äôs being honest and also making an effort to change how he thinks. Is it hard information to hear? Absolutely. It also doesn‚Äôt sound like he phrased it rudely. 

Weight will fluctuate through your life, especially after having kids. That‚Äôs normal. It‚Äôs also normal to be attracted to your partner within a weight range (and I don‚Äôt mean a narrow weight range). It doesn‚Äôt mean you don‚Äôt love them, it just means you‚Äôre learning to find someone attractive that no longer matches your sexual template. I think it‚Äôs awesome he‚Äôs WANTING to change. With the Internet he could so much easier choose someone else. 

All that said, I want to validate how hard this information is to hear. It sucks and it can feel scary and hurtful. I‚Äôd highly recommend therapy together as a safe way to process this and communicate about it. And just remember how awesome you are. He clearly is in this for way more than looks, and that‚Äôs because you have so much more than that to offer. He loves you.

"Completely agree with this. While it is of course hard to hear the person you love say that, there's another message in that. That the husband still loves her, and is trying to change *himself* rather than telling *her* to change. 
You so often hear that men want their wives to change back to how they were before giving birth, so honestly, this guy acknowledging that he is the one that needs to change... I dunno, looks like green flags to me. He might be less physical with showing love, but at least then she knows he's trying his best to change for her, out of love.

This happens when I gain or lose weight. If I gain some weight and it goes to my breasts, I feel it. If I lose weight/inches in my torso but not in my breasts, I feel it. It happens around my period, and when I'm sick, and when I've done manual labor that day or a work out.

This approach also REALLY helps how much you judge other people. Like baby I'm not spending my time hating ME, you better have a damned good reason to make me spend it hating YOU.

You are you. Your body exists in order to house your soul (your mind, your aura, whatever you believe in) and as long as you're still in there, it's doing alright.

"My therapist has me try talking to my 'inner child', imagining what I would say to *her* if she felt about her body the way I do currently. This can get emotional. 

I also try to counter every negative automatic thought about my body/self with at least 2 positive statements about my body-- I find this more helpful if I try to reframe the negative statement to a positive/neutral in some way, such as countering ""I dislike x body part"" with ""it feels really fun when I move this part in *this* way"" or ""I love the way it looks in this pose/outfit/etc."" 

Sometimes even just challenging the negative thoughts/feelings with a reminder to myself that those thoughts aren't *mine*, these are messages I recieved from my mother, or an ex, or media, etc. I felt like just the practice of awareness and identifying the thought or feeling instead of just automatically accepting it as truth was really helpful when I first started my self-acceptance journey. You could maybe even give yourself some time to reflect or journal about *where* exactly that specific judgement or insecurity comes from, in some situations just being able to identify and process that has been empowering for me.

I, then made a list of the reasons why I'm grateful to my body (it was difficult to list them down first but I started with the most basic ones). The realisation that I no longer have to associate with the shame and the reminder that my body is functioning and taking care of me even on days when I'm not fully able to do the job helped. After that I learned to take care of myself. I started it in little ways like researching on basics of skincare, buying skincare products and eventually doing it. What I also realised is that somewhere when I slowly started accepting myself I also evolved as a person, it helped me gain my confidence which further helped me accept my body.

"Things I will never understand:

*Having all white straight size models (exclusively size 4) with a single East-Asian model, and then having all black plus size models (exclusively size 12 with pads). Racism branded as inclusivity is embarrassing.

*Making jeans/trousers with 5 belt loops. I know they assume that we don't need belts because ""belts are for skinny people, why would fat people need them"" but still. How are you gonna make jeans in a size 28 with 5 belt loops?? Have you ever seen a fat person with a belt??? We need at least 7 or the belt slides up over the denim.

*Calling yourself inclusive because you go up to a size 20 in about 3 items. Don't get me wrong, a size 20 I can usually squeeze into. But don't put the i-word in your mouth if your brand is very clearly ""we tolerate The FatsTM (but only the small ones)"".

*Having plus size models of only 1 bodytype. Idc if it's hourglass or large in the hips or a big belly, brands really couldn't figure out we need more than that?? Yeah I love that the model with a huge belly and hips as curvy as chopsticks is here to model the jeans - but shouldn't you show what they look like on more than 1 bodytype?? 

*One size fits all accessories. Make this one make sense. Some of us have fat wrists, fat necks, fat fingers. Even scarves, shoes/boots, or the straps on cross body bags. They. Need. To. Be. Bigger.

*When the fatphobia is normalized. I live next to the largest shopping mall in my country. There are over 50 clothing stores. 5 of them carry sizes over a 14. 3 of those carry their plus sizes in store. Nobody is bothered by this.

*Plus size garments that are WILDLY more expensive than straight sized equivalents. The lingerie stores will carry 28-34 band and A-D cups in every shape and colour bra imaginable, for twenty bucks. A 36H? Hope you like beige nursing bras that cost 80!!!

*On that note: bras over a D cup that only have 2 hooks. Why do you exist??? What do you think you're supporting??

"Way way way back in the '90s, when dial-up modems roamed the Earth and mail-order was done via printed catalogs, there was a campaign to write letters to the major brands of fat women clothing, asking them to please use models that fit the sizes they offered, because we wanted to see what clothing looks like on people who are shaped like us.

The responses from these companies were all the same [emphasis mine]: ""Our research shows that our customers prefer to see *normal* models for our clothing and we see no reason to change.""

Some of these brands had to have been making special versions in the size extra-small that these models were wearing. 

I'm all for clothing in a wide variety of sizes, but if your brand is ""plus-size only,"" don't show models wearing less than plus-size clothing."	anoushkawho	reply	na	na	na	0.9978910088539124	no	strong	no	na	BodyAcceptance	no prediction.
My problem is that they either go with super skinny models, or much bigger plus sized models.

Oh my god. Everything you said over here is so true. It‚Äôs almost heartbreaking how little effort they give while they design clothes for bigger women.

"Exactly. Like I think it's great to show much larger sized models wearing the clothes, size 20+ (uk size I think like US size 16) kind of thing, but here a size 12-14 (I think in US it's labelled 8-10) is pretty much average, but I never see models wearing those sizes, our models tend to be at least several sizes smaller than that, sometimes significantly. It makes it very difficult to determine size, particularly as even ""plus sized"" models tend to be very tall and often have particularly accentuated features, like a very large hip to waist ratio. Sometimes you'll get brands with models wearing a size 12, but the model is only that size due to height, so proportionally they are still very slender and don't really look like the average size 12."	anoushkawho	reply	na	na	na	0.9978910088539124	no	strong	no	na	BodyAcceptance	no prediction.

Title says it all. I have really poor body image. I struggled with body dysmorphia through about 18-22 to the point where I struggled to go outside and was delusional about the way other people saw me. It's gotten much better since then but I still don't do a lot of things like date or wear lots of things because of my discomfort with myself. I do get compliments but I'm totally unable to accept them, mentally. I just invalidate them automatically. I can't \*make\* myself believe them bc it almost feels like I'm lying to myself.

I am struggling with this too! I‚Äôm in anorexia recovery and I‚Äôm gaining a lot of weight and don‚Äôt even feel like myself at all. Just feel like a soul inside a body it doesn‚Äôt want to be in. Anyway I have been working on body neutrality and acceptance, and cutting out the negative self talk. EVEN if I believe the horrible things. I need to change the way I see myself if I want to fully recover. Where attention goes, energy flows. I want to stop strengthening the neural pathways I‚Äôve created that lead me to believe my body is ugly and wrong. And I am creating new beliefs by repeating affirmations and accepting and trusting that my body knows what it‚Äôs doing and it keeps me alive. I don‚Äôt have to like it, but I don‚Äôt have to hate it either. I am also in the same boat with relationships as well. I just want to be invisible to people so they don‚Äôt have to see what I look like because I‚Äôm ashamed. Genuinely I‚Äôm pretending I don‚Äôt have it. I‚Äôm trying to act as if I am not ashamed. Little steps here and there. Say positive things to yourself over and over even if it sounds so stupid and disingenuous. You have nothing to lose if you try.

Thank you so much for the reply and congrats!! I'm so happy for you!! I know I'm an internet stranger but I'm very proud of you for your recovery and excited for you in what's to come. It is indeed very painful, so I can't imagine what you've been through. I hear you on the pretending. For me, that's what it feels like too. I don't like my body yet, I may never like it, but I must act like I'm not afraid of being seen. At least for other people. And I hope in the long run, that starts to make it feel easier to be perceived... Affirmations are a great idea! I already do them, it's something I started in therapy, but I lapse in them constantly bc as you said, they don't feel true. I really struggle to create affirmations that are neutral and not about rating my body against other people's bodies or beauty standards. I almost get a sense of guilt using them too, like I'm lying to myself about how I really look. As if acknowledging I look horrible is supposed to knock me into my place or something, and that's supposed to somehow help! I hear you on needing to trust your body, I certainly don't trust mine, but it's something I need to build into my relationship with myself.

"I am on the skinnier side and my boobs aren't the biggest. I'm on the smaller side of the B-cups. Me and my group of friends were at a friend's place. Suddenly, a guy I barely know, tells me to eat more chicken. And I was like why? And he told me so that my boobs will get bigger. Suddenly, everyone burst out laughing, even me, because I was in shock and disbelief. I didn't know what to say. Then, a friend of mine reassured me, let's say his name is M, that there are guys like M who like girls with smaller boobs, and then the first guy said ""yeah, guys who surf, because she's like a board"" and everyone started laughing again.

"\[TW: Weight Loss and Hurtful Comments\] 

Mods, please remove if this is in violation of rules in any way. 

Right now, I can confidently say that I am not in a good place regarding my mental health. Lately, I have been really reflecting on how I got here. I have been asking myself how I lost touch with the imperfect, but secure, confident, joyful person I once was. I have been fighting to get back in touch with her.

In late 2019, I made a few changes WITHOUT the intention of changing my body. I was in an excellent, self-care oriented headspace, and I ended up losing a noticeable amount of weight. I didn't even notice this or think about it, just carried on as per usual. A turning point occurred when people around me began noticing and reacting openly. First, it was light ""compliments"" on the weight loss. I was surprised to hear these compliments, and relatively unaffected by them, and I would move on quickly. 

As time went on and the loss continued (not on purpose), the topic of the change in my body began to dominate my interactions with my friends and loved ones. People would go on and on in a way that made me feel very uncomfortable and objectified. Everyone would be standing around me, asking me ""how I did it"", what ""diet"" was I on, what was my secret? Making terrible comments about their own weight and comparing their own bodies to mine. Some of the ""positivity"" and ""compliments"" took a really ugly turn, and my weight loss was announced to everyone in a room as something everyone should congratulate me on. Some of it turned really dark and sour. More than once, I had the same individuals telling me that I was now too skinny, and people musing on whether or not I had an eating disorder right in front me. It was crushing. I was pushed to the point of tears a few times. 

More than anything else, it started a habit of fixating on myself and my appearance in a way that I NEVER had before. I began to feel the crushing insecurity and obsession with my physical appearance that I am now plagued with. These things truly had never even crossed my mind pre-2019. I took joy in my hobbies and interests and truly lived in the moment. 

The ""compliments"" and commentary on my weight loss boiled me down to my appearance, when I was and still am SO much more than that. Right now, I am trying so hard to dig myself out of this hole I am in and get back in touch with the version of myself that brought me the most joy. I really think that we have got change the dialogue surrounding weight loss and the commentary and compliments that follow weight loss. It has hurt me so deeply."	trivialbullshit	post	35.29762091483109	female	White	0.9872843027114868	na	na	na	3	BodyAcceptance	no prediction.

"TW: weight discussion, eating disorder

This is my first time posting here, so I hope I‚Äôm doing it right/not breaking any rules. I just saw a post on another subreddit that was filled with comments judging a young girl‚Äôs weight. Apparently it‚Äôs okay to bash a teenager on the internet now (I guess that‚Äôs really nothing new when it comes to fatphobia)? The commenters must surely have all been MDs with all the medical advice they were giving (she‚Äôs ‚Äúlikely on her way to diabetes‚Äù, etc.). I found one comment that I agreed with saying a child shouldn‚Äôt be dieting (according to much research on weight, health, and eating disorders, no one should really be dieting ‚Äî dieting is literally considered disordered eating by experts in the field [I studied under one]), but of course once they heard about the girl‚Äôs exact BMI (BMI is not at all a good predictor of health if you look at the academic research!) they made an edit to say ‚Äúactually, yes, they should be on a diet‚Äù. 

Anyways, sorry about the angry rant. The reason I think this has me so worked up is because I used to have an eating disorder and when I recovered my weight went up pretty drastically to what some would consider ‚Äúoverweight‚Äù (not a great term to use, but alas if you‚Äôre over society‚Äôs expectation for weight that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre considered). This is of course to be expected ‚Äî I was anorexic for years, my set weight went up after that, and some people‚Äôs set weights are where I am without having an eating disorder for years. Of course I got tons of opinions and ‚Äúexpert‚Äù advice from my family about how I should lose weight when my weight first went up (now people know that if they talk to me about my weight in any kind of negative way I will literally walk away in the middle of the conversation ‚Äî yay for boundaries!). Recently due to stress, depression, and vomiting (often multiple times a day) due to anxiety attacks, I‚Äôve lost some weight pretty rapidly. It‚Äôs really not ideal at all, and I‚Äôm worried that when I see myself becoming thinner I may fall into old ‚Äúhabits‚Äù (not eating or purging). I feel like no one cares/everyone thinks it‚Äôs good that I‚Äôm losing weight, which it really isn‚Äôt. So now I think I‚Äôm a little more sensitive to weight stuff right now, hence the rant.

Anyways, if you took the time to read this, thank you. If anyone has any words of encouragement as well, I would happily accept them."	RevolutionarySoul	post	34.5168149984941	female	White	0.9968249797821045	na	na	na	5	BodyAcceptance	no prediction.

I'm sorry to hear you're feeling triggered, I can empathise where you're coming from. As you already know I'm sure,  weight alone is not a strong enough predictor of someone's physical or mental health, but that's not something which everyone respects or appreciates sadly.

It's good though that you've got good insight and awareness of where you're at and what's going on, and as you say, that any weight loss you're experiencing isn't a good thing that others might automatically assume it is. 

I don't know what the answer is here, if I could wave a magic wand to make everything better I would!

The mind is a powerful tool. Almost as much as self love. Once you fully accept yourself, you can start to mold into what you believe in and care about. Please do not compare yourself to others. You have what it takes to be great. Don‚Äôt stop and start tearing down walls or building them up. Life is hard. Nothing that‚Äôs worth it is easy. Once you commit, you‚Äôll see the change you want. That could be spiritual, maybe a new passion or hobby, physical, emotional, or take a chance at a job of your dreams. The more work you put into whatever you care about the more you‚Äôll receive.

"I was about to post here yesterday, but even after reading through the rules I somehow managed to break one of them - apologises for that. ‚ù§Ô∏è Let's try again.

I am looking for tips on how to deal with some harsh comments from your family. I'm 31F and in some sort of a crisis with my mother, who is just not understanding my point _at all_. We've just had a massive argument over MY BODY, as I have ONCE AGAIN, told her that she is not allowed to comment on my weight or appearance.

I think I kind of lost it today when she posted the same old stuff to our family WhatsApp group. Sending me just another link to join an online diet plan, this time in front of the whole family. I've been through this same thing with her so many times throughout my life. I now finally told her that I believe this has all started in my childhood. I said I don't want to blame her because her intentions have been good... But it's impossible to ignore the fact that my experiences in childhood has affected my relationship with food, my confidence and mental health. And this has now hurt her feelings and she is accusing me for blaming her on the situation.

Basically, I've always been pushed to join diets and lose weight. My mom made me join Weight Watchers when I was 16 (the age limit is 18 but they allowed me in). After that, I tried multiple different diets - aaand always failed. Obviously. Always left me feeling like a failure. And my mom always reminds me of it. Comments about my weight and how I need to do something about it. And it always hurts, and she knows it. When I lived abroad, she used to send me stuff by mail and the parcel always had a weightloss article in it. I can't do it any longer. What I want, is to work on my fucked up relationship with food - but how can I do it when my own mom just won't stop doing this?! 

My family is the best really, I had a lovely childhood etc - but this has left me scarred. And I would like to think that they only mean good which is what makes this difficult. I've tried to explain to mom how much it hurts and that her comments don't help at all  - but she doesn't get it. Her final argument is always: ""But it's a health risk"". This time she said that the only thing to help me will be a surgery if I don't diet well enough. 

How would you deal with this? It's my body, it's my life, I'm 31 FFS. And I still feel so awful. Been down to the Memory Lane today and gosh it hurts. I hope this all made sense, my brain is so foggy today."

"I don‚Äôt know how useful this will be but I‚Äôve recently gained quite a bit of weight after going on new medication. I was looking for things to boost my acceptance of this as it‚Äôs unrealistic to expect to lose this weight, and I found a podcast called Maintenance Phase. It‚Äôs about wellness, health and diet from a position of science-based understanding and draws heavily from the experiences of one of the hosts Aubrey, who‚Äôs 300+lb and has been ‚Äúfat‚Äù since she was young. She talks about going to weight watchers as a child of about 12 and how that impacted her self esteem and experiences growing up. 

Again, I don‚Äôt know how useful this will be, but they talk a lot about the myth that being fat is bad for you. If your mum is trying to make you lose weight because she thinks it‚Äôs unhealthy then maybe try listening to a couple of their episodes to get some alternative, informed perspectives. 

The episodes probably most useful for you are ‚ÄúIs being fat bad for you?‚Äù, ‚ÄúThe obesity epidemic‚Äù, and ‚ÄúAnti-fat bias‚Äù. But the hosts are super charming and I‚Äôd recommend all their episodes tbh!

I generally don‚Äôt tell my parents anything about body acceptance or intuitive eating. They just shit on it and think it‚Äôs dumb. It‚Äôs not our responsibility to inform them or change their minds. It‚Äôs our responsibility to protect ourselves! It‚Äôs also not our responsibility to make them feel better about our life choices. If your mom is upset about your weight, then let her be. It‚Äôs not your problem. It sounds like you came from a family where you had to be somewhat responsible for your mom‚Äôs feelings when you were a child. It probably landed on your shoulders whenever she was upset about something. But now you‚Äôre an adult and so is she. If she‚Äôs upset she should deal with it herself. 

Is she obsessed with her own body too? If she is then you can use this to feel better about your own choice. Whenever I see my mom freak out about her own body it reinforces my path to body acceptance. I don‚Äôt want to be in my 60s freaking out about eating a muffin. My mom has wasted so much time, money and energy on diets. She‚Äôs been dieting for at least 40 years and it has done nothing for her. It‚Äôs all been wasted.

"My mother was the same way.  Made me do almost every diet she was on from the time I was 8. I wasn't a fat kid, she just decided that she didn't want  me to get fat.  Then when I got fat, she doubled down and got far worse.

You can try to train this out of her.

It's more than just saying ""Do not talk about my body.""  It's ""I have asked you before to not talk about my body. If you don't, I am leaving.""

And then walk out the door.   Every time she does it, leave, hang up the phone, whatever.

Chances all she will make this all YOUR fault. ""Why are you so cruel?"" ""How can you speak to me this way?""  ""I have the right to talk to you about this.""  etc.

No, no, no, and no.

It takes a while. It took months for my mother to learn to stop talking about my body, and even then she backslid from time to time.    Every time I ended it.

Because of this we went from talking regularly to infrequently.  This was not my fault. I didn't cause this to happen. She made the choices on how to talk to me and treat me.

Mind you, my mother was an insecure narcissist who made everything all about her.

"I (28F) just put a picture of me in high school (age 14-15) on my fb story. Someone who just saw me a month ago made this comment underneath: ‚ÄúYou lost a lot of weight üëèüèªüëèüèª‚Äù

The funniest part (or tragic depending on one‚Äôs point of view) is that I‚Äôm not even anything like what i looked like in that photo. I had very long blonde hair then, now I have a pixie cut.

But this person who looked at that picture didn‚Äôt even bother to notice that the ‚Äòwoman‚Äô she saw a month ago can‚Äôt possibly be that girl in that picture. Instead she directly looked at how my weight changed and decided to compliment me on that aspect which turned out to be an insult since it‚Äôs obviously the other way around. And of course this well-meant remark added to the list of body-shamings I‚Äôve been subjected to since I gained a bunch of weight this past year.

The bottom line is that even when a compliment is the intended outcome it‚Äôs not a good idea to comment on people‚Äôs weight or any other physical features.

"I'm a size 14ish person who struggles finding clothes between plus and straight size stores.  According to my doctor, I'm ""Class 1, almost Class 2 obese"".  I think I fit pretty firmly into what some people might describe as ""mid-size"".  I just call myself fat, but the term you use for yourself, I don't think that's the major issue this person is getting at.

It's that in the fat liberation movement, people like you and me, people who are visibly fat but not ""you know, like the *really fat* people"" we're the ones who get the most space in the public eye.  To non-fat people, if you were to ask them what a ""plus sized model"" looks like, they'd point to somebody like us.  And compared to fatter people, we've got fewer problems.  And when we go around saying stuff like ""I'm in an awkward middle spot where it's hard to find clothes that fit"" as if that makes us more oppressed because we don't ""fit in"" to either mainstream society OR fat positive spaces, .... no that's not really how things work.  The ability to buy clothes that look good is the tiniest of the many societal issues faced by fat people.  For every other one, the ability to physically fit into public accomodations, the ability to travel throughout the world without being shamed by others, the ability to access medical care, for all the important ones, we're significantly less oppressed than fatter people.

It's entirely appropriate that we aren't centered in the fat liberation movement.  We're the fat people with the fewest problems.  We still deserve to be there, to call ourselves whatever we're going to call ourselves.  But we should be actively making space for fatter people in the spotlight, and centering their issues, and not allowing people to accept us ""but not those really fat people.""  I think it's fair to keep that stuff in your heart.

&#x200B;

And also.... this might just be me, but I used to say that shit a lot, that ""I can't buy clothes at straight-sized stores, and I can't buy stuff at plus sized stores either""  But really... most of the issue was that I was spending most of my time digging for the 14's in the straight sized stores.  When I started spending most of my time shopping at the plus sized stores, I genuinely COULD find clothes that fit me with minimal tailoring, belting, or hemming.  And even now, I STILL prefer to dig for the 14's at the straight sized stores, because plus sized clothes are often ugly and expensive.  It's not like I'm excluded from plus sized stores.  It's that it sucks to be stuck in plus sized stores, and I'm PRIVILEGED to be able to SOMETIMES shop in straight sized stores."

I despise referring to fat people as ""fats.""  Apparently these fat people think we're not *people*.

I despise the idea that people have to be divided up by just how fat they are or aren't, especially while we're trying to get rid of the whole BMI classification bullshit.  None of them see the hypocrisy.

I have a particular problem with this poster because she not only uses offensive terms to classify fat people, but when I explained why it's all bad was told I am ""obviously not fat"" so I should shut up and sit down and let the fat people talk.   

And, I'll say this again: ""Body Positivity"" was invented by thin, able, white women who were angry that the Fat Acceptance movement, and the Body Acceptance movement that grew out of it, were getting attention and didn't specifically include thin, able, white women.  That's why a large number, if not the majority, of ""Body Positivity"" social media accounts are by thin, able, white women who are fatphobes and ableist and denigrate anyone who doesn't look just like them.

Anyways the main reason I like midsize (mostly fashion stuff) is because as a 14/16 clothes are weird. I‚Äôve read a lot that straight sized clothes are made for a size 4/6 then just scaled up to a 14. Then plus sized clothes are made for a 20 and scaled down. So at 14 straight sizes aren‚Äôt curvy enough generally and plus sizes are too roomy in the thighs/butt. The best fit is generally a straight sized curvy brand.

Like if someone were to ask how to describe my size I'd say plus size, but I like mid -size communities because in a lot of plus size communities smaller plus sizes aren't as welcome, often for understandable reasons, feeling there are too many of the smaller plus voices who still get some amount of thin privilege and that it takes away from the representation and community for people who are experiencing much more severe forms of discrimination. 

The people in mid-size groups share more of my issues and aren't going to get annoyed about complaints that are about things straight sizes don't experience but are less fatphobic/discriminatory/etc. than those in larger plus sizes.

If it's just the name that's the issue then fine call it something else, call it just by the size range or come up with some other term but I don't see why it shouldn't have its place."	Knotty_brain	reply	na	na	na	0.9891040325164795	no	strong	no	na	BodyAcceptance	failed
When it comes to sizes for clothes theres basically plus size and straight size. But honestly thats a pretty big range. Mid size to me seems to be more about a body type? Like not skinny not fat. It seems to not have a ‚Äúreal‚Äù meaning. i‚Äôm plus size though so to me it doesnt really matter. How some one describes their body is up to them though. I prefer curvy for myself but ive heard a lot of fat positive people kind of mock the term. If mid size means something to people and it suits them i dont see it as harmful.

I am estranged from my family because they don't respect the boundaries I set. Just my opinion, but it's not about the fatphobia. They can have their opinions, and given how hard it is for people to break fatphobia's hold on their lives when they are working towards it I don't think we can expect them to give it up easily either. BUT if you've set a boundary about the way they talk to you or their unrealistic expectations of you, then that's a whole different issue. They don't have the right to do that. So the question is whether you have clearly stated your boundaries in this area along with the consequences if they don't respect them. If you have, and they aren't then it's time for you to enforce the boundaries.	dave71us	reply	na	na	na	0.9988754391670227	no	strong	no	na	BodyAcceptance	failed

"[TW: discussion of ED/weight] This is a long one, I apologize, but I need some advice. So my partner (27M) and I (25F) are home visiting his family for the holidays and it has been lovely aside from one constant looming issue, his dad and step mom are extremely pushy and judge mental of our weight/bodies/food choices/exercise habits. Since our arrival it has been brought up multiple times a day every day. 

For some background, my partner and I are overweight but just do not prioritize weight loss in our lives right now. I have a history of severe disordered eating and have worked extremely hard to get to the other side and feel comfortable in my every day life. My partner‚Äôs step mom has an active eating disorder and is extremely restrictive and strict about what she‚Äôs ‚Äúallowed‚Äù to eat (the woman brings her own dressing to restaurants because she doesn‚Äôt trust the dressings available there) and his dad has picked up a lot of these behaviors as well and is obsessed with talking about weight loss and how good/bad foods are. 

Since we have arrived they have skipped at least one meal a day (usually both breakfast and lunch), banned Christmas cookies and dessert from the house, skipped Christmas dinner (we had a plain pork tenderloin and steamed broccoli instead), and keep making  subtle comments about how we shouldn‚Äôt be hungry or we should go on a walk or don‚Äôt need a snack or that we won‚Äôt be eating out at all while we‚Äôre here because everything in a restaurant is ‚Äúbad food‚Äù, it‚Äôs absolutely maddening.

I‚Äôm really struggling with all of it and frankly want to leave, but they have always been so kind and welcoming and we‚Äôve always loved them so nobody wants to step on their toes but I just feel like crap about myself and am struggling to maintain my healthy view of food/meals/my body. My partner is also pretty effected by it but he doesn‚Äôt have the same history so he‚Äôs been just ignoring it. How do I make it through the next 5 days without a full relapse into behaviors it took me years to overcome?

"I don't normally say this - I generally advocate for people trying to teach others to stop talking about food and bodies and the like - but in this case I say **IT'S TIME TO GO HOME**. 

This whole family is swamped in their own culture of disordered eating and obsession with body size and ""bad foods"" ([here are the only ""bad foods""](https://i.imgur.com/ZfP5g1X.jpg)) and other nonsense.

If they want to be judgy about themselves that's one thing but they are judging you and it is *at the expense of YOUR mental health*, at minimum.  And your BF should be understanding that this is damaging to you because he knows of your struggles and history.


It's time to pack up and leave.  People who are ""kind and welcoming"" do not make comments on other people's food intake and body shape or size and their exercise habits.

"First of all - go eat. Something with carbs, protein, and fat. Nice big snack. You can't take on insidious nonsense on an empty stomach. If you're already going to be miserable with what they say, you might as well be full. 

Second of all, I don't think it would be a fault for you and your partner to sit down with them and make your position clear. 

""We love you and we are so glad to have spent this festive season with you, it has been great. Unfortunately, we are struggling with some of the communication in the house. The way that is spoken about food and the way you act around food, are things that directly contribute to eating disorders. There is plenty of science around this. Due to my personal history I am sensitive to this kind of talk. I have to be careful what I listen to or hear, because I don't like the idea of ending up in the ICU, begging whatever God is out there to please oh pretty please give me cancer so I can be skinny. If we all continue to communicate about food the way we have until now, you will almost certainly put my life in danger.""

I don't think you can do anything about them skipping meals (I'm a menace for skipping myself), but you can ask that they don't announce it to the world that they aren't eating. They are really only doing it so they can feel morally superior, but since you and I know that food has no moral value, that's just silliness of the highest order.

It's also very valid to ask them to stop making comments on your body, food, and exercise. Simply put, those comments will NEVER produce a positive outcome for YOU, and so you shouldn't have to hear them. If they absolutely MUST whinge about oh-how-dare-she-consume-two-whole-oreos, I am sure they can do so in private where you won't be affected by it.

They might go ballistic and scream and yell. They might be taken totally unawares because they hadn't noticed what they were doing. They might be genuinely apologetic. Ya never know. But you don't deserve to suffer in silence. Your health shouldn't have to take second seat to their comfort. You and your partner need to confront them in order to cope.

Either way, I am sending you all the good vibes. The end of the year is always the hardest. Sometimes, focusing on small things can help keep your food intake steady. For me, ""my body needs fuel"" was never going to help me eat. I had to zoom in and focus on tiny things. ""If I don't consume enough protein, my muscles will get tired and I'll be sore tomorrow"" or ""if I eat this orange then that's free vitamin C and I dont have to worry about scurvy for oh, at least 3 more days"" or ""milk will keep my teeth strong and my dentist wont yell at me"".

"My family is like this unfortunately. If you are able to have the conversation with them and they listen, that‚Äôs fantastic!

Unfortunately my parents are too obsessed to give up so I have to sneak around instead. Here are some strategies I‚Äôve picked up:

* make excuses to leave in the morning or lunch time so you can go get a peaceful breakfast. Even if you just take food from home to go, it‚Äôs just nice to eat with just your partner and no judgement. 

* go to the grocery store with your partner and get some of your favorite snacks. My mom watches every single bite I eat at dinner. It makes me feel so icky I usually stop way before I‚Äôm full then I‚Äôm ravenous and feel out of control. If I keep secret snacks in my closet then I can go finish eating with my favorite snacks alone in my room. I know it sounds like secret binging, but keeping each meal to my usual level of fullness actually helps prevent any binging because then I can keep a level head. If I skip too many meals or finish way before fullness too many times then I‚Äôm prone to big binges on unsatisfying food because I wasn‚Äôt prepared. 

* offer to cook dinner and eat while you‚Äôre cooking. Syphon off some of the food as you prepare it so that you can get some nutrition before sitting down with them. 

In terms of dealing with her restrictiveness, I think the absolute best thing that helps me are pity and anger. When I see my parents restricting or doing disordered things I try to either conjure up a lot of pity for my parents being in their 60s and still having to worry about their bodies. Like how sad I would be if I still at 60 hated myself enough to bring my own dressing to a restaurant. Or I‚Äôll try to bring up anger. Anger that they pushed me into eating disorders. Anger that they make me not trust my internal signals. Anger can be really boundary reinforcing!

"Hello!

I'm new to this group and hoping I can get advice or ideas. Before I jump into where I'm getting stuck, I'd like to mention that I do currently have a therapist and I've also got a dietician for support in nutrition, so no advice needed there.

About 6 months ago, I suddenly gained weight. I've been mostly the same size for years, so this was very uncharacteristic and startling. The scale says 15 lbs, clothes say 2 sizes.

I'm struggling in 2 areas:
1. My body looks and feels different now, and because there's no measurable reason why, I'm having a hard time mentally catching up with it. I had an imperfect body before, I have an imperfect one now. But it's very odd to look in the mirror and see a body that isn't familiar anymore. Not knowing what caused the change is also disturbing to me (is something wrong?), hence the dietician appt.
2. I feel like a hypocrite. I've always been a big proponent of body positivity/acceptance, intuitive eating, health at every size, etc. I don't hate my body, but my struggles to accept it are making me feel like my beliefs only went skin-deep. I know that's not true (I don't look at anyone else's body and feel the same criticism that comes up when I look at mine), but has anyone else felt that? 

This is all messing with my head quite a bit.

Anyway, if anyone has been here and has tips for what helped them settle in and accept their body suddenly and unexpectedly changing, I would love to hear it!"	Dry-Cash-5174	post	23.329835437204856	female	White	0.9927000403404236	na	na	na	3	BodyAcceptance	no prediction.
"A sudden, unexplained weight gain is definitely something to talk to a doctor about.  Don't assume it's about what you eat; unless you've suddenly changed what you're eating, that's unlikely to be the issue.

There are many, many causes of sudden but unexplained weight changes. Some are more serious than others.  They can include:

- the onset of insulin resistance, a pre-cursor to type 2 diabetes, which can occur out of the blue or from diseases like PCOS

- the onset of other endocrine diseases like Cushing's

- hypothyroidism

- stress - just plain stress.  We're all going through a lot with this pandemic stuff and stress can affect how and when your body stores food as fat.

- other mental health issues, like depression

- something promoting edema, although you would notice a part of your body being more swollen than usual

- new medications (many mood disorder drugs, for example, promote weight gain)

If you can't easily explain it, you should talk to your doctor.

As for dealing with it - first rule out health problems, then realize that our bodies change as we age.  It's like finding your first 20 gray hairs or that new wrinkle on your face.  In a way they're badges of honor - you've lived long enough to show the changes of going through life. Many people do gain weight as they age, although it's not usually that quick."

"I really, really appreciate this.

Some of the health issues aren't things I've thought about. My dietician ran a thyroid panel on me earlier this year (normal), I'm not on any new meds (or psych meds), I get regular mammograms and pelvic exams to rule out cancer, but that still leaves a few options to consider. 

It's incredibly validating to know that the fact that I've suddenly, inexplicably gained weight is not the norm, which means my sudden concerns aren't all rooted in some deeply buried fatphobia. I've certainly watched my body composition change over time (heavier to lighter and back again), but nobody I've talked to yet believes me when I say this just isn't normal for me (or at least, hasn't been until now).

And thank you for reassuring me that body composition changes are a natural, normal part of aging!

"On the one hand, you're well past the end of puberty, which tends to end in women in the mid-20s. (Men can finish up as late as 30.)  On the other, you're slightly on the younger side for peri-menopause, which usually starts in the 40s. But nothing is impossible and the hormone cha-cha-cha might be an issue.  On the other hand, if you're taking a birth control pill that might negate the effects of peri-menopause. 

This is really why you want to talk to a doctor - or nurse practitioner or physician's assistant, if you prefer.  (I get my primary health care from an NP.)  Some dietitians are also RNs, but not all are.  You need someone who will look at your whole body and evaluate everything.

"My little sister, who's only 9 years old, is having issues with her body image. She's told me and others in the family several times that how she looks makes her feel sad. I'm looking for advice on how to help her with that and I hope this is the right place for asking, couldnt post in the body image subreddit because I'm not active in it. 

In our family we're always a little bit 'chubby' as children and the girls usually grow faster than other girls their age, so I understand that she looks 'bigger' in general compared to her friends but it's litterally just how she grows. She's healthy, very active (does dancing, biathlon, skates, exercises at home as well) and she is a very pretty girl. I just worry that it could become an unhealthy obsession, especially in a few years when she becomes a teenager. She's also got a cousin who died of anorexia, idk if there's an increased risk because of genetics or not but just fyi if it's relevant.

So basically I'm wondering how I could help. I understand that the issue is probably with media representation and societal expectations on girls bodies more than how she actually looks and as a guy, who hasn't had the same kind of issues, I feel that I'm not really equipped to help and could use some advice if anyone's willing to share."	simperererr	post	35.08042659651666	female	White	0.007490475196391344	na	na	na	11	BodyAcceptance	failed

I don't have a list of resources or anything, but my main advice would be to speak to any women in your family about it. If she is hearing them speak negatively about their bodies (or anyone belittling bodies similar to hers or otherwise) then she will pick that up. This is exactly what I did as a child - hearing my mother speak negatively about body parts that I saw on myself was devastating to my kid brain.	simperererr	reply	na	na	na	0.007490475196391344	no	no	no	na	BodyAcceptance	no prediction.

Elaine Su (elainesoup on Twitter) had [a long thread](https://twitter.com/elainesoup/status/1450176697156866051) on positive fat representation in kids' books that also want to portray diversity:

* Princesses Versus Dinosaurs (by Linda Bailey, illustrated by Joy Ang)
* Fry Bread: A Native American Story (written by Kevin Noble Maillard, illustrated by Juana Martinez-Neal)
* I Really Want To Win (Simon Philip and Lucia Gaggiotti) \[this might really resonate with your active little sis\]
* Abigail The Whale (Davide Cali and Sonja Bougaeva)
* Beautifully Me (by Nabela Noor, illustrated by Nabi H. Ali)
* The Bare Naked Book (written by Kathy Stinson, illustrated by Melissa Cho)
* Our Little Kitchen (Jillian Tamaki)
* The Oboe Goes Boom Boom Boom (story by Colleen AF Venable, pictures by Lian Cho)

For the grown-ups in your family and anyone who wishes to help - I'd say the Maintenance Phase podcast (by Aubrey Gordon and Michael Hobbes) is also a good place to learn the bad science behind health fads, and other systemic reasons behind fat discrimination. [Aubrey](https://www.yourfatfriend.com/) has written many articles generally on being fat in society.

"While you can always role model healthy behaviours, she is ultimately growing into her own little person, and one day will be her own adult. You can definitely boost her confidence now, saying the bullies are just jerks, etc. if you are really interested in helping her long term with positive perspectives that she can take to her adulthood and carry with her through her life, here are some things that can be sprinkled into your conversations:

- Think to yourself: What are the best parts of her, as a person? What are some things you admire about her? Communicate this often. If she has a lifelong struggle with body image, she‚Äôll be able to self soothe knowing she is a good person with special, unique qualities.
- Not giving too much emphasis or attention to these feelings. They do not have a seat at the table of her mind to help her be successful, in whatever way she defines ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù. They will pass. But knowing she is intelligent, relatable, curious- these are thoughts to focus in on.
- Teach her!! Watch a documentary about the male gaze and beauty standards. Teach her about photoshopping in the modelling industry. Knowing where her own doubts originate from, externally, will help her separate that part of her mind.
- She may be feeling a lack of control- talk about that. Where do those feelings originate from? Remind her of things she does have control of- even small things, like which movie you‚Äôll watch that night.

Again, you yourself will not have much control over her mental and physical health as she ages- but there are so many things you can do now to model healthy thinking patterns. It sounds like she looks up to you, so best to practice all these yourself, too. Best of luck"	simperererr	reply	na	na	na	0.007490475196391344	weak	no	no	na	BodyAcceptance	no prediction.
There is a lot of great art that has immortalized the beauty of women with bigger bodies. When I was a teen, an adult who cared about me took me to a museum to look at some of that art and talked to me about how the standards of beauty are personally defined. I recently heard on a podcast that only 20% of men want women who are thin. 20% love bigger women. And 60% literally don't care. Either is fine with them. We don't have to listen to that 20% with a restrictive sense of beauty, no matter how powerful they are in media. We can define beauty for ourselves.	simperererr	reply	na	na	na	0.007490475196391344	no	strong	no	na	BodyAcceptance	no prediction.

"(TRIGGER WARNING ‚Äî I used to have an eating disorder years ago and still struggle w body image) 
Not looking for anyone to judge me here. This place should be free of any criticism.

I really try not to beat myself up over this, but every time I have certain events in my life that make it hard for me to exercise daily, I notice the change in my body within a week, and it really discourages me. Recently ive been working seasonal in retail and as you know the holidays are super busy. I even got sick a few days ago and had to stay home. This resulted in barely moving around for 3 days. 
I realize that when im not active im more tired and i get in this habit of not exercising, which sucks because I genuinely enjoy my work outs, and the feeling I get knowing im closer to my goal (which is honestly staying healthy enough to go hiking and do full push ups)

I know exactly how you feel. I‚Äôve struggled with body image since my early teens and also had eating disorders in the past. I find my body changing all the time and I can‚Äôt tell if it genuinely is or its just my perception of how I look depending on my mood. It can be really hard to motivate yourself to exercise or even find the time. I find its easier if you have someone else to exercise with. Also making small changes to diet that might not affect your weight but make you feel better about yourself. Even if its just as simple as putting cucumber in your water.

"Long time lurker, first time poster. As AMAB, I have had a life long condition that has put my hormones at odds and for years has caused much distress and even bullying well into adulthood. I have what is known as Gynecomastia, where my testosterone and estrogen are out of balance and both fight for dominance.  This has caused my body to become feminine in some places and male in others, most notable in the chest where I have developed prominent breasts requiring support. While I am not alone in my condition,  it's not as common as the more common ""man boobs"" of overweight men and is easily mistaken as just a trip to the gym will fix it.

It has taken me years to accept my body for what it is while maintaining my masculine birth. While it's still a struggle at times dealing with a trait that society deems ""for women only"", these days I am at peace with my body and am learning to enjoy life as I should be. It is possible.

"For me, this is terrible to admit, but I got over my body hatred when I worked as a lifeguard at a waterpark.  I spent 8 hours a day every day for a summer looking at people in their bathing suits, and one day, about 2 months into working there, I realized, hang on, there are a LOT of fat people here!  And there wasn't a single moment in my time working there that I thought ""geeze, that person is so fat, I can't believe they'd wear that in public.""  Now that I thought about it, there were tons of people there, old people, weird-looking people, people much fatter than me, that not only had I not been judging, I didn't even notice them.  I didn't even have a passing thought about them and how they look.  I would never think of a single one of them ""that person shouldn't be out here in their bathing suit.""  So why shouldn't I?

So if you ever have the opportunity, if you ever feel like you're having a good day and can take yourself out of the house for a few hours, it might be valuable to sit yourself down on a bench in a high traffic area, have a cup of coffee in a Starbucks in a Target or something, and see if you can find a stranger who you think looks so bad they shouldn't leave their house.

Like you, in my early stages of self-acceptance, I had less difficulty with what strangers thought of me, and more fear of what my friends and family thought of me.  And that allowed me to experiment with being more confident and doing things I'd normally be scared to do in places nobody knows me.  Not giving a crap what other people think is a skill you gotta practice just like any other.  If it's easier to get out in front of strangers, maybe that means that making it a habit to go do stuff in front of strangers will make it feel less scary to do stuff with your friends and relatives?

"I can‚Äôt believe there is a sub on Reddit where people are openly fatphobic and ‚Äúdismantle‚Äù the concept of fatphobia. Someone said fatphobia isn‚Äôt like homophobia because queer people are born queer and fat people aren‚Äôt born fat but if you use that logic then people who were disabled after birth can‚Äôt say they face ableism. There are a variety of factors that can contribute to someone being overweight, like mental health, poverty, health reasons and many more things that happen after birth. It‚Äôs Honestly heartbreaking to see how some people think. 
Anyways I have a hard time deciphering what someone‚Äôs intentions are when they say or do something backhanded because I‚Äôm not only overweight but I‚Äôm also a black woman. 

One example of a fatphobic microaggression I can think of is when I was 13 around the holidays my older cousin cooked a feast for thanksgiving. I ate a few bites of macaroni and got full. When she heard that I was no longer hungry she got angry. I guess she expected me to eat more than I did because I was the biggest. She cracked a few jokes about my eating to everyone then wanted me to continue eating despite the fact I was full."

"not sure if this counts but once i bought a tray of food. it‚Äôs typically for 1 person but it‚Äôs a very full meal. at university, students either share it with one other person or they save the rest for later. i usually save the rest for later.

i hadn‚Äôt eaten the whole day (it‚Äôs 7pm now and i woke up at 8am). and i just bought this food and sit down to eat with my other ‚Äúfriends‚Äù. the skinniest one makes a comment about that being so much food. ‚Äúoh my god you‚Äôre gonna eat all that, that‚Äôs so much food‚Äù in front of everyone. i live in nyc and it‚Äôs the typical street food they sell in the styrofoam trays. everyone gets the same size. literally everyone. hundreds of students buy this on a daily basis, even her friends. 

ive literally seen her buy this too. she‚Äôs never said anything except to me. because i‚Äôm bigger than everyone. 
they don‚Äôt sell a smaller size. it‚Äôs one size for all. i hadn‚Äôt even taken more than 2 bites yet and she‚Äôs commenting on the amount of food i eat. i was planning to save it for later too. 

then on a later day on her instagram, she posts about how‚Äôs she‚Äôs obsessed with food and loves food and shows off her packed lunch everyday. 

so it‚Äôs okay for her to be obsessed with food because she‚Äôs skinny. it‚Äôs not okay for me to buy food with my money and eat a meal when i‚Äôm hungry. i had taken 2 bites but it shouldn‚Äôt matter to her how much i ate. she shouldn‚Äôt be making negative comments about my food or anyone else‚Äôs"	Topixal	reply	na	na	na	0.9984347224235535	no	strong	no	na	BodyAcceptance	failed
"Honestly, I struggle to pick up microaggressions, because they all feel pretty damn macro. People dont bother hiding their fatphobia with layers of ""good intent"" like they do with racism or homophobia. It's pretty much accepted that ""fat people are morally inferior and don't deserve the same respect as others, because they are morally inferior"". But, as for examples --

Not being invited to parties as a kid, because ""we were going to a theme park and you are too big to go on the rides"" or ""we were going to get dinner at a fast food place and we know that's not good for you"".

Being VEHEMENTLY ""cheered on"" in gym class when having to do... well, anything.

Being told I ""need"" xyz makeup to ""make up for everything else"". Babe, look at my skin. It's nigh flawless. Your xtra full coverage smashbox foundation won't make me skinnier.

""I'm sorry, we don't have anything for you here in our store."" Sweetheart, I know. I couldn't LOOK at a pair of your jeans without bursting a seam. But you sell socks and jewelry and bags dont you?!

When it's presumed I don't date a lot. I mean, you're not wrong, but I doubt that it has ANYTHING to do with my butt, and more to do with the fact that I hate socializing.

And then of course, the ""lets talk about your weight"" convo every time I see my physician. Buddy, lets talk about the fact that you've been my doc for a whole decade and yet I had to find out I am literally missing vertebrae from a PT. Let's talk about my cyclical EDs.

I was at my gyno (young teen me) for issues unrelated to weight. She always bagged on me about it, but one thing that stands out to this day is that she told me to avoid ""anything that comes in a plastic package"".

It really sets me off when I see people pushing this rhetoric that all fat people put themselves there by choice-- as if someone would *choose* to be discriminated against interpersonally and systemically. As if someone would make a decision to live in a larger body in a world that is eager to remind you that you don't 'fit' into it.

At an LGBT teen group in the 90s, I asked a girl why she came over and said hi to me, because she introduced herself first.

"I like this post bc it speaks to how most people heard some sort of negative comment about their body during a critical time period where it solidified as a life long insecurity. I was just talking to my middle school friend about this a week ago. We were both reflecting on the fact that we both carried wounds from comments people made to us when we were young that wouldn't bother us now. 

My parents made a few comments when I was younger about how I was chubby and had baby fat that would probably melt away when I was in adolescence. That ended up being the start of my obsession with my weight because that was when I first realized other people saw something wrong with my body, especially when my ""baby fat"" did not actually disappear. 

A few other people made comments about me being fat or ugly throughout middle school in the mean way that kids do. I've forgotten most of those specific comments, but I know for a fact they solidified into some of my worst body issues. I often feel possessed by the idea that I'm extremely ugly and extremely fat and I know I only heard those things from a few different people and among them were close friends.  

Also my dad made small negative comments about my body throughout my life that just had a mean tinge that stuck with me. I remember he called me a cow once when I was younger. When I was 18, my dad told me that I lost my youthful glimmer and was starting to look old. Since then, I've been preoccupied with signs that I'm aging, even though I know he made the comment in spite. I have had deepening nasolabial folds since I gained weight in my face and I can't stop thinking about how old they make me look üò¢

Still, it's helpful to know a lot of these insecurities I have formed when I was younger. It tells me that I may feel like they are true, but there is no ""truth"" they are necessarily rooted in. There's no objective truth that I'm unattractive. I can form my own understanding of attractiveness and I can learn to love myself."	saany7	reply	na	na	na	0.9963293671607971	no	strong	no	na	BodyAcceptance	failed

"My mom dragged me into Weight Watchers, too. This was in the 1960s and '70s, long before ""points.""  They used to weigh you in front of everyone else and loudly announce whether you'd lost (in which case everyone would clap).  Staying the same weight was shamed as much as they'd shame you if you gained. 

My mother also pulled stupid shit with candy.  The best part was that she'd very carefully portion it out, allocate certain bags to us kids (less for me, of course), and then the second we were asleep, she'd go eat it all.

Bonus: I had no need of dieting at the time, but my mother was so sure that she had to put me on a diet or I'd be fat.

When I was eleven and I discovered that I had stretch marks on my thighs, the first thing my mom told me was that stretch marks happen when you gain weight too quickly. That I should try my hardest not to get any more. They were permanent and I could never get rid of them, like a tattoo. And my mom hated tattoos.

When I used to go shopping with my mom for clothes, she‚Äôd manipulate me into buying clothes that were too small for my body. She‚Äôd try to use them as a motivator to get me to lose weight. I never lost the weight to fit into them, and instead, from the ages of nine to fifteen, I wore clothes to school that were too tight and very uncomfortable.

My mom has physically ripped food out of my hands before.

She used to pat my stomach when we were out in public.

If we went to a restaurant and I ordered something with a lot of pasta or bread, my mom would make sure to tell the waiter ‚Äúyou can tell she‚Äôs the one who likes carbs in the family‚Äù

And it wasn‚Äôt as though I was a fat kid growing up. I was a normal little kid with a normal amount of body fat and a normal child-size tummy. But because of the way my mom talked to me about my body, I believed her and spent some of the earliest years of my life negatively obsessing over my self-image.

I don‚Äôt think any other seven-year-old in my second-grade class was worried about how fat they looked.

When I was in fifth grade and I needed a training bra, my mom told me that it was because I was eating unhealthily. I felt so ashamed to have breasts. 

When I was twelve and I decided that I no longer wanted to play field hockey, I was so scared that my mom would think less of me because I wasn‚Äôt doing something athletic. I thought that she‚Äôd see me as even fatter and grosser than she had before.

In eighth grade when everyone was hitting puberty and growing up, my mom would point out how all the other girls my age were thinning out and I wasn‚Äôt. It made me feel horrible. I felt like I was doing something wrong.

I ate the same foods as everyone else, but to my mom, my body was never good enough. 

And now even though she‚Äôs cooled down somewhat, I still struggle.

I struggle with my self-image. I struggle with eating in front of people. Clothes shopping is so dysphoric and almost always ends in me crying. If my mom is in the kitchen and I‚Äôm hungry, I wait for her to leave. If I‚Äôm out to dinner with her, ordering what I want always results in a myriad of poking and prodding; ‚Äúooh, that looks good, my body can‚Äôt handle all that grease and fat.‚Äù ‚ÄúAre you really going to eat all of that?‚Äù 

One time my friend was over at the house, and we were eating cookies. I asked my mom if I could have another, and she immediately took the cookie box out of my hands and told me how crazy I was for wanting another one because of their calorie count. My friend told me he felt sorry for me that my mom was willing to do that and embarrass me in front of my friend. It wasn‚Äôt until then that I fully realized that my mom is the one with the problem, not me. 

Since having that realization a few months ago, I've started appreciating myself more. I've never felt more myself than I do right now. I can look at myself and be proud of who I am. I don't tear myself apart every time I look in the mirror. I don't force myself to skip meals. I don't discount myself. I am amazing on my own. My body is absolutely a fucking temple and it's beautiful and incredible and so fucking powerful. My body is going to do what it wants. It's okay for me to have stretch marks. It's okay for me to have breasts. All of that shit is normal. My mom has her own problems and I can choose not to listen.

"Yesterday one of my friends and my mam commented a picture of me and told me things like I look ''like a man'' and my smile is weird. I didn't even ask them to look at the picture. They probably just wanted to tease me but it hurt and made me quite sad because I thought that this picture of me is not too bad. I deleted the picture afterwards. I am not conventionally beautiful, but I have been trying to accept what I look like and I don't actually think I am so hideous, but now I am wondering if the perception I have of myself is wrong and all people can see is this ugly creature that I apparently am.

"That person is not your friend.  Friends don't make fun of their friends' appearances like that.  Honestly, most people who think they're hideous are actually average-looking, both because society is constantly exposing us to much-prettier-than-average people, and because, definitionally, most people in general are average-looking.  I'm not going to pretend looks don't matter, because they do, but they shouldn't, and anyone worth your time will be interested in spending time with you because of the person you are, not how you look.

"I can tell you that you are not the one who is ""ugly"" in this situation. ugly is only on the inside, and teasing, or even just commenting, on appearances is as ugly as people can get.

body/beauty neutrality is a real good state of mind to work towards. you don't need to look pretty or nice. and for sure you don't have any obligation to value yourself in terms of beauty. for whom? others? the patriarchy? companies who make profit off of your unhappiness?

"While desperately looking for that chic ethnic FIT I can slay in for Diwali, I came across this awesome sleeveless Kurti which was perfect...but it was sleeveless that means SHAVING! 
God, why! But wait why do we HAVE to shave if we hate it so much. Let's be honest making ourselves go through hot wax and exorcist level yanking or bleeding to death while shaving is like self-torture just to look good (in the eyes of society). If it is that painful why do we make ourselves go through it? 

Did you see the movie Khiladi? The one where Akshay Kumar was seen flaunting his body hair. Wouldn't it be amazing if we saw women flaunting theirs too? 

Have you seen animals shave their body hair? There's a reason why we have body hair. It keeps mammals warm. It protects the body against trauma and also against ultraviolet damage. In human beings, specialized hairs such as eyelashes and hairs inside the nostrils and external ears afford some protection from the environment. Eyebrows prevent sweat from getting into the eyes. Scalp hairs may assist in stabilizing the temperature of the brain. Hairs can also excrete toxic substances like arsenic, and are thus of use in forensic medicines. As every dermatologist knows, the physiological functions of hairs are immeasurable.

We all go through puberty. Hairy or otherwise it's one's choice to either keep the hair on our body or not. Society or your friends can't shame you for your body hair. There is a reason why we were born with the same. It protects us from so many unimaginable things. Imagine not having eyelashes or nostril hair, then how will you survive the dust that affects your body? All I want to say is let's continue to break the barriers and show that beauty is diverse and you don't have to be a certain stereotype to be beautiful. 

When you look at the world, the world isn't just one palette. It's a rainbow. So, say goodbye to your inner critic and take a pledge to be kinder to yourself and others too.

Hi everyone. I'm new to the subreddit and the community in general. I'm a large guy with a small penis so I never had much confidence with women. I recently had sex for the first time with someone who made me feel special and seen. It made me realize how badly I've been treating myself for how I looked and how my body is. I realized I need to work toward healing the relationship with myself. I also want to surround myself with more understanding and accepting people like her. I'm scared and excited about where this journey will take me and I have hope I will end up in a better place. I'm looking forward to reading about and interacting with everyone.	bigcan88	post	24.67274293430992	female	White	0.0012185390805825591	na	na	na	3	BodyAcceptance	failed

I'm glad you found someone to have that experience with!  It can be so easy to only see our deficiencies, or to hold ourselves to unrealistic standards.

Im just asking because in places where there is enough light, especially when you can see the shine in my eyes, I look like a literal supermodel, but in lighting where the light is exposed directly in front of my face or a few others, I look uglier to myself.

"When someone talks about separating all humans into two groups, one called ""attractive"", and one called ""unattractive"", they usually mean one of two things. Either they mean that *they* consider some humans attractive, and some not, and they group up humans on that basis, or they mean that *a specific segment of humanity's culture* has generally agreed that some are attractive, and some not. There is also a third option that doesn't use the concept of ""attractiveness"" to be a property of a human, but instead a property of a relationship between two specific humans: e.g., ""X is attracted to Y"".

In all three of these possible interpretations, your question does not make sense.

If what you mean by ""attractive"" refers to what *you* consider attractive, then there's no reason to ask others what they think. What we think is not relevant to whether a person fits in your personal ""attractive"" category or not.

If what you mean by ""attractive"" refers to what *a specific segment of humanity's culture* considers attractive, then it still doesn't make sense to ask others what you did in a forum like this. Generally, there is agreement on what a specific culture finds attractive at the very top end and at the very bottom end, but there is very little agreement in the middle. In the US today, for example, psychologists can show photos of people and get general agreement on the top 5% or so being attractive, but for people below that, there is a lot of variation in the relative ""attractiveness"" that subjects will score. Additionally, when you do the same experiment with people in a different country, you get vastly different results; and while I don't know of any studies that have done this, I imagine that you'd also get vastly different results if you repeated the same experiment across 50 year time spans. Beauty standards differ across space and time. In any case, it doesn't make sense to ask a forum what we think about attractiveness when studies consistently show that *any* flaw will cause people to have great variation in rating a person's attractiveness.

Finally, if what is meant by ""attractive"" is a relational term between two people, rather than a category term for a single person (this is what I think is the best way to think about attractiveness), then your question *really* does not make sense. You can't just say: ""X is attractive""; you have to say ""X is attractive to Y"". If you are asking if someone is *generally* attractive, then you have to say something like ""X is considered attractive to N+% of this culture's current population"". In my opinion, this is the only real way to think sensibly about attractiveness. For every person, there is someone who will find them unattractive and someone who will find them attractive. Neither is right nor wrong about this; it's just that attractiveness differs wildly between different sets of people.

I also want to point out that physical beauty (such as how you look in particular lighting), is only a small part of what is meant by attractiveness. We humans are attracted by many different things: a person's humor, their personality, a shared interest, a drive to work hard, a charitable demeanor, or any of a number of other things that have nothing to do with how one physically looks. If you meant to ask a question about physical beauty, then don't just use the term ""attractiveness"". Attractiveness is just so much more than merely how appealing one's appearance is to another person.

Having said all that, I'll still answer your original question. ""Attractiveness"" isn't a lifelong quality, even in the relational context. You find yourself attractive in one light, and not in the other. That's okay. Attractiveness is a temporary thing, sometimes lasting mere seconds. That's why photographs can look so good in one moment, and yet a photo taken mere seconds later in a different lighting can spark a very different reaction.

You ask: Are you attractive even though in one lighting you consider yourself to look amazing and in another uglier? My reply: Are you considered thirsty if you want water in one moment but don't want it in another? Are you considered cold when you shiver in one climate but sweat in another? The true answer is what you've already said in the original post: you are attracted to yourself in one moment, but not in another. That's okay. We're not always at our best. The most honest of us sometimes lies; this doesn't make them ""a liar"". The most neat of us sometimes makes messes; this doesn't make them slovenly. To you, you are attractive in one moment, and not attractive in another. There is no such thing as being attractive to all at all times; your attractiveness is a function of who is looking at you, when it is happening, and what you are doing in that moment.

Also remember that this is *your* perception, not others' perceptions. There are some people out there who will find you attractive in both contexts; and there will be people who find you unattractive in both contexts. Ultimately, you need to become more comfortable with not thinking about attractiveness in the way that caused you to ask your original question in this forum. Attractiveness just doesn't work the way that you imply that it does in your original question."	sycamore98	reply	na	na	na	0.9913631677627563	no	no	no	na	BodyAcceptance	failed

"I was experiencing a lot of body shame and guilt about eating today. I was getting ready for bed and happened to look in the mirror half undressed and was comparing my body posed vs candid, criticising my candid body and wishing it looked how it did when I suck in and work my angles. I don't know why, but I decided to take photos of both, by setting up a self timer. 

I know a lot of people don't find these kind of images helpful or empowering, and maybe not when it's someone else. But weirdly, putting the two images side by side felt really affirming. For some reason right now I feel more self connection and compassion.

"I've (25F) been talking to a girl I met on the apps for a while now. She's postponed our first date twice and is very active and fit. I usually don't make disclaimers about my body, I just let the full body photos on my app speak for themselves. Today she made a comment about being chubby after eating xyz, and she's made diet talk and body comments about herself before, so I asked to make sure she knew what my body looks like. She said she didn't mean it offensively but ultimately was offended for not feeling she can say anything without being judged (earlier I had asked for clarification on how she felt after she replied just ""ok"" to another topic where I thought I offended her with my boundaries, I thought she was upset/being short). It's so hard to discern tone from texts and it's mercury retrograde, so I'm hoping someone here can understand where I'm coming from. I shouldn't have let my past experiences and insecurity effect me but I did.

Edit: this was supposed to be titled ""miscommunication and..""

Edit 2: Thanks everyone who responded and validated my gut feeling. I agree that she didn't respond well, and overall is not what I'm looking for in a partner. Even if she didn't mean anything by her comments she should have been able to apologize, communicate respectfully, and not put all the blame on me.

Your boundaries are your boundaries. There's nothing wrong with telling people how fatphobic comments and rhetoric make you feel. If that's not a boundary that they can respect, then the kindest path for both of you is to part ways.

Not to mention, who talks about that (diet talk and weight gain) with a random person from a dating app? Even if you weren't a random person and were a friend, she doesn't have to force that kind of negativity onto you. She choose to say those things.

To be real, no one who is complaining about how ""chubby"" they've gotten to someone who is chubbier/fatter than them thinks positively about your body. They might let you be, because they can't control you, but they definitely don't think of fat bodies in a positive light. There IS nuance such as knowing that a thinner body gets treated better and therefore wanting to be thin to get more privileges but that kind of person most likely wouldn't subject you to their constant diet talk and fatphobic talk because they're socially aware.

She most likely thought you didn't like your body too and since you are bigger than her she probably felt you would coddle her and be like ""Nooo you're not!! You're soooo skinnyyyy"" and feed her ego."	kepave	reply	na	na	na	0.9987761378288269	weak	no	strong	na	BodyAcceptance	failed

Pinterest has saved me when it comes to picking out my wardrobe (40 yr old size 18/20 for reference). May I first suggest looking up what a capsule wardrobe is? I have one, and it‚Äôs honestly been the best. Secondly find models that look like your body type and start putting together looks that you like. I have a spring/summer board and a fall/winter board. Twice a year I hit the thrift shops with my Pinterest board and I try to find outfits exactly like the ones I‚Äôve pinned. Leave plenty of time for trying on stuff and figuring out what you‚Äôre comfortable in. And please please please remember that just because your 55 doesn‚Äôt mean you still can‚Äôt rock a cropped t, a leather jacket and a tulle skirt. Own it. Also, take some time looking at accessories. You can dress up a suit jacket, a white t, and a pair of jeans by simply adding a few statement pieces, a scarf, or some nice boots and a hat. Don‚Äôt be afraid to go outside the box. I never thought I was a hat person until I found ones that actually looked good on me.

So, I'm in Australia but I do have some advice! Firstly, high-waisted straight leg cuts are the most flattering for curvy people BY FAR. It makes you look so good as it draws in the waist, and the straight leg cut balances out the leg. A few pairs of pants in that style and you'll look amazing. Secondly, wear high waisted things and tuck in your shirt, or at least partially tuck. Again, this will accentuate the waist and give the hourglass look, plus it's very stylish if I do say so myself as a 24 year old. Also - seconded! Cropped items are great (especially paired with the aforementioned pant), as they elongate the leg.	auntpama	reply	na	na	na	0.9991031885147095	no	strong	no	na	BodyAcceptance	failed
"I'm close to your size and the same age and I had pretty good luck with Stitch Fix. I realize that could be way out of your budget; they aren't cheap. 

That said, my style is likely not yours, so I'm not going to be offended if you throw the rest of this post out the window. :D. I tend to do very classic styles--straight-leg pants/jean, tunics. I do wear leggings.  When I'm in the office, it's a basic button-down white blouse with a black blazer. I jazz things up with jewelry, scarves and hair toys. 

Personally, I avoid most patterns, especially big floral ones. They contribute to the Little Old Lady look, IMO. I also don't tend to wear blouses with a lot of gathers in front.  I never wear peplum because it will stick straight out even though I have a high waist:hip ratio.

Be careful with cardigans. Make sure you get them the right length for your body. Some will make you look grandmotherly.

Some department stores will have personal shoppers who interview you and pick things out for you according to your preferences, but in cuts that work, no obligation to buy. When I did this years ago, I didn't pay for the service.  I think Macy's does this now. Nordstrom probably does and if you can hit the sales just right they're affordable.

"First off, great job taking back your power! Love yourself with all you've got, because it's all you've got! :) That said, sometimes it can be easier said than done!

The conditioning/programming of the world DOES NOT dictate our true worth, even tho that is what it's conditioned to do (keep us in lack/fear mentality). FEAR: False evidence appearing real.  How much time is wasted worrying or self-shaming due to not accepting ourselves as we are. Think of how much time is thrown away by living in fear or anxiety about how we look or not fitting into the mold of artificial standards. It makes us fearful of owning and having the power to become creators and our best selves. If you have a harmful or negative thought about yourself, remember, it is not true and only becomes true if you allow it. Harnessing that power that we have been conditioned to give away is where I've found peace and taking that power back. My worth is not based on anyone else or what is deemed acceptable today and not tomorrow. Finding a deep stillness, confidence and peace inside yourself helps to keep you grounded and to stay sovereign. Meditation is a fantastic tool. It is great all around for the betterment of the self, awareness, acceptance, forgiveness...so much more. 

If you do fall back into a harmful way, be soft and kind to yourself. Don't beat yourself up, don't guilt or shame yourself. Acknowledge what triggered you and forgive yourself and do better next time. Every moment is a chance to change your thinking. It's just like introducing a new good habit into your life. Repetition is key. It doesn't happen overnight. Continue forgiving yourself and letting it go, continue learning to love yourself even if at moments that may be difficult. You are beautiful, unique and there is only one of you.

"I am heated and need to vent. I posted on an emotional support discord server asking to talk to someone about weight and body image. I specifically said that I wanted someone to listen to me. I am having anxiety at work, and the emotional support hotline I call isn't picking up.  When a poster offered to help me out over DM, he then asked me ""why is this so important to you"" within 5 min of talking. I shared a bit about what I was struggling with, and he asked that question. I told him that his question isn't helpful. I ended the convo, bc I didn't think we were a good match. 

Does anyone not like having to explain why body image is an important issue? To me, there's so much information out there on why it is important. In fact, I think it's common sense that many women struggle with body image concerns. I don't want to be in a position where I have to educate someone on something that is naturally important to a lot of women (and some men). 

I complained to one of the mods on an emotional support server. The posters on there pride on being empathetic. Everyone has the right to feel upset over they are struggling without having to explain ""why."" Sometimes, there isn't a clear reason.  

For those who say ""maybe he was trying to help or get you to think, l have analyzed the issue on my own of why body image is important to me millions of times over the years. What I was looking for empathy...not being prodded on how my issues came about.

"One of the reasons I just joined this subreddit is because I got a lot of hate on another subreddit for explaining why an overweight girl might have said something along the lines of ‚Äúif you don‚Äôt find me attractive that‚Äôs your problem‚Äù. I took it rather than being conceited as more of a pushback from how much people concern themselves with women‚Äôs appearances, how many actually get annoyed if they don‚Äôt find a woman attractive because she‚Äôs overweight, has piercings, tattoos, short hair, certain make up etc. I feel like as a woman you get so much off this, from both men and women, though honestly I see it more from guys. It can make it very difficult to exist and feel positive about how you look when any deviation from the standard beauty Queen look is going to incite comments on your appearance (both negative and positive).

I think a lot of men just don‚Äôt understand this, and they probably don‚Äôt think much on how they don‚Äôt give overweight men as much grief as overweight women. They probably don‚Äôt realise that when they involve their own personal preferences in their judgement of women they‚Äôre essentially so entitled/in their own bubble that they feel others should alter their appearances to suit their personal tastes, even if the person they‚Äôre judging is a stranger. 

In a world that will judge your right to exist by your appearance and body weight, how could it not be important to you?

My youngest niece and nephew never said anything about my weight until they started school. One day I was visiting and they kept saying, ""Auntie is **FAT**!""  We adults looked at each other - the oldest kid never said this before, so they were obviously picking it up from school.    

We started asking why they were saying this, but they couldn't yet grasp the link between saying it and a reason behind it.  Finally, the oldest kid said, ""Auntie has always been fat.  It's just how she is.""  And that stopped it.

"If body weight as a child was the same thing as body weight as an adult, we'd all be fat.  Fat on babies is as normal as breathing. 

It's normal for your body to change during puberty, including where weight settles.

If you're female, puberty is when PCOS can declare itself existent, which can influence weight gain. Of course not all women have PCOS, and of course it's not the only factor in normal weight changes.

Women don't fully end puberty until somewhere in their mid-20s, and then other things can influence weight.

I also struggled with an eating disorder, and I'm currently in recovery. The best advice I ever read was to view diet culture like toxic air that everyone breathes but doesn't smell. Because it's so deeply imbedded in society, it's second nature for people to comment on eachothers body's and imply it is a matter of character rather than biology to control. 

What's helped me was I started looking for the scent. Notice how often only skinny women are shown in television shows, advertisements, are chosen as the epitome of beauty. Look around, how accurate is that portrayal? Now I only follow body positive accounts that affirm that women don't need to be skinny to be beautiful and are genuinely hot af. 

Don't participate in her body comments. She's inevitably going to say something, but instead of engaging with her, I would suggest saying ""My body is the least interesting thing about me. Let's discuss something else."" 

Call it out to yourself whenever you see it. ""drop the last 10 pounds"" ""lose the baby weight"" ""weight loss solutions"" Our society is fixated on the ridiculously rigid standards of being ""beautiful"" aka taking up as little of space as possible.

You are allowed to take up space!!! women being pressured to be the smallest version of themselves is a product of patriarchy. By forcing us to starve, thus fixate on food and our bodies, we have little mental capacity left to control the messages being told to us

"Recently, my girlfriend told me she is likely to get a waist trainer. After further discussion, we made some conclusions together. She doesn't like her body.

I think that there is too much correlation between the two subjects and that she is getting one not for the ""feel"" but rather the look.

"It might be helpful for you both to do some research about the types of shape wear (an industry that makes money by getting people to chase that ever changing ‚Äúideal‚Äù!).

If it‚Äôs just the hug, I feel like something soft like spanx is more along those lines since it doesn‚Äôt aim to permanently change your body and still allows movement.

A waist trainer is specifically more restrictive and used to literally train your waist into a different shape. As with any body modification, that can come with risks and health concerns. Things to watch out for (I am not a doctor and just happen to have interests in corsets and fitness): wearing one too often or that‚Äôs too rigid can atrophy your stabilizing muscles. This can lead to pain and dependence. They can change your appetite (they restrict your stomach) which can disrupt your body‚Äôs natural hunger cues and add to more disordered eating.

Also, does your girlfriend see people in the media with her body type? Is there a way to help find people who look more like her? I recently saw a show where the lead woman had my body type and I was shocked. She was beautiful, and I loved they way she would style herself and it made me feel a bit happier since it confirmed that mantra that I‚Äôve been telling myself: my body is mine and natural and not abnormal even if I don‚Äôt see other people who look like me.

Finally, just a caution: like others have said, this is definitely something to maybe bring up once but really let your girlfriend lead and make sure you‚Äôre actively listening to her and not just trying to change her mind. I have corsets I enjoy to dress up with and my fianc√© doesn‚Äôt like them at all (he prefers my body as it is and corsets seem uncomfortable to him as well), he mentioned it once to confirm that he likes me best as myself, but when I was insistent that I like them as an occasional hobby and find them comfortable and I was staying safe, he didn‚Äôt pressure me to stop or change my interests and I appreciated that greatly.

"Not that you change all of the sudden over night but we do over time. If our bodies are constantly changing how can we really know who we are or what we look like?  I feel we all subconsciously know we're going to get old to  so we fear aging.

I think that's why we get so obsessed about our looks because we don't know how long it will stay and want to do everything we can to preserve it. Youth is one of the most prized possessions in society and the thought of losing it leaves people feeling uneasy. Anyways I have no clue if this is true or if there's any validity to it, it's just my viewpoint outside of other reasons people have trouble accepting themselves."	spankyourkopita	post	8.208911945523255	female	White	0.9936498999595642	na	na	na	2	BodyAcceptance	failed
"I just think people in general put so much focus on appearance. I get it, it's what you see in the mirror or what other people first see, but why does it have to stay the same? My personality has changed since I was a teenager, and that's a good thing. Oh, but I don't have the same body? What a shame, right? I don't get why it has to be this way. 

I agree with you, but isn't it weird that I'm looking forward to being 40, having stability and all that, but I dread looking like a 40 year old?"	spankyourkopita	reply	na	na	na	0.9936498999595642	no	strong	no	na	BodyAcceptance	failed

"I just saw a TikTok of a girl just vibin at the beach with a song, nothing rare until I go to the comments section.

There was lots of people ""preaching"" her saying ""you are so brave!!"" and ""I have the same body type and I hate it but you look cute"". Why those comments? Cause that girl didnt had an Instagram model body type.

If you look comments on a post from a normative girl you will only see compliments about how hot she looks, yet if we have an /average/ body we are supposed to be ""brave"" to show it? Like the normal thing were to be ashamed of it?

Maybe I'm reaching but I found it the opposite to normalizing it when people say these things like you are beautiful *despite* your body type and if you show it you are *brave* like it should be hidden or what?

I don't want to be brave, a body positive activist nor even be hot; I just want to chill on the beach. Stop minding someone else body."	Baddie-Bunny	post	17.24284028847878	male	White	0.9981274008750916	na	na	na	14	BodyAcceptance	failed
"i am new to the sub and i don't know if i'm allowed to comment, but i agree fully! the purpose is to embrace the beauty of your and others' bodies, and by saying they're ""brave"" to show it, it does literally nothing to help, and only makes people feel worse. it's an awful thing to say. 

if you like their body, compliment it.

 if you don't, shut up. mind your own damn business.

It depends on the caption and the account. If it's a body positive account then I think those comments are normal and acceptable. If it's not a body positive account or post, I totally agree and it's really inappropriate.	Baddie-Bunny	reply	na	na	na	0.9981274008750916	no	no	no	na	BodyAcceptance	failed
Truly, I think there should be a new societal rule to just shut the fuck up about another person's body. Like, just don't comment. If the person is a 6xl or a 00 just don't comment, keep your mouth shut, just let them exist in peace.	Baddie-Bunny	reply	na	na	na	0.9981274008750916	no	no	no	na	BodyAcceptance	failed
"That girl doesn't have to prove or answer anything to anyone. Just let her be! Let her enjoy herself. 

Even complimenting someone for ""being brave"" goes to show that the first thing you do when you meet someone is check out their appearance and judge them for it. 

Let's start looking beyond physical appearances. The world could potentially change."	Baddie-Bunny	reply	na	na	na	0.9981274008750916	no	no	no	na	BodyAcceptance	failed
If it wasn't a body positive account, then those comments are a tad bit insensitive. I run a body positive Instagram page, if I were to post a picture of my body, then yes, I would have zero objections towards such comments. But... if I posted it to my personal account and heard those types of comments from friends/family, I wouldn't exactly be as happy.

"I think the term ""you're so brave"" is coming from a place of acknowledging how women who aren't the **media ideal** of attractiveness are often harshly criticized. Posting your true, unedited image online is opening yourself up to troll comments and hypercritical people, which takes confidence and courage. Still, I can see how ""you're so brave"" can be interpreted as a backhanded insult."	Baddie-Bunny	reply	na	na	na	0.9981274008750916	weak	no	no	na	BodyAcceptance	failed
I think the important thing is that some of those comments are coming from people who claim to have a similar body type. I can speak from experience and when I say that I envy their confidence it‚Äôs because I am ashamed of my own body, not because I feel they should be ashamed of theirs.

"Tbh I always thought it's just well intentioned, and brave is because a lot are scared to show it? Tho I guess it's not nice to call it brave but they mean well.

No matter what weight I am don‚Äôt feel confident in a bathing suit. I‚Äôm not super skinny or over weight I weigh what I should for my height. I don‚Äôt feel confident in a bathing suit. When I wear my everyday clothes I feel just fine.

"I recently went on vacation and I wore swim leggings and a rash guard. Best decision I ever made was just wearing something I‚Äôm more comfortable in, instead of trying to force myself to be comfortable in a bathing suit.

What is it about a bathing suit that makes you feel especially insecure? A few years ago, when I was thinner, my biggest insecurity was still my stomach, but I got a bathing suit with a ruffled area covering the stomach that honestly did a great job of hiding that my stomach stuck out.

I think noone really feels confident in a bathing suit, unless maybe they have model proportions. It's like when people sit down everyone has stomach rolls or in a ski outfit noone would look sexy. In a bathing suit you're exposing your naked body to people you've never seen and most of them are cut in quite unfavourable ways so I think it's pretty normal to feel uncomfortable. Maybe it helps reminding yourself that the purpose of a bathing suit is not the looks but the practicality of it	JessicaTiffanySunny	reply	na	na	na	0.9990329742431641	no	strong	no	na	BodyAcceptance	failed
remember that most of the bodies we see in the media and on instagram are heavily photoshopped and airbrushed, and people in real life NEVER look like that	JessicaTiffanySunny	reply	na	na	na	0.9990329742431641	no	no	no	na	BodyAcceptance	failed
I get it, and feel the same way. Being in a bathing suit makes me feel really exposed especially when most of the time I keep my body quite covered under clothing, so I guess I'm just not used to the exposure. I find that when I go to the beach more regularly I start to feel less awkward and uncomfortable in a bathing suit because I get used to it. I also make sure to only surround myself with people who radiate positive vibes and good energy. This energy can be infectious and so I can go from feeling uncomfortable to feeling happy and joyous very quickly when I'm around the right people..

"I‚Äôm the same way and I just don‚Äôt swim. 
Maybe that‚Äôs not the right answer, but it works for me. If something is bothering you enough that it the discomfort overtakes the enjoyment of activity you‚Äôre doing, it‚Äôs not worth doing it."	JessicaTiffanySunny	reply	na	na	na	0.9990329742431641	no	strong	no	na	BodyAcceptance	failed
For me, it‚Äôs because it‚Äôs pretty much like wearing your underwear in public. That‚Äôs just never been comfortable for me, and I have been many different sizes. Ultimately I just like more coverage; wearing something that‚Äôs comfortable allows me to enjoy the experience I‚Äôm having rather than fixate on how weird I feel.
