CW: thoughts of self-harm

TL;DR: recent events have gotten me bummed out with dating/romance, how do I make something work with someone

I‚Äôve never had much luck with women. I never had a girlfriend in high school, and after one too many in-person rejections, I switched over to doing online dating almost exclusively when I was 23. With online dating, I‚Äôd build up the women I was attracted to into wonderful partners in my head, and I‚Äôd fantasize about being in a relationship with them - but then I‚Äôd meet them in person, and we‚Äôd have zero chemistry, or they‚Äôd find someone else before I could work up the courage to message them. If they (online dating or people I know in real life) just wanted to stay friends, I‚Äôd stay friends with them, because people keep telling me that a lot of great relationships start out as great friendships - but nothing romantic ever came out of any of them. The only people who ever seemed interested in me were women that I wasn‚Äôt attracted to. At one point, when I was 23, I felt particularly burned out and drained, and felt like each new rejection had physically taken ten years off of my life expectancy. I started to think that I might actually end up alone. I even toyed with the thought of just giving up entirely, because instead of worrying day and night about whether or not girl of the week was attracted to me, I‚Äôd have the comfort and security of *knowing* that I‚Äôd end up alone. Besides, some of the happiest, most satisfying, most fulfilling periods of growth in my life have been when I was single and not actively looking for a partner.

Then, in 2019/2020, after fantasizing about a girl for a long time, not receiving a response when I finally worked up the courage to message her, and feeling empty for months afterwards, lockdown happened. After having had to work numerous Production Assistant jobs that I was frankly embarrassed to still have to do (I still wasn‚Äôt in the union at this point), I was out of work for months. This is incredibly privileged of me to say, but it was good for me. I was able to rest, take time off from dating, and get caught up watching movies and tv series I‚Äôd been meaning to see. After talking to my psychiatrist, I also agreed to go back on medication - more specifically, I started taking Zoloft for anxiety. It was an absolute game-changer for me.

Then, towards the end of 2020, I went back to work, and working on film sets / watching movies / working on my own editing projects became my main priority. I actually started seeing a girl through CoffeeMeetsBagel, first through Google Meets, and then in person. She was fun to hang out with, and we moved onto making out by the third-in person date and touching her breasts / my groin by the fourth in-person date, but in March 2021, after the fourth in-person date (seven dates total), she cut things off because I didn‚Äôt communicate or text enough. It bummed me out for a bit, but that‚Äôs mostly because I was shocked that *she* was the one to end things - to be honest, I wasn‚Äôt really physically attracted to her, and I had a hard time picturing a future with her. She talked about children (she wants to be a teacher) *constantly*, even mentioning in our last date how she wanted to adopt children. All in all, even though I was sad, I realized it was probably for the best.

From that point forward, dating took the back burner. I haven‚Äôt gone on a date, virtually or in-person, since. I worked as a COVID PA on a feature film for months, and used the enormous amount of free time the job gave me to edit a trailer-style video mashup tribute to Ari Aster, one of my favorite directors. It‚Äôs not perfect, it‚Äôs probably too long, and not many people have seen it, but I‚Äôm so incredibly proud of it, and even prouder that I had the skills to will it into existence. There was even a cute Scenic Artist I made a point to talk to while doing the rounds at my job, and she inspired a screenplay idea that I have yet to actually write, but it feels like I can almost touch it, it feels so within the realm of possibility (much to my dismay, she already had a boyfriend). I repeatedly began to compile movie clips for future director mashup tributes, only to get distracted by downloading movies from other directors.

Late 2021 to 2023 proved to be enormously transformational. I started using more groan-inducing puns at work, and found that it made me more comfortable around people (or among people on film sets, at least), and that helped me develop my sense of humor in general. On one gig in September 2022, I even meet a girl who I thought was cute, who liked Ari Aster movies, and who laughed at my jokes - but that was for one day, and because she doesn‚Äôt have a huge social media presence, I haven‚Äôt interacted with her since, so I mostly just pine from afar. I finally moved out of my childhood home in late October 2022, after an acquaintance / friend / something in between of mine from high school posted on Facebook looking for a roommate in Somerville. At one Production Assistant gig, I finally met someone in my craft in IATSE who expressed willingness to sponsor me - I was finally accepted into the union on April 25th, 2023, after almost four and a half years of trying to get in. Hell, I even managed to (kind of) curb my porn addiction, to the point where I don‚Äôt even really look at porn that much anymore (but that was only because I freaked out upon realizing that I‚Äôd spent nearly half my nest egg on OnlyFans custom videos - and I‚Äôm still waiting on *four* of them! üò¨). Work is slow because of the writers‚Äô strike, I‚Äôm a little concerned about how much money is in my bank account, and I‚Äôm not doing as many creative things as I‚Äôd like - but overall, I‚Äôm doing okay, and I‚Äôm getting by. I don‚Äôt give a whole lot of attention to my dating profiles (or to dating in general).

Then, someone from a previous pro bono shoot asks if I‚Äôd be willing to help out on his pro bono shoot from July 22nd to July 23rd and from July 28th to July 29th. I say something along the lines of ‚Äúsure, I can probably help out for a few days‚Äù - and of course, I get roped into being a department head.

I‚Äôm going into this shoot with zero expectations - at best, I feel resignation (‚ÄúI promised to help him out, so I ought to stay on. It‚Äôll probably be fun, but I wish I was getting paid - but then again, they‚Äôre mostly college students or recent grads‚Äù); at worst, I actively dread it (‚Äúfuuuuck why did I agree to this? The gaffer is also gonna be the sound guy, and I‚Äôm not gonna have many people to help me as key grip. Do I have enough experience to be able to do my job?‚Äù).

Then I met her.

While we do go overtime quite frequently, the shoot actually goes remarkably smoothly for me - people laugh at my jokes, my pun game is stellar, and I‚Äôm able to do my job pretty well (that, and it‚Äôs a film set run by college students, so‚Ä¶). I don‚Äôt think much of her at first - she‚Äôs cool, she‚Äôs cute, and she works as both make-up, costumes, and 2nd AD on the shoot (though she gives the actors quite a lot of direction) - but that‚Äôs really about it.

The second day of the shoot, I interact with her more, and I realize both how pretty and playful and funny she is, and how comfortable I feel teasing her and making fun of her.

From that point on, I can‚Äôt get her out of my mind. When shooting resumes on July 28th, I see her again - but she mentions off-hand that she just broke up with a guy two days ago after he gaslit her and showed up at her job. Fuck, I thought. I have to wait before asking her out. But that‚Äôs not the end of the world, I guess.

During this leg of the shoot, I admit I became a bit more self-conscious, because she also talks to one of the actors a lot - he‚Äôs a nice, funny dude who‚Äôs also good-looking and manly in a Teddy Roosevelt sort of way - and I admit that I occasionally slip into the ‚Äúoverly-polite nice guy following her like a lost puppy‚Äù routine that I performed with other women I‚Äôd fallen for instead of teasing her and joking around with her. And it wracks my brain. What if it doesn‚Äôt work out with her? It might not work out. The others didn‚Äôt. But I also get to spend a lot of time with her, and my attraction deepens - she‚Äôs funny, playful, I felt comfortable teasing her and joking around with her (sometimes), she laughed at some of my jokes, she‚Äôs outgoing and bubbly, she‚Äôs interested in movies and tv, she does stage management (which I can kind of relate to and talk to her about because I do theatre lighting / stagehand gigs when film work is slow), she works as a teacher when she‚Äôs not in school and is passionate about helping kids (though recently she told me she wants to transition into film because she feels unappreciated by her students and the company she works for), she‚Äôs incredibly intelligent and articulate, she‚Äôs driven and ambitious, she does screenwriting, and while she clearly doesn‚Äôt take shit from people, she‚Äôs also an incredibly, genuinely sweet and friendly person even though she‚Äôs had a string of relationships that didn‚Äôt work out and experienced at least two or three miscarriages (one when she was concerningly young). How much self-control and willpower does it take to be that kind and sweet after experiencing all that?

When I think about it now, I realize I haven‚Äôt felt this way about anyone else for almost nine years - I‚Äôm just kind of in awe of her, and it feels like I respect her and that it‚Äôs a selfless kind of attraction. She‚Äôs everything I could ever want in a woman. She inspires me to be a better version of myself. She makes me want to finish my video tribute to Lars von Trier, and to pick back up a screenplay idea I‚Äôd come up with back in my last semester of college in 2017 (I was too lazy to actually put much effort into writing it, and when I filmed a scene I actually had written, it was too long, and one of my actors hammed up his performance). She even inspires me to want to actually begin writing that screenplay that the aforementioned scenic artist inspired. It feels like a more legitimate love, because this isn‚Äôt just a dating profile - this is a real person.

But she says she wants to move out to LA within a year because she wants to write this miniseries about the miscarriages that women suffer (such as the ones that they don‚Äôt even know are miscarriages) and the effects that it can have on them. And it killed me, but it also made me re-evaluate whether or not I wanted to move to LA - I‚Äôd undoubtedly get more film set work, I know a lot of people from Emerson who‚Äôve moved out there, my union status could (possibly) be transferrable, and even my mom (who‚Äôs not exactly a huge fan of my film career) has repeatedly said I should at least visit LA to see whether or not I like it. Could she be the motivator I need to move there? Is she worth it?

On the fourth day of shooting (we ended up shooting on the 30th as well), after we‚Äôd wrapped for the day, a few of us were smoking together, and I asked them how they came up with screenwriting ideas that they were excited about. She at some point mentioned that she thought that I would have a good grasp of dialogue and that I had a great grasp of social cues, which I was super surprised to hear from anyone - because that REALLY doesn‚Äôt sound like me - and I was like ‚Äúreally?‚Äù, and most of the people in the group were like ‚Äúyeah!‚Äù, and she started listing off all of these really nice things about me, like how I was witty because I was able to fire off incredibly lame puns all the time, which also meant that I was good at reading the room, and she said that I seemed literary (I think) and educated and smart.

That night, I talk to the director about my feelings for the girl (I‚Äôve had heart-to-heart convos with him before), and he advised me to at least wait a month before making a move. Not a bad idea.

The next day, I leave the set early so I can get back to my parents place (I‚Äôd been looking after the place while they were on vacation), leave food out for my cats, pick my car up from the shop, transfer my gear back into my own car, drive back home to Somerville, and prep for my upcoming gig, which is helping the electrical crew at a theater in Cambridge strike the set of a major musical that had just wrapped at that venue. Before I go, she invites us to her performance in a tribute to Ruth Gordon that her professor is putting on on Friday, August 4th. She‚Äôs not enthusiastic about it, because she‚Äôs doing it as a favor, and the haphazard rehearsal schedule forced her to temporarily leave our set early (she came back, though).

The work I do that week at the theater is absolutely grueling. But at the advising of my close friend / wing-person, I decide to go to her performance, because it‚Äôs showing support for her. I even try to invite the director of the shoot so that it‚Äôll be less intimidating for the girl, and so even if the girl can‚Äôt do anything afterwards, he and I can at least stay and watch the showings of Harold and Maude and Rosemary‚Äôs Baby - but the director twisted his ankle the previous night, so he can‚Äôt make it.

I go to the show, and, as expected, it‚Äôs excruciating to sit through, self-indulgent, and very thrown-together. After the performance ends, I wait in the audience for a bit so she can get her stuff together, and because I know that the cast and crew members are gonna get swarmed by audience members. Afterwards, I go up to her, hug her as I greet her, and joke around and talk with her as I help her and several of the cast members clear the stage. She mentions that the film set went to shit after I left - the couple who owned the house we were filming at had apparently gotten into a huge fight, and both she and the director had to act as intermediaries. She‚Äôs too tired to stick around for either of the movies showing that night, and as we talk, it gets to her personal life, and apparently the aforementioned actor I was worried about had made a move on her - but not only had she just broken up with a guy, but she was also wondering if she was gay. She said she‚Äôd been with women before, and had felt more comfortable with them, and had told the actor that she didn‚Äôt think they had those vibes. I then said that I‚Äôd have asked her out, but that she had just broken up with someone, and that she had shit she needed to figure out. She said she was in a friendzone mindset at the moment, but that she thought there was no reason I couldn‚Äôt find someone. I said I‚Äôd ask her out sometime in the future. She said she‚Äôd be more available to hang out in the coming week, and to hit her up if I was interested in hanging out.

I felt dead for most of the day on August 5th. I‚Äôd promised a girl I‚Äôd met through Bumble, but had reconnected with through work, that I‚Äôd help her move her studio across the hall, in an effort on my part to keep myself busy and social, and so if nothing happened with the girl from the shoot, I‚Äôd at least have some other mildly-social engagement to keep me occupied. I did a lot more heavy lifting than I‚Äôd anticipated, and felt so low and borderline catatonic by the end of it. On the ride home, my thoughts turned to purchasing a pack of cigarettes and using them to burn myself.

(I didn‚Äôt buy the pack of cigarettes, and I realized that that really wasn‚Äôt a healthy way of thinking, so I‚Äôve been thinking about checking into a psych ward for a few days, but I‚Äôm worried about the cost).

\*\*\*\*\*

I‚Äôm just so exhausted by all of this. Every time I put myself out there for someone I like, either something comes up, they‚Äôre not interested, or I screw it up. It just happens time and time and time again, and it‚Äôs just so demoralizing and humiliating and soul-crushing, and it makes me feel like less of a person and that something is just fundamentally wrong with me. Even not trying to be romantic with them and just staying platonic never leads to anything more. Why does it work for everyone else, and never for me? Do I still have a chance with her? Will I ever find anyone? Alternatively, can I find enough happiness and contentment that I won‚Äôt be overwhelmingly lonely if I stop dating entirely and just accept that I‚Äôm going to end up alone? What do I do?

I just want to find someone who I love, and who mutually loves me back. As masochistic as it might seem, I want her, or someone like her, who makes me feel and want that intensely, because it feels good and selfless to want someone like that who can motivate you to be the best version of yourself that you can be."

"For the past year, a perfect storm of life stuff converged and buried me and my available time.  Work, family, community, building a house, grad school, and managing an elderly parent and subsequent passing/estate.  I pushed as hard as I could thankfully keeping all the balls in the air, but obviously that will create burnout. Every day was managing who to disappoint and how much without verging on failure.   Recently, I've finished school and ticked a few other items off the list.  The floodwaters are receding as planned.  

Now I need to find ways to best recover.  I've been catching up on my sleep.  I'm not where I neer to be for attention span, memory, focus, all around mindfulness and effectiveness.  I still have a reasonable backlog of things to catch up on that will be OK, but I'm finding myself overprioritizing those things over taking time for family and self.

"I'm also recovering from a period of intense stress, anxiety, and burnout. These things helped me but of course, it's different for everyone:

\- Meditation and mindful breathing. This has made a significant difference in generally returning my nervous system to a calmer regular state, instead of being in fight-or-flight 100% of the time.

\- Regular vigorous exercise.

\- Reconnecting with friends and family. When the going gets tough, I tend to self-isolate and ""put the nose to the grindstone."" It's not a healthy impulse. Getting social support during and after periods of intense stress is super important.

\- Getting re-oriented to what's important in your life, or a sense of purpose. I definitely lost my way when I was SO busy taking care of various things. All the joy and purpose was gone. It can take a while to remember or figure out new things that will serve as your guiding light, that will re-energize you as you pull out of the burnout.

"I've also been recovering from burnout from university. It took me like 3 weeks to start feeling like I could feel normal again. I'm like 2 months out now and starting to feel like I can take on projects again.

One of the best things I did was get myself a noticeboard, so I could write down anything I thought should be on my to-do list and put it there. Most days I wasn't up to doing anything productive, but I'd torture myself by thinking about all these insurmountable tasks I still had. Writing them down gave me more mental real estate because I felt free to forget them, since they were written down in an obvious place. Without this, I really struggled to even start to relax, which is the thing you need to do for burnout.

I also spend a good amount of time reading or meditating. I've also been cleaning and building things and going on walks, engaging my body to help ground my brain.

The most important thing you can do is be patient with yourself. Burnout doesn't develop quickly, and it won't go away quickly either. Let yourself go at a slower pace than you want to, you will come back. Trust the process. Be kind to yourself."

"Hi :) new here. 

I have been rather unproductive last 12+ months after a serious loss. I know I need to get back on track, but I feel like I have a million things I should do and I can't keep track of them all, let alone prioritise them. 

Any tips on how I can do this? I think I need a counsellor for it bc simply writing a list isn't working. 

Any other tips? Financially, I am not comfortable - not working, barely paying rent (bills are late).

I've never heard of vocational rehab - I might look that up. I'm adept in therapy techniques as I've probably spent 10-15 years in therapy (half my life), but I really need help on the vocational side of things rn I think. This is really interesting suggestion.

I've found it helps to just pick one thing each day to try to get done, even if you skip days the list will slowly shrink :)

As for vocational stuff have you considered volunteering with a charity close by?

I spotted him on reddit a few nights back, got extremely irritated, told him I spotted him on it and saw him texting while his main page was full of naked women. He said i have nothing to worry about and showed me a few of things he was saying to other people on a group where he can have a genuine chat and shit, so I thought ok whatever. I'm doing it again, over reacting again... now I've seen his page, kinda went into the forum he was in that he showed me and I found him. I click on the comments part so I can see what and who he's commented.

Hm. For some relationships this would be fine (though also should be discussed in advance), though you are clearly not comfortable with it so it should be a serious discussion. I get the vibe you‚Äôre told a lot that you‚Äôre overreacting. I wonder how often you actually are, or if maybe you have to overreact because otherwise you‚Äôre not listened to.

"Hey I know this is months later, but as a dude who occasionally goes on reddit for porn, and has left comments on women's pictures, I'm not doing so when I'm having the best time in the bedroom or at home generally. You aren't really overreacting, he's saying it's not a big deal, and maybe it's not a BIG big deal, but it's a deal.  

Maybe he's depressed or stressed from work or something else is wrong, and this is an outlet for him. In that case he should be a bit more upfront about it. Maybe he's embarrassed. 

This doesn't have to be relationship ending, it probably doesn't mean he's unhappy with you generally, it doesn't mean you need to divorce or anything. But it is something you two should address together.

Maybe he just likes looking at porn. I know I do. It can be possible to consume porn and still have a healthy bedroom.    
But amounts, and amount of interaction (leaving comments, having conversations with the posters) are variables that need to be regulated. Like I said, the more I was having problems, the more I wanted to interact with the women I was looking at. Seeking some sort of emotional validation in connection with the sexual.

And I don't mean to say ""You're not taking care of him enough!"" Because that's bullshit. I understand that what I'm saying could be read as placing the blame on outside forces. I'm not. He's the one having the issue. He's the one who turned to porn instead of his partner. You may have to be the one to get him to face that though. It's something a couple should work through together.

Your feelings are valid, I hope that my post here is totally unnecessary and you're both already over this and in a better place. But I saw your post and it was just a little too familiar for me not to say something. Good luck."

I have aloud him to look and do what ever he wants to himself while looking. But talking to them is where I cross the line. He had been sly behind my back before and said they were just friends, I had to borrow his phone for a minute while he was in the room and he gladly handed me the phone, I went on what I needed to do but just as I was nearly finished a message popped up basically slagging me off. So obviously opened it, and read months and months of messages exchanged between this friend that he wasn't happy with me and all this. I was over bearing and lazy. And how much he misses this friend. That got sorted and he blocked all contact of her, still has to this day. So we have been fine for along time, but then out of the blue he has been talking to naked women, I don't care if he talks to women with clothes on. But these where full on naked.

In just a few hours I have had an anxious reaction where I have racing thoughts about:

-Freaking out about not making enough money. Spent two hours googling/Reddit on passive income. During this time thinking I could go to school and get a realtors license. Real estate is too expensive so maybe I could purchase storage units or something, then I start looking into how to start a vending machine business (wasting time). 
-Maybe I could do door dash on my lunch breaks, which I don‚Äôt even take because I have so much work to do (while I end up watching TikTok or scrolling Reddit). I don‚Äôt even have time to do laundry. 
-Maybe I should build a greenhouse and then when I propagate my pothos plants I could sell them, and that could be a side hustle (spend more precious minutes looking at greenhouses online, thinking I could build one)
-Again worrying about doing a two person job on my own working from home.. then procrastinating some more.
-Reading an article about abandoned homes in Japan going for like 25k, daydream about traveling anywhere. Get depressed because they interview some software engineer from Australia who was living in London and then bought one of those gorgeous Japanese homes.

Just want to commiserate and say it's so hard to find a compatible therapist. I've probably seen 7 or so in the last 10 years, with little improvement to my mental health. I finally found a psychologist, recommended through my primary doctor as she's on staff at the hospital, and she's phenomenal. My insurance blows, and when I told them I couldn't afford her ($3K deductible, her visits are 100% out of pocket) they offered a discount on sessions.

And there is no one I can think of. 

Years ago, I made complaints about how people only turn to me when they have problems. In recent times I‚Äôve noticed that no one talks to me about anything.

"I decided to work at home today, which was a ""lucky"" coincidence. 

I had lunch with my mother and continued working. Then about an hour later, she told me that her tummy/abdomen hurt badly. She threw up a few times and also had diarrhoea. 

It's not easy to get to see a doctor in the local clinics where I live. Her usual doctor would not arrive until 6 pm. I phoned some other places and no one picked up. 

In the end,  I found a clinic where the doctor is in. We went there, and waited for about an hour. During this period of time, my mother also complained of pain, and she also started to have a running nose and seems to feel cold. 

She was prescribed various medication (mainly regarding flu affecting the digestive system). She ate a small bowl of soup and took the meds and she has been resting in her room for about an hour now. I did ask her before she went into her room whether she felt better, and she said the pain has largely subsided. I don't know if flu has these strong effects, but heart of hearts, I think I hope it's only the flu. I am very much hoping that she will start to feel better tonight and that the matter will clear up soon.  

I am shaken. I am always shaken when she's unwell.

Perhaps this sounds melodramatic, or irresponsible. Whenever anything like this happens, my immediate thought is how suicide is so much simpler. 

I have often been candid here, due to the anonymity. For my entire life, despite everything, more or less (more as I became older) I have always felt that my destiny in life is to be carer for ppl in my family. No more, no less. I have fought against this, mainly by working on my career and hoping that it will be successful to the extent that I would be able to afford whatever need or care they require. Of course, I failed terribly in this regard and I go through guilt-trips over this on a daily basis. But I also feel that I am incapable to deal with her becoming older. It was very difficult with my father (who passed away 3 years ago) and my mother was a devoted and strong supporter for him. Now, it's just her and me.

I worked in the living room last night to check on her, and she woke at about 11:30pm. She had a stronger appetite, and ate more food, and then took another round of meds and went back to bed. 

I stayed home today as well. She said she feels better than yesterday. We had lunch and watched some tv, then she went back to her room to rest. 

I'm feeling like crap. I admit, despite everything, I'm still worried about the supposed warning letter but since I didn't go in for two days, I don't know what is the status of that issue.

"First, many thanks to everyone who encouraged me in my last post about exercise. I read them all and I am grateful. 

But, life is never easy for people like me.

I have worked for 14 years since graduation. For once, ONCE, I was late today. Once. I am generally the super punctual, super early kind. 

Yet, undeniably, I was late. It was my fault, I don't deny that. I had a meeting elsewhere. I got on the wrong bus. I didn't know where I was. Not to trouble everyone with the details regarding my fear and confusion and the logistics, it took me ages to finally get a cab.

I was scolded by the ""client"" (I have always been hesitant to disclose what I do, so I will use this word loosely) like a dog. Like I killed his parents, skinned them alive, and then ate them. 

The situation was odd. Cos when things got rolling,  the other participants started talking immediately, and I thought I might as well let things be (again, due to my reluctance to disclose what I do I don't know how to describe the situation precisely, but there is some sort of flexibility as to the timing of the events, the other participants might not even be aware that I was late). It was my judgment at that point in time that it would be worse if I interrupt the person speaking to stand up and make an apology. 

Yet, what happened was, the ""client"" stopped (again, yelled) at the person speaking to stop so that he could yell at me. And I was yelled at by the ""client"", literally yelling and pounding on tables for over 15 minutes, disregarding anything I had to say, my apologies, my explanation, and I was told that my behaviour was subpar (he used much stronger language) and he would lodge a complaint against me.

Again, I cannot stress enough that I accept that I was late, and I accept that I was wrong. But did I deserve that treatment?  I am not new to the scene, I know that technically, I did not really disrupt thee schedule. 

I guess it all goes down to luck. Perhaps another ""client"" would be more forgiving. It doesn't matter that this is a one-off incident in a 14-year record. 

I admit, I feel a bit suicidal. In my mind, I am already imagining some sort of sanction, some sort of disciplinary hearing, etc, etc. I know, it might be an overreaction, but I don't know. But at this very moment (and for the last 5-6 hours), I have been contemplating suicide. Some part of me thinks perhaps this is the ""opportunity"" to kill myself.

"I should point out right from the start that it is nothing to write home about.

Simply that I had been doing mild exercises for about 2 weeks. Not every day, but most days of the week. Mostly just stretching, and following some basic routines from youtube videos. All within 20 minutes or so. I am very out of shape and quite overweight so that's pretty much all I can do. 

It's absolutely nothing. Yet, this is the most ""productive‚Äù thing I have been doing. And I had tried to cajole myself that it is something. That if I do a bit every day, it might add up to something. Perhaps my stamina/mood would improve. Perhaps at some point I could pair this up with proper diet to lose weight. After all, exercise is good. 

I know I've only tried for two weeks but I really don't feel any different. I am not expecting any kind of weight loss, but I had hoped my mood would improve. I don't really feel better. And whenever I see how overweight and clumsy I have become, I feel I am fooling myself. Years of comfort eating, alcohol, sedentary lifestyle, not to mention getting on with years, did not do me any favors.

I‚Äôm so sorry that you‚Äôre struggling. Making changes and not seeing any immediate results can be frustrating and discouraging. As others have said here, this is a GREAT step in the right direction of developing new habits that WILL make a difference over time.

Small, **achievable** goals are the way to go as slow, steady change is the key to success. Try making one small goal each week that you know you can do. For example, setting a timer for 10 minutes 3x/week to clean house or journal or do a self-care activity. Anything you feel will help you emotionally or physically. The goal is change and progress, yes, but that big goal will be accomplished through many much smaller changes. Just keep moving forward, doing what you‚Äôre doing and you will absolutely start feeling different and seeing improvement.

Finding a great therapist to encourage you through this and support you would also be of great benefit as it sounds like you have become depressed over time. This would also be a lovely way to show yourself some love.

This is where I stand, after decades of struggle.

I'm unable to cope with life, I'm simply not good or strong enough to do what life throws my way.

It's peculiar how I jeopardise myself. I finally have work - I actually have a client today, after about 6 months of unemployment. And I choose to drink. Who knows why I do what I do.

Perhaps I drink to alleviate the stress of actually potentially dealing with a client. Perhaps I drink to give my excuse when in the end everything goes wrong (as it nearly always does). 

For what it is worth, I am well-prepared to see the client. I have researched, prepared questions, practised ""speaking"", etc. Like a child, or like the child that I had always been, I have a pathological obsession to do well. I do more that anyone else, and receive the least reward, probably because I am rubbish. I know for a fact that many of my colleagues mock me behind my back for spending so much time on petty and trivial things. Yep, cos only the petty and trivial go my way, and I should thank the good lord for it.

"I cannot disagree with your positions here. I have many of the same thoughts.  However, I have 2 relevant observations:

* You start with a lot of ""I can't"" and ""I don't have"".  Unfortunately, these thoughts are self-fulfilling.  Take that from someone who has them daily as well.  They will continue to come true until and unless you fight them directly as their own problems, which they are.

"I honestly don‚Äôt know where else or how else to post this, but I feel like I just need confirmation that this feeling is normal, or common or understood. And hopefully that there‚Äôs a way out. 

Essentially - I‚Äôve never been a driven person. About anything. It‚Äôs always taken someone else, or some support, to push me to do better. Graduated high school and worked anywhere that would hire me. 1-2-3,4 jobs at one point in my life, to make ends meet. And it didn‚Äôt bother me, because I have no life anyway. 

Then my brother passed away before he was able to go to school for his dream career. So, I went to school in his place and became what he wanted to be. In doing that, I met a new partner who made me feel capable and worthy of more. So I went back to school, and did something that has helped me set myself up (us up) financially, for the future. To most people, this has made me ‚Äúsuccessful‚Äù, and nobody bats an eye about any emotional or mental unwellness I might feel. 

I have managed to keep my weight healthy, despite being obese earlier in life; but if I‚Äôm honest, I think I find it easier to push myself to do this because it requires no social connection with anyone, as I have a gym in my home. But even then, I am forcing myself to do it for the better of my health. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs joy anymore. 

And all the other daily stuff - don‚Äôt even get me started. Everything else, absolutely exhausts me. And I do it, but every day is a goddamn chore. 

Calling my friends or hanging out with them. Even calling my mom. Small talk with colleagues. Walking my dogs isn‚Äôt even enjoyable like it used to be. I never regret it. But I never want to do it. They want love and pets and they absolutely deserve all of it. But I just. Don‚Äôt want to. I feel selfish all the time, but also like I can‚Äôt even be bothered to be selfish, so I just do the shit I‚Äôm supposed to. I don‚Äôt want to take care of anyone or anything else. I barely want to take care of myself. I hate cooking and have been eating way too many protein bars so I don‚Äôt have to. I clean because I know I should and have to. So I mean, I am not so depressed I‚Äôm dysfunctional. But barely?

I want something more, but I don‚Äôt know what. I‚Äôve never known what I want. I don‚Äôt know what I like. Will I get up the courage to do anything about it? Probably not. I just go to bed. Do it all again tomorrow.

"I am 33, male, have been on and off into depression the better part of my life, and this time it's like there is no escaping, the tension and panic I feel almost borthers suicidal thoughts.  
2-3 years ago I was yet again afraid of the potential death of my grandmother, which was alive back then, peace be upon her. And that wasn't even the first episode of such freaking out and focusing on her life. I tried therapy for months, no use. Took meds presrcibed by a doctor. At some point I changed my job for a way better paying, and for an year and a half I was happy, content. No more morbid fears too.

Last august depression, morbid anxiety arrived again in my life - at that time I could see my grandmother doesn't have much to live - she had dementia and I could see she is going for her last phase. She died this January. I loved her, but my fear was purely egoistical. For months I acted as the biggest coward on Earth. I was day drinking because I couldn't cope with her dying very, very soon. I was taking different meds with little to no inpact on my well-being.

Strangest thing was, but actually makes quite sense - when she died I felt relieved for two or three days. I even did a few gym work outs, which I did not have the power to do for the last six months. Also I almost did not drink. But after these two days the tension and anxiety started to build up again -- my other fears - whether I will have a family and children, what if I never have, what if i have but never feel content about it, what if my madness continues until I am alive, etc.etc. all these nasty thoughts plus now the fear of death moved t my mother. I only have her. I don't count my father and his mother. So now I start torturing myself for the inevatable death of my mother, freak out I will never have a family as I m obviously in deep pain, I barely work, don't work out, can't enjoy life, I drink, hence become fat, etc, etc, etc I am 33 she is 58

I am trying different meds, but it seems all my life anxety and psychotic fears never disappeared, and meds, yes sometimes they do help, but they don't cure the root cause, they deal with the symptom...

And man oh man, I don't wanna be a coward, a good-for-nothing, and I wasn't just before this last episode, but it's like panic attack, or agoraphobia, you freak out... I look at people in restaurants, in the streets, see them guys my age and older with little kids, so well-grounded, oh how I wish I am like them, so full of the minute

When i was 5,6,7 my father was physically abusive, he would beat up my family two times, piles of blood from my grandmother beaten up by him, calling police on him... I am absolutely sure the trauma he caused to me fucked me up for decades up until the minute I type this."

"When I was 33 I entered a residential care facility for the mentally ill. I had been on and off various meds, in and out of therapy and in various treatment programs since I was 20. I had had periods where I was completely disabled, and periods where I was relatively stable. 

I spent three years in the RCF. It was honestly one of the best things that happened to me. The psychiatrist there was a genius. (Even though he looked and dressed like Danny DeVito from Taxi). I also worked with a very good therapist who was a good fit for me. I attended day program classes that taught all kinds of psychoeducational skills as well as skills of daily living. 

After I moved out, I continued to have services from staff that came to my home daily to help me with the  tasks of daily living. I still have staff a couple of times a week. Most of my services at this point are to make sure things keep running smoothly. 

I haven't self harmed in over thirteen years. I bought my own house a little over six years ago. I have held a part time job for many years now.

There are many ways to grieve, sometimes there is a sense of peace for a while. I wouldn't judge yourself on how you responded, it sounds reasonable. Hopefully your mother will have many good years ahead of her. I wonder, if your fears (lack of family either through death or by not reproducing) have to do with your concept of death. Are you religious or believe we are gone gone? Have you tried mindfulness? I think most people have some of those fears, the key is to enjoy the moment. I fluctuated a lot when my father died between thankful or even happy that i have all these memories, but then sad that no one would ever love me like that again.

"Therapy helped me a great deal, to the extent that I became a therapist myself.  Meds have been helpful but less so.  The thing about therapists is that if you don't have a good, strong, warm relationship with your therapist, you're not getting much out of it.  You'll learn some new coping strategies maybe and if they do something like CBT it might help your thought processes become more realistic and less harsh on yourself, but the part of therapy that heals is the relationship.  It's feeling heard, understood, and safe with someone who holds appropriate boundaries and does not judge.   Often you need to meet the therapist and have a few sessions before you know whether you're clicking with this person or not.  

So, if therapy didn't help and you feel like you didn't have that kind of relationship with the therapist you saw, you might consider trying again.  If you talk to the therapist to make your appointment, pay attention to how you feel while talking to them.  See if they do free consultations because sometimes you can tell right away that this person isn't the right fit.  Look for someone who is trauma informed and can actually articulate why they're trauma informed--many therapists claim to be trauma informed when they are not, and for someone with your history, that's really important.  A therapist who does not understand trauma can actually make things worse.  So, if you ask why they're trauma informed and the answer is super vague, probably avoid that person.  If they can identify specific rationale for calling themselves trauma informed, that's more promising."	Kozchey	reply	na	na	na	0.9974606037139893	no	strong	no	na	MadOver30	failed

I wish I could offer something else, I just saw 0 comments and 16 hours and a sentiment I know most of us can identify with.

I am a long-time hermit, when I am under-socialized, I make a focused effort to do something for someone else (I love scrolling through https://www.charitynavigator.org/ and picking out a place to send $20 bucks to) which often puts my own stuff in perspective and makes me feel a bit more connected (if distantly). Probably works with volunteering, I am not at a place where that is an option, personally.

Other than that, make the most of your current interactions/touchpoints, with co-workers, vendors or neighbors, I would suggest making an effort to ask more questions than usual.

"My mother in law used to say 'there's a lid for every pot' I thought it was kind of funny at the time, but as I get older I think its true.

I have two tenants who are the most unlikely couple Ive ever met. I mean unlikely that they would find a match but they have. They are both uber nerds. They rented my large house with 4 bedrooms so that they could each have an 'office' and then a gaming room with a fancy coffee machine plus their bedroom. 

They are both constantly on their computers and I dont doubt they communicate from room to room on their phones lol. They love to cosplay and their house has all kinds of costumes laying around. They also love role play games with each other and they meet up with a few others for that on a regular basis. 

In addition their idea of a perfect vacations is driving their beat up minivan to some desert location in the US where a bunch of other like minded nerds spend the whole weekend pretending to be warriors in a future dystopian civilization, aka Mad Max style, I forget what its called but its Burning Man for nerds. 

And if that wasnt odd enough (at least it is to me) they are both into hiking and exploring despite the fact that both of them are quite overweight. Both are what Id call average looking at best, she has blue hair, and half her head is shaved. He's a neckbeard with a pot belly at 30. Both are socially awkward but very polite. And they definitely love their dog. They're good people with good hearts - which is why I like them.

"I started going to the gym or exercising at home last year and recommend it to everyone. Of course there's the health benefits or getting in shape or something like that, but I recommend it for an even more basic reason that it's good to have a routine for yourself (or at least I find that very comforting) and it also does give you endorphins or makes you feel good at a very base level if you keep at it. The best time to have started is years ago, same thing is true for me, but the second best time is today.

It's good and comforting to be in a relationship and to want to be in one. I'm getting over a breakup now and I want her back so bad, or to be in a new relationship since that was really nice and warm. But at the end of the day, you really have to believe that all the love you need comes from within. I know that sounds like hippie nonsense but do consider it seriously, from a practical standpoint.

"You've never missed the boat. I'm 32 (or am I about to be 32?....) and I just started (online) dating for the FIRST time in my life, as my first two girlfriends just popped into my life by luck, and I get about the same results as you. Well I match a lot more, but they never respond or they live in mexico (I live very close to the border). I finally found one though who seems to be working out, doesn't have kids, likes my craziness (bipolar/ADHD/Anxiety), but also has recently slowed down on texting which is worrying. I don't think it's going to work out possibly, but it was fun even if it didn't lead to anything.

I know this sounds like weird ""advice"" but maybe take up light drinking just so you don't stick out so oddly in a bar/club. You can turn a bar into 'your element' if you find one that plays music you like or at least has it on the jukebox, OR do what I did with my first girlfriends and just BE yourself in your own hobbies/work/etc and let them come to you. Don't write at home, go to starbucks. Get your T levels checked, this probably won't apply to you (although if you can't get it up 9/10 times, it's very possible) but after a decade of heroin use, my T levels (as a male) are at the lower end of a woman's. I'm not going to bother fixing that until I'm off the suboxone since it's still an opiate, just legal and less powerful.

Start going to meetups from meetup.com or the local tabletop gaming shop. Start exercising. That's one of the most important things, not only for dating, but for yourself. I know it's cliche/annoying to be recommended to start exercising as a depressed person, but it's proven to be one of the best remedies if you can manage it. I'm not going to be toxically positive, but your mindset guides your life. If you start exercising and feeling good about your life and what will happen, your life will generally guide itself in that direction. It's not a guarantee, but it helps. Get off tinder for sure. Bumble is much better in ALL ways.

Just make yourself available to women, go to cons/cosplay, write your novels/games/worlds in a public place, exercise as much as you can manage, and don't spend all of your time on the internet. Being chronically online is one of the worst things you can do both for your mental health AND for finding someone. Lastly, go to therapy if you can afford it. They can even teach you how to flirt or at least approach women. Therapists can be one of the most powerful tools in your arsenal for life if you utilize them properly, and since you're depressed, you probably need to see one anyway. Good luck man."

There's more to therapy than JUST looking at your past. They can help you learn how to approach/flirt, they can help you address things in your personal/professional life, they can help you quit procrastinating, OR they can help you look at your past and get over things that weigh you down. Of course no one can change your past, that's not the point of therapy or what happens for anyone obviously, as the past is set, but the way you view and feel about your past isn't. Honestly I would try out single and group therapy if you can afford it.

1. People who bullied you hopefully have grown out of it by now. If they haven't and they're still looking you up online, that means they haven't grown and is shameful for them

2. If it really bothers you that much, get your name changed. You can literally create a new name for yourself that your old bullies can't look you up by. If that is the blocking issue keeping you from using career sites to get a better job, focus on what you can do or need to get that done.

3. Not healthy to compare other people's highlights to your whole experience. There are people who are rich, beautiful, famous and miserable. It might be that it looks like they have what you want from the outside, but the reality is a lot grimmer. Maybe their partner is cheating on them or something like that, who knows.

4. I also don't have a bachelor's but am doing OK for myself in the IT field. I'm not crazy about my career or anything but it keeps the lights on. You don't need to have a degree for a good job.

"1. Probably not actively looking up, but maybe stumble upon.   
2. In my country, you need a valid reason to change your last name. The best I could maybe do is after marriage take my partners names - so I would need to get married first, so I would need to get my life together first.   
3. That's true, but right now I know that I'm poor, ugly, a nobody and miserble. So the chances, that they are doing better in at least 1 point are high. Additionally that I know due to indeed and other sides that they are doing well in their jhobs and that I'm the only virgin leaving school, so they at least had a healthy start in their dating- and sexlife.   
4. Again, in my country you need a degree, at least a 3 year trade school degree. Some might get around without - a colleague of mine started his IT degree, never finished it, but did one odd job after the other in this field and by now he apparently got a steady job. Not sure about the pay though, but I wager it's way less then he could make, if he got a degree. Some companies and expecially the state pays pure after degree - so you couldn't grow into a roll and start earning more than a master or doctor, as one could do in the US. My father told the story of a colleague that was set up by the old head of department as his replacement, once he would retire. But once he was gone, the management recruited a doctor fresh from university to replace him and the ""normal worker"" with all the knowled needed got nothing.   


So yea, I could try to get a job without a degree - or start a trade school and hope that the problems that kept me from getting my university degree won't keep me from getting that trade school degree - I'd wager that highly possible, as I don't have a problem with it intellectually, but that I can't finish the degree, can't hand in my final submission, etc - so a thing you would also need for a trade school. But with a fraction of the money I could have made in life.  
And since I would start with a 15 year delay into the workforce, I would still feel like the biggest loser, as everyone that simple started trade school at age 16 would be better off than me. 

&#x200B;

And I have the feeling, I need a god paying job to impress. Either for myself, that the feeling that I'm worthless might stop one day. Or for others, as I'm still judged by others. Especially with the other sex and potential partners - ofc you can read everywhere that the right woman won't be interested in your income and if she is, she's not the right one. But it's not that I'm swarmed by women so I could allow myself another weakness. TBH I sometimes fear, getting rich is the only way to find a woman that might be interested in me, especially if I want a pretty partner and not just the remnants with their best days behind them, with tons of sex in their twenties, that are now in their thirties, with some children from former affairs and marriages, so they have to settle for someone like me, so I will always feel like I'm the second choice.   
So either I end as the token ""fat, ugly, old but rich guy, that has a young pretty women by his side, and we all know she only wants his money""  
or as the ""fat, ugly, old and poor guy, who knows she will never love him like the 20 guys before him"""	Prestigious-Ask4151	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9993368983268738	no	strong	no	na	MadOver30	failed
"It's just that I feel like I wasted all my time. Not just with my non-existent career, but also with my free-time activies. That I can't produce anything that is worth the effort. Or, since I don't have a career, I hope to have some kind of hidden talent, so I could turn the hobby into something making money - even if I didn't start doing it at age 5, so I might have been perfect by now.

\>This isn't about high-level goals and comparing yourself to other people and their success or skillfulness

For me, it is. Maybe if I had a ""normal life"" and a job that I'd be content with, just writing a bit on the side and even if it never gets anywhere, >its ok, too<. But right now, creating something unique so the wasted last 10+ years feel at least a little bit less wasted is like the minimum requirement. If it doesn't meet that standard, I could just do nothing and wait for my end, as it would have the same value.

\>hopefully there's some small part of you that respects or looks up to yourself 

Not really. I don't see anything I achieved I could be proud of. The last thing I did was finishing school 12 years ago with good grades and since I didn't made anything out of it, that was worthless, too - maybe even hinder myself, as I got the idea that I could achieve more in life and repeat the career and income my father has.

Hey! 34 yr old female here. I felt the same way day after day for years. It was unbearable. It was affecting all aspects of my life. I literally needed adderall just to go to work or finish a school paper (went back to school late) or to even go out to enjoy a relaxing evening with friends. It was awful. Everything just felt so overwhelming day to day. I started not leaving my house for days at a time. Going to to the grocery store felt like a monumental task. Come to find out I was very depressed and not really knowing it. It hit pretty hard when I turned like 31. Adderall made me function but by far made my depression way worse. Finally got on a good antidepressant and most of these symptoms are gone. Not completely but for the most part where I can function, not feel grossly overwhelmed, and can actually leave the house and interact with people too.

"Sounds like the depression talking. Are you on antidepressants? Finding meds that work for you can make a huge difference, but you have to be patient as (afaik) they always take about a month to start working.

Also what you experience sounds more like anxiety in addition to depression. Maybe check out [this list of things](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/16-ways-relieve-stress-anxiety#11.-Practice-mindfulness), they might look silly, obvious or worthless but maybe one or a few of those could provide some relief.

Of course if you don't yet see a psychiatrist and have access to one then go for it.

"So. I'm 41, and due to a few unfortunate incidents, namely an awful divorce where assets were hidden, and a string is sexual assaults leading to mental health issues, I am now finding myself both unemployed... And homeless.

I fully had my life together a few years ago. Good job. Good salary, presumed loving partner, stable housing. Hope.

I've been handed some bad hands recently, and I did not handle them well as my mental health was awful. The suicidal ideation has mostly gone away. (I'm not at a point that anyone needs to worry, I promise) 

I feel so much shame. I did things right, I went to school, went back to school, made decisions to support what I thought was ""my family"" and was burned in the end. I'm rebooting at 41, and I'm... Just not pulling out of the dark funk. 

I had a sexual assault by a neighbour which caused a full PTSD episode. I can't remember the entire week after the assault. I lost my job during that time, ended up in a position where benefits were denied to me, and have struggled to find solid work since, due either to missing reference, very visible anxiety during interviews, or now a large gap in my resume. I'm... Scrambling. 

Mostly the shame. The PTSD is back to under control, though flares for a few days occasionally.

I just had a cataract removed in my left eye and have a smaller one in my right that will have to be removed eventually. They joked that I was their pediatric case for the day. I laughed, but it's one of many issues I have going on. My testosterone tanked in my mid 30s. I have no sex drive even though I'm taking testosterone. I have PTSD and am taking 2 antidepressants as well as Adderall after being diagnosed with ADHD this year. I am also taking Spravato treatments twice a week. I worked out religiously from 2017 until 2020 when I tore my dominant arm's elbow tendon. Had surgery and physical therapy only to find out I also had a torn rotator cuff that was missed. I am scheduled to have that repaired in June. Anyway, I stopped working out and my mental health tanked. It kept me sane and healthy since I am battling being pre-diabetic. Diabetes has destroyed both of my parents and my father died at 68. My mother is incredibly unhealthy and sick because of it. So, I just worked and laid in bed the next 8 months. I was finally able to get the job I wanted, but once I started I had zero motivation. I just don't seem to care about anything at all. 

My mother is also in a neglectful skilled nursing facility because she's a hoarder and wouldn't let anyone in her house for months. I did a welfare check and she was almost dead when they found her from sepsis in her large intestine. She's better now, but constantly harangues me about how terrible it is there. Yet I have tried to get her in assisted living and she refuses. Her paranoia and need for complete autonomy is pathological. She wants to live on her own again yet will inevitably end up back where she is. I have no legal right to make decisions for her. I contacted the ombudsman about her complaints and gave her the number for 13 facilities that do Section 202 housing for the elderly with health issues. I can only hope she allows a housekeeper in once a week to help her stay clean and safe. 

I know I am lucky to live in an era where my health problems can be treated otherwise I would be blind and crippled in my 40s. I have health insurance although these issues are still expensive to fix. I should be grateful but if I have all these issues now I know it will only get worse.

I share all that to say with therapy (mental and physical) I've gotten to the point where I don't feel like I'm in pain all the time anymore.  It definitely cycles, and it depends on how much stress I'm under at the time, but it definitely does get better.

It sounds so challenging for you because you're dealing with your own health issues but also your mom's, and caregiving can definitely lead to burn out.  I wonder if it might help to set a boundary with mom regarding her telling you how terrible it is there - yes, you know it's terrible, and you've tried to get her relocated but she doesn't want to relocate.  So at this point, maybe it's better to tell her if she wants to complain about housing, she'll need to do so with a therapist or another loved one because you've attempted to help solve the issue to no avail.

"So I stumbled on Reddit talk and liked that idea of people sharing and chatting with voice. I wondered if there would be one for mental health but then I realized that some of the Reddit talk groups are soo massive and might not be so suitable for a 'support group'.

So Im looking to set up a support group where people can chat and share just like an in-person support group. The only difference with an 'official support group' is that it wouldn't have a 'professional' trained facilitator but be more self-managed. Im is willing to use platforms such as Whatsapp, Telegram, Zoom, Dischord (or other suggestions).

I'm writing to see if there's any interest in this from people in this subreddit and if so maybe we can DM each other and get something started. If there is enough interest in this Im happy to make it a weekly or monthly.

"Things currently triggering my low sense of self-worth:

 I feel unappreciated and unsupported at work. My supervisor constantly cancels our one on one checkins, leaving me in the dark about what‚Äôs going on with our ever-changing company and, therefore unable to contribute the level of value I believe I can. I don‚Äôt even have a team to commiserate with. 

I received employee of the month in the company newsletter recently (we have a small company and they‚Äôre intentionally not repeating anything so I had to get it at some point). My supervisor didn‚Äôt say anything to me about it and I‚Äôm the only person who didn‚Äôt receive a ‚Äúpublic‚Äù shoutout on our internal messaging platform. 

I look at other jobs but I‚Äôm both over-qualified (high level of education) and unqualified (circuitous work history and no technical skills) for any job I find. 

To top it off, my spouse won an award and neglected to give me a shoutout as a supportive spouse even though other award winners called out their supportive family members. My husband cares for me in so many ways and I know he values the ways in which I‚Äôve supported him but this stung. 

I‚Äôm feeling invisible and worthless and this is a recurring theme in my life. I‚Äôm so sick of it and I don‚Äôt know what to do about it, specifically tonight when I‚Äôm spiraling instead of getting much needed sleep.

To work past issues eating at you, it helps to get closure, but how do you get closure when everyone who betrayed you or could provide insight is dead? Is outliving them supposed to be closure enough? I want answers. I want accountability. It seems I am destined to have to live with those demons in eternity.

Most of the time, closures are unilateral. This means at some point you just stop trying to understand people's reasons and realize the only thing you can know is that they hurt you and you are better off without them in your life. Then, try to direct your energy for what you still can get from life. To meet people that are more capable of love and to share with them your soul, so you can heal.

"I need a holistic treatment plan. Willing to go to a Rehab if anything like this exists in India. Don't want to live like this. No point. Online therapy sessions every week help me find the wrong beliefs in thinking and just that. No change from within.

Caught up in thought loops - negative/insecure.

No defense mechanism - feel like all thoughts just come to the surface and take over me.

Sleep issues - can't sleep, in a quasi sleep state, solving/thinking about issues (that needn't be existing in real life)

Fed up with living like this. Want a complete shift and change.

I workout - though HIIT has made it worse for me - hyperalert mind and body. 1) Incessant thoughts - can hardly take control of them. Racing thoughts. For example, trying hard to find the right answer, looking for better options, critical of myself, doubting my judgment, OCD-like, thoughts of insecurity. Morning to night - Only thinking of solving my thoughts which keep running in my head.

2) Working memory issues. Can't focus. ADD/ADHD symptoms. Have this need to remember things as is, but can't focus. Can't process/slowly process information - this lack of comprehension adds to the already existing battle within my mind.

3) Brain fog. Don't feel like interacting, doing stuff, but sitting idle doesn't help either.

4) Sleep issues: - Sometimes: onset issues (when confronted with some thought that my mind is clinging to incessantly)

Most times: Heavy-disturbed-state during REM. Vivid dreams; and weak erections during this. Sort of awake/aware of my dreams - almost like experiencing a movie first-hand. Note: Most, if not all dreams, have me in it and generally have elements that I have obsessed over or angered me in waking life - feel the fear.
5) Get anxiety attacks when in situations that are even slightly demanding, etc. Feel my threshold to take stress has broken. Even a small disturbance makes me feel stressed.

And during this state - I don't have control over my distractions - multitask a lot (OCD-like, quickly shifting between stuff) during this anxiety state.

6) Nothing makes me feel accomplished/satisfied/contended/happy. No identity at times - Not sure what I want, what are my likings/interests. What to look forward to...

Others: - When I workout during my negative states, feel too fatigued - joint, muscle soreness begins quickly; though, the same workout on a good day (that is so rare these days), doesn't cause the same physical symptoms. - I show extreme anger to protect my ego, sometimes - irritability - No libido whatsoever - after the medication (SSRIs) + nofap [other symptoms are so potent and terrifying, this hardly feels like a concern now :( ] - Emotional detachment. Anxiety, prefer not to meet others - even if/when meeting, don't see the value/emotional want to do so.

Note:

Some of these symptoms occur simultaneously (say, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5) while some of them are just states I experience once in a while (say 6)
Most of these symptoms (barring the brain fog and lethargic depression I had in the past) are post-taking different SSRIs and anti-anxiety tablets. But it's been more than 4/5 months since I stopped them cold turkey. I'm certain a couple of stressors + extreme obsessions wrt self-improvement (extreme mindfulness + IF, etc.) + medications led me to this.

Now, even without objective stressors in life, I'm in these states :(

Nothing fancy. Just the basics of being aware of your thoughts. Maybe try this simple exercise of writing down your thoughts on a paper for five minutes straight. Just transcribing whatever is in your head. At the end of five mins, read the pages. This exercise was a game changer for me.

I was able to find that my thoughts were so random and incoherent and unpredictable. They were not even really related to one another and I felt that it didn‚Äôt really make any sense when I seriously analyzed my thoughts.

Therapy isn't really for healing either.  Most people who get some kind of benefit from a therapist are people who don't have any friends, and the therapist is basically like a surrogate friend.

It sounds like you just have a lot on your mind.  You might need to look over your life and see if you need to change things.

Long story short and feel awful about this but my aunty passed and my parents who I live with because of my mental state reason took guardianship of her daughter.

Just looking at people lately who want to blame me for been unwell during my bad days and tell me what they want me to be like. I have a team and therapy the conversations are like people are fed up of me been unwell and that I should be able for anything and my mental health in not an excuse for the way I feel or behave because it too much at times. Some day been present is just too much I can feel like nothing is going to stop this I try and talk to adults near me but makes me feel no bit better or sure I can get over this and have the relationship I had with them.

"Ha! I hope I'm not you because I don't want you to feel like everybody thinks you're just ungrateful. But maybe we're just alike in some ways. I relate to feeling incompetent to do jobs except those that are in my ""zone"" (i.e. jobs I've done or feel like I could do successfully) but I don't have much of a resume regardless so it compounds matters at my age.

It is strange to me because I keep hearing that people are pretty much just being placed in jobs easy peasy right now. I'm experiencing things differently, having trouble getting entry level positions. I feel like I've worked my butt off at getting here but still get zero. The only option I've been given is to accept minimal work with no room for advancement at all - and I've put that hold on a while and I'm fighting the urge to go back because I don't feel it fits in with my ethics.

"It took me many years to recover from psychosis. Probably wasn't back to full confidence for 10 years. But those friends who stick with you are worth keeping.
I have had a years of antipsychotic medication, many sessions of CBT and more intense counselling. 
As far as the anxiety goes, find ways to reduce your baseline stress. Exercise is great for this. I started from being barely able to walk. Last year I climbed 6 mountains (small ones mind) and ran a marathon. 
Small steps. 
Sometimes one trip out of the house is enough to be a good day. Or even getting out of bed. I spent 6 weeks in bed last year due to intense work induced stress and anxiety not to mention a difficult end to a 23 year relationship.
It is possible to recover. Don't be so hard on yourself. 
Everyone is facing their own struggle. If you suffered with paranoia like I did, it does get better. No one actually cares or notices if you leave the house. 
I find ear plugs or noise cancelling headphones great for reducing stress and anxiety in crowded places. 

Reach out to people and organisations.  There is a lot of help. You'll be surprised who has suffered in the same way and manages to cope.

"Going off-topic here ... it's interesting you mentioning social change in the UK and how people there tend to be understanding of mental illness.

I moved from the UK to Australia almost 20 years ago. Here in Oz, attitudes are different. 

Yes, there are the ad campaigns saying all the right things, ""mental health matters"", talk about your feelings and so on. But I feel that here, society in general lags behind how I remember it being in the UK. 

I'm fairly open about my issues. A few people have opened up and been receptive, but in general I sense there's a ""don't talk to me about this"" kind of vibe going on. If they can relate, most people choose to remain closed books. They don't want to talk about it. 

The stigma still seems to be fairly ingrained. Just pretend it doesn't exist, it's personal, shameful, that kind of thing. Of course this is simply my perception.

Support services are also lacking in comparison to the UK, where I'm living anyway. I feel I'm pretty much on my own in dealing with my illness.

"There have been huge changes in 20 years here. My eldest has a far better understanding of mental health than I did at her age. Her friends are far more supportive than mine ever were. I feel her generation are more likely to call out discriminatory language and behaviour too. 

My first thought about Oz are perhaps the culture is built about being strong, independent and that any deviation is seen as a weakness? 

40 years ago here, any serious mental illness meant being sent away to an institution. Something to hide and be embarrassed of.

"That's good to hear, that things there have changed for the better. It's great that young people are, in general, more aware and accepting.

You may be right about Australia. Men are still expected to be strong and resilient. Seeking help isn't really the done thing. Any problem, go have a few beers with your mates and all will be well again. If it isn't, you better pull your socks up cobber and soldier on! You're a man, with responsibilities to be met.

Maybe it's similar to how the UK was 40 years ago. I feel Australia's like that in many ways. Change is slow.

Of course could also be that I'm not a native, so to speak. I'm still aware of the cultural difference, even after all these years. For example, just the way they converse; the greetings, the social cues, the way they wrap up a chat, it feels slightly strange to me. And perhaps, as a non-Australian, guys are less likely to let their guard down and open up.

Maybe I'm viewed as a crazy Pom who's too quick to talk about his mental problems lol.

"Sorry people are treating you different. I have a diagnosis of schizophrenia, but I keep my diagnosis to myself. I try to really limit who I tell about my diagnosis and mental health experiences. I consider it very personal and not many people's business.

I would try to make new connections when you can if you're not happy with your current friends. Always growing your circle of social connection seems to be good for at least me.

Also if you're not currently working, I usually tell folks to explain my situation that I have a disability that limits me from working, but I don't go into any detail. If they ask, I just say it's personal. 

Everyone is different. Some people are very open about their experiences, but I find it best to only open up when I'm really close to the person and I feel they know and appreciate me well first. I think with time you'll discover what's best for you.

Also sometimes peer support groups can be a good place to meet people with similar experiences if you want to connect with others who can relate to you. Here's a list of support groups. Some of them are online.

"So today it was time to help out my Parents who live with, with their awareness we got on well I didn‚Äôt feel like talking about things was a trigger this time. My doctor did say to them to try and not fear my symptoms as I have psychotic episodes use to be everyday . Now I found my way to get out of them or easy them off a good bit. 

The thing is and I didn‚Äôt take them in is that was she was taking about them it was that with my emotional stress I will have them come and go and suffering with EUPD could be anytime at any stage of the day. 

Realising now that I might have to live with the voices  and more and not knowing as of yet as I am only starting my new therapy if it ease off and I won‚Äôt have to worry what‚Äôs around the corner each day that might set of my emotion regulation unwellness doe just think of it puts my mind in a place where it kind of scary where more symptoms of paranoia and intrusive thoughts come and go. 

Never thought I would be here in my life doe they think my symptoms started at a young age doe I never let it sink in as I was enjoying my social life at that time. The feelings that were-overwhelming where always there from a young age. 

How do I accept this and move forward and recovery with my therapy when this is what I am going to be thought how to learn to cope with them instead fearing and adding more upset and stress around this is too far away for me to see for now. Too pick up my social life and to but behind my relationship aspect of my life just be happy that I work so hard every time I feel I am losing my battle and ring to go into hospital straight away before I am lost in that space of mind."

"I don't know if this fits here or if I'm even the right age to post here, but here goes nothing. I'm a 25 year old male. She is 55. 3 years ago a ''bomb'' happened, that's all I'm going to say. This caused her to go through unimaginable grief. Now, she's doing better, that's not to say that the pain vanished, it's still very much there. She's now overly cautious on how she looks and asks me every morning if she looks presentable. 

The thought of her death came up recently for two reasons and it's been going inside my head my for the past three years in an unsettling fashion.

The first reason is because around 2015, doctors found an ovarian cyst the size of a golfball. If I remember correctly it was cancerous or was going to become cancerous, they caught it early. I mentally broke down during that time. I wasn't able to do anything. The thought of my mom going on a operating table was an alien concept. The closer the date for operation was coming, the tighter the knot in my stomach became. The day came, and I was white as a ghost. I was at the hospital for 4 hours. The moment she came out, I noticed she was looking perfectly fine. I'm no expert in surgery, but do they have to stay in the hospital for a while before they get discharged, so there aren't any other issues? The reason for the quickness? Her surgeon was sloshed from previous surgeries. She didn't want to risk any errors and told her to come back in 2 weeks.

2 weeks passed and the day finally happened. Her surgery lasted 5-6(?) hours. Her name on the monitor was cleared out and I deflated and entire months work of stress and fear. Her surgery was a success. The cyst was gone. But I noticed before her surgery, she would make ominous statements. She would say that if anything happens to her during the surgery, I shouldn't worry about her and live life. The reason for these statements came to fruition when I asked her couple of months ago. My reason fearing her death that day was not without reason. I learned that during the operation, she almost bled out. She didn't specify how much she lost, but according to her surgeon, the amount she lost was ''concerning''.

The second reason comes from my two best friends. My first best friend, who I will call C, lost his mother at 17 because of shingles and diabetes. My second best friend, who I will call B, lost his mother two years ago, due to lung cancer. 

Today they are able to live on their own and have careers. C is a former nurse, now is in Sales and B is an IT technician. C bought his own apartment with his girlfriend and B now has his mothers house under his name. On the other hand, I feel like I haven't moved an inch since high school. But, I wouldn't say I'm in a bad spot either, I have a good job and I make good money. But I feel small towards them.

No, I AM ABSOULTELY NOT JEALOUS AND BITTER TOWARDS THEM. They deserve what they have. It's just that I find they have a much closer bond between the two of them now than the three of us together. As if they can relate.

They reached their potential. Does that mean my mom has to die for me to reach my potential? Even till this day she is accepting of death in a morbid way. Telling me if it happens, it happens. But her dying now would not sit right with me. Especially since she is still in emotional grief. I want her to live long enough until she is comfortable. Till there is no more worries. If it happens now, she'll be ''forgotten'' and it will be ''unfair'' especially for what she went through."		post	26.50649882351554	male	White	0.012274759821593761	na	na	na	2	MadOver30	ethnicity: no prediction, age: 25, gender: male, explanation: the author self-identifies as a 25-year-old male. no specific cultural or ethnic identifiers are given in the text.
"I'm not sure what your question is.  Are you concerned about your reaction to your mother's potential death?  You feel you reacted badly or something? Everyone reacts differently.

Are you feeling like you've stagnated in life and blame the fact your mother is alive since your other friends who have ""made progress"" lost their mother's? Because progress doesn't require a deceased parent. It requires you to take action. Your friends may have been forced to take action because they didn't have their mother to care for them, where you maybe could live with your mom. I don't know your situation vs theirs specifically. 

If your mental health is in a bad place because of your mom's surgery and the fear of her dying, then you need to seek therapy to overcome that trauma. Your mom doesn't have to actually die for you to have a traumatic event.  That could be keeping you stagnant if you haven't dealt with it. 

One thing I will say... stop comparing yourself to others. Everyone has different opportunities. Different resources.  Different motivation levels. Different mental health. Different capacities in dealing with trauma.  Comparison is the thief of joy. Life your life the best you can live your live, and don't worry about keeping up with the Joneses.  They will do what they will do. If they are perceived to be further ahead, maybe they had a lot more resources than you did. Maybe their mental capacity for trauma was much higher.  That doesn't make you any lesser. You're just different. Focus on improving what you can with what you have. Therapy will help.

Good luck."		reply	na	na	na	0.012274759821593761	no	no	strong	na	MadOver30	no prediction.

"When I was young and wrestling with a lot of issues, the thing I feared the absolute most was ending up alone someday. At middle age, that nightmare is my reality. I have some friends I'm grateful for, but not a lot of close ones, and I've been single for quite a while now.

Now I have a new fear: becoming bitter. As my social loneliness has increased, and career stuff hasn't gone my way, and more doors close quickly as I'm getting older, I find myself feeling more and more jealous, angry, bitter. These were not feelings I ever had before. In the moments when I'm conscious of this, I'm disgusted with myself.

Just as a side note, it's not the being alone per se that's making you feel bitter. There's pleeeenty of bitter people out there that are in relationships, married, with families, etc. I think bitterness arises from the dissonance between where you believe your life 'should' be vs whatever the reality is, so the issue to solve is not necessarily about changing your life but about trying to minimize the 'should be' types of thoughts, since that's what's causing the anguished feelings.	anxiousjeff	reply	na	na	na	0.9917562007904053	no	no	no	na	MadOver30	no prediction.

Psychedelics very well could be the reason I am still alive.  I'd tried LSD and psilocybin several times, but recently I was in the tail end of an emotionally abusive relationship with a severe narcissist (not just throwing that word out, she is so, so bad and I loved her so, so much), and she had torn me down to the point I wanted to end it all.  I was given a heavy, heavy dose of DMT (three long, hard vapor hits), and I died.  I'm not joking (again).  You will see the other side, learn your true purpose, and never, ever fear death again because you've been there.  That's just my experience personally, but I came out of it loving myself more than I ever have.  I do recommend starting fairly heavy, enough to make a difference.  Talk to a shaman or an expert or find a study group.  They will give you the direction you deserve. Best wishes to you.	anxiousjeff	reply	na	na	na	0.9917562007904053	no	strong	no	na	MadOver30	failed
"It recently occurred to me after much introspection that everything I told myself that I cared about is a lie.  I have always tried to convince myself that I care about one cause or another but I was just being glib. I see people arguing passionately over what I consider to be frivolous things and I just sit there and watch in amazement their energy and passion. I see people really driven by their craft and I feel jealous.

I am always devising some plans for the future, and then when it comes down to it, I never end up putting them into action and on the rare occasion that I do, I end up quitting half way (story of my life). 

I have come to realise that this apathy is a huge limiting factor in my life because caring about something creates motivation, and motivation drives you to action. Action creates a necessary distraction. 

One example of this apathy in my life is in losing weight. I have been trying to lose weight for many years and I simply can't be motivated enough to stick to the necessary steps. Instead, the weight has piled on due to comfort eating. I remind myself of everything positive that would come from losing weight, but these possibilities fail to move me to take any type of action. Instead, I just use my weight as a crutch to justify feeling even worse."	TheEternalStranger	post	23.756371936690925	male	White	0.9982853531837463	na	na	na	7	MadOver30	failed

You're likely aware that depression cripples motivation, but ADHD also comes with a seeming inability to care about anything that doesn't really interest you. I was treated for depression with meds for six years before a psychologist said ""hey, I think things would really improve if we could evaluate you for ADHD and actually get your prefrontal cortex going,"" and god damn it has been a life changer.

"I relate heavily to this. My personal apathy stems from wanting to be dead. To commit suicide is what I truly want. Living is Plan B. I want to die because I believe we are destroying the planet and extinction is inevitable, I focus on all the cruel things are society does absentmindedly, and I believe life is meaningless anyways. I just got to focus on my little bubble of a life. I‚Äôm not going to change the fact that we will go extinct. My options there are to hope I‚Äôm wrong, minimize my personal input into it, and hope our leaders put in drastic change, and spread information. That goes for the cruel things society does also. And for life being meaningless that leaves me free to make my own meaning. Meaning to me is helping people and forcing myself to do my hobby. I want humanity to live long enough to evolve into something new and not destroy the planet. I guess I‚Äôm apathetic as a defense mechanism. A lot of what I value and want out of life differs drastically from mainstream society. Makes me feel like an outcast and a weirdo, but I got to get busy living or get busy dieing. Staying stagnant in the middle is maddening. Suicide wouldn‚Äôt be called the easy way out if living wasn‚Äôt hard.

"I'm at the point where I barely even eat anymore unless food is put directly in front of me, so the apathy can still get worse! Good way to lose weight though, no lie.

Positives of apathy being I'm never really anxious, because then I'd have to care about something in the first place. I'll never have a drug problem or addiction of any kind, because heaven forbid I'd have to actually go get it.

I don't know. Like the other commentor said, I mostly just wish I was dead. More specifically that I'd never been born. People say I have to do things, that I have no choice and should try and make the best of it, and then the little voice in my head whispers *oh, there's always a choice.*

Makes it hard to get help. Can't be honest without running the risk of getting locked up, which sounds worse than being like this or death.

I'm aware that was not helpful at all, sorry. On a slightly more helpful note, I have a variety of hobbies I take turns neglecting.

"As the end of the year approaches, my anxiety and depression worsens.

Another wasted year. Another year lost. 

And then another new year starts and all the shit, the pain and suffering, continue. 

Over the years, I've learnt, to some extent, to lessen the significance attributed to seasons and festivity. It's just another day of the year - there's no cause to exemplify my failures and disappointments. 

Thinking about the years, I've moved from hoping for better things to come, to wishing I would drop dead, to my ambivalence about my life as a middle-aged person: my wish to die and my wish to look after my mother. I believe my suicide would be cruel to my mother and I don't want to go down that road, but I wouldn't really mind if I just die in my sleep tonight. 

I'm tired. I'm tired of seeing the happiness and luck of others, and I hate myself for this petty jealousy. I hate how small I have become, how my wishes and hopes and dreams have also become so small, and how my anger, fear, and resentment have become so big. I wasn't like that - at least, I remember myself as a good kid who tried her best to rise above her inner demons, who really really tried to do well. I might have admired the successes of others or aspired to their successes, but I certainly did not wish for others to fail, or bad luck to befall them. Shamefully, in recent years, I think I hope that bad things would happen to others more than hoping that good things would happen to me (probably because the good things really don't happen to me).

Maybe some of the people you are referring to do have magically amazing lives, but I wouldn't be surprised if you looked under the hood if you'd find a lot of struggles of their own. Also just cause someone might be living a cushy life in the financial sense, they might still be dealing with hard stuff like a parent with memory loss or a kid with autism or a loveless marriage or something like that, or even tons of debt despite appearances.

I used to do what you did & assumed that others were doing great vs my depression/anxiety struggles, but at this point, I've kind of gone to the other end & just assume that everyone is dealing with some sort of personal struggle until proven otherwise, at least when it comes to people over 30.

Often I feel like my wife barely tolerates me, and then I question if that's reality or if I'm just having imposter syndrome about my non-work life....not to mention the massive ongoing anxiety wondering when I'll get laid off from my current job just like all the others.

I realized during that time that I just didn't like the work anymore.

"Some time has passed now so I don't recall the structure completely, but I'll give it a go.   For the first program (6 hours a day, 5 days a week, 3 weeks) we started with intros and a check-in saying how we felt, what beneficial things we did or didn't do the night before, what coping tools we may have used, what our mood (1-10) and anxiety (1-10) were, whether we had any thoughts of self harm or suicide (answering yes did not result in a hold of any kind, just discussion about it).  Then we had some training on coping mechanisms for an hour and a half or so, followed by processing, which is where you just got to talk about shit that you're struggling with which was so great. Then after that I think (?) more learning, then music therapy at the end of the day.  

The second program (3 hours a day, 3 days a week, for like 2 months) was just check-in, ~1.5 hour learning session, break, and 1 hour processing.

Perhaps needless to say, I was able to process a lot of stuff I was dealing with, much of which I wasn't even aware I was dealing with going in.  

Also, I think perhaps one of the most impactful things was the knowledge that I was doing something about my depression. I wasn't just wallowing in it as I had been for a year or so. I was capable of doing something about it, and that felt good."	red-xiv	reply	na	na	na	0.9974574446678162	no	strong	no	na	MadOver30	failed
It can really help to dress for work even if working from home. Try changing when you are done with work. These transitions can help you separate the time despite being in the same place. I lack this discipline, but don‚Äôt need to work from home. The light box may help. I use one at work as I have a very dark office with no windows. Also, making an effort to go out for a walk, maybe when you are done with work. Staying active is important and it doesn‚Äôt need to be anything more than a walk for 10-15 minutes.

And yes. I've read the bible. I've read Buddhist sutras. I've read Nietzsche and Frankl and Schopenhauer and Kierkegaard. Hell, I've read books on Shamanism and Witchcraft.

I've always been depressed. I've been diagnosed with some things (look at post history if you care), but I guess I had... hope? when I was younger. Hope that things would get easier or better. That I would find purpose in my life or that the good feelings or satisfaction in my actions would finally last.

That hope actually drove me pretty well. I went to school and work, I exercised, I worked on my social skills. I traveled and volunteered, because those are supposed to ""expand your horizons"" or some shit, right? I bought a workbook on CBT, I tried meditating. I took antidepressants.

I wanted to find... something. And I really believed it was out there. Something that would make this emptiness and sadness go away.

But that is not what the world has shown me. It's a random series of events, some good, some bad, mostly meh, if you're lucky. Nothing lasts. And then you're dead. There's nothing out there, is there?

">Some of the finest surgeons / rescue workers / defense attorneys, etc, are people who are able to perform high quality work without letting the grind affect them personally. They don‚Äôt have a personal stake in every single outcome.

So, I know you have good intentions when you say this and I don't mean to dismiss that, but this statement is almost never true. The finest professionals are always keyed into their professions. They are always learning new skills and reading up on current developments, on their own time, and trying to figure out how they can apply that information to their field in order to improve outcomes. They may not necessary lose sleep over the bad things that happen, but they absolutely *care.* 

The fact is, when you don't care, you don't do the job as well. There are very few what I call ""factory jobs,"" jobs where you just do what your told for 8 hours and then go home, left in the modern world that pay any kind of living wage.

There are some positions at my job where you can mentally check out. The people in those positions have rich spouses or live with their parents.

"Hello everyone, this is my first time posting on this sub. I've just come back to reddit after a long hiatus and I'm interested in hearing the thoughts and experiences of others who are in or have been in a similar situation. Just for background I'm unmarried, no children, and a renter. I'll try to stick to the main parts. 

The last several years I've been doing a lot of reflection/meditation, and healing from my childhood experiences. Over the course of this year I've come to the realization that the corporate life makes me miserable, even in this age of work from home (it actually makes me more miserable now). Continuing to work for a corporate any longer would be living a lie, so I put in my resignation a week ago with only one week left. It feels amazing but also very scary because I don't really have a plan or much of a savings, just some ideas. Luckily my skills are in high demand in my area so if this fails I can easily land back in the corporate world or just pick up a contract, but I'm really trying to avoid that scenario. The truth is, I only ended up here because I was trying to gain the approval of people that haven't been in my life for years now. And the more time that has elapsed since then the more of my ""true"" self I seem to have recovered. Well recently that tiny little voice deep down inside me has been getting louder and thus could not be ignored any longer. I never wanted a lot of money, just enough to live a simple healthy life. I don't even like owning a lot of material possessions. I get a lot more fulfillment out of connecting with and helping others than sitting inside my apartment on a beautiful day working on yet another corporate software project for over paid executives alongside totally apathetic people. I want to make a real impact in this world, even if it's just within my own community. 

I'll conclude with something I came to realize: I have no real savings after working as a corporate software developer for nearly a decade because I spent a lot of my salary on useless consumer goods and going out, mostly in an effort to avoid the feelings of misery from living that very lifestyle.

TLDR:

Single, No kids, renter, sick of corporate dev life after nearly a decade, makes me miserable, never really wanted this lifestyle, did it to satisfy people from my past.

Leaving with no real plan or savings, 1 week left, dealing with fear of the unknown.

Going to see where using my creative skills (music/art/coding) gets me.

"I can relate. Also a software developer, I left my job a few months ago. Also trying to heal from childhood experiences, and also make up for the experiences I've missed.

A large problem with working is that I don't have the mental presence to actually live. Work would leave me too exhausted, and time will just fly by without me experiencing life.

My goal is to use this time to become a more whole person, and find a way of living that fits me. I will design a life that I'll be happy living.

Thanks for your comment, and congrats on taking the leap of faith ! It's good to hear the perspective of another dev. I know what you mean about the mental exhaustion, it leaves you completely drained at the end of the day. That is freaking awesome you spent time in slab city ! As of right now I believe I'm supposed to stay put and focus on creative projects. I love writing and playing music, and also doing art. I recently set up a minimalist recording studio with a mac mini, garage band, my fender mustang amp, and guitar. It's all I need to record. I spent the last couple years studying applied music theory, I still go to heavy metal shows, and i meet other musicians at the skatepark all the time.

Thank you and congrats on having the courage to leave ! Although you're still dealing with the anxiety/depression, it sounds like things are getting better for you. Having a good therapist really helped me figure out where I needed to put my focus in order to effectively deal with the things I experienced and the feelings I had. Actually in hindsight that therapist was the start of a better path for me. I have a feeling this therapist will do the same for you ! Exercise helps a ton with mental wellness (and sleep), don't be afraid to think outside the box on that one. If you don't end up liking the gym or jogging, find a form of exercise that is fun for you.

"I am thinking about failures, both externally and internally.

Externally, there is no doubt I have failed, and the boat to redeem myself has long sailed. 

Thing is, lots of ppl are 'failures' in that sense. I'm sure I'm not the only person on earth who managed to live to her mid-30s with no spouse, partner, child, friend, career, money, property or stability. 

But I think many of those people manage to find internal peace as they aged. I myself have been hoping for that. That, at some point, when I am past the point of no return, when there is no longer any reason to struggle or strive, I would see beyond all that and find peace within me. That, despite the loneliness, the quashed dreams, a life that is restricted by duties and lack of means, I would realise that this is all transient, that one day I will die and none of this would have mattered at all. 

Yet, even on this count I have failed. Day and night, I fluctuate between anger, resentment, jealousy, and disappointment. 

And there is always this resounding voice that I was an absolute idiot for letting myself make it this far, when my suicide would now be cruel to my dependants. In my distant youth I thought I was a protagonist in a coming-of-age story and I would emerge as a hero and find my way to happiness. After all, I was a good kid, a star student, an honest, decent, hard worker - why would it not work out? I didn't realise I'm only an NPC even in my own story. 

Back in my youth, I had imagined that the 'punishment' for killing myself was that I would be shown (after death) of my life had I held on, and I would see that it all turned out ok, that I deprived myself of a life of happiness because of a youthful impulse to end it all. Turns out, if my imagination had been true, my action would have been vindicated. The video of my life would show me struggling aimlessly at work and in my social life in my 20s, constantly trying to 'do my best' and please others without being appreciated or rewarded. In my 30s, I would no longer have friends as everyone has moved on. My career/finance is no better than it was when I was 23. My parents would become older. My father would deteriorate before my eyes and then pass away after some challenging and very stressful years. I would not have dated in over 10 years, and no one had even shown remote interest in me. Other family members would require help due to disability and illness. Every night I would sleep in my childhood bedroom, that is, if I actually manage to sleep. I would nearly always want a drink. All in all, I'm not a credit to myself or anyone else. It's a life wasted. 

For the sake of clarity, I am in no way suggesting or encouraging anyone to kill him/herself. I merely wish I gave myself a realistic time-frame."	stranger38	post	21.366655185315782	female	White	0.9984960556030273	na	na	na	5	MadOver30	no prediction.

"Maybe two or three months back I gave BetterHelp another try for a few concerns: ongoing grief as my friends died from COVID and other issues, significant pain from my ex trying to torpedo my current relationship, and coming to terms with the fact that my mom, one of my first role models, is developing dementia and refuses to admit it. 

I am a disabled man and I am very active in the disability rights community, but since BetterHelp does not have a search option to filter by disability-informed therapists I went with the first professional who allowed me to use pseudonyms, other anonymizing information, and let me communicate solely by messaging rather than video or voice. 

Micah Nagel was his name and he seemed like a kind, peaceful, non-offensive and slightly balding man. While he offered a lot of useful help, I noticed it all came from either reflecting my words back at me or from worksheets he got from an online source. 

Micah repeatedly tested my boundaries and then began violating them entirely. He told me he understood the disability experience because he has disabled friends. He injected his own experiences into my narrative even when I told him not to. 

Looking back I now realize that **Micah saw my boundaries as something to be tested and broken down rather than respected.** And, once those boundaries were broken down, he wanted to assume the mantle of my best friend, confidante, and advisor. 

I cannot help but think how much better my experience would have been if I had been matched to a disabled therapist or at least one who had undergone significant training in disability trauma. **We must have more mental health professionals from marginalized communities** who are more aware of our struggles.

I have no support system, and two remaining family members. My grandma had knee surgery in August and I was with her for the first three weeks and left when she seemed better, but after that her recovery has taken a nose dive (incision got infected, repeated falls).

I've only just come through what I hope is the bulk of my angst against my mother for ""ruining"" my life, but still have so much resentment for my grandma because she ""ruined"" my mother's life. I know that my grandmother's own upbringing is what turned her into the kind of person she was (not good).. but I'm not there yet, and I find it so hard to have true caring and compassion for her instead of pity and sympathy.

Things keep going wrong after this surgery and I feel like I'm kicking the can down the road, that if I were a good granddaughter I'd already have gone back home to stay with her and help her through this.. I just feel like I barely have my head above water on my own (in a city 350 miles away, with no car) and when I'm back in that house with her, I can't find my patience (which I often have) and my anxiety is through the roof while my mood is absolutely abysmal.

I'm her only family member. My mom is dead, my dad isn't near by and doesn't like her, she has no siblings, she's never been good at keeping friends (except her next door neighbor who is trapped in her web). There isn't really any logistical reason why I can't go home except that all my plants will die. 

I think I'm afraid I will never get to leave, that caring for her will become my life, when I've already never even had a life of my own. And once she dies, it will be time to take care of my father. I'm not even good at caring for people."	allfloraleverything	post	27.24204625757056	female	White	0.9987397789955139	na	na	na	18	MadOver30	no prediction.
Sorry no good answers are coming here get in contact with a social worker is literally all you can do to get the ball rolling. EVERYTHING else will be on you if you decide to get involved. Its soul crushing that this is reality in the wealthiest nation in the history of earth but here we are. Literally millions of Americans are stuck in your exact situation and being one of them I would not blame for washing your hands, walking away, and pretending you're grandmother never existed. Not trying to be mean or scary here just blunt; it's hell trying to care for yourself and failing elderly loved ones in today's society nothing you do will ever be enough and the problems never end. Simply coming home goes from the highlight of your day to leaving a pit of despair at the thought of what mess they are in now and how long it will take YOU to clean up or fix the issue.	allfloraleverything	reply	na	na	na	0.9987397789955139	strong	no	no	na	MadOver30	no prediction.

Some find it meaningful, others do not. One element is your particular relationship, another thing is that some can do it better than others, and some people are easier to care for than others.

If you can live your own life, and get her set up with professional care, that would be wise. Nothing says you have to live for someone else in a case like this. It's not like when you decide to have a child; this isn't something you chose.

">Is there some reason your grandmother can't figure out her own care?

How much have you dealt with the elderly? How much have you dealt with arranging care for yourself or someone? If you suddenly became immobile, what would you, personally do? I'm going to guess that high on that list, if not at the very top, would be to rely on friends/family to get you through. Otherwise, who would you call to help you? How would you navigate all that while being too old to understand research on the internet, tired, in pain, already struggling to care for yourself, moderately confused, etc.?

"Yes, I am obviously hurting. I posted here about the struggles of staring down elder care as a singular, struggling person and I was surprised to find such callous comments. 

I genuinely find it perplexing and horrifying that one could ask, ""Is there some reason your grandmother can't figure out her own care"" .. especially if you are in patient care. Yours was not a helpful comment, and my response was 100% genuine. Age is only a complicating factor, as it would still make complete sense to have the same feelings if this happened to my (hypothetical) sister instead.

I'm disappointed at having been downvoted for asking legitimate questions -- the answers to which may actually be helpful (as so far there hadn't been any supportive comments). 

If I'm struggling to navigate all this, it must be much worse for her, right? And yet the comments were essentially, ""why is it YOUR problem""? That is bleak and uncaring and it really fucks me up.

"Discovered an excellent roundup of mental health subreddits over on /r/ListofSubreddits and said I would join. First time posting in an over-30s sub (I'm 32) too.

I've been using Reddit a little too enthusiastically over the past week or so. Reasoning: starting Wellbutrin and struggling with insomnia (hence, awake an abnormal amount of hours).

Also: figuring a ton of stuff out at the moment, from budgeting to starting this drug. And .... Reddit is amazing. There's a community for literally everything.

Two thoughts from this intense period of engagement

**The nice parts of Reddit are good for mental health**

One of the things I find interesting about this network is that it's commonly used by academic researchers to try to gauge the effects of online discourse.

Came across [this study randomly](https://www.chiefhealthcareexecutive.com/view/the-longterm-effects-of-participating-in-reddits-mental-health-communities) which says that /r/depression participants actually felt better from participating there:

>The results suggested that participants of r/depression increased in positive language and decreased in negative language over time‚Äîmore so than, or as much as, the other subreddits. ‚ÄúDespite prolonged interactions with other depressed individuals, r/depression members‚Äô emotional states were found to have become more positive,‚Äù wrote the researchers.

For the most part, I find Reddit an okay to good experience. But you never know when you're going to encounter:

**Reddit can be bad for mental health**

When Redditors aren't going out of their way to be nice to one another - see: mental health subs - this place can be a cesspool of negativity and toxicity:

\- General pedantry

\- General needless nastiness/aggression

\- Needless downvoting

There's also the meta trend that social media use is correlated with poorer mental health. I'm not sure why this is and my hunch would be that Reddit is better in this respect than other networks (see: Facebook/Instagram and the feelings of inferiority that a lot struggle with when they see others flaunting their success). But it's there. Ultimately I guess most of us - myself included - prefer talking to humans. And as nice as interacting online can be, ultimately there's this weird distance to it. 

So yeah. I feel like this place can be either helpful or detrimental to your mental health depending upon which community you choose to be active in.

Just thought I'd share the thought!"	danielrosehill	post	33.986879472279945	female	White	0.0024007223546504974	na	na	na	9	MadOver30	failed
"Its really important what community (sub) you decide to join but I agree its better than the other social medias and talking in person is better. 

I do like it for information or reaching out for something people in your real life don't have answers to. Mostly its good for jokes. 

Welcome to the sub and hope all goes well with your mental health. I did not have good luck with psych meds so I hope it works out better for you. Wellbutrin can cause insomnia so it might get a little worse before it gets better. 

I found meditation helped me a lot for insomnia and two ideas I read on reddit were: 

Try to do three things at once with your mind and wears it out for instance, do math or count, visualize and move your toes. It keeps you from overthinking about anything really because your mind cannot do a fourth thing. 

A sleep specialist said that everytime you dont fall asleep get up and do something else (Ive tried it with just sitting up bec I get too tired to get up all the way) and this ""resets"" your brain. Do not go back to bed until you've decided you are ready to go to bed. She said that everyone she worked with that did this for a few nights ( I don't remember how many) eventually the brain caught on that if you go to bed you have to go to sleep. Its almost like you are ""punishing"" your brain for not going to sleep and teaching it can't be in bed unless it goes to sleep. (Not sure if I'm explaining it correctly). Anyway some association is created that can help insomnia. 

Ive tried both and had them both work sometimes and other times they did not work but I had stuff going on that caused serious insomnia so YMMV. 

If it doesn't help just know I tried, cuz people out there do care, and I hope it gets better for you!"	danielrosehill	reply	na	na	na	0.0024007223546504974	no	no	no	na	MadOver30	failed
I always get at least 1 downvote when I post an opinion many people on a certain sub do not agree with.

I find smaller, focused communities generally a lot more civil than larger, default, and 'general interest' subs. 

I tend to avoid commenting in subs that are gen pop these days. Too many trolls and idiots.

I used to argue with people on Reddit. Just lead to a lot of stress. These days when I encounter someone who is either a jerk, or just wants to have an argument, my general refrain is just ""I think we just need to agree to disagree and to move on"", and various other phrases to that effect.

Woke up this morning thinking about home, high school, and classmates. That was a long time ago. I wonder if the kids back in the day knew I came from a dysfunctional, abusive home? I wonder if they realized the torment I experienced on a daily basis? In the second grade, I had a teacher who had me come to school on several consecutive Saturdays for IQ testing. She alone sensed something was amiss, but her conclusions couldn't have been more wrong. It wasn't my IQ that should have been in question. It's that I am Autistic. That one factor accounts for a lot, yet I remained undiagnosed for decades. I have to ask, would it have made a difference if anyone had known. Perhaps to my father, but I highly doubt anyone else would have cared less. My stepmother thought of me as the demon child from another realm. She wasn't fit to raise healthy children, let alone special needs. She died blaming me for all the wrong I did. She threw me into the streets like yesterday's news. I haven't been to a family gathering in over 40 years. I was never invited to my father's funeral. I was always a loner and still am, but they could have been a tad more compassionate. My stepmother was a gold-digging bitch. Heartless and cold. When I showed up on her doorstep after getting the news about my father's passing, second hand I might add, she had a garage sale set up of all his possessions. She told me I could have anything I wanted IF I bought it from her. Trust me, that was a fatal wound to my soul. I may never comprehend how family can be the meanest of all.

After tapering as low as they make effexor doses, going to zero still made me suffer, brain zaps were the worst.  I finally discovered the method of using prozac to mitigate effexor withdrawal.  Ask a doctor about this method. 

While on a minimum effexor dose, start taking a small dose of prozac.  Once the prozac builds up in your system for about 3 weeks, then go to zero effexor while still taking prozac.  Then a few weeks later, after effexor is out of the system, you can stop the prozac too.  The withdrawal is much more manageable this way."

"I believe very firmly that this is the case for me. It's hard to be sure regarding certain aspects of my experience (as in, is what's happening due to my illness, or is it the medication), but there are certain things that I can say, objectively, are a result of non-therapy treatments.

Trials by pharmaceutical companies and companies selling other treatments (looking at you, rTMS) are manipulated in favor of positive outcomes and downplay side effects. I've read testimonials from people who participated in trials like these who were bullied into not reporting side effects and their actual experiences accurately, because that's not the data that these companies want to show up in their trials.

Non-pharma-backed studies on the efficacy of medications don't go on for more than a couple of months, which isn't a sufficient length of time to get real results. There are also certain side effects, especially sexual ones, that are underreported. And, to my knowledge, there are no studies looking at the effects of long-term use of psychotropic medication.

I'm always hesitant to talk about this because I feel like a Big Pharma conspiracy theorist, but based on my own experiences I can't help but feel that a lot of the anti-psychiatry ideas that I've read about are true. That antidepressants eventually become depressogenic, that medications have a kindling effect, etc.

There are plenty of cases where medication has benefitted people and allowed them to function well enough to lead the kind of lives they want to lead. But there are also huge numbers of people who've had the opposite experience, and it seems to me that those voices have historically been suppressed.

That's a really interesting take on it that I hadn't considered. I think as far as destigmatizing meds goes, it's necessary for that message to be oversimplified initially. The priority is to get people to stop thinking of meds/mental illness as scary or bad, and that's all the movement (if you can even call it that) is thinking about right now. But as you mention, that message implies certain things that are incorrect or ignores important things in the interest of simplification, which is going to create unintended consequences that are going to show up down the line.

And you're right, referring to someone as treatment resistant is definitely stigmatizing, even though I think it's technically clinical term.

">Non-sarcastically, congrats on having found medication that works for you.

It isn't magic, it isn't without its drawbacks, but it took me a long time to get here (longer than it should have). Either way, I don't expect it to stay effective for very long, and I don't really intend to stay on it for too long regardless. Thank you all the same.

I think the med-centric destigmatization campaign is all capitalism, tbh. We could formulate the same narrative, that there's no """"""shame"""""" in being not-okay (by whatever definition you want, if you want it) without also selling medication. But of course, it is a campaign, and campaigns cost money, and that money comes from the companies who want to make more money formulating, bullshitting, and selling ""solutions"" to what largely grows out of the system we're born into. 

>That's a really interesting take on it that I hadn't considered.

There gets to be a point where, even though you don't exactly have ""shame"" for having depression or anxiety or mental illness, you dread talking about it because the conversations can easily go ""ohh that sucks, have you tried therapy? med a? med b? my friend says med c worked really well for him"" and you can easily go through this whole list of drugs/combos and say ""no, that didn't help"" and it just gets fucking shitty real fast.

ETA: Also, the point I was trying to make earlier was also that when you go through this list of meds that haven't been effective, you can easily feel like *you* are the aberration -- especially when you see ads blasted all over the place. You don't hear about the stories of those of us who largely have not been helped by meds because it's easy to make us feel like shit about it so we shut up about it, but I think it's way more common than we think."	-flameohotman-	reply	na	na	na	0.007339984178543091	weak	strong	no	na	MadOver30	failed

"I would like to share my story. I just graduated with my doctorate and started my first job today in a healthcare field at nearly the age of 40.

I needed to live at home with my parents from the ages of 25-35 as an adult child due to severe mental illness.

I never thought I would make it through and applying to finish my education by pursuing a doctorate at 35 is something everyone told me was basically a hopeless venture but here I am!

I knew many people in my early 20s who suffered with depression and other mental health struggles as well including people I've met with very serious disorders such as Bipolar Disorder or Schizoaffective Disorder who took a couple of years off from college etc. but then were still able to get stable and land on their feet by 30. I remember not understanding why I wasn't in that boat and how I was treated very differently after I turned 30 and was still living at home with unmanaged that mental illness that would not respond to any form of treatment after so many years.

Never give up and never let anyone tell you it's hopeless.

Now I work in a field I love, doing what I love, getting recognition for my work even - it blows my mind.  I hope to always stay humble and grateful to everyone who helped me.  

Because it took a lot of help, trial & error, different meds, a whole lot of hospital stays, ER visits, suicidal ideations, suicide, psychotic behavior . . . 

Sometimes I feel angry that I'm so far behind other people but I think I have a richness of experiences that makes me useful in this world.  You, too.  

I'm very proud of you and thrilled to know there's other late bloomers out there.

"Something comes along that structurally changes your life -- an opportunity, a new responsibility, a new whatever -- and then that has a cascade effect and slowly but before long -- years, but not too long -- you begin to ask yourself if you're even depressed anymore, or it has changed so much you start to be introspective about the nature of your remaining depression, which is now in the backseat if not shoved in the trunk of life.

Use every bit you have in you to 1, maintain physical health; don't abuse or neglect your body to the extent that you can (and heck, even really focus on improving physical health if you can), and 2, experiment with new *anything*. New club. New job. New hobby. New friend(s). New pet. New *anything*.  And keep experimenting.

Your mood and mental health won't change until your hour-to-hour existence changes, I believe. You have to go through new motions if you want to feel new feelings.  I don't think people overcome a mood disorders by continuing to wallow and follow the same contours of their day that they dug out when they were depressed.  That said, I'm also a big believer in wallowing for a good long while if that's what you need.

But when you feel the urge to be done with the shit and move on, try new shit.  It's really never too late.  Like, if you're healthy, 70s are the new 50s.  You have a lot of life left."	throwawaytho987	reply	na	na	na	0.011523728258907795	no	no	no	na	MadOver30	failed
"I'm 57F and sometimes I feel like it's too late - but only sometimes. I do struggle a lot with regular depressions (from bipolar 2). At my age, I really am closer to death than I used to be. 

But I've been doing self-help work and finally have come to the conclusion that since I'm not dying tomorrow, I'm going to be here for awhile. So I've started working on doing things, self-improvement, just starting from where I am. I use the nonzero subreddit and those first few days it was embarrassing how basic my goals were. 

But one tiny step at a time, things are getting better. I'm letting myself dream about things without letting it derail my daily plodding. I'm learning languages, I'm exercising every day, I'm paying my bills on time. I'm on disability so money's an issue - but I'm finding ways to supplement, and ways to save, because I've got some dreams that will require me learning to save. 

Sorry I got off track talking about myself - but I just wanted to express that you can just start with where you are and you can start small. Small little steps done daily lead to more steps, bigger steps. 

Perhaps you can ask yourself if CBT would help you? I've been doing that and it's helped me; it's been good for me to see what exactly I'm thinking that's bringing out bad, depressed (in)activity. Personally I use it more for anxiety, but it's supposed to be really helpful for depression to.

"It is too late.

It's too late for the idea you had of yourself. That version of yourself that you had pictured in your head didn't realise itself, and it's probably too late for it.

But that version of yourself, the one you had set your expectations to, isn't the end all be all. There are other versions of ourselves that are attainable, valuable and still worth pursuing even if they don't reflect what's in our minds. 

What we need to do it set away the expectations, set away that idealised version of our life.

You pictured yourself a mother and a spouse? A successful career woman? Maybe that's not going to happen, something else still can, something that is worth living for, that gets you up in the morning. 

There's an old, fat, childless version of yourself who still finds love and happiness with a raggedy old man travelling the world on a dime.  Or another that finds happiness with adoption. And anything in between. 

It's not an easy thing to accept, but only once we let go of unobtainable expectations that we have of ourselves can we catch worse ones that, while worse, are still better that what we end up with by giving up on everything. 

I've felt this way countless times in the past. And now I look at my past self and I realise that if I now had what I thought then was not enough, I would be so grateful and happy.
I'm 35 and I genuinely, truly hate myself for what I've done. I look at myself 5 years ago and I was so much better. Sure I was miserable from time to time but things really weren't as dreadful as I made them up to be. Even more so another 5 years back. Yet time and time again I've given up on myself, ruined my life over and over, destroyed relationships with lovers, with friends, with family. 

It's really hard to be objective. If it were somebody else, we would be quick to point out how to make the best of an un ideal situation. But we can't do it with ourselves, and being depressed only makes you come to the worst conclusion every single time. And you're always tired. All the time. But still, giving up on yourself is not going to do you any favours. Go to doctors. Try to find as many ways as possible to get better. One at a time, don't count how many attempts fail, don't count the time it takes, just don't give everything up. Let go of what you think should be and keep holding on just a little bit. Things really can get better,even if it doesn't seem feasible. We're much closer to being happy that we are to actual dread, we're just too blind to see in when we're in the midst of it. 

It's not easy. It really is not. But I'm convinced it really is the secret recipe of genuine, naturally happy people: not setting expectations of themselves, taking things as they come, not focusing of what they could be, or worse, what they think they should in their own head.

Now bear in mind, I'm talking entirely out of my ass. I've written too much on a screen too little and I'm not sure what I wrote is even coherent. But I can tell you this: 

don't be like me. I have given up completely again and again and again. I'm completely alone. I hate what I see in the mirror. And yet I know that on the course I'm on, there's going to be yet another future version of myself who is going to look back at this moment and think ""you actually had a good thing going on, you only really needed to try a little"".

All your job needs to do is support you.  It‚Äôs not who you are, and you can bounce around.  Nursing is great because there are so many kinds of things you can do with it.

"Sometimes maturity means making the most of a situation that you feel isn't optimal right now.  

You can study sociology (and all kinds of other subjects, and take up all kinds of hobbies) on your own without needing a degree or having to do sociology for a living.

You can make a good living with a nursing degree while you get yourself together.  

And then once you've matured and have some resources, and once you know yourself and your situation better, you will be in a better position to make your next move.  

Your career is only part of who you are right now.  

What's more important is how you deal with the situations, good and bad, that arise throughout your life and your career.

"Hey, you have about 40 years of being in the working industry before you can legally retire. Assuming you're 30. Also assuming you're 30, you've only been allowed to work for 15 years. Of those 15 years, only 10 of those years you were a suitable age to have a career. That means you've only used 1/5 of your working life. You still have 4/5 left, assuming you're 30. That's a long time to play with, change careers, change your mind. My mum was 45 ish before she graduated from university as a psychologist.

Nourish your spiritual path.  That‚Äôs all.  Be kind to yourself.  32 here. Suicide attempt 5 years ago and still want to die many days.

Connection with our truest selves.  Denial of it is the reason I‚Äôve found to be the cause of my mood and personality disorder. Serving other people who are also hurting is also a cure of sorts.

When you're at your lowest, this can be a good reminder that you yourself are sound, even if the world you've been thrown into is unjust and chaotic. You are not responsible for the world, only how you respond to it.

OP - Frankl's book is short and analytical, about his own experience in the death camps and the knowledge he gleaned from the people he met there. It could be tragic and painful to read, but it isn't. It's about how to overcome adversity, whether small or great.

"I need some hope. 

I‚Äôm 30 years old with a beautiful wife and 2 incredible young boys (5 and 3). Unfortunately ADHD and depression have been tightening their grip on me more and more the last 4-5 years. I‚Äôve tried adderall and legitimately every SSRI and SNRI med you can think of with only short term boosts if any. It seems all medications have left me worse overall than before. To make matters worse, my little sister died by suicide one year ago and trying to work through that has sent me spiraling. 

My life as I knew it has essentially come to a halt. I lack drive and motivation. It‚Äôs almost impossible for me to get things done at work and I rarely ever have energy for my wife or kids. My outlook on life was once filled with hope, optimism and dreams but is now muddy and mostly hopeless/meaningless. 

Recently I‚Äôve pulled together enough to give life an honest shot again. I‚Äôm about 15 days into completely quitting medication and also alcohol. I‚Äôll be seeing a therapist regularly starting tomorrow and decided to see a psychiatrist for a review instead of simply experimenting with my family doctor. 

I‚Äôm not looking for false hope or BS but wanted to honestly ask if anyone has been in similar shoes and rediscovered zest and meaning in life? I welcome any advice, anecdotes or words. Thank you in advance!"	bclink3	post	33.63518426514586	male	White	0.9873973727226257	na	na	na	6	MadOver30	failed

"I've dug myself out of the deep hole of depression a few times, but it's a mistake to say ""I"" did it.  Sometimes I was in so deep I truly believed I'd never find joy again so I didn't look; I needed some friends to literally kidnap me for a movie.  That one movie day showed me that I could enjoy things again.  Another pit of despair I got out of by going through the motions of parenting: keep them alive, pretend to be happy to see them, fulfill social contract obligations of how a parent should act while I felt dead inside.  Eventually I noticed how pretty my daughters hair caught the light, her infectious smile, her learning to read, and the pretending to enjoy my time with her became real joy.  Other bad times ended through medication that let me be motivated enough to take a shower, and once that insurmountable task was accomplished I could move on to grocery shopping, etc.  Eventually I didn't need the meds to give me the motivation.

I think it's about finding the tiny joys in your life as it is, not making massive changes to your life in the chase of happiness.  I'm not well versed in Buddhism, but I have read some about it and found it meaningful, the idea that suffering is wanting something you can't have so happiness can be wanting what you already have.  ""Love the one you're with""

If nothing else, time changes everything.  2 years ago I'd never have guessed we'd have a pandemic/racial injustice /political coup/lest we forget Australia burning then flooding kind of year.  Can't say that's a change for the better, but who is to say that the next big event won't be a massive improvement in quality of life for you.  Maybe you'll find oil on your land, win the lottery, add a special family member, make a great friend, catch the biggest fish, or your brain will just start firing on all pistons again.  Personally, I'm hoping for friendly aliens coming by to save us from climate change and maybe give us time travel.  In the meantime, I'm going to enjoy this book I'm reading, scratch my cats soft ears, sleep on the softest bed with quality sheets, and think less about the things that suck that I can't change.

"A lot of people try a lot of different ADHD meds before they find one that works well for them. 

I‚Äôm sure Adderall is great for lots of folks, but it was lousy for me. If you‚Äôve only tried one kind of medication for ADHD, I‚Äôd really recommend that‚Äôs something you talk with your doctor about. 

I know there can be a lot of overlap between depression and ADHD around motivation, but if the root cause is ADHD and the depression is more of an outcome (because you beat yourself up for feeling useless that you can‚Äôt get anything done) then treating the ADHD could go a long way to helping you feel more optimistic and productive. 

I just figure, ADHD is easier than depression to treat with medication, from what I understand, so maybe you can get that working for you and you‚Äôll feel a bit more like other wins are possible. 

I, and a lot of other ADHD-ers, like the glasses metaphor for medication: you wouldn‚Äôt expect someone who needs glasses to stop wearing them and still be able to see, likewise it‚Äôs not reasonable to expect someone with ADHD to self-motivate without meds. The ability to initiate a non-fun task is literally one of the problems the medication is treating. 

I can‚Äôt imagine what a disaster I‚Äôd look like if I tried to go to work unmedicated. All those ignored emails! 

Just figured it was something to consider‚Ä¶ 

I can see you‚Äôre trying to stay off alcohol and I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs value in that for you. But meds aren‚Äôt a recreational drug. They‚Äôre like crutches or glasses that help you to be more functional. 

Motivation is huge in ADHD, as I‚Äôm sure you know. 

Like a lot of ADHD people, I‚Äôm a pretty big Russell Barkley fan and cried a lot watching some of his presentations about ADHD, and learning a lot of the things I disliked about myself were symptoms of the disorder and weren‚Äôt actually evidence that I was a bad or lazy person. 

>	‚ÄúOur research shows that ADHD is much more than a neurodevelopmental disorder, it‚Äôs a significant public health issue,‚Äù says Dr. Barkley. ‚ÄúIn evaluating the health consequences of ADHD over time, we found that ADHD adversely affects every aspect of quality of life and longevity. This is due to the inherent deficiencies in self-regulation associated with ADHD that lead to poor self-care and impulsive, high-risk behavior. The findings are sobering, but also encouraging, as ADHD is the most treatable mental health disorder in psychiatry.‚Äù

That‚Äôs from [here](https://chadd.org/adhd-weekly/dr-barkley-to-share-his-research-on-adhd-and-life-expectancy/).

"So this time last year I was in hospital really really unwell. I had to talk to my team about my trauma and my physiatrist went on and on about me been abused in an adult manner to put it but I have no memory of such trauma events but she was certain something did happen. I have been with the public serves since then as  I suffered a great deal with psychosis that lasted nearly a year I have been ok over the last few months now. I decided I need extra help and support so I am going back as a patient with my old physiatrist but a bit uncertain that we will have the same relationship that we had before was with her for 5 years until she moved me and feel abandoned by her bit of my borderline personality traits flaring up but still need the extra support that they have even if it means going back to her.  

My parents got on with her but are dreading me going back as her patient since all the investigating she did but got her no where only making my paranoid over something I have no memory or thoughts that it did happen.   

Am I over reacting I miss the fact that she got me so far in my recovery before she blow it all away and made me disappointed in her want to give it a second chance if she accepts me back under her care but nerves about talking to her about how I am since I seen her last  thinking of putting certain boundaries in place around that so we can get back to when I trusted her with my mental health care is this too bad to say to her if I do get back in her care. Confused on who is the right person to lean on and know I will be ok within their care. Still have flash backs when I was so sick not sure if I am worried that she will be one of my triggers even if I want to forgive and forget, Don't think I could go through another episode of illness that was a horror for months on end and had me nervous to even sleep which was the only time I had some piece away from it all. feeling unaware about how stable my mental health will be moving forward at this point it should not be part of my fear that I can do this and not be in a place where I have a fear most days of having to recover from psychosis again."

"Avoid mental health professionals who make you feel worse.

Its utterly incorrect the assumption 'no pain no gain' when doing therapy

When you are working with someone to get better, you should feel you are getting new insights that are helpful to you. Over time you should be feeling stronger, more capable, and more in control.

Dont settle for someone who is upsetting you. Real harm can occur with unskilled people.

Also, if you dont want to talk about a particular experience, you can just say ""no"": Theres no rule that says you have to re-live trauma to get better, and its well known that forcing people to talk about such experiences can be re-traumatizing. You should be in the drivers seat of what you are comfortable talking about, and not. Always."	Irishkatie	reply	na	na	na	0.014665542170405388	no	no	no	na	MadOver30	failed
">my physiatrist went on and on about me been abused in an adult manner to put it but I have no memory of such trauma events but she was certain something did happen.

If you have no memory of it, it probably didn't happen. Most ""recovered memories"" end up being false memories. It is also very difficult for survivors of trauma like that to fully forget it, particularly if it is ongoing. A single event might be successfully forgotten, but not so much a pattern. 

>thinking of putting certain boundaries in place around that so we can get back to when I trusted her with my mental health care is this too bad to say to her if I do get back in her care.

I've worked with counselors who lean psychoanalytic and who lean towards CBT. I think it's ok to look back, analyze and remember because witnessing is a big part of what human beings are but I've benefited the most from CBT.

In this case it sounds like she's trying to fit a story (another very human trait), but things don't always have nice clean stories.

You are so right I have someone I get on with now but only a year with him and he has a good team but when I was with her she got to know me as well as checking in on me when I needed more meds at a personal level which gave me proper reassurance and I focused on all the treatment I went to with her well most a few people she got me to to I couldn't click well and then when I eventually did and went back into hospital under her care they had no room to take me back leaving to find new people to go to but got on good with them and learnt a lot. Still my folks want me to have therapy that more on going which is not what happens so I am on the look out again to see if I can find someone more or less to talk to that doesn't get to clingy when I open up to them. Ends up them more upset than me leaving me annoyed and feel time was wasted at times and not a good trait when you have to care for people with mental health issues so still on the look out.

Yeah I will there was a lot of people I know from staying in the hospital before but not as sick that had a big talk with her about their care she has triggered a few people that are in her care but still she would stick up for you through anything you tell her personally when things are going well that is which was me and he for years until the last time I was an inpatient last year."

I just wanted to let you know that you're not alone. I know that sentiment rarely helps much, but I'll be 39 in August, and I feel very similar. Every single day is a massive struggle, with very few glimpses of peace, or a feeling that the suffering is worth it. And most modern western societies seem to be misery machines, and only seem to be getting worse, so I think sometimes we should take some of the onus off of ourselves. Try to find the few things that bring a semblance of meaning, and try to steer life towards those things slowly over time. Maybe hone a craft, find love in nature, animals, and hopefully platonic love through family and friendships. Do some traveling, read, drink too much occasionally, try sobriety, and find hilarity in the absurdness of waking up and trying again each day. Maybe one can eventually  stumble into some kind of life that feels worth living, one day down the road. Anyways, just wanted to send warm regards your way, and anyone else out there suffering.

"Hello everyone, as the title says, I'm going right now through a small emotional crisis. So please bare with me because I am not in the right state of mind.

As many people of my age and generation, I still live with my parents; I never had a meaningful romantic partner despite always wanting to have a family; I am well educated (as in I have a Master¬¥s degree in history) but I am working as an English teacher because all the opportunities to teach humanities or social sciences are alread filled by older people with way more credentials, so my job is not exactly stable, because I don't have labor rights and such; I am not able to save enough money but it doesn't really matter because I will never be able to buy a house for myself; I don't have deep connections with other people and I have few if any friends; with the pandemic I gained a bit of weight so my self-image is on the floor; I am getting so worried that I'll never do anything with my life; I sometimes feel like a child because I still play videogames and even if I KNOW that a lot of people my age still do, I still have this feeling that I shouldn't do it anymore; one of my other hobbies is drawing and then I see way younger artists being so, so much better than I am on twitter and on instagram and that really messes me up; sometimes I wonder I'm still a child despite paying taxes, working, cooking at times, cleaning the bathroom etc.; my parents tell me ""oh you're still young"" yet I'm 30 and when they were 30 they were already, if not succesful, at least they KNEW what they were doing in their life and had a family; I constantly second guess everything; I feel like a failure; I don't like my life because I feel like I'm wasting it, despite being fairly; I don't have people to relate to what I'm feeling; AND it feels like I have to work three times harder than others to get the same results. What do I mean by this? Example, my older brother got to study a Master¬¥s degree in a European country right now, and I'm not able to get into a damn Ph.D. program and I've been trying for over a year, despite knowing that I'm competent at the historic field and it feels extremely disheartening.

As I said, I'm going through quite a crisis and I want to play videogames all day, or get in closet with a book and never come out, or lock myself in a room and draw forever, but at the same time I always have this anxiety that my time is slowly passing and that I have no time to wallow, instead I should still keep preparing myself more and more and more: keep learning the two languages I'm studying, keep reading about historical, political, sociological, and economic theory, keep writing, etc. etc. BUT THEN, I think ""Oh shoot, what if I'm a failure"" and the cycle starts ALL OVER AGAIN.

Yes I know I'm having quite an emotional crisis it sucks, I have no one to talk about it becuase it's almost 2am and therapy is quite expensive so that's a no no.

Basically what do I want with this? I don't know, to be heard, to talk with someone, to receive some advice maybe. Like I said, I'm not in the best mental state at the moment. Do forgive me if I don't make any sense."	Perhapsoneday1	post	23.515824414976507	female	White	0.9951900243759155	na	na	na	11	MadOver30	failed
"Do you truly want to be studying all that stuff? Pursuing a Ph.D and so on? 

Or are you doing it more because you've come to believe, for whatever reason, comparing yourself to others maybe, that in order to be considered ""a success"", you should to do it?

I guess I'm asking what success means to you.

It sounds as if you're putting a lot of pressure on yourself to have everything figured out, where you're going in life, exactly how you're going to get there,  etc. 

Yes, it would be good to know where you're headed and what you want to do with your life. Some people juat seem to know from a young age. In a way I envy them.

I've never known what it is that I want to ""do"" with my life. By ""do"", I suppose I mean as a job. 

To a lot of people, what we do for a job seems to define us. You meet someone for the first time, they ask ""So, what do you do?"", and they make judgements and assumptions (whether consciously or not) about us depending on what we say.

Anyway, yeah, I've never had a clue what I want to do. So I've had some very different jobs. Some were better than others. For 11 years I was a newspaper sub-editor. I enjoyed that. I'm good with the written word, so I naturally took to it. But the job wasn't part of any big life plan or anything. The opportunity simply came up and I went for it.

The work I'm doing at the moment isn't so great. It's a low-paid, unskilled, physical kind of job. But that's all right. For me, what I do as a job doesn't define me as a person. There's more to life than work. If people want to judge me, that's OK. My self-image and wellbeing isn't dependent on the opinions of other people.

I'm creative, too. I like to draw. I paint big stuff on walls; street art I suppose you'd call it. But it's just something I enjoy doing in my spare time. I don't want to make it into a career and I don't care whether I'm great at it or compare my work to that of others. It's more about expressing myself, a creative outlet, therapeutic almost.

So you like playing videogames. That's fine. Don't be so hard on yourself. It really doesn't matter what anyone might or might not think about your gaming interests. And if someone thinks worse of you, then what? Does it really matter? When you care too much about other people's opinions of you, it gives them power over you. 

I'm not sure where I'm going with all this ... I'm rambling. I think I simply want you to understand that whatever you want to do, that's OK. It would be a shame to pursue things that mean little to you because you feel you have something to prove, that you can be a ""success"".

Of course, maybe I'm on the wrong track here and you do want to be studying languages and pursuing a Ph.D. If that's the case, keep it up, do your best, and try not to compare yourself to others. As another comment said, there's very little to be gained by comparison.

There's no rule stating that you have to have everything worked out by the time you're 30, or any age for that matter.  It's OK to figure things out as you go, to change your mind, go in a new direction, try different things etc. To me, that's life. No ""five-year plan"" or whatever.  More simply living life, whatever it brings.

I hope all that made some kind of sense ;)

You get one life to live how you want. You can't control everything - like job and PhD availability - but you can control whether you keep doing art and keep trying to get into a doctoral program.

My boss is one of the smartest, most talented, experienced, knowledgeable people I've ever met with years of experience writing professional documents, but still struggled for years to get into a PhD program. He lucked out by getting one of the people reviewing the candidates to give brutally honest feedback which helped him figure out what he could do differently, and eventually was accepted into a program he really values.

You're ok. It's ok to be frustrated. In the big picture, there are many doing much worse for themselves. You can be proud of what you've accomplished so far. It's ok not to be achieving everything you want right now. You're going to be alright.

"This post is a few days old now, but I wanted to say, these are all very normal thoughts and feelings.

You know, as a historian, that people's lives are shaped by forces and circumstances beyond their individual will. I know it doesn't feel helpful to hear that, but I do hope it makes you feel less alone. Because if you look around, there are SO many people in the same boat.

re: pursuing a doctorate. It's probably not about your competency. As a whole, academia limits the number of people they take into fields like history, based on their estimates of the job market. And the job market has been very bad for so long, and only looks to get worse with technologization and neoliberalization.

I had a similar crisis at 30 and was living at home just like you very similar situation. I've come to find that many are in this situation. It's just that no one shares it out loud. Know you're not alone and that many of the 30 year olds you meet are exactly like you even if they won't admit it. I didn't move out until after 35 but I eventually got there.

Note: Epitome is autocorrect correcting my spelling again when it didn't need it  A person can lie to themselves for so long that they start believing them. I lied to myself when I told myself I didn't need anyone and I was fine being alone. I wasn't. I just didn't see how miserable I was. It was a defense mechanism that run amok. I never risked getting hurt. Love is like gambling. You have to risk a lot to gain a lot. It wasn't until I fell in love that I realized the void couldn't be filled by something I bought.

"I'm tired. And a little bit drunk. And very depressed.

Whenever I let my mind wander (and I well know I shouldn't), I just become more depressed. 

Introspection is a curse. 

The truth is, it's all over. Not my physical life - that would have been a relief. But everything I ever cared for, that I ever valued, no longer on the agenda. 

I know that lots of people change their plans in life, by their own will, or forced into submission. I am just one of them. 

But I just hate my station in life and I don't have the agility to adapt to it. 

Turns out, my sole purpose is a carer (I should point out I know lots of people bravely, willingly, and gracefully accept this role and that it does of course has a very important purpose per se).

Turns out, my only 'relief' is to read some trash novels and watch some trash tv. I do a rubbish job during the day, rush home and spend time with family until about 10 pm, and spend what 'free time' I have distracting myself with said trash books and trash tv until I take a sleeping med and go to bed. 

Turns out, there is nothing more or less to me, or the purpose of my life. I have achieved absolutely nothing. I don't have a partner/spouse. I don't have friends. I don't have a career. I don't have money to spend. At my age, I can't pull a veil over my eyes and pretend that there is still time or opportunity to catch up. I will have to live with the fact that they won't happen - I won't have a partner, I won't have a fulfilling career, and I won't be financially secure for the rest of my life. All that 'it gets better' bullshit is really only bullshit. 

I guess my only choice is to find peace amidst shit. To want nothing, and so want for nothing."	stranger38	post	28.72053099095801	female	White	0.9988865256309509	na	na	na	4	MadOver30	no prediction.
"Hi there. I hope you don't mind but I took a look at your post history and it sounds like you're being expected to shoulder a lot of family responsibilities.

From what you've shared it seems like we are in a similar situation. I'm Chinese too and have been taking care of my mum for the past few years. She's been sick and bed-ridden for years. Being the only unmarrried child it kind of fell to me to take care of her. My siblings help out now and again but I feel I've done far more than my fair share.

Let's not mince words; the situation we find ourselves in can outright suck. You try and do right by others and do your best for yourself but it just seems to encourage people to take more and more advantage of you. And at the end of the day you're so damn tired and there's no one there to take care of you and your needs.

Repeat after me: it can suck big time.

I'm not going to give advice or suggestions. All I can do is share what I've been doing (to varying degrees of success) to maintain my own sanity and individuality. If you don't want that right now then stop reading here. I won't be offended, do what you feel is right.

* I exercise as regularly as I can. I aim for 3 times a week. Sometimes I'll take a walk instead on the days when I feel my head is going to explode.

* I try to meditate. I'm still terrible at this but I just sit and breathe. I don't keep time, I go for as long as I feel like.

* I stretch almost every night before I sleep. The act of stretching calms me down and hopefully gives me better sleep.

* I've been reclaiming my hobbies. Right now I'm reading when I can. Just a few weeks ago I was in a writing phase. I also practice Cardistry but haven't done that in a while.

* I try and meet girls to chat with online. I may still be a single guy but I'm still hoping to meet a compatible girl. I haven't been able to get out there much in the past few years so I've had to use online solutions. I was too chicken to use online dating sites but Tinder worked fine. Around here most people use it to meet potential partners rather than have a one-night stand (though there are people who use it for that here). I managed to find some girls that legit want to just talk. We exchanged numbers and I still message them every now and again especially when I feel down.

I just read the book ‚ÄúBuddhist on Death Row‚Äù and it gave me hope and more importantly inspired me to meditate on a regular basis again. Meditation is the only thing I‚Äôve found to help. I get so caught up in my thoughts and usually those thoughts aren‚Äôt helpful. But when I just relax and focus on my breath for 200-300 breaths, it helps. Highly recommend.

My GF (30) and I (62) have a long distance relationship. She asks for money I don't have. Her asking isn't the topic here. It's when she asks and I have nothing to give her, I feel like a complete failure. I'm old school from when it was the man's responsibility to be the bread winner. It tears me apart knowing I can't provide for her. Maybe dating her is like having a Mercedes. Looks good in the garage, but I can't afford the repairs. I never hid my financial status, or lack thereof, from her, so she knew what she was getting into. That doesn't stop me from feeling bad. I'm a retired senior living on a paltry fixed income.

"Yesterday, a girl ( giving her the benefit of the doubt) on Reddit asked me to chat. Normally I dismiss those requests automatically, but she is cute. It was obvious from the get- go that she wanted a relationship. I haven't dated in ages, so I decided to see where it lead. I wasn't looking for anyone, so I had no expectations, but I was watching for red flags. Let me tell you, if you are trying to scam someone, don't tell him you inherited a million in real estate and then say your phone is being turned off and you need $50. That flag isn't just flying, it slapped him across the face.

She seemed to be trying too hard, but I was young once (I know, it's hard to fathom, but I was) and I remember trying too hard. I chalked that up to youth. Some flags just cannot be reasoned away or ignored. Little things start adding up. There comes a point where you have to accept it's not real. My heart wasn't invested yet, but it's the principle I find distressing. I find it difficult to accept there are people out there who have no qualms about playing with another's emotions for money. So even though it wasn't real, I still feel disappointed. It's also hard to explain when she says she doesn't know anything about Bitcoin, but later is giving you instructions on how withdrawals work.

I got burned once in a romantic scam. At the beginning of this year, I got burned big time by a philanthropist scammer. What I am saying is right now, my cynicism is on high alert. No, I didn't give her anything... I bailed.

"FWIW my wife is very unwell and unable to leave the house a lot of the time. Because its so hard for her to see friends and family, she has started talking to people online. Its been a hell of a ride, and I would be lying if I didnt say its been full of frustration. Every time she puts out there that she's seeking friends on dedicated friend subs. These subs have rules that specifically state they arent for hookups. She says explicitly every time, she is married, and not looking for anything except platonic conversations. And every time there are assholes who want to get into things with her. Its been incredibly frustrating. Like which part of ""only looking for frendships, married"" dont these people get. I could make this post a lot longer because some of the situations (she has been doing this awhile) have been really out there. Like *really*  out there. And some of the people have been full-on dickheads.

The reason Im telling you all this is she has managed to make some genuine friendships, but I would say for every one decent person she has met, there have probably been 20 people who werent doing the right thing, had nothing in common, or simply didnt have the basic skills of holding a conversation.

Point being, for her it was perseverence. She now has people she can talk to every day who are really nice and we get to share their stories from all different parts of the world. Its pretty cool actually.

Reddit is such a mixed platform. Anyone reading this would - if they have spent any amount of time on here - have had some really truly awful encounters with other redditors. It has some of the worst people. It would be untrue to say it didnt also have lots of actual proper decent humans too though.

Sorry this happened to you. Sorry for the long post. Hang in there. Hope you meet someone nice soon. They are out there.

"TW:  minor mention of self harm, thoughts but no intentions.

Sorry to make a whiny post but I figured people on here would get it.  Due to age, disability, and circumstances I'm totally dependent on one last friend both emotionally and for some practical things.  I'm awkward over the phone and she's usually kind enough to email with me daily.  Suddenly she went dark and I haven't heard from her since one message on Saturday.  She does that rarely for a day or so but always emails me to let me know why, but nothing this time, and I've been afraid she might be ill or in trouble.  Finally this a.m. I texted her to ask if she's OK, and she said yes, she's playing pool with a friend.  (We're both retired.)  

I was imagining her dead/in an auto accident, and I'm relieved that she's OK.  But now of course I'm questioning whether I've offended her, or she's burnt out with me, or what.  Overreacting, of course.  But I'm literally terrified.  She's not the sort to be open about feelings, and she absolutely doesn't owe me anything, so I don't feel I can just ask her why.  

Emotionally I want to crawl in a hole right now.  I hate being so dependent on someone, and I hate that my world has shrunk to such a tiny focus.  And I hate that I want to hit my head against a wall until I'm in pain -- I won't do that but it's the image that keeps coming up in my head.  I hate myself and my life and it hurts.

I don't really have a solution for you, only an observation.

I managed to find a job eventually which I don't hate. It still feels mostly wasted time but not entirely. And I fill up the free time with stuff I look forward to (instead of drinking like I used to). Getting ahead and getting better is an iterative process. And I know how hard it is to find meaning. I struggled with the realization that in the end, nothing makes sense. There is no goal. I had sucidal thoughts. Then I realised that if there is no overarching truth, I can make up my own meaning. I fuckin paid for this ride already, I'm going to enjoy it. I'm not sure if any of this helps at all. It's just sometimes it's worth to just bite down on your mouthgard hard and go forward.

"This is where I was before the struggle became my own reason for being. It sounds like you're close. I'd heard talk all my life about 'finding something bigger than yourself' and thought it was bonkers spiritualism. But I get it now, because the 'bigger than myself' thing for me is the struggle. I started out trying to figure out what the 'point' of living was. For me, ideally it was 1: human connection, and 2: what I can do for the world. 1 I already shit the bed on and it doesn't seem like it's an option, and 2? Well, I don't really need happiness to do it. My own happiness is what I had been trying to get back to for years, and then I realized it isn't even necessary. In the grand scheme of things, it's inconsequential. I can do *something* for the world, the struggle, even if I'm not ""living my best life"". That feels so much better than spending the rest of my life (however short it may be or how short I may make it) stuck in my own head, crying over myself.

I think psychedelics shows you what you need to see, it doesn't necessarily change you as a person by solely depending on it. It may wear out with time and for many the lessons stay for a longer period of time. But you have the option to integrate what you learnt with psychedelics in your life and for many that is enough.

I‚Äôm tired. So tired that I seem strangely calm. 

I hate my life. Because it‚Äôs nothing but pain and suffering. I‚Äôm an average person who has been tested way beyond my limits, with no reprieve, no breaks, no appreciation. 

In the last decade I‚Äôve realized, slowly, that my life is not mine at all. None of my talents, interests, aspirations, hopes, actually matter. I‚Äôm merely place on earth to deal with my family.

"I am also the daughter of a Chinese family. It seems that some Chinese parents are emotionally immature. When they are unwell or have life problems, instead of being considerate towards their family, they play up the victim card and bask in the enjoyment of being cared for. It puts a lot of emotional strain on the carer.

A lot of Asian kids grew up never being allowed to be kids. From a young age we are expected to shoulder our parents' burdens and be good and avoid giving them more problems. That includes a lot of normal kids behaviours, wants and needs etc - we were not allowed to have them because they created a burden on our poor fragile parents. This kind of upbringing made us feel like our lives are not our own, we are not the masters of our fate, and we have to live for our families, otherwise we are being too ""selfish"" and ""inconsiderate"".

Honestly a lot of that is bullshit. We can do a lot for our parents out of the goodness of our hearts, but ultimately we can't live their lives for them or suffer on their behalf.

apparently not.  so i feel you on that one and not only that, i initially perceived her letting me go as a patient because ""she doesn't like me"" and it's not that at all.  it's that people are really messed up right now and there are loads more people that are worse than me.  

everyone is weird right now.  no one wants to do anything, people are either busier or in some kind of holding pattern. . . the whole world feels like it's holding its breath.

have you ever read ""Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance"" ?  you might really dig it.  or hate it.  you'll know in the first 10 pages.  

it's not you OP, it's never been you.  those are old tapes, those are remnants of something you maybe once heard or maybe internalized.  you can let it go.  people can like you and still say no.  that's hard, i know.  i struggle with the same thing.  my best friend recently was mad at me and i decided she hated me forever, we were never going to talk again. 

and last night, as i was hanging out in her house she was like ""you're silly i was just mad at you but of course you are my friend, even if i'm mad"" and my mind was totally blown.  

there's gotta be a vintage-motorcyle-head type subreddit, no?

I remember one thing from the Uncommon Knowledge depression program i did. And i did this before going to a regular therapist. Is that bad things are supposed to be specific, random, and temporary. Conversely, good things are supposed to be framed as universal, earned, and stable. So, the advice is that when you are in one frame try to switch it to another. In this example it's a bad thing. So, it's temporary (your friends are just busy) or random (they don't have this hobby). I don't know about you, but good things, I do the opposite with instead of it being 'my fault' or something i worked for, it's random. I hope this helps.

Yes, that is an important question to ask! Many people with ADHD get misdiagnosed with bipolar. With ADHD you lack the dopamine you need to find life interesting enough to live it? Well, that is just my interpretation. As mood stabilizers also block dopamine you might be feeling more stable, but also even less interested in the whole living thing than you were before... So, both is dangerous: Giving stimulants to someone bipolar because it might make them manic as well as giving mood stabilizers to someone with adhd, because everything in life just becomes too meh to be worth it.

Seriously, I could have written your post a few years ago (except for the addiction issues, but they are very common in people with adhd -and the risk of addiction is lessened if the person with adhd takes adhd medication!). I also got misdiagnosed with bipolar and now that I have got my adhd pi diagnosis - and medication - I can build a life that I want. Before, everything I ever tried would come to nothing, because I would just ruin it. It is going to be a long way still for me- but now I definitely know my problem is my brain chemistry. My brain is just constantly underwhelmed and wants to shut down/go all foggy- which makes for a boring and depressed life. The adhd meds let me feel some level of interest/curiosity/excitement. I still have to learn to do things I find interesting (to concentrate on something even if it is so hard and uncomfortable), but I have already seen more change in the last year with the new meds than ever before. Please always remember that everything can change tomorrow - dying is the only choice you can never take back.

Thanks, I am glad you took the sentiment as positive, as I had intended.  I am bipolar, so I have been in that same place, the low lows, and know the feeling.  I go up sometimes so I know the other side.  Luckily I also know the middle.  The best things I have found for my depression are omega three pills, turmeric pills, l-theanine the sauna, conserving sexual energy, walking in nature and LSD.  Also, typically for you to feel this way, you like I, likely have a lot of pain, unintegrated pain, emotional pain.  It eats away at the body mind and soul.  It all can get better.  I hear you on the depression and suicidal ideation.  I just know for me it comes and then goes.  I see it is the making of my own mind, and while I can not escape it, I can at least not give in to it, because life is funny and downs often eventually become ups.  So I try to ride it out.

I wish I'd never got a dog. I never wanted, in fact, but my SO insisted so much I caved in. She's so fearful, so afraid of everything, every little thing makes her jump, retreat, cower. Only way I have to take her for a walk is to wake up everyday at 5AM, when no one is outside, because later than that she'll try to run and hide from every person, car, noise, whatever. Only thing that attachs me to her is knowing very few people would have the patience to deal with her, and she would suffer tremendously (fuck, she is mixed and neutered, and I noticed many people want their dogs to give them good money with cute babies, so most people couldn't even care less since she wouldn't even give a financial return).

"This might be a strange one, sorry. I need some advice regarding increasingly worrying behavior my friend is showing

Some background: we‚Äôre both straight guys in our mid-30s, he‚Äôs a few years older than me. We‚Äôve been very close friends during childhood and our teenage years, then drifted apart in our 20s. We‚Äôve been in touch over the years, but really only reconnected in the last 12 months. I‚Äôve been back in the town for over a year due to COVID and remote work.

Here‚Äôs the thing, he‚Äôs been through some really rough¬†times in the last few years ‚Äì bad ongoing divorce (his wife‚Äôs decision), moved back with his parents, can‚Äôt find work due to health problems. Understandably, all of this took its toll. Anybody would be affected by all¬†this, however, there‚Äôs an aspect of this I find strange (and potentially worrying).

It‚Äôs hard for me to describe the change without getting into specifics, but when it comes to women/sex he basically devolved into some ""immature, sex crazed 15-year-old"" trope. This¬†type of behavior, cringeworthy enough when teenage boys engage in it, is *completely* out of place and bizarre when coming from a guy approaching his fortieth birthday. And this goes double for him. Back when we were teens he was always so serious and acted very mature for his age. He was never this ‚Äúimmature, sex crazed 15-year-old,‚Äù not even when he actually was fifteen. Like, imagine, when the rest of us were boasting about getting laid or whatever (when we were teens) he would be the one saying it‚Äôs disrespectful or inappropriate. He was *that* kid.

And now he‚Äôs the one bragging about getting oral sex, or wondering out loud if a girl he will see later is¬†shaved, or offering to send nudes/films of some random girls he was with. He‚Äôs constantly boasting of the number of girls he slept with in the last 12 months, etc. It‚Äôs definitely not a good look.

At first I let this stuff slide. I am aware that sounds very cowardly, but he was in such a bad place and went through so much I just thought he‚Äôs going through some strange, temporary¬†phase. I didn‚Äôt egg him on, but I didn‚Äôt think it was a right time for a lecture either.

However, now it has been months and he‚Äôs still at it. He's even in a relationship with some girl¬†now, but he still constantly brings up his past ‚Äúconquests‚Äù (like every single time we talk). I‚Äôve changed strategies and try to let it slide much less, sometimes I offer firm advice.

Like in the cases above, I might say: ‚Äúyou bring up this girl every time, way too much, maybe it‚Äôs time to move on man, let it go‚Äù or ‚Äúwho cares if she‚Äôs shaved, why do I need to know anyway,‚Äù or ‚ÄúNah, I‚Äôm good, by the way, I wouldn‚Äôt send that nude to anyone if I was you, you might even get into serious trouble.‚Äù

So far I‚Äôve been avoiding the ‚Äúit‚Äôs not appropriate‚Äù/‚Äúyou‚Äôre being sexist‚Äù/‚Äúthis is disgusting‚Äù route. I realize that this would be the most direct way, just let him know when he‚Äôs acting strange. However, I have a very strong feeling that all that will accomplish is push him away. Seems like this guy already lost touch with nearly everyone (who knows, maybe because of this type of behavior). I‚Äôm trying to be there for him, maybe we‚Äôre not super close now but we once were like brothers, and it sucks to see him like this.¬†

I‚Äôm also terrified that there is a small chance he will actually sexually assault someone in some way. He seems oblivious to social cues, observing him interact with women in public I can see he often has no clue when they are uninterested or even evasive. It's like he's acting the part of the womanizer but doesn't have the feel for it (because he never was one to begin with).

I don‚Äôt know what else to do, I would like to help him get over this, but don‚Äôt know how. I think that consistently and firmly calling him out¬†is the logical next step (intervention), but I worry that this will just result in us not speaking anymore. And all that will mean is that I can no longer help him, or even be there to offer advice if he tries something really stupid or dangerous."	throwawaymeawayaway	post	27.511892489379147	female	White	0.9981017708778381	na	na	na	16	MadOver30	ethnicity: no prediction, age: mid-30s, gender: male, explanation: the author openly identifies themselves as a straight male in their mid-30s. however, there are no specific details in the text to confidently determine the author's ethnicity.

And this is the ICD-10 definition for F33.1: [https://www.icd10data.com/ICD10CM/Codes/F01-F99/F30-F39/F33-/F33.1](https://www.icd10data.com/ICD10CM/Codes/F01-F99/F30-F39/F33-/F33.1) 

Take all the time you need to click each link (even if they may seem to be a ""trigger"" for you). At least they explain what your psychiatrist or psychologist BELIEVES is wrong with you.... (Remember, these codes are used for the doctors to get PAID by either Medicare, Medicaid or private insurance. you may NOT have all of these conditions -- but the more they put down, the more they get paid, probably....) Note that I am not a doctor, but I do have a (lapsed) certificate in Medical Coding and Billing from Queens College Continuing Education (from around 2008), so I know my way around a HCFA -1500 (billing claim form) better than most people (even though I got the certification when the ICD was still ICD 9)...."	the_cutest_void	reply	na	na	na	0.994814932346344	no	no	no	na	MadOver30	no prediction

"\[TW: Suicidal ideation, discussion of declining mental health, gender dysphoria\]

My mental health has just gone to shit over the last three weeks. My brain gets stuck on the feelings of hopelessness with my situation, and just wanting to stop existing.

I can no longer afford my private counsellor, as my hours at work are being reduced (for my mental health). I do not have any official diagnosis, though I have seen several mental health professionals. One thinks that it is probable that I have a milder case of BPD, since I keep falling into suicidal ideation spirals, and tend to ""split"" when it comes to whether work is going great or awful.

Another mental health professional thinks that I have a mild case of bipolar disorder, due to family history, and the pattern of how regularly I fall into suicidal ideation spirals.

When things get bad, it feels like time slows down. Like my arms and legs weigh a million pounds. I don't even do things to take my mind off it, like reading or playing games. I just don't have the attention any more.

And all I can think of is how much better it would be if I never existed at all.

I can't deny a part of it is that I accepted that I am trans (mtf) in February. I've always been trans, but I was in denial since I was at least 14. I've already started losing job opportunities, friends and mentors over this. The hurt over a lifetime of being called f\*g.... and you realize you've never been a person to conservatives.

I want to die. Nonexistence would be less painful than this.

I'm on the verge of losing my job due to a leadership change. I've never been good with money, and am paying off my ex's debts. If I'm out of work, I am guaranteed to be homeless.

"Hi guys :)

My analysis on a Brian Wilson song and how The Beach Boys helped me.

What are your thoughts on this song, (Busy Doin' Nothin') mainly the lyrics and looking at Brian holistically?

To me, I'm not sure if he is aware he's doing it. But I think he's describing a day in the life of someone with mental health issues, particularly ADHD.

The way I see it (and this may be a ""me thing"") in BDN he is consciously writing lyrics such as: To paraphrase, sorting your head out, being ""busy"" but not achieving anything, having lots of ideas and plans in the morning and writing them down, losing important things.

Also I believe he is giving a bit of advice to call someone you love to socialise (as well as giving instructions to find his house)

But most beautifully (and he's admitted to doing this when talking about the song Love and Mercy, I think he does it in a lot of his songs) he's loving you musically. He's letting you know ""he's got you covered"". He's letting us know we're not alone with these issues and we can be happy (like the song is) by doing some of the things in the song:

Meditating (0:10), being productive (0:23), *random observation - 0:39 is just what I want to hear when being given a time to be somewhere (I also think the lyrics in this section are the words of the letter Brian writes but never sends, more on that later), (1:20) - writing down ideas/plans/to-do lists, (1:35) - ruminating over isolation but taking positive actions.

(1:45) the delivery of this line is very interesting and leads me to my conclusion.

""I THINK I'll make a call"". He sounds so confident and happy in the rest of the song but this line is delivered with reluctance.

He apparently attempts to call after the quest of looking for the number on a piece of paper, then searching his pocketbook, then meditating over the number, calling unsuccessfully and deciding to write a letter instead, finding paper, sharpening a pencil and writing a letter that probably doesn't get sent. 

He's busy, but ultimately achieves very little other than remember a phone number (which he will probably forget again as we aren't told if he writes it down) and sharpen a pencil.

The ""Friends"" album that this track is from is soo beautiful and uplifting to me.
I think the overall theme of it is self reflection, connecting with nature, starting a family, spirituality - Great for mental health.
Find a quiet peaceful place to enjoy this album.


Looking at Brian holistically:

I've noticed the RSD lyrics in Brian's songs too (I'll add some later maybe)

Murry (Brian's father) had mental health issues apparently and spent long periods like Brian (and I) in bed, withdrawing and overeating - It's another mental health condition: Self Neglect.

I had a partner who was an angel but achieved similar results to Eugene Landy (manipulative psychotherapist) with me - best shape of my life, promotion after promotion - living the dream!

After the relationship ended I've had my own ""bedroom years"". Brian's music has helped me so much in the last 3 months - His motivational songs especially: HCGHPOBTM 
Too much sugar 
Little children

I've started playing the guitar again and that's a great source of joy.

This Beach Boys journey began when I watched a 15 minute interview with him from 1976 in his bedroom - I saw a lot of myself in the way he spoke and his mannerisms. 
https://youtu.be/A9AenU9iWEs

I then watched Beautiful Dreamer and recognised my own behaviour in his reclusiveness after having his heart broken with Smile. I then went head first into the music and everything I could get (Like I usually do with stuff and apparently very common in ADHD)

Stores urging you to spend money. Need to use a restroom in a cafe? Must buy something first. Libraries may have reduced service due to COVID. 

We tell OP that it won‚Äôt always be like this, but maybe they‚Äôre dealing with long term unemployment and/or disability and/or chronic health issues that mean there really is not an end in sight. 

I remember being just out of college, no job, friends busy with their own lives, family pressuring me to get hired and go back to school at the same time. Of course I was sick of my own shit. It was pure luck that found a foothold to get out of that spot and nobody can reasonably expect to be able to just maintain existence while waiting on a lucky break.

Maybe The Gift of Fear by Gavin de Becker. I started reading it, and i haven't had my apartment invaded, but it brought back a lot of memories of when my car was flipped upside down. I sensed at the time it was these guys who had teased me a few years previously and had whistled at me at a gas station earlier that day. Of course i didn't tell the police that.

So after years of work at 43 I am graduating my nurse practitioner program today. I passed all my finals (with flying colors), and yesterday I completed the last of my clinical hours. It‚Äôs been really hard with working full time as an RN, Covid crap, dealing with my mother‚Äôs dementia and my own depression and horrible social anxiety every day of clinical rotations. But as I drove home from my last clinical day I felt no sense of triumph  or satisfaction. In the small window of time before I had to get home, I considered stopping somewhere to eat a lone, celebratory meal. Maybe even one glass of wine. But even the thought of it exhausted me. I got home and dealt with my mother‚Äôs dementia melt-downs and criticisms of me (she‚Äôs staying with me currently so I can give my dad a break), I and felt nothing but panic and dread. Which is normal for me. My lone moments of satisfaction unfortunately take place in getting lost in and binging on detective mini series from Acorn TV. I joke that all my best friends are television actors. By the time I slept it was a strange sleep, full of vivid dreams. At 3 am my mother woke me up to tell me I am evil and killing everybody with the Covid vaccine (I don‚Äôt even give vaccines in my work, but whatever). I thought I would have trouble falling back asleep, but I asked my mind to please release me back again into the relatively peaceful world of sleep, and miraculously it worked. I have some kind of lame graduation ceremony on Zoom this morning and then off to work. I hear my mom fighting with the caregiver in the kitchen calling the breakfast shit. I am not really sure what‚Äôs wrong with yogurt, oatmeal and fresh fruit. But whatever. My rare moments of peace and pleasure take place in the tiny crevices between my daily real life obligations. The feel of my soft bed, my dog next to me, letting go and entering some fantasy world where I am not really here. This was long. I apologize for being long-winded and whiney.

"Hi there. Have you sought treatment for your social anxiety? Finding a medication that works has honestly changed my life. There's no value in suffering needlessly.

If medication isn't a path you wish to go down, fair enough. CBT is helpful for some (though it didn't work for me), as is counselling

It's hard for me to feel sympathy for someone who had someone in the family die whether from COVID or a cop's bullet when they use the situation and become millionaires from Go Fund Me. I lost my mother to heart disease when I was 3 ending any semblance of a normal family life. I lost my father 30 years ago to the same cause. I never saw a dime... not even my inheritance. We live in a different world today from when I was a child. I have so many unanswered questions about my heritage. I have always felt disconnected... unloved. Perhaps it was bc I didn't get the nurturing I needed as a child. I got ridicule instead. I was a pawn for grown ups games. The saddest part is knowing there are a lot of people like me. Some people simply shouldn't be allowed children.		post	29.10378864216624	male	White	0.9960665106773376	na	na	na	14	MadOver30	no prediction.
"I don't want to sound unsympathetic, because your emotions are understandable, and valid. 

I totally get where you are coming from, not because my parents died, but our relationship was so strained that I grew up without any sort of family ties that I saw my friends having.  I never knew anything about my extended family, heritage, or culture.  It was very confusing, and it led to me feeling unlovable, ungrounded, and completely disconnected.  The whole thing was insanely bad for my mental health.  

All of which to say, I think I understand how you feel, and I'm sorry for what happened to you. 

However, your reaction to other people's relationships with their own tragedies and any money involved sounds like a trauma response to me.  At its crux, what you are feeling is 'bad things happened to me so why don't they happen to everyone.' I'm saying this without any judgement - again - it's very understandable why you would feel this way, and it's not a wrong, or bad emotion.  I just think your pain has skewed your perspective on other people's situations.

"OP I don't like have any statistics in front of me or anything but I think it's safe to say that if anyone has used GoFundMe to become millionaires after losing family to covid, police violence, or any other sudden and tragic cause, they are almost certainly the rare exception to the rule, because the overwhelming majority of people are struggling so goddamn hard right now just to keep their heads above water, to keep the heat and electricity on, and to keep food on their table‚Äîat least here in the United States‚Äîand there's no end in sight because the only thing our elected officials are ever willing to offer us is endless political theater punctuated with the occasional token effort at relief, which is inevitably never even remotely enough and yet still means tested to death

sure maybe a relatively tiny handful of people have been able to cash in on their tragedies, but by and large everyone is just barely scraping by even before being hit with some kind of unexpected, occasionally violent, and almost always entirely-preventable death in their family‚Äîand as such they're generally grateful for anything they can get

the honest to god truth is that none of us deserve this shit‚Äîthey shouldn't have to deal with these tragedies, and you shouldn't have to either

we all deserve so much better than we're getting, and so I think it's just really hard to judge anyone for any success they've managed to have crowdfunding‚Äîthe odds are that almost nobody is successful to any significant degree, and the few that are probably never raise enough to cover everything they need it to

we just don't have the privilege of knowing what other people are going through, just like they don't know what we're going through, and so I genuinely believe that the best we can do in such unimaginably shitty circumstances like these in which we now find ourselves is to just acknowledge and accept that you, me and every other working-poor, marginalized and disabled person out there deserves to have everything we need‚Äîand then, of course, to proceed from there on to the process of somehow figuring out how the fuck we're going to effectively and efficiently organize ourselves in such a way that we can demand it and force them to give it to us

tl;dr: anybody who gets rich by crowdfunding off of a personal tragedy is by far almost certainly the exception, because the vast, *vast* majority of people turning to these kinds of solutions are just as desperate as you and I are‚Äîthey're not the enemy, and focusing our attention on the rare few who are fortunate enough to find some kind of windfall from the kindness of internet strangers doesn't do much of anything except maintain the exact kind of ""fighting over scraps and crumbs"" status quo that distracts us from the people in power who we so desperately need to organize against because of how they've explicitly and deliberately chosen to perpetuate the crushing austerity that keeps us in these miserable conditions indefinitely"		reply	na	na	na	0.9960665106773376	no	no	no	na	MadOver30	no prediction.

Too many people are hurting financially. The government has been pathetic in it's response. I sent a letter to the Secretary of HUD pleading that they change policies to make programs equitable.

"I don't know what meds you've tried, but the MAOI phenelzine has been great for my social phobia and depression. It's changed my life. 

SSRIs and the like, in my experience all they do is numb your emotions. That can end up being depressing in itself.

So I'd say don't give up on medication because of a few underwhelming experiences. For sure there's something out there that would work better for you. I know it's a draining process trying different stuff, but try not to lose hope. And don't make do with partial improvements.

"Do you believe in destiny? That fate has preordained your life? I have to wonder bc everything I do to get ahead fails. Having ASD hasn't helped. I see others with disabilities that are better off than I and wonder, what am I doing wrong. I don't want to be wealthy, but I don't want to continue living like a pauper either.

I was born into a middle income family. My father invested in stock to provide for me after he was gone. Destiny... and a crooked stepmother... intervened to see that didn't happen. I worked 2 years out of 62 and was declared ineligible for survivor's benefits. I went into the military, but couldn't hack it... no surprise there, but I was declared prior existing condition and ruled ineligible for V.A. compensation. I have struggled all my life. Battled a system deadset on butting heads with me. No one in my corner. Constantly falling through the cracks. People who are supposed to look out for me tell me the system has nothing to offer me. BC I am high functioning, they overlook my ASD and expect more than I am able to provide. I can't outgrow it. I can't wave a magic wand and ""be normal"".

It frustrates me to no end. My health is going. No one seems to care, so I don't. I've had SI since adolescence and made several attempts. I've perfected my method so the next one will be the last. I've been alone for decades. No family, no relatives, just me alone. I fell in love with my high school sweetheart, but destiny intervened again and she disappeared. Destiny's determined I shouldn't be happy. Yes, I'm a strong person, but an empty shell with no more dreams. I don't have a bucket list bc I know I couldn't afford to make anything happen. Last year, I lost part of a foot. The GFM went nowhere. I've lost most of my teeth due to an extremely rare condition. The GFM went nowhere. With destiny constantly on my ass, I have to ask what keeps me going? I lost any hope that ""tomorrow"" will be any better. My life is basically eat and sleep.

"We've all seen them. The clips of someone ranting about Blacks, foreigners, Muslims, even having to wear a mask bc "" My Rights!"". Where does all this hate come from? Didn't their parents teach them better? Well, I have to admit my stepmother was quite racist. That's not an easy thing to overcome. Hell, I still hear her voice saying ""Finish your plate. There are starving children in Africa"". Wait a second. Back up the truck. You hate Blacks, but you're concerned about starving children in Africa? 

Is it any wonder I grew up confused. I remember watching the news when a report of the National Guard shooting at Kent State. My stepmother said ""long haired hippies got what they deserve"". I was appalled and shocked. (I still am). What does their hair have to do with anything? In case you didn't notice, my hair is down to my waist. Is that what you think of me? I know my stepmother never wanted me. I was simply part of a package deal, but that woman was evil.

In retrospect, I see where all that hate comes from. I wonder how many other kids grew up in that kind of toxic environment and struggle to put it to bed. What amazes me is how, in spite of a toxic childhood, I grew up to be so compassionate. I hold no ill will against religion (just don't try to convert me). I would gladly march with my Black friends for equal rights. Hell, I've been fighting for fiscal equality for years.

The answer to Mexico was never build a wall, but rather go down and help them develop their economy. Didn't the government ever hear ""you get more flys with honey""? The Chinese certainly did.

"I'm depressed and anxious. I procrastinate a LOT.

I have to force myself to do the things i enjoy doing. usually with mild success, sometimes with no success at all.

pretty often, i end up with some kind of brainfog where i seemingly shut down to the point where i don't understand i'm procrastinating. like yesterday, i went to work, went grocery shopping after work, came home and then just plopped down on my bed and browsed reddit. i didn't unpack the groceries and i didn't do the small list of household chores i do on the evenings.

23:00 rolls around and i've been spending my entire evening in a brainfog of procrastination just mindlessly browsing the internet. i had wanted to watch a movie but it never happened so i went to bed pissed off that i wasted my friday evening. (if you're wondering why i haven't included other people in my post it's because i'm an introvert and want to be alone on the weekends usually).

i don't understand how to get myself to push thru this brainfog of procrastination. it's debilitating to the point of immobilizing me physically, and my mind is, surprise, a foggy soup where i'm trying to understand what the hell is happening. i didn't even touch alcohol or weed last night because my mind is so foggy i even forget about drugs like wtf?? i WANTED to get high but didn't."	the_cutest_void	post	22.275481183806765	female	White	0.9990038275718689	na	na	na	24	MadOver30	no prediction.
"Hi there. Are you taking medication for your depression or anxiety?

I ask because depression meds can cause brain fog and exacerbate the tendency to procrastinate.

I'm kind of like you. I plan to do stuff, then get engrossed in looking at Reddit or Instagram or anything else on my phone, and then I realise a few hours have passed and I no longer have time to do what I'd planned.

I've always been prone to procrastination. I've found that taking medication has made this tendency worse. Yes, overall I feel better in myself, less anxious, less depressed, but it's an uphill battle to get things done. What little self-discipline I had has gone out the window.

I think losing yourself in internet browsing or whatever else can be an escape of sorts, a comforting thing to do that makes real-life, with its problems and complications, recede into the background. But when you eventually return to reality, you can be left feeling shit about the time you've spent doing nothing.

I'm still struggling with this myself, so I'm afraid I can't offer much in the way of constructive advice. But hopefully it might help to know you're not alone in this. Good luck :)"	the_cutest_void	reply	na	na	na	0.9990038275718689	weak	strong	strong	na	MadOver30	no prediction.
"There are at least 4 reasons for procrastination.

1) Lack knowledge, skills, strategies, and/or tactics (this triggers doubt, fear, uncertainty, lack of confidence... and so we go into protective mode and procrastinate).
 
2) ‚ÄúMy vision and goal is currently bigger than my self-esteem, self-worth, self-image‚Äù (so we avoid taking ‚Äúinspired action‚Äù).
 
3) LIMITING BELIEFS: I'm too young/old, I need this other thing to be in place FIRST before I do that, etc.
 
4) FEARS: Conscious and unconscious fear. What if I fail, lose time/money, disappoint self, friends, family, investors.

(Could be both fear of failure or perhaps fear of success with subsequent failure?)

"I do this all the time. I know why it is though, it's because I'm afraid to be alone with my thoughts.

Once I step away from it, the anxiety/panic/intrusive thoughts come crashing back in full force and I get upset and feel distressed.

"Hey, this used to happen to me as well. All my life. I never knew why. It used to drive me crazy. I was always depressed, anxious and upset, had super bad brainfog and was a chronic procrastinator. Flash forward to last fall - I enter therapy for the first time ever and my therapist raises the possibility that I am on the autism spectrum with a massive sensitivity to overstimulation due to sound and sight. I start wearing earplugs and being a lot more careful about when and how I do things in potentially chaotic environments (for example going to the grocery store at night rather than during the day).... and boom! Procrastination/brainfog evaporate like magic. Turns out all the brainfog had been created by my brain getting exhausted from writing really really really massive audio/visual files all the time. There had been no energy left over for anything else.

I now have a clinical diagnosis for autism and have restructured my life around avoiding noise/visual chaos of all kinds. I am way more effective at my job and my depression/anxiety are just... gone. I still have a bad day now and then after overextending myself but that is just what it is: a bad day. In the singular. No longer a continuous malaise.

I have no idea if any of this applies to you but maybe it will help. If anything I have said resonates, you could google ""late diagnosis autism traits/symptoms"" or visit r/autism, r/aspergers for more info. Either way, good luck!

"It sucks to be human. 

Our lives span decades. Yet, hopes, dreams and possibilities are vanquished somewhere by the end of one's 3rd decade (i.e. late 20s). Then everything goes downhill. More burden, less joy. More responsibilities, few rewards. And somehow, one has to endure this deterioration for like 4 decades. 

Yes, I'm aware that there is scope for change, for improvement, for hope, and that some people do manage to turn their lives around in their 30s or even later. 

We say that. But I think for as many folks who were just late bloomers and managed to swim back to the surface for air, as many of us if not more, just struggle and struggle and struggle until we sink. 

I also subscribe to the suicidewatch group and most of them are young folks. Those are young people who want someone to tell them it's all gonna end up ok, that in a decade you will look back at this and just cringe.

And often my mind says, I was one of you nearly 20 years ago and it only got worse and worse. And I‚Äôm afraid that it will continue to get worse. 

I know I will always be alone. I know I will always struggle with money. I know I‚Äôve tried my best. I‚Äôm just waiting for everything to end - a long wait that might go on for decades.

It does make sense. I absolutely understand feeling ‚Äúbehind,‚Äù from living with adhd, depression, and a chronic incurable illness that causes lots of physical pain. You need to prioritize yourself, your happiness and health. Are you able to take a medical leave of absence from work, and possibly do outpatient intensive therapy? Are you still in contact with your previous therapist? Maybe you can do therapy via zoom and that will help work it into your schedule. Honestly I think it‚Äôs the best (if not only) way to help you get your life together, and give you the tools to keep it that way.

"Hey, I haven't personally been assessed by a neuropsychologist but a client of mine has. They were assessing her IQ and her adaptive functioning.  It took about 2 hours so it sounds like yours may include more tests. So, I would expect a lot of questions! Be honest with the psychologist and with your answers. Stop for a break if you need to. Try not to worry about the psychologist judging you, she is there to identify any issues and help you to get the support that you need.  Ask if you can have a support person there if that will make you feel more comfortable.
Take a fidget toy or a weighted animal or other sensory items if they help you feel calmer.

"Just another rant post. 

Sometimes I feel that I‚Äôm less worthy of help because I‚Äôm no longer a young person.

I had an appointment with my psychiatrist today. Whilst I was waiting for my turn, one child and 2 teenagers also entered the waiting room. 

Leaving aside the issue of the rather irresponsible scheduling of my shrink. I was kept waiting for over 30 minutes (which was expected) and then it was my  turn. 

The shrink didn‚Äôt even pretend to engage in conversation today. I was in and out in less than 4 minutes. Basically I was just there to confirm I didn‚Äôt suffer from side effects from the meds and to be given the same prescription. 

I should at this juncture point out this is a shrink in private practice who is paid handsomely. This consultation (including the meds, being sleeping meds and Valium) costs about USD400. 

I doubt the younger patients who were there with their parents would be allotted such a short appointment. The only inference I can draw is that I was squeezed in (despite the appointment being booked a month ago) between other appointments on the assumption that I could be dealt with very quickly. 

And I somehow feel that it is my shrink‚Äôs opinion that nothing much can be done about me, and that time should not be spent on me even though I‚Äôm also a paying a customer like everyone else.

"it's actually not uncommon for psychiatrists to overbook patients for financial reasons (read: greed, milking insurance companies, etc.), regardless of age, and many of them squeeze as many patients as they can into 15-minute increments so they can get people in and out as quickly as possible for maximum profits.

there's merit to the comment that an appointment for medication management shouldn't take that long, but it's also not uncommon for psychiatrists to shunt a person out before they're able to air out their issues with a medication, because if they're stuck having to listen to our grievances, they'll go over the time they've allotted for everyone and make less money.

given that you state you didn't have issues with the medication, i'm assuming the shrink saw this as a green light to not dwell on anything and get you out as soon as possible, which is something i reckon they do to all of their patients who are on the 'management' level.

all this said, this is a product of the medical industry and i highly doubt it's anything personal to you, tbh. i hope that doesn't sound invalidating; i've experienced the same since i was a teen. it's a conveyor belt treatment system all around for medical issues."	stranger38	reply	na	na	na	0.9994878768920898	no	strong	no	na	MadOver30	failed

I‚Äôm turning to this sub because there is no one in my life I can talk to. I feel really alone. I used to and still do rely on my mom but she‚Äôs not doing too great herself these days. I guess I just want someone to understand or someone saying that they experience this too.

"The mental health epidemic in this world is really something.

Know that you (and the world) are much more resilient to mistakes than what you might feel right now. I realized that by looking at surgeon handling the body during surgery.

"I was also diagnosed with ADHD when I was about 31 and it changed my life (for the better). Previously, I struggled with anxiety and depression, because I didn't have an explanation for why the things I find so difficult seem to come to others effortlessly. If you can, I recommend the book [You Mean I'm Not Lazy, Stupid, or Crazy?](https://www.chapters.indigo.ca/en-ca/books/you-mean-im-not-lazy/9780743264488-item.html?s_campaign=goo-DSA_Books&gclid=Cj0KCQjw0oCDBhCPARIsAII3C_FucnV6GYR_6L3kzTv95s-YlqywSpdGSmWfs1aDzWUR9SCTOPZd7EYaAkhgEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds) which is a really accessible guide to living with adult ADHD. The subreddit r/adhdwomen is also a really great resource.

I had really good luck with EMDR to help treat my anxiety, but a lot of it has dissipated since being diagnosed. I was anxious because I couldn't trust my brain not to fuck up, and I had so much lived experience of forgetting something important or losing something I needed or making impossible promises... once I started treating the ADHD and addressing some of those negative experiences, I found I was able to better handle the panic and stress of every day life.

I used to torture myself, chewing endlessly over what might happen, might go wrong, and also over past events, how I'd done or said the wrong thing, what people must think of me and so on.

Treat the anxiety and it's likely your perspective will change, for the better.

There's talk therapy and counselling, but it takes persistence and patience before you see results. And it doesn't suit everyone.

And there's medication. Getting on the right one can be life-changing. It has been for me, after years spent trying the many kinds. I eventually responded well to an old, not often used antidepressant. My anxiety is pretty much non-existent these days. Not much gets to me.

"Yay! I was much like you with my general anxiety disorder. Just about everything would send me into a tailspin. One of the things I remember is that the more I tried to ignore or push it away, the harder it came at me. My therapist at the time said to let these scenarios play out fully, then tell myself they weren't reality but then find the solution as to how I would handle it. It actually helped me because I then understood that things *could* go really wrong, but if they did I knew I could and would handle it. It defused the fear behind the worry.   


Another thing to try is to go and do more new things. Do some of the things causing you worry. Afraid of talking on the phone? Make more over-the-phone orders or call friends. Afraid of heights? Find a stool to stand on, then a chair, then a ladder, etc. Between the new experiences and overcoming existing fears, you will become much more confident and stronger as a person. Get out there and do scary things. Carefully, of course. 

&#x200B;

Also journaling is a very real thing. If it weren't for my journaling I wouldn't be able to keep everything straight and I wouldn't have a place to vent my deepest thoughts and fears that I'm most ashamed of. It acts as a friend/therapist when I don't have someone to talk to(or don't want to burden others). And lastly definitely be open and honest with the mental health doc when you go to see them. They will give you the tools you need, whether that be medication or coping habits.

"Anxiety can be a coping mechanism for the undiagnosed ADHD brain- I think it's definitely more common for women than men, because societally there is greater pressure on women to ""have it all together"" and women tend to internalize blame. But even then, it's not a universal strategy.

One thought that helps me is to remember that my brain is trying to help in the only way it has learned how. You've spent your whole life using anxiety to help compensate for ""brain leaks"" and it has gotten you this far, so it's going to be a hard habit to break. When I recognize my thoughts starting to spiral, I try to address them with something like: ""thank you for letting me know you're concerned. You don't want me to feel embarrassed or be ashamed. Instead of thinking about it over and over, now I'm going to make a list and we'll handle it."" ... Acknowledge the worry/concern, recognize why the anxiety has taken control, then try to plan another way out of the situation. I'm not perfect at it, and definitely still sometimes find myself wrapped in panic instead of calm self-appreciation and active problem-solving. I used to try to fight my brain and that just landed us in deep self-doubt and emotional turmoil and that kind of looping, repeating thoughts that you're describing.

&#x200B;

>I still don't see the point of the therapy (maybe it is too early I don't know) 

You need to choose your therapy carefully. I am so angry therapists don't talk about that. Different therapies for different problems. The ""mainstream"" therapy (analytical therapy) has a special purpose: you talk about your issues and the therapist helps you find the root of the issue and validate your struggles. It can take time, especially if the source is deeply hidden or you're confused, so you don't know how to talk about your problems. But if you:

1) are incomfortable with talking or struggle to express your emotions verbally 

and/or 

2) already got to the root of the issue and now need to heal from it

analytical therapy will do nothing for you. If you have PTSD or addictions, the best therapies are hypnosis or EMDR (= communicating with the subconscious by changing brainwaves). If you have behavioral issues or cannot control your emotions, DBT or CBT is best. If you're not good at talking, then art therapy, musicotherapy or equinotherapy are great. Meditation should be men-da-to-ry. If you're not meditating regularily, you're wasting your time (btw if you cannot stand still, mediation can be achieved by exercising, that's what they do in most marital arts, yoga and some dance styles). You also need to let your guard down. be honest with yourself and your therapist. Pride or people-pleasing behaviors pushed me closer to suicide than anything else. I healed faster when I surrendered.

>still don't see a reason to be alive.

Well, it is a question of reframing. We can only be desperate if we loose hope. We can only be dissapointed if we had unhealthy expectations. Modern society makes us depressed because it tells us that a lot of futile things are the epitome of happiness and make us forget all the great things that we already have. Some people on this Earth are happy alone; living without technology; with minimum food; not so great shelter; not so great job; disabled. Hell, monks are happy with nothing but a cloth on them; they don't even have their own room or their own food (dependaing on the religion). I *assure* you that you can ""stop and smell the roses"" and let it fuel your happiness. I'm sorry our society makes us thing this is dumb.

""Stoicism"" can really help for that. ""Mindefullness"" and ""radical acceptence"" too.

&#x200B;

>What's the point to study 

Ideally for self growth. In this current society? To get a job you appreciate so you'll appreciate your day, hopefully something that helps society so you feel good about yourself, to have enough money to carther to your need of food, water, shelter, partnership, healthcare and hobbies and art. So to find a point to studying, you need to care about what you study and to care about your own life being good. So overall, it boils down to self esteem.

>To literally wash my ass 

It's self care. You do self care if you care about yourself. If you love yourself a little. You can search for the source of that with your therapist and start healing (usually the source is the parents).

&#x200B;

>I have had my ups and downs all my life and now it feels like there is no surviving this 

Of course you can survive this, unless you got dangerous psychosis and go do dangerous things (like I do). Now the question is: do you want to? Again, self esteem + purpose. BTW your purpose could only be to live. Or to achieve that one thing. Either way, you have to choose, and commit, so you don't get dissapointed.

If you always had ups and down then you may need to accept that it will always be the case. Again, reframe how you think about your life. For me, having ups and down became barable once I could somewhat manage them and I discovered that purpose I wanted so much. Yeah the depressive episodes are real bad, but my finish line is more important. Battling the end boss is less scary once I did it 10+ times and I have better gear.

You can build tools with your therapist to manage the down moments. To survive until the wave go away. TBH even if I still have a hard time recognising when I will have a down moment, when they do come I am so detached, like ""ho, here you come again. okay"". I know the ups will be there. *I got there before*. I *assure* you that you CAN stop giving a fuck about pretty much *everything* and still feel joy and motivation to do things. In fact my fuel is my new ""fuck it"" attitude. And I didn't got it because I reached ""enlightement""; but because, really, my suicidal thoughts became so bad I was left with zero fucks; better do the thing since my only other option is the void. I surrendered.

">So, the pain doesn't stop you from becoming sexually aroused? I just assumed it would do that. I imagined I'd lose interest in having sex if it hurt that much.

It's not as simple as that. Imagine that it was painful to swallow, you would still get hungry but you know that to eat would bring you unimaginable pain so you just don't and you feel hungrier. I love my partner, I find her insanely attractive and sex is a huge part of how I connect and how I show and feel affection; I want to have sex with her and I want to make her feel good but I also know that to do so brings me levels of pain that I can barely begin to describe and so I don't even try and I just crave it more.

I'm not sure how to get across how bad the pain is but it's really not a case of me just not enjoying it in a sexual way it's a case of me being in so much pain that I am unable to think of anything else.

And just to be clear it's usually painful anyway but sex just makes it even worse. The psychological pain of being unable to share any physical intimacy with my partner or even to enjoy my sexuality on my own is just the straw that's breaking the camel's back.

Therapy has helped me to be able to identify emotions and triggers so that I can better deal with them. It took a while for me to find someone who was a good fit and it also took a while to get to know this person and trust them before it started noticing changes.

"**Time anxiety**

Time anxiety is the feeling that you have not done enough to meet your goals or that you're not using the time you do have effectively.

Time anxiety is more than feeling overwhelmed at times - it haunts your days and causes you to procrastinate on essential tasks.

**Three types of time anxiety:**

* **Daily time anxiety:** It is the feeling of not having enough time in your day.
* **Future time anxiety:** You feel paralyzed thinking through every *'what if?*' that may or may not happen.
* **Existential time anxiety**: The feeling of only having a limited time to live your life.

**Overcoming time anxiety**

*Overcoming time anxiety boils down to awareness, understanding, and action.*

Being aware of what you spend your time on can lessen your anxiety. But too much observation over every aspect of your life can add to your time anxiety. **It's about finding a balance between awareness and action.**

**Acknowledge your relationship with time**

* *Time exists.*
* *You can't stop the clock from moving or slow it down.*
* *You only have control over what you do in the future.*

Time anxiety increases when we try to ignore or manipulate the ways time impacts our day. Acknowledging these truths can reduce anxiety and help you move forward.

**Understand the planning fallacy**

We often think 8 hours of work time means we can schedule all 8 hours. However, **most people have at best 2.5 hours of real productive time a day.**

*At work, most people spend:*

* *15% of their time in meetings,*
* *25-30% on email, chat, and video calls, and*
* *40% multitasking and working sub-optimally.*

This breakdown can help you understand the limitations you have to work within. **The goal is to be realistic about what you can do with the time you do have.**

**Make space for the things that matter**

To feel motivated, you first need to act, then motivation will follow.

Look at your time well-spent activities and fit them into your day. In other words, **think about how and when your most meaningful tasks will fit into a real day.** Understanding how to use your limited supply of time on what truly matters will help you cut out time-wasters that add to your time anxiety.

**Practice being a ‚ÄòSatisficer‚Äô instead of a ‚ÄòMaximiser‚Äô**

* **Maximizers** try to make a choice that will give the maximum benefit later on.
* **Satisficers** make choices according to their set of current criteria. Nothing more.

Trying to maximize every day will lead to more time anxiety. Instead, use your time well-spent activities and **decide on what fits your time best** ***now***\*\*.

Kindness. Kindness does not mean you are weak. Kindness, generosity and compassion are characteristics we need more of, particularly during e crisis like this pandemic. Greediness, insensitivity and taking advantage of others are what we don't need. A friend of mine and I were talking about the Chinese form of government as compared to ours. The only thing I like about it is they get things done, but they lack compassion...but so do we. If you have a kind heart, the shame is not yours... it belongs to the person who takes advantage of it.

"Hi,

I hope this is OK to post. It's nice to find an age relevant community. I'm 37/F. Just. birthday was Tuesday. I have depression and last year got screened for ADHD (will I ever get results? Who knows? The NHS is pretty busy rn). I'm a big loser, aha. 

It's so hard to DO anything. I have a job, which I hate, which makes me feel inadequate. Just yesterday I was in a group meeting with this pretty, young, lively alpha girl from another office and she just made me feel so bad. So bad. I'm nothing like her. I can't find any other jobs. I have no experience except boring admin and a useless MA in history. I can't drive - I'm not well enough - so I can't travel far. I'm very easily exhausted so commuting to London is a no-no, really. So I know I'll never be successful.

My mother was a bit stifling and also brought me up reading and playing make believe instead of socialising and learning how to get on with people so I'm just let down by a boring life I don't understand how to make my way in, for which I have no aptitude or ambition. As that meme says, ""There's no magical adventure coming, you silly girl"". 

I am a former Forever Alone woman, my friends set me up with someone when I was 25 who graciously tolerates me even now - he's far too good a person for me, in truth. We're not like...mega well suited but we're best friends and it's good. I just constantly still feel like the ugly nerd girl who's nobody's choice, who's not liked, who's always overlooked. I don't have anything to say and i wouldn't know how to say it even if I did.

I have had therapy but it didn't help at all. It felt too...patronising, too basic, too - generic? It didn't help. I guess it was nice to vent but I got no useful way of moving forward from it. 

It's weird being this old and not going anywhere. It's sad. I regret a lot. I look back with sadness at my life.

"World: ‚ÄúHello Lonely Canary. Nice to hear from you.‚Äù

Hi.  Nice to meet you.  32M here.  Depression is my main issue too, but I‚Äôd like to be screened for adult adhd also. 

I think our depression is the only thing masking the wonders of the world. Maybe you could have been socialized more, sure ‚Äî but I think your upbringing could be a good thing.  Don‚Äôt we need people to be dreamers?  I think perhaps you have a super ability masked by your depression - the ability to see a more interesting world than the one in front of you.  Without Depression, that quality would be unfettered and left to work in you to possibly manifest (at least parts of) that more interest world which you crave.  I think it‚Äôs important to acknowledge that it is our common struggle with this very real illness that keeps us back.  We shouldn‚Äôt blame ourselves.  You seem like a fantastic, wonderful person to me. You‚Äôre Clearly observant with very good communication skills and no obnoxious ego complex.  You‚Äôre probably beautiful to boot. Which brings me to your relationship!  That‚Äôs not nothing!! Relationships are hard, especially for people like us.  Being in one for 7 years (and going strong from the sound of it) should be an automatic pat on the back to you and he.  

To me, it sounds like you‚Äôre only waiting for the humdrum of a normal life to stop holding you back.  Well, it isn‚Äôt life.  Life isn‚Äôt and doesn‚Äôt have to be humdrum.  I say these words as much to inspire myself to get up and do something creative with my time today.  I‚Äôve spent half the day just lying in bed watching Jon Oliver reruns, when I have a dozen things I know would fulfill me more if I just did them.  

So thank you for your brave introduction. Hearing your story and trying to reach back out to you is what has created synergy in my day today.  

In conclusion, I think you are blaming reality for the lens through which you‚Äôve been looking at it.  Pesky depression.  Even if there‚Äôs no magic pill, and even if that cursed lens is all we will be able to see through for a while, we have to steer clear of pitfalls that tell us that our depressed reality is the only reality. Even if things don‚Äôt become more interesting, and you‚Äôre never able to look beyond it,  I‚Äôm proud of you.  You should be too."

"So I've been seeing this therapist for awhile and recently she said I need to find a passion for something to help me with my depression and anxiety. Through out my life the people who know me could describe me with quite a few words but passionate isn't one of them. I'm not sure if I was born without that gene or what it is. There are things I like or enjoy, like reading and movies, but I wouldn't say I'm passionate about them. 

Has anyone else been like this and found a way to turn on the passion feature in your brain or was my model built without it? I don't have the finical means to classes or courses and my agoraphobia makes it difficult to leave my bedroom for any meaningful amount of time.

"Is there anything you've been interested in trying/learning more about? Woodworking, sewing, aerial yoga, butterfly hunting, beekeeping...? (Throwing out totally random suggestions here). Youtube tutorials are free and sometimes very helpful and informative.  I got into collage/art journaling a couple years ago, and found that watching other people create and share their skills helped fuel my desire to create more and make more art.

Also, if you have a library card, the Libby app is free, and you can check out books/audiobooks on your phone, so I've been listening to audiobooks recently.

I'm 33 and only recently got into making art. Before that, I had zero hobbies or passions other than smoking weed. I wouldn't even say I'm passionate about making art...I think as long as you find something you enjoy doing, that's good enough...no need to desperately seek out a ""passion"" per se.

I can relate to your situation.

I wish you well, and a great recovery.   Depression is an illness, just like any other.  Any shame you feel, don't anymore.  Go get yourself to a therapist if you are able to.

Great tip. That's exactly what I thought when I started doing exercises. I wanted to be stronger, to be able to walk more than 15min without thinking I would die. I was agorophobic at the time and all I wanted to be was free and stronger. And this vision changed my life. I started with 10min of exercise daily, learned to cook healthier, and everytime I wanted to give up I remembered why I was doing all of that. My life improved a lot after 6 months.

I generally have a low mood and have had a previous bout of depression.

What I've noticed in the happier periods is that I'm less bothered about figuring things out because life inherently feels meaningful. Like it's nice to talk to a friend or to go for a walk and I can enjoy that for what it is. I still want to feel some meaning or purpose but I can enjoy life even knowing I haven't 'figured it out'. This is very different to how I feel when I'm down and everything feels pointless and then the existential questions take hold.

I still get stumped by the 'what do you want' question. The advice I've been given is just to write out your thoughts and brainstorm ideas. Basically get it out of your head where you will just go in circles. After a while you start seeing a theme. I haven't done this yet but thought I'd mention in case it's helpful to you.

"Yeah that's right.  On the order of the highest court in the universe, I hearby charge my brain with abuse, neglect, torture and crimes against humanity.

""Your honor, over the course of several decades, this man's brain has wreaked havoc on his life, in what I will prove to you a most sinister way.  It has allowed him the chance to attain modest opportunities for the purpose of providing false hope, only to continuously blindside him with a random series of unexplained ailments or counterintuitive predicaments.  Just last night, he was allowed to pull himself up and work for 13 hours straight, only to find that although his body should have been exhausted and his brain should have understood the need for sleep, it demanded he stay awake through the night, further compromising his employment and sanity.  This is of course a petty example, however, one among tens of thousands that have, over his lifetime, led him to believe he is forever broken and that no matter how hard his soul pushes, his brain simply refuses to allow it through.  FURTHERMORE, it is the belief of this court that in doing the above, the brain is intent on breaking his soul completely, until there is nothing left.  If this is proven, surely there is no greater crime than the intentional destruction of a soul, and it is our duty to see that this ridiculously reckless and hurtful brain gets served a fine of exactly one ultimate act of forgiveness, an infinite quantity of love, and the chance to rehabilitate itself into a functional organism that is not at war with the soul any longer."""

"This is just another of my rants. I‚Äôm always grateful that people here responds kindly to me, but please don‚Äôt bother - I really wouldn‚Äôt want to waste your time. 

I didn‚Äôt take my sleeping meds for a few nights as I want to spread them out longer. So I‚Äôm not sleeping well. 

I don‚Äôt know why but I woke up and shed a few tears. I very rarely cry. It is unsettling for me. 

I know I‚Äôm allowed to feel what I feel in my own time and space. It‚Äôs not as if I go out into the real world crying or complaining - in fact not one single soul in my real world knows the difficulty I‚Äôm facing at home. Yet I reprimand myself for feeling sorry for myself, because I know my mother and my ill relative are having it worse and I‚Äôm a shitty daughter to my mother for not being able to do more. 

Here, this is not the real world. And I want to reveal another thing that I didn‚Äôt tell anyone in the real world. I was a very ‚Äòpeculiar‚Äô child, but growing up in the 90s, I wasn‚Äôt given any kind of diagnosis except standard IQ tests - yet, very intelligent children with behavioral problems used to be considered sensitive and it was expected that they would grow out of their problems. In my early teens I started drinking and cutting myself and learnt to put on a mask. I was very successful until I wasn‚Äôt. I had a breakdown far far away from home at university and I was eventually diagnosed with autism (and ADD and depression and anxiety). During those years, I was on suicide watch multiple times. I never told my family, I never disclosed this to anyone at work. I didn‚Äôt tell my present psychiatrist about the autism - I merely told her I had mild depression and anxiety for awhile in my youth. 

None of this is an excuse for my incompetence or my failures as an adult. I know lots of people succeeded despite these problems. And the real word doesn‚Äôt give a dime about me or my personal problems.

">I‚Äôm not good enough and I hate myself for it.

I get these feelings. One question that helps is to say: not good enough for what?

There is no grand purpose to life, nothing after nor before from your POV. You have nothing to live up too except those things you choose. I suggest you change your objectives so you can get a small 'win' then set another one. There's a reason video games are so much fun, that's exactly what they do. It's just as valid an acheivement as anything in the 'real' world to your brain.

You're basically telling yourself you're not good enough to match some random criteria a bunch of glorified big-brain apes plucked out of their arses and some that evolution has given us to try and make us procreate and survive long enough to do so. You're above that, beyond it and anything you do is, by definition valuable. 

That's what I try and tell myelf anyway. I struggle like you, I think I may have some kind of ASD but undiagnosed. I'm too old to continue to live in misery because of random concepts.

An ego will never seem adequate and no matter how we try it will never be just right because ego is only a mental construct and not a real existence. Better to find out what life is like when it is not dominated by memory or your past, when thought is put aside along with all the delusional assumptions we live by.

Please try to remember one thing: *There is nothing more fruitless than a mind judging itself.* Nothing.

Some think I should self terminate bc they are too big of pussies to do it themselves. Imagine killing yourself bc you think (rightly or not) that it's what society wants.

I am disabled but it's a different flavor than yours, I can tell.

I've taken pills, I've cut myself up, I've done super risky things . . . all with the hopes of a lights-out scenario.  

There are still days I wonder.  Especially now.  Things are so crappy I can't believe it.  I think I've been disassociated for a year straight.  

But here's the thing - you can either remain in this state or you can change it.  That's just fact.  One cannot live in the in-between for very long.  At some point you gotta choose life or death.  

It seems like you have a voice, I can tell you are intelligent by your words and I can feel your pain.  All of these things (I gotta believe) can be transmuted somehow to ease your own burden somehow.  

In my I started volunteering and somehow that made me sort of ok with myself and that world.  Also therapy and medication.  In addition to the disability you already have I think you might also have Depression because why not?  The universe has blessed us haha.  

I can feel the passion in you - you want to live, you just don't know it yet.  

Pretty sure I haven't helped at all but at least you know there are others in solidarity who are mad also.  I'm using that anger to help those around me as best as I can.

"I don‚Äôt know what you want or need to hear. I have two perspectives. 
On the one hand, I think it‚Äôs bogus as hell that we are brought into the world without any say for whether we want to be here, and as adults we are basically thrown into the void and told ‚Äúgood luck!‚Äù- forced to learn to cook and clean and work 40+ hours a week to keep a home that constantly needs repairs and then repeat the cycle by having kids ourselves, just to end up feeling terrible for bringing them into this shitshow of a world. And I fully understand why suicide happens. Staying alive to make other people happy is not a great reason. 

On the other hand, the older I get (I‚Äôm early 40‚Äôs), the more I‚Äôm able to look at life as a cyclical thing. There is a LOT of bad, but there is a LOT of good. And when I‚Äôm in the muck of the bad, I have enough experience living to know that eventually things will look up again, and if I can just hang on and hang in, I‚Äôll be glad I stuck around.

"Are you talking physical or emotional pain? Sorry, but it's unclear from the context of the post. If it's physical pain, go to the ER. I don't care how many times you've talked to specialists in the past, go. Go and tell them the pain is so bad that you're suicidal to stop it. They'll be forced to help, at least to stabilize. That also creates a record that makes your diagnosis more serious. Obviously, if specialists are ignoring you, get new doctors. Fuck them. Travel, if you have to. 

If you mean emotional pain, I think it's clear you want help. You wouldn't type this out if you didn't. I deal with a degree of depression and anxiety, and the recent loss of my mother suddenly sure as shit didn't make it better. For me, escapism helps temporarily, but you need more help than that. What has failed in the past about getting help? I've not gotten to the point of being suicidal (a lot of my anxiety is about death and dying, so I'm sorta immune to suicidal tendencies, but with a tradeoff of constant dread about the mortal coil), but I know folks who have. They tend to have to go fishing for the right match when it comes to therapists/councilors. Maybe you just need a different one?

As for loneliness, you need to work on you first. After you're safe and stable, you can start working on getting yourself out there (again?). Or not. Maybe the solution is getting comfortable by yourself. Also, loneliness doesn't have to be romantic. You can find ways to combat loneliness with a friend group (might have to put yourself out there to make friends, join a club/support group, etc).

"Perhaps it's a sad commentary on society, but it has gotten to the point that expressions of love (online) are just words. The only thing that has any meaning to me is hard, cold cash.

Kevin O'Leary, AKA Mr Wonderful (I have no fucking idea why) stated the government should stop giving people money. Only the unemployed should get stimulus.

"Here‚Äôs some advice you didn‚Äôt ask for but I think I have something to offer. 

First thing to remember, if these scams weren‚Äôt convincing no one would fall for them. Scammers prey on those most likely to need the money and who may overlook things they wouldn‚Äôt if they weren‚Äôt in need. You are right, the police are likely not going to be able to do anything for you but it‚Äôs important to take that step if only for documentation purposes.  Tell the bank what happened, be honest and do not blame them or yell at them for what has happened unless they actually played a roll in this in some way. Ask them to work with you to come up with a payment plan. Banks lose money on writing off debt, it‚Äôs in their best interest to work with you and get paid.  If the first person at the bank won‚Äôt help ask to speak to their supervisor in a *non threatening their job manner* .   If that manager won‚Äôt listen, repeat until you have exhausted the escalation path or you‚Äôve found a solution that works for you. If you have to declare bankruptcy then so be it, that‚Äôs life and lots of others have done before you. There‚Äôs a reason it exists. 

You are going to be okay. It just doesn‚Äôt feel that way right now. ‚ù§Ô∏è

"Twitter Philanthropy was created by Bill Pulte for millionaires to help Twitter users in need. Since he and another Twit on the fraudster's byline are legit, I had no reason to question Williams the Team Helper when he offered to pay my bills. Original pledge was for $40k. I archived the entire dialogue. They gave me a BOA account number and instructed me to use it to pay bills. When my credit card cleared, I was to use it to buy kids gift cards, which I did. The payment bounced and I am out that $700 plus the fraudulent payments on my record tarnishing my reputation. I had given them access to my account so they could deposit the money. Please don't point out what I did wrong, I already know, but like I said, legit people are associated with it. I asked those legit people about the fund, but was ignored as always.

Now I have sum $10k in bogus payments and as long as there is a cloud over me, I can't apply for the PPP. I needed that to stay operating. I filed a police report, but I don't expect it to go anywhere bc I don't matter. The fund cut off communication with me.

"I dropped out of therapy I think two years ago now. I am not functioning but the flashbacks were so terrible that it was destroying me and my relationship. I can't do that again.

It's a full time job to find a therapist. It took me months last time. Lots of calls. There seem to be fewer places that take my insurance and they're all full.

Today I called a hospital that has outpatient services for the low income that also takes my insurance. They only have their main number listed, the site says that you need to be refered by a doctor to their behavioral health clinic. 

My doxtor's not going to know how to do that and they're too busy to bother.

So I called the main number listened to long mesages in english and spanish, did not hear what I was looking for and ended up with an operator. Their computer was locking up and they sounded like they also were new and didn't know ehat they were doing. I suspect this means they can't keep people on this job, they quit regularly because that is not uncommon.

It took them a half hour to find a number and they seemed stressed out, I get it, I've been there, so I waited. They gave me two numbers and I suspected why. One was to a voicemail to a clinic which will probably never get back to me. And the other wasn't working.  They probably expected at least one of them not to work. 

Hospitals are like that though. I was passed around once 15 times trying to gwt to the right deparment. I had to call the main number becauae the number on the website was disconmected.

Obviously therapy is the gold standard treatment nowadays, but if you have no money, there's a lot of self help books written by knowledgeable & qualified people that you can read for free from the library or probably find online. I've got more help with anxiety from a book than from seeing a therapist, so I do think they can be helpful. Some people love therapy & get a lot from it, but some people don't, so don't think you can't get help even if it's not from a physical human interaction.

First time poster. I have so much resistance to working on my goals and responsibilities. I've realized through meditation that I'm scared of the future which contributes to my inaction. I work at a grocery store 4 days a week and it is super draining. I'm highly sensitive And give away a lot of myself at work so I think this just drains me? But I have goals and stuff I could do to eventually get me out the grocery store but just too tired to pull the trigger. Like there's very little self discipline. Can anyone relate or have tips?

"Hi there. I can relate to a lot of what you describe.

Like you, I'm very sensitive, but I've also struggled with social anxiety for as long as I can remember.

I don't like to think too far into the future; I pretty much live from day to day, week to week.

I'm not stupid, but my working life has consisted of a series of mostly unskilled, low-paid jobs. The work I'm doing now is very tedious, but I just endure it. 

I think it's the fear of failure that stops me from taking steps, such as study for example, towards a more fulfilling job.

My social anxiety always held me back, but for the past few years I've been on a medication (phenelzine) that controls it well. SA is no longer an issue for me. But still the procrastination and lack of motivation/drive remains. 

Although I can now deal with people without stress, in practical terms my life hasn't changed. I'm still in a dead-end job and am not doing anything to move on.

In a way, it feels like I've given up, and have accepted that this is it for me. I'm 46, and although I guess it's never too late, I can't picture myself doing anything with my life. 

I've never had any idea of what I actually want to do. So I've basically done anything that came my way.

I have a family, two kids. My inaction is a source of tension with my partner; she says she can see the wasted potential in me.

I try to do the things I enjoy in my free time, to make up for the drudgery of my work. But I still dread Monday mornings, though I imagine I'm far from unique in that lol.

Sorry, I've ended up waffling on. I'm not sure where I'm going with all this. Maybe I simply wanted to say your post struck a chord with me, and I empathise."	tigereyetea	reply	na	na	na	0.0066464184783399105	weak	strong	no	na	MadOver30	no prediction.

"I have a lot of anxiety as well as panic attacks. I find breathing and grounding exercises can help being my levels down enough to function. A lot of the time my anxiety is still pretty high so my work was affected but at least I can actually think my way through somehow. 

I had known to do this a while via yoga and meditation classes but I didn't really fully understand what was really going on in my body until I saw the Nerd Nite video about the polyvagal theory. He actually says that our reactions are a central nervous system response and how breath plays a role. It was very helpful.

Procrastination is something I struggle with myself as well and I hack it the best I can. My mother used to jump on every little thing I did wrong, includi saying ""yeah"" on the phone instead of ""yes"". I would become paralyzed initializing any sort of task at home, and that carried into school because I feared the teachers would respond like my mother, and also that the teacher might speak to my mother and I'd get into trouble. That pattern became deeply entrenched and  laterI feared my bosses and struggled at work also, some of whom were people who were toxic or exhibited unhealthy behaviors. 

With procrastination I would remind myself of the consequences of not doing versus deferring punishment or attacks. How I can relieve the burdeb of the sword hanging over my head by getting started. Sometimes I would forget the threat tell myself I would just take a quick look at it just to get a better idea of how to approach it and if I could make it easier on myself. Sometimes that would get me going. Other times, while it was unhealthy, I used my fear to fuel me by telling myself how horrible the punishment would be if I didn't complete the task and how people would react like my mom. And that fear would breakt the freeze, and send me into flight and action.

It's very hard to live in the cycle of anxiety and depression. For many years doctors focused on my depression as the cause of my problems. The depressions really happpened as a reault of my anxiety. My anxiety was so powerful that I couldn't function well and I was criticized for falling short, and often I would frreeze and not do things and regret what I missed out on life. And often that would turn into feelings of being trapped of hoplessness and depression.

 Sometimes the depression would also be as a result of my body being drained and exhausted by anxiety. And somtimes it would be the result of things I did to alleviate anxiety. Sometimes the anxiety would ovwrload me and my body would start to shut down and I'd feel incredibly sleepy and fall asleep (this is also part of the fight/fight/freeze/fawn survival response, shutting down can prevent damage to your nervous system, like a circuit breaker).  Sometimes I'd deliberately go to sleep just to shut down for a while. These things messed up my circaidian rhythm and quality of sleep, I would often feel foggy, muggy, and depressed afterwards. And sometimes I would binge on carbs to get relief, it made me feel good and high for a while and then I'd crash into a depression after. 

I used to feel bad and less than everyone else because I struggled so muvh, I guess I still do to a degree, but underatanding what goes on behind it has helped me see that I have challenges and reasons for why I struggle.

"I always think of it like there are a hundred different versions of me. Every person in my life gets a different ""curated"" version of me. I'm not fake with anyone, it isn't like that, but I just hold back a lot because when I try opening up it becomes clear pretty quickly whether the person can relate/whether its okay to open up more, or whether it's better to shift the boundaries. 

My mother is an example. She means well, but she's never experienced depression herself. When I was a teenager and was first diagnosed she worried, of course, but her worry also comes across as angry panic in a sense and culminates in ""Well you know, things could be a lot worse but life sucks and isn't fair, and you just need to remind yourself that at least you're alive and suck it up. Now, why are you still depressed?""  I'm turning 39 next month and I've learned that the best thing is to not have her worry so I'm really, really fucking good at hiding it. Everyone in my family ""knows"" that I'm depressed and it's been a thing for 25 years but I'm also ""so happy and have such a great attitude and I'm a joy to be around"". I like that version of me, that they have in their minds. And I'm good at keeping it up for them.  

I had someone in my life for just a few months once, whom I could totally be myself with. It was such a fucking relief. Jesus fucking christ, it felt like coming home to a warm house after a long day. It was beautiful. I could say everything I thought and felt, and there was never any judgement, just ""I love hearing all your thoughts."" It was the best feeling ever and I remind myself of that feeling often. I know I can ride that high for the rest of my life because there was never anyone else before or since who gave me that feeling of pure acceptance.

Oh goodness. I don't think you're lacking in ability, stamina or determination. It takes a lot of all three to get through each day when you're dealing with all that you deal with now.

I don't know if this is true of everyone, but I am starting to see the procrastination as resistance, some part of me is fighting so very hard to protect me from some outcome. The harder I fight against it or try to go around it, the harder it pushes back! For a long time I have used the methods I mentioned because I still need to get things done. I think there is a message it want me to hear somehow, but I haven't figured out what it is yet. I'm pretty acquanted with what happened in my childhood so I can understand why it is there. I do not know yet exactly how to make it feel safe and let go. I have not tried using IFS to address it yet, which is a relatively new therapy for me, I'm kinda afraid to attempt IFS without working with a therapist, given how bad my flashbacks can be. I'm trying to see if I can find one. I've only had a little experience with a prior therapist.

It's also hard not to compare outselves with others, I don't feel it's vanity, I feel like perhaps people are afraid and that by keeping up with others, or even surpassing them, they feel it keeps them safe, perhaps to protect from ostracization. It seems that humans are pack animals and like other pack animals we stick together for protection, esoecially from predators. To fall behind means that we are the ones that predators may go after first. And even within our ""pack"" the ones that fall behind can get targeted. I don't know if this rings true for you, but whatever the reason, that you say you can't stop indicates to me that it's not vanity, there is something else behind it.

There are milestones I haven't met that my peers have, and even though with some of them I actively chose not to, I still feel bad for not meeting them! For me when I search within it seems the message is that I don't belong, and I guess that plays into that feeling of not being safe outside the pack. The reality is that I'm actually safe and I'm content with those choices. It is an interesting thing.

I read Pete Walker's ""Complex PTSD: from thriving to surviving"" a while back and this sounds like the voice of an Inner Crtitic. Around the same time I read ""Self Therapy"" by Jay Earley where I was introduced to the concept of Parts, some of which are Protectors, meaning they act in ways to protect us from harm. Some forms of harm could be an emotionally or physically abusive person or parent. There's a sub /r/ifs if you're not familiar.

The Inner Critic within people is actually, oddly, a Protector part. The Inner Critic takes in the words or messages people gave us and repeats them to us as a warning of what may come if we do or say a certain thing. What it's saying is if you do this thing bad things will happen so don't do it and you'll be safe.

Pete Walker attributes his Inner Critic to his parents and he pushes back, belittles, attacks it. I had trouble doing that because it felt like it was part of me, even it repeated words my parents said.

Turns out most people have at least one of those figured out, but not all of them. But of course no one advertises their failures, so what we see is people around our age having a perfect life (as per their internet personas) and we end up feeling lacking. 

I'm already in my mid-thirties, so that realization already made me feel better with myself.

"I am an meds, which have made things a little more bearable, their full efect is suppose to hit after 3 weeks. I have been thinking of starting therapy at different points for the last 8 years, but never did, or tried with no success. Now this current episode is so bad that I had to grab whatever there is - I am two sessions into therapy with a therapist recommended to me by one of my two best friends (I am a guy, 31, she is female - 33) who was claims that when she was in the darkest place ever and tried to commit suicide this therapist saved her. Now she has another job in another city, loves her job and life.

The current thing started last December. I had just started a free trial for a course in order to make a career change, I was making plans about 2021, but now I have ditched everything. It is a nightmare - all fears and intruisive thoughts that have ever been in my life have smashed me. Sometimes I don't eat for two days in a row. I work from home so I only shower before going to therapy or seeing a friend. No will to live, no hope for the future. House is a mess. I drink more beer than ever (yes, I know I shouldn't). Never been that desperate in my life. I am afraid to wake up and face this life, I am afraid of my miserable future. I am afraid of death, of edning up my life alone and miserable. I have had dark moments in the past, I thought I was done with them for good. I was wrong. Now it is the worst one ever.

Whn I was six my father beat up everybody at home. I am sure he is the reason I have been funked up in the head all my life. I started having OCD at 11,12 years old.

If i was 21 not 31 I would be atleast a little more optimistic. i will never quit therapy, it is my only hope, it is just that at 31 I am already tired of fighting.

"Therapy can absolutely help you.  I also have OCD-type intrusive thoughts and have struggled with that and anxiety since I was about five.  It took me the next twenty years to get help.  I finally crashed, much like you, and started just cycling through guilt, past actions, questioning everything, and obsessing constantly.  I‚Äôd go to work and just do nothing the entire day but cycle through my intrusive thoughts. If I could get to a point at night when my mind burned itself out and just went blank, I could get some sleep. Other than that, it felt entirely hopeless.

It took me two tries to find a therapist who worked for me.  Big learning experience: don‚Äôt be afraid to quit and try a new one if the relationship isn‚Äôt working.  The first one ended up taking a very religious angle (nothing against it but really not great when your intrusive, obsessive thoughts are guilt focused and you‚Äôre not very religious) and the second simply ran me through a questionnaire and suggested medication.  

My third therapist listened to me, listened to the approach I wanted to take and my concerns about my past experiences, and worked with me to process the intrusive thoughts, dig down to the roots of them and understand the science behind the therapy and the illness, and gave me tools to not only deal with the thoughts (LOTS of CBT and related therapies), but also to keep tabs on and regulate my own mental well-being.  

I had my last appointment (for now) just under two years ago.  Still use the tools and techniques daily.  Can confirm, it works, is possible to reign in your brain, and it DOES GET BETTER.  Please stick with it-the payoff is huge.  The money I spent on those appointments are the best investment in myself I‚Äôve made in my life.

Well done! Climbing up from the bottom is tough as hell. My bottom was different, but I found it sometimes takes significant time to adjust to the new status quo. Predictability actually feels quit unpredictable when you first start experiencing it. Plus, you don't realize how much trauma you experienced living your prior life until the dust settles. And it takes time to work through that. However, experiencing the joy that gratitude brings to the table is a top notch bonus...exactly what you were talking about when you feel that heat cut on. You will experience joys that many other people never will know of, because they never lacked that benefit. That is one benefit of the climb up. It sucks to have ever been struggling so hard, but the joy of rising up, even slowly...it's palpable. Wishing you many congrats on the improvement in your quality of life!

"Right there with you.  

Am on life number five or six, I don't know at this point, but I remember being on disability and living in a room with my cats.  Struggling so hard with mental illness and a whole bunch of other issues, some actually NOT my fault but probably a little over half were/are my responsibility.  Still working on those because that's important.  

I moved into a place I chose and like.  I am with the man I want to be with.  I have the job I want.  I've recently had a small spate of good luck.  

But what do I feel?  Fear.  Anxiety.  A knawing feeling, an inability to relax, a fist in the stomach.  That it will all be gone.  That it will be taken away.  That there will be a fire, an accident, a devastating illness. . . 

I'm in therapy for all of THIS right now.  I can relate.  

Very proud of you, it's so hard to claw yourself back when you end up on the ground.  Most people don't make it at all.  And some make it but are jerks about it, don't appreciate it and then go back out.  

This strength that you so obviously have, along with your self-awareness, would go a long way towards helping others!  So if you don't know what to do for a career, helping others would be a good direction.  And that's very broad - anything from teaching to being a nurse to working in a shelter to writing a best selling novel about overcoming obstacles!

It's always super jarring and makes me feel weird for the rest of the day, but I feel like it's a sign that my brain is healing. The brain does so much work while we're sleeping that it makes sense that would be one of the ways it would start clearing out all those traumatic memories.

"So I started cutting when I was 12...I'm almost 34 and still a fucking cutter. When I was 25, I got a tattoo that covers the majority of my left forearm/wrist (my ""sweet spot"" for SIB and precisely why I chose my L forearm for the tat), and for a while, it kept me from cutting...but the past 6 months or so have been rough. I've been cutting over and around the tat, I just don't give a fuck anymore because 1) it's covid so I barely see anyone and 2) it's winter and cold af so my bf is the only person who has noticed/commented.

I don't really know what my end game is here in regards to this post...I don't know anyone my age who still cuts themselves and it makes me feel like I'm in middle school again. I've been through so much DBT so I know all the distress tolerance skills, but I am truly incapable of using any of them when the urge bubbles up. And over the past month or so, the urge has been coming on more frequently and much stronger.

My psych doc is basically just my drug dealer at this point, I get 10-15 phone sessions with him once every 2-3 months that are usually spent filling out FMLA paperwork. My therapist is amazing, but she's seeing me pro bono because I'm broke af, and I legit forgot to bring it up when I saw her last.

I just feel like I'm regressing back to the early 2000s. I feel immature, pathetic, and like a complete fraud due to the fact that I work for a mental health clinic."	JackStrawBerryfields	post	23.38074415328678	male	White	0.9979077577590942	na	na	na	8	MadOver30	failed

"Trigger Warning:  Self Harm Specifics

47 here and iI haven't cut since I was maybe 38 but I still do things like mess with a random piece of skin on my arm until it gets weird, pick at pimples, pull out hair on arms, pick skin around fingers . . . you get the idea.

Are you in the same spot as 2000, 21 years ago?

Yes and no.

We will always be confronted with the same issues until they are resolved.  You're in the same longitude on the spiral, but you're at a different latitude.

I guarantee you are not the same and I can tell that you have done a lot of work.  You have such a huge and sensitive heart still and I know it hurts, but it's a good thing.

You're not a fraud.   Working in a Mental Health Clinic doesn't give you a ""get out of feeling bad for free"" card.  Unfortunately.

So you know DBT and CBT and all the rest.  You're carrying around the tool box.  But you can't quite bring yourself to open it.

I'm totally a random person but it feels like there about three things going on with you.  Maybe four.  Just gonna riff them out.

\#1.  You're too hard on yourself shut that critic DOWN damn check out that imposter syndrome

\#2.  You're 34 - could be biological hormonal adrenal - maybe you aren't getting enough sleep maybe you're just stressed all the time.  This is going to cause an inflammatory response in the body and, in turn, your critical brain goes AHA WEAKNESS

\#3.  You're 34 and there's a lot that happens around 34.  There's definitely a shift and it's a hard one, I don't know how to explain it.  I had friend who said to me ""oh that's the the jesus age"" and I definitely crucified myself in more ways than one that year.  Ended up in the hospital with 338 stitches!  I went to TOWN

\#4  The world is so f\*cked right now. In so many ways.  There is malicious cruelty, ignorance, sickness, conflicting information, a 24 hour news cycle . . . It is going to get to you and that's ok.  You are a human being and you are affected by what you are seeing.  Don't internalize it or make it more than it is.  And give yourself credit for being able to feel for other people even though you struggle with your own feelings.

\#5 If you already have depression, long nights and cold days will definitely take a toll.  Maybe a change in meds?  Tolerance can happen sometimes.

\#6  Sometimes shit just sucks.  There's no other way to say it.  The trick is to recognize it and take action.  What's the action?  Well it's different for everyone but for me . . .

I go back to a state called ""observation without judgement"" and I identify the different parts of my personality.  I got up to 10, some have only 2 (self and critic).  Once you understand where the stream of negative energy is coming from, you gently tell that part to get back and you imagine the other parts helping.  It sounds crazy, right?  I had to draw it, too, to really kind of understand how I am assembled.

If you are feeling immature and pathetic, I guarantee that's a younger state coming out through the cracks of your capable adult shell.  So that's who you deal with.  I imagine myself and my inner child as an actual literal child walking next to me.  And I would never tell a 5 year old kid that they are immature or pathetic.   By doing this I am able to reframe my inner conversation.

Maybe you are having issues and maybe your work is not at 100% and maybe you are feeling stuck.  But you are in way better shape than you think and you're gonna be OK, I promise.

"You're not pathetic. Not at all. I'm about your age and I've relapsed and cut myself a few months ago. I have a genetic disorder that makes healing take a long time. But I was have a hard time and I had no one to reach out to, no one who was willing to help. So it came to that.

"I am also of a similar age, and I cut myself between the ages of 12 - 24/25. 

I can't offer any advice, save that I also experience strong urges to cut myself too, over the years. I didn't do it merely because I was too 'lazy'. 

I also often feel like I'm trapped in my teens, despite myself reaching middle age.

If I might offer any explanation/justification/excuse, sometimes I feel like we are the 'lost' generation. Unlike the youths of today, we didn't grow up with everyone talking about mental health/problems all the time. In the early 2000s, society didn't adopt as 'nurturing' (for want of a better word') an attitude as today.

You and your mom should start acting as room mates, not family.  I found that that is the baby step for setting boundaries.

"I changed my meds (changed the psychiatrist and the new one gave me another prescribtion) and just last evening I started therapy. I have been running around, trying and quitting therapy early, or wanting to start, but not having the money for it, etc. for the last 8 years from time to time, but now I am definite that there is no quitting and it will be my only chance. The therapist is highly-acclaimed and my best friend recommended her to me - my friend is a former client, two years ago tried to kill her self, but now has a new job, lives in another city and is completely transformed.

I barely eat, I drink alot of beer to ease my anxiety, and I just FEEL like I know it that there is NO HOPE for me. Ever. Will be miserable for the rest of my days. That's what depression whispers. Or actually shouts in my ear.

&#x200B;

What makes it worse - you know how depression is like a snowball - is that having my condition in my early 30's makes it feel even worse for me. I know and, yes, I have been told - mental health problems don't care for your age - but I feel something in between shame (yes, I do know I shouldn't be ashamed generally) and anger that this happens to me at THIS age. I am not in my 20s. Not a teenager. Just a month ago (just before everything started) I was planning what new things I will learn, started a course, planning a career change and moving to another city - I really wanted all that and wasn't scared by the thought of all that; and also dreaming I would have a family on my own one day.

Nooow, I am a worthless shadow of a person on sick leave (only this week, until meds kick in a little) laying in bed or on the sofa all day, barely humaning... What career? What children on my own? Man, you can't even look after yourself.

I am not suicidal at all, just feel like there is no point in my life... but I will stick to meds and therapy, hey what else I have. Normally I am a fighter, I am even now. Just feel like utter shite.

&#x200B;

**Bottom line, if you have some personal or other people's success stories from your/theirs 30s in similar conditions, or just wanna cheer me up, you would be most welcome.**

&#x200B;

P.S. If you see me chit chatting with coworkers or girls in the office (cuz I am sober in office, i.e. closest to my real self) I am talkative, make people laugh - you would never guess what I have gone through years ago in similar situation and what I am going through right now. I would say my looks and brains are a bit over the avearage. I am not a loser, an outsider. I have enough to make something of my life.  
But what screwed my mental health and psyche ( I am convinced it is the thing) - is my father beating up my mother, her parents (even punching me in the forehead during the melee) back when I was just six years old, the summer before starting first grade. Then my parents separated, but in the autumn my grandmother pressured my mother (her daughter) to get back with my stupid father, because supposedly the child will be better of living with a father figure. Then four more years living under one roof with that man and then another violent episode.

My childhood though wasn't all bad, not at all. Many people have had way more disturbing events in their childhood. Childhood shouldn't be an excuse for me. I should do my best to get myself on two feet and have a normal, meaningful and sometimes even pleasant life. I don't wanna die a miserable human being, waiting for death all his life to be released from misery. I also hope I will some day meet a girl and fall in love with her (for some reason I fall in love very rarely - just two times max for my life so far, and it it is not about being picky - it just rarely happens) - we will not just fool around, but create a family. One one hand I have the selfish fear of dying alone, but on the other I do think this is a meaningful thing to do. And part of me still longs for a meaningful life."

You have great potential my friend. You are seeking help, and that's a tremendous boon. Some of the first steps in therapy is often doing a thought record, doing worksheets on what core values you have (sounds like may value family and social life, but religion, career, etc are all options), and if i were you maybe a food/drinking journal.

Bravo for seeking help. Once the right meds kick in, it will get so much better. You maxed out your serotonin levels so you could emotionally survive your childhood. Our brain releases massive amounts of it when we experience trauma. But we only have so much that we can create on our own, and we get depleted and downward spiral. Now as an adult you will notice this keeps happening. It's why many adult survivors of child abuse become addicts. They are self-medicating by replacing chemicals they haven't had in their brains since childhood or so far back they can't remember. People often mistake this for pure self-pity or willful self-destruction. Not correct. This is how depression and addiction are sicknesses. The brain is literally malfunctioning. Running on empty.

The first few days I layed around and cried but that only makes it worse.  You kinda have to push yourself to do things to feel good about.  And this pandemic isnt helping, but even if it's taking a 5 min shower and getting dressed, you've already done something you can look at positively.  Depression is a fucking bitch, but it doesnt have to define you.  

Also what happened in your childhood doesnt have to be as bad or worse then what happened to someone else to have a long lasting traumatic effect on your development.  So dont feel like it's a competition for whose allowed to hurt based on how bad they had it.  You went through shit, and it's ok to hurt but you have to let go of that hurt, whether its talking it out with that person or a therapist or writing a letter you never actually send, it just helps to get things off your chest.  

Lastly, cause this is getting long... dont worry about having a family or any of that right now, it will all come together.  31 is scary and we start thinking, were running out of time.  But I promise you, the right person will come along when you least expect it and it will all work out.  Honestly, maybe try getting a pet, they are some of the best friends you can have.  Theres no time limit on love and family or learning and growing, when it happens it happens.  And right now you're learning and growing, its painful and it sucks and maybe its left you in a dark place, but as corny as this sounds, caterpillars go through the same thing when they turn into butterflies.  They know the darkness wont last forever, they trust something more is out there and that my dear is how you should think of this time.  You're transforming into something amazing and even better then before.

I even fancy finding God, and again - I have thought about this during nice times too.

"I started a new job just before Christmas. I'm not exactly sure why I thought it was a good idea to interview for and accept a new job during the holidays, during a pandemic, during whatever the fuck else is happening in this nightmare time we're living through.

I'm deeply insecure about my social skills. One of the reasons I wanted to leave my old job was because I feel like I made a terrible first impression since I was practically a shut-in before I got it and I wanted a chance to start new and make a good impression somewhere else. Every day since starting I've been living in dread of saying or doing something stupid and embarrassing and ruminating over the inevitable fuckups that come up every day. Of course, my social skills haven't improved nearly as much as I thought and I'm already making a fool of myself at this new job.

My boss just makes me incredibly uncomfortable. He comes across as very rude and I THINK he's joking, at least most of the time, but I'm never quite sure. His comments whenever I ask him a question, or don't ask him a question, or say or do much of anything make me feel like he sees me for exactly the socially inept fuckup I am. I'm probably imagining at least some of this but it seems like my awkwardness annoys him. Maybe he sees it as inexcusable weakness or maybe it reads as professional ineptitude or rudeness.  He has a way of making sure I know when I say the wrong thing or don't say something when I should have and it always feels like he's trying to correct me in front of everyone. ""\_\_\_, you really should have mentioned that in the last meeting, it would have been so much more relevant there"" or ""wow \_\_\_\_ , that was way more context than we needed for this meeting but thanks."" 

During a meeting this afternoon there was an awkward moment where I was prompted to speak but didn't quite pick up on what was happening. I sat there for a few seconds and about the time I thought ""oh fuck, that guy wants me to say something"" he said ""uhhhhh \_\_\_\_\_, that's your cue"" in this annoyed, impatient tone. I said ""oh, sorry"" and then said what I needed to say and the meeting moved on. Typing it out makes me realize it's probably pretty trivial and unimportant but something about the awkwardness of the moment and the way this guy pounced to draw attention to my little slip really gets under my skin. And it's been like this since I started.

I keep turning over what happened in my head. Am I a socially inept idiot for not picking up on what was, in hindsight, a fairly obvious cue for me to speak? Is he an asshole for calling me out like that. There have so many incidents like this in just a short time on the job - does he already hate me? Now I'm convinced that I made a bad impression in my first few weeks. I was happy in my old job, just convinced that they hated me (despite two years of positive performance reviews). Now I'm back where I started at a job I don't think I'll like as much and a boss who I don't think I like near as much as my old boss.

I know nobody else probably remembers it. I'll get so distracted by other fuckups that I'll forget it by Wednesday. But it still ruined my day and it'll still feel like my brain is on fire with worry over this meaningless incident until I've slept.

I'm fucking 35. I feel like I should have a thicker skin and not give a fuck about what people think of me by this age. I keep hoping that more exposure to fuckups like this will make me less sensitive to them but it seems like it just gives me more potential entries to the cringe moments highlight reel that plays in my head when I'm feeling anxious. I remind myself that the worst case scenario is that I get fired and go back to my job search. I turned down 2 other offers for this one and I'm pretty sure my old company would take me back so it's not like I'd be unemployed for long. I just can't stop feeling so ashamed and embarrassed every time I do my best to say the right thing and I still hear this guy sigh and correct me in the tone my dad used when I did something obnoxious in public as a child.

Of course, I know I'm in a very fortunate position to have a good job I can do from home right now at a time when so many are struggling so I feel guilty complaining like this. Knowing this doesn't make it any easier to stop worrying and I find myself wishing they'd fire me so someone more deserving could take my place and I wouldn't have to deal with it anymore.

"Hey dude there is a lot to unpack here. Why don't we just start from what we know and can control. Im a fucking ptsd burnout 31 yr old from silicon valley. I can absolutely relate. You aren't socially inept, and we all ruminate. For some of us its aLOT more intense. Our bodies actually respond (cortisol) from memories. What you need to do is get a plan together. The plan is to stay sane. I dont want to sound like im plugging books but ""Stress Proof"" and a lot of practicing being present (mindfulness) to stop the ruminating.

"Wow I'm sorry to hear all of that. It does sound like it's causing you way more stress than it reasonably should. We all want to make great impressions at our job. 


I can relate slightly to not really being socially apt in the workplace. It takes me so long to show my personality and/or build relationships. Its really something that has held me back. 

I think it's a mix of you being awkward and your boss being kind of a dick. i had a boss like this and he would point out that I missed ""social cues"" . Which unfortunately isn't really true we just got off on the wrong foot and he formed an opinion of me that he sought to confirm from then on. It didn't happen on a weekly basis but often enough to make me want to quit when the school year was over. 

It didn't affect me because I knew my colleagues had a much worse opinion of him than he had of me. But nevertheless our interactions weren't great. 


And because he continued to make me uncomfortable i gave him more content than i otherwise would have. 


So i think that with him treating you like this and having possibly already formed an opinion of this it's going to be up to you to break this cycle where you continue to feel even more awkward and his opinion is confirmed. 

One thing to think about is that if this is a pattern in every job it's definitely time to address your crippling insecurity. You're right you're too old to care that much what others think. Though as I said most of always will care especially when it comes to the workplace. 

If your social skills are what needs work then I would find a way to work on them with friends or whoever makes you feel most comfortable. Perhaps even cbd can help. I used to take it before important job interviews but i tend to only be awkward when I'm nervous and self conscious. 


Either way sorry this is happening and that it's affecting you so much. Try to distract yourself when you feel very strong emotions and then when you're ready you can start to think about it again to find a solution. 

I also practice mindfulness meditation to undo the ""knots"" in my mind that stressful experiences create.

"I can relate 100% mate. 

Instead of fucking around with benzos and maybe digging yourself in deeper, why not try something more sustainable like Nardil? 

It's just as effective for SA (if not more so) than a benzo, without the associated tolerance/dependence stuff.

Nardil has changed my attitude. I used to be just like you, getting hung up on every perceived social fuck-up and ruminating endlessly about what the other person thought, how dumb I must've looked etc etc.

Now I really don't give much of a fuck at all. I feel equal to others instead of inferior or somehow lesser. And I can now make small talk or chat at length to anyone, friend, stranger or enemy üòÇüòÇ

It's worth at least looking into Nardil as a possible option, even if you decide it isn't for you.

"It's hard for me to focus well, but I think I got the gist of your post and thought of a book that used to be recommended a lot on reddit. It's called *""Feeling Good'* by David Burns . You mention of being insecure about social skills is what made it pop into my head. I think Burns had a similar expereince and if I recall correctly this book is about what helped him to overcome his feelings of being inadequate socially.

He talks about cognitive distortions, which I think may be helpful. They're a framework to check against to see what's going on. For example, we don't yet have the power to read minds (that I know of anyway), one of the cognitive distortions is Mindreading. You seem to be trying to guess what your boss is thinking and the book may also be useful for that as well.

Sometimes I still reference the list of distortions and go, oh yeah, there's no way I could really know what that person is thinking. I'm mindreading again, I'm putting my thoughts and interpretation onto this and they could be nothing like what goes on in their head!

Burns has a website now. I read the book loooong time ago so I haven't seen it before, I just stumbled across it when I was googling trying to recall the author and title of the book. https://feelinggood.com/tag/cognitive-distortions/ It looks like he has a podcast also, and I think he is also on youtube. You could probably poke around and see if anything resonates for you.

I've also read *""The Reality Slap""* by Russ Harris, which comes from an ACT background. I read it to fill in some things that I didn't feel were covered by what I had at that point learned about CBT.

Both CBT and ACT are similar in challenging negative thinking habits. Some prefer one of the other, you could probably check out related subs and their wikis to see if there's things that are useful to you. I read these books maybe 10- 15 years ago. There may be newer, better, faster versions now.

 While these therapies worked very well for others and I found the concepts useful, there was something missing for me. I stumbled across DBT, which seemed a lot better suited for me. DBT does actually borrow from CBT,  she uses the cognitive distortions as well. I think DBT may also borrow from ACT. There may be a bit of a gender parity thing here as DBT was developed by a woman and CBT and ACT I think were developed by men, I'm not certain. I feel like DBT allows for having emotions and CBT/ACT try to dismiss them. But that is my take, others have not agreed. I am throwing them all out there because everyone had their own methods and preferences for what works best.

After DBT I felt like something was still missing and eventually wound up learning about Complex PTSD and reading Pete Walker's book ""*Complex Ptsd:from surviving to thriving*."" 

I actually found that while that book is very popular and well liked by many that it wasn't a good fit for me. He types people by their dominant nervous system response (fight, flight, freeze, fawn). He is very good for fawn types, as I suspect that he's a fawn and this is based on methods that helped him. But he is dismissive and critical of freeze and fight types, of which category I fall under (I seem to be Freeze Fight, the narcissistic ""John Wayne Couch Potato"", which is awful to say and not very accurate. I'm guessing you may be a fawn and find it useful, but if you're not, it's ok, it might not be the best resource. Right now I'm looking for resources for fight/freeze responses. I did find a sub for fight types and I'm going forward from there trying to decide what's next.

I guess what I'm saying is that this is a process and there's trial and error involved. The ruminating and worrying is coming from something, and I'm not sure what you'be explored already, but I hope maybe somewhere in those resources you may find some clues to help allieviate it."	stuckinsidemyhead2	reply	na	na	na	0.9992300271987915	no	strong	no	na	MadOver30	failed

"Yeah, I'm going to strongly advise against Xanax or other benzodiazapenes. I know they really do help in the not giving a fuck department, but they're so fucking easy to get addicted to. As a recovering heroin addict who's spent some time in rehab, I ran into plenty of people there who were just there for benzos and they were WAY worse off than I was. Having seizures and feeling like shit for three times as long as us junkies...and they had only been using for half as long! I think people are especially susceptible to becoming addicted to benzos when they find GREAT results from them, too. I don't know, I'm not a doctor and I don't know your history with substances but just...please be very careful and deliberate if you go with any benzos. There are also plenty of non-addictive anxiety meds too! Visirel and Buspirone are two that come to my mind (no guarantees on the spelling there). 

I'm sorry you're going through these insecurities. You're definitely not alone in that! I'm a 34 year old with a law degree and I just interviewed today to work at a fucking gas station because of my myriad of mental health issues. 

Mindfulness has become my number one coping skill. I've been practicing it everyday since October 5 and it's made a HUGE difference in my life. I'm not a Type A personality at all so I've had to set alarms and calendar reminders and push notifications, but I'm proud of myself for sticking with it and it's become second nature for me when I'm feeling stuck in one way or another. There are lots of options for apps and such, but my absolute favorite has been Insight Timer. Lots of functions and features, and approximately 60,000 free mediations. Of course, there's a Members Plus section too. YouTube is another great resource.

Also a lesson I've learned is that when my source of anxiety is internal sometimes meditating doesn't solve the problem since I'm still in my head. In those situations I do grounding exercises: focusing on external things very intensely, down to minute details. Grab a grounding rock. Really look at it closely and use words to describe its look and texture. Describe it like you're JR motherfucking Tolkien. Look around you and name 5 things you see, 4 things you hear, 3 things you feel, 2 things you smell, 1 thing you taste. The more external stimulus you have going to your brain, the less you'll be in your head. Run your wrists under the coldest water you can stand; it's an instinctive brain reset. These are all strategies I've used myself with positive results. See what works for you. It's not about being weak or stupid or broken. It's about being strategic and working hard. None of this is your fault, but it is your responsibility to deal with. 

I'm pulling for ya dude. If you ever want to talk one on one, please message me. I mean that sincerely, not as a bullshit platitude. If you want some reading material, suggestions, or just someone to commiserate with, I'll be your battle buddy so to speak.

" How do I get over feelings on inadequacy in terms of dating?  Like I know I am and like who I am. I am awesome.  But when it comes to dating, I just feel‚Ä¶ undesirable.  I mean it's definitely because growing up and not fitting the ideal of beauty and sexiness, guys treated me like I was invisible.  My life consists of so many instances of guys not wanting/choosing me.  They always went for my prettier friends.  And now I can't help having this gut reflex of ""why not me?"". Even though I know the answer to that is really ""different strokes different people"", I can't help feeling rejected.  Maybe it's my Rejection Sensitivity from my ADHD, or maybe because it keeps happening.  I don't really get asked out.  I haven't had anyone love me. My relationships have never lasted very long and are far and few between.

But then I see the flip side of things and wonder if I even want the attentions of men.  I just feel so hopeless that I'll find someone.  

Everyone keeps saying that I'll meet someone. When I least expect it. When I'm not looking.  I'm 32 years old. I've waited long enough.  Not to mention for that to work, I need to actually meet people.  Which I don't. I'm not sure how.

Or maybe they say that it's a numbers game and I just need to get out there.  How? Dating apps?  That sounds miserable.  It's such a grind full of rejection, invisibility, drama, shitty guys and I just can't take it.   

I'm not even sure I'm in a mental space to date right now. I'm trying so hard to get my shit together and dating/meeting someone just seems like it would be detrimental to that.

But goddamn I want someone. I want sex. I want cuddling. I want someone to cook for and do things with.  I want someone who'll hold me when I cry and celebrate with me when I succeed. I want someone I can text inane things to during the day, who laughs at my jokes and makes me laugh. I want someone to get me flowers or leaves me notes or finds a way to show me how much they care.

"You sound a lot like me. I grew up with undiagnosed ADHD and was so used to people going for my more pretty or feminine friends.

I don't know how to say this without sounding hokey or all magical-thinking, but what really changed dating around for me was just trying to focus on what I wanted, rather than on what other people wanted from me. I decided that instead of trying to make people like me (or worrying about what was wrong with me that they didn't) I would treat every date like it was them auditioning for my life. So the questions I would always ask myself were ""what do you add to my life?"" and ""how is me dating you making things better for me?"" The answers didn't always have to be life changing - when I met my current partner the answer for the first month was interesting conversation, fun, and someone to try new restaurants with.

Basically, I tried to change my thinking to make dating about what I wanted out of life instead of a popular referendum on my awesomeness. It wasn't easy and mostly involved me shouting at my brain in the privacy of my apartment. It didn't make me find someone, but it did make dating more bearable and honestly, while I dated fewer people, I dated more people who made me happy.

I recently met someone who wants a relationship, but not from me.  Our arrangement is more casual than that, more of a FWB.  I'm ok with it, especially since he's a really good friend and I am getting a lot out of the relationship.  And I get it, I'm not who he's looking for in a partner. But it definitely triggered a lot of the ""why not me"" issues I apparently still have.  We met through a large friend group that has that one ""pretty girl""  who's a big attention seeker, so that's also been triggering.

"I have been angry for about two-three years. I can definitely feel it waning now.

One thing that really changed it for me, and this happened over the previous few months, is... a kind of a validation of me and my situation on the level of lived experience.

I experienced things that made me go ""oh, I really am correct in thinking I have been abused, and I still am being abused"", not on a 'neocortical' level, but in deeper parts of myself  ‚Äî as well as things that made me go ""it's happened to people before me, people like me existed before and they were good people"".

So both a validation in the truthfulness of my trauma and the value of myself as a person and as a part of humanity.

When these things clicked, some healing definitely happened on a level that I feel was very biological, outside of any region that CBT type talk therapy could ever hope to reach. It feels like putting down roots in this world.

So I guess my point is... perhaps those two viewpoints can help others to also move beyond rage?"	not-moses	reply	na	na	na	0.9978429079055786	no	strong	no	na	MadOver30	failed
For me it's been three years at least and just getting stronger. I overanalysed myself, did so many practices, going through therapy. The rage is still there. Learning to let it out very slowly (not always successful at that). But yeah, I used to suppress my anger, up until my early 30s.

"My father passed away last year today. 

I admitted then, and I admit the same now: when he passed, I did feel a sense of relief. He was a fiercely independent man and him trapped in a body which he could not control weakening day by day was not a life to live, for him, for my mother or I. I believed then, and I do believe now, that he was set free by his death. 

Of course, I would occasionally feel a pang of guilt. Like, what kind of a daughter was I to wish for his death? Especially because we were never close. However, I think one reason we clashed that much is because I am very much like him in personality. And I think, I know what he wanted, at least towards the end.

Things didn't go smoothly. A few months thereafter, there was a fire at home. Nothing v serious. But still very worrying and stressful in dealing with the repairs and the insurance people.

Then, 3 months ago, I was told that a seriously disabled relative has become seriously ill (cancer). I will not go into details as to the why and how, but somehow it has become my responsibility to deal with it.

So far, I will say that I am mainly responsible for the finance part, and not the personal care part - yet. I have paid USD10,000 towards medical expenses. It was from my savings - as I haven't had much work. It's ok - I have been frugal in the past and have saved up money for a rainy day. Albeit, I must say, this was not the 'rainy day' in my mind. And I do worry that what happens to me, to my mother, should my savings run dry.

It goes without saying that I worry about money incessantly. And I feel useless because I am a poor adult in her 30s. Not a young person, not even a young adult. One stroke of bad luck could swipe away everything I have owned."	stranger38	post	34.63551162855163	female	White	0.9843593239784241	na	na	na	1	MadOver30	no prediction.

I myself lost my mother to cancer when I was a child and while I was too young to really understand those feelings, i remember wishing it would all just ""end."" I think those are fairly normal feelings to have.

Also speaking as someone with a chronic illness that will inevitably get worse, I have no real desire to live past the point of independence, even if that means shaving a couple decades off my life. I'm hardly doing anything with it anyway.

"""Mental Illness"" is the price we pay for being intelligent. Its being trapped; a round peg in a world full of squares. Our brains never stop. There is no ""relaxing after a fulfilling day"", because there is never fulfillment. Therefore there is no relaxing. Moar, moar, moar, even if its not enjoyable, even if we know its to our detriment, we still do it. We can't see the forest because there are no trees. There is no completion because life is simply one, big, neverending task. We try to make the circle into a square through meditation, self medicating, prescriptions, but all these do is provide a temporary numbing of who we actually are. We are told that success brings happiness. Love brings happiness. ""Things"" bring happiness. Well, what if they don't? What if we are chasing something that isn't there? Is this some bizarre simulation of an advanced, psycopathic civilization, plopping us into this world and watching us stumble? while at the same time people far less intelligent, far less empathetic, far less human even, thrive? Control us, through government, laws, taxation, policing, ""education"". A life engineered for the lowest common denominator. A system we cannot change, no matter how hard we try. ""Vote!"" ""Get a degree"" ""You can be anything you want"" All programming with the intent of us being good little soldiers of society. Well, the programmer who programmed my CPU got some coding wrong, because I never did and never will buy it.

 Im sticking it out though. Worst thing I ever did was peel that first layer off. Now that I am half way through, I want to see what remains. Ive come this far, its the fith inning. The game isn't over until the bottom of the ninth. Maybe this intelligence curse will pay off. I wish I could be like my father, waking up, happy to be alive, whistling, observing the sunlight, the birds. A zest. Life is a gift to him, square peg in a square hole......

Stop trying to solve the riddles because the riddles just bring you more riddles. Instead, find peace. Maybe smoke a little weed. Engage in your relationships, be more loving, embrace the insanity that is the world because you don't get another.

You are what you are born into usually applies, although it seems you broke that mold, congrats for that.

I was torn. Mothers side=education, fathers side=own business, trades type deal. Literally a tug of war growing up. In the end, I never went to university. Public and high school were prison for me. I asked a lot of questions. The teachers I had didn't like to answer questions. This made me combative and led to constant conflict. No way in hell I was going to actually pay money to go through four more years of this bullshit when I can make money and get treated with respect (the irony of course is I would have done well in uni, I just assumed it was a continuation of the academic side of high school, which I hated)

Having said that, I dont regret my decision. Ive done well for myself all thing considered. My education happens on a day to day basis, its not pre planned and rehashed.

"Coming up on my 34th birthday and realizing that my life has not gone the way I'd planned, like, at all. Common story...people have regrets, mid life crises, disappointing lives routinely. Part of the human condition, life is often disappointing and our hopes, dreams and expectations are often unrealistic.

But what's jarring about my experience is that my hopes, dreams and expectations seemed to be perfectly  reasonable, but somehow they were just as impossibile for me as some pie-in-the-sky fairy tale.

I've always wanted to be just basically average, but it seems like that was too high a bar to clear. 

I never wanted some awesome job like a celebrity, astronaut, or star athelete. I wanted a boring office job, with a boring cubicle and a boring break room where I might get my boring lunch stolen. 

Nope. I've never managed to get a job where I've even had my own desk, let alone a cubicle. I've barely even managed to get a job where I wasn't on my feet/on the road all day, not for a lack of trying. (I got laid off the one time I did.)

I thought that I would go to college, live the stereotypical college lifestyle, get a degree, and then a low-level job in the field where I would work my way up. Never rich but making ""enough.""

Nope. While I did graduate college, my degree is useless, I never really had the stereotypical wild college party years, never made any lasting friendships. I did get that job in my degree field but it turned out to be unsustainable and I've never returned to that area. Or any area. I hop from field to field, nothing ever sticking, never mind silly things like ""climbing the ladder"" or earning a ""living wage""

I thought I would get have a few girlfriends throughout my life, meet a cute (not unobtainably hot) woman and we'd get married, have a couple of kids, dog, regular house that I'd learn to fix up. Nope, terrible with women my entire life, only relationship was with a girl that, if I'm honest, I agreed to go with mostly out of a lack of options, at first. We became close, but as soon as I'd adjusted my expectations and looked forward to being with her she developed severe mental problems that I couldn't handle and I've been celibate ever since. And affording a house, ever, is completely out of the question.

I thought I'd have a stereotypical bohemian 20s, move into a flat with some friends/roomates. Fully expecting to live in a crappy place until I was able to afford better, roaches, rats but also learning to be independent. Nope, never was able to afford moving out, stuck in my parents basement, isolated, well into my 30s.

Like, I tried, but literally nothing worked. And I don't think my expectations were unrealistic. But the way everything turned out, I might have well been shooting for the moon.

I accept where I'm at job-wise because it was my choice, even if just because I didn't make a choice and instead drifted along.

Chronic anxiety plagued me for years. Depression also became my faithful companion. 

I think it's hard enough getting anywhere in life without the added weight of mental crap to deal with on a daily basis.

"Sincere question.

How do I know if I have a problem? I am 63, getting divorced and know that my husband suffers from various mental illness issues and that is why I am leaving. I know that I am extremely introverted but I can function in the real world. Have a job as an RN in a stressful position, not beside nursing, have always gotten good reviews, have worked for the same employer for 30 years. My kids are talking to me, even seem to like me. But I have watched my husband who is not able to see or admit to his mental health issues. How do I know that I am not the same? 

Thanks in advance for any advice you might have for me. I have had counseling before, and will begin to go again shortly but would like to know if there is anything in particular that I should be on the lookout for."		post	50.031668472675705	female	White	0.013660156168043613	na	na	na	10	MadOver30	failed

"This turned out to be really long, so thank you for just reading this.

I am not expecting any answers, but I would be happy to hear different opinions.

I am a 31 years old spoilt white male, born to privilege, who is wasting their life.

I feel unhappy with myself, beacuse everything I have ever done was given to me.

&#x200B;

I have failed two bachelor degrees.

The job I have has been given to me and there is no pressure to do anything meaningful with it, because it is a minute team and it does not force me to engage with people or present any consequences for failure.

I feel no real desire to be good at it.

When that eventually falls through, I have no pressure to get an actual job, because, although I will not live a life of luxury, I will never really have to face any financial hardships (my family owns a bit of property).

&#x200B;

I feel no reason to seek out connections with people, because I feel it is too much work, without too much reward.

I know, rationally, that the work is worth the reward, because it brings me happiness to connect with people, but not enough to stop myself from actively pushing people away or seeking out connections.

My family is my only real source of meaningful connections with other people, however there are issues there.

My parents are content to never push me to do anything and they let me just exist in the state that I am in.

They do that, because they need me to take care of their emotional needs and serve as an emotional drain for their baggage, while simultaneously refusing to include me in any meaningful conversations which could potentially lead to change.

They also show real support and love, when my problems do not involve them actually changing.

I used to be very close to my sibling, and they show me real support and love, but they have grown distant, since they now have their own family to support and issues to take care of.

Since I have been spoiled from an young age, my safety net is very toxic to me.

&#x200B;

I have no real desire to improve myself, because I am too scared to change what is essentially a lifestyle that brings no hardships.

More often than not I want to find meaning in life but that requires at least a nominally consistent drive for self-improvement, so that usually fizzles out within days or weeks.

I have been to several therapists, but that ultimately fails, when I just stop engaging, because the desire for change dries up when I fall back to habits that lead to stagnation.

Habits, such as ignoring people, doing nominal self-improvement (i.e. taking the occasional online class or certificate for job-related skills only to do nothing with them and let them expire), consuming media, which makes me feel good about myself, and general laziness.

I have been diagnosed with depression and generalized anxiety disorder, because of my general lack of desire to take basic care of myself, beyond personal hygiene, and actively ignoring the few people from school who still want to be friends.

The only friend I keep in toch with (on and off) tries to make me get off my ass and actually do something, anything, since that is the only way to find something which will make me feel happy and not just content.

&#x200B;

I often have suicidal ideations, but I know they will not be realized, because that would be an utter waste of all the opportunities that have been given to me as well as any potential I might have.

I also realize the inherent contradiction, between feeling that I have potential worth and feeling bad, because I'm not doing anything about it.

&#x200B;

I realize that my emotional growth is stunted and I have no real desire to grow, or I would try to do something to change it.

&#x200B;

All of this makes me a burden to myself, society and family, since I have no desire to give anything of value back, and I do not feel happy with myself, because I want to do something I define as worthwhile.

I have no way of knowing what is worthwhile to me, without trying stuff that I feel might be, but I also have no desire to try things I feel might be.

I do not have any external or much internal pressure to actively change, and it's easy to just ignore myself and by extension people around me.

Ignoring people arond me makes me feel shitty, so I just hate myself more and fall into this spiral of discontent, where I hate myself, but not enough to change.

So I neither hate, nor love myself enough to change.

I just feel I am wasting what was given, which is not enough motivation for me to do anything with my life.

Add to that the fact I should have been going through this when I was 16 (if I'm being generous with myself) and the general understanding that I am wallowing in convenient misery, instead of doing anything about it.

So, being a spoied, whiny, self-hating loser at 31, it's easy for me to distance myself from myself as a way to reconcile with the fact that I don't like myself.

This whole thing also makes me feel very egotistic.

&#x200B;

The options I see and my questions are:

1. How do I force myself to change, when I don't really want to and have no external pressure to do so?
2. How do I learn to live with myself and not care so much that I have no value to other people?
3. How do I learn to find meaning in what little value I have?

&#x200B;

"Maybe you need a change of perspective. There are many people who aspire to simple living, they aren't interested in career achievements etc, they live life as simply as possible in many different ways and it bring them peace. The difference between them and yourself is perspective and probably the fact that they live harmoniously with others and have people in their lives who they feel close to  (just a feeling) but some people live peacefully as hermits. 

Im not saying just accept your situation but what I'm saying is how can you be so sure that you need to do something or change in order to be happy that's something that humans always feel, we need to change we want more or we want different things than what we have no matter what it is. 

I think you probably should do some soul searching. Since this isn't really the kind of sub I won't get into it too much but I do recommend buddhist meditation which I have found really helpful in helping me change my perspective and gain greater clarity about what particular life I want to live regardless of what society or family is expecting of me .

">My parents are content to never push me

Dude you‚Äôre 31. THIRTY. ONE. A parents job to push is when you‚Äôre in elementary school, middle school, high school, and to get you through college or other post-secondary training.

Most they can do at this point is to support you, which they‚Äôre doing. They can‚Äôt make you do anything so stop blaming them for what you choose to do or not do at 31.

"A lot of western culture brainwashes us into thinking we're either 1) successful, important, and doing Great Things, or 2) we're losers. Doing anything feels like ""too much work,"" as you put it, because it is... if you look at things in a black and white way.

This is hard to break out of. I'm not a spoiled well-off white guy but I can very much relate to your situation and lack of motivation.

I think it's important to experiment. Try different things to figure out what is important to you and what activities or human relationships feel good and valuable. They may not be what you think. You might think ""cultivating a friendship w/ this new person I met doesn't seem worth it"" but give it a try to see what it's actually like. You might be surprised. Or you might not. Experimentation is about failure, so expect many dead ends. This takes time, and it's not wasted effort. You're learning a lot as you go.

Eventually you'll establish a small ""base"" of things you want to do, people who are important in your life, values you believe in. The smaller the better.

"I've had shoddy attendance for the past year because of my mental health and I took a 2.5 month LOA in the fall to attempt to address some of my issues. Long story short, didn't make a ton of progress, went back to work and almost immediately started having attendance issues again. And now I'm out of FMLA hours until they start replenishing. On top of your run of the mill severe depression and anxiety, over the past year I've managed to develop ergophobia...so like this morning I spent 30 minutes doing mental gymnastics trying to get in the shower, crying and dry heaving the whole time. 
Getting my ass in to work is probably pretty crucial because I have missed every day this week without a doctor's note (although my boss does know I have depression/anxiety stuff going on). But trying to fight through the irrational panic and nausea and dizziness and confusion and feeling like I'm going crazy, for yet another morning?

I can't. I can't fucking do this for one more god damn morning. It's demoralizing and embarassing. Despite all they've done for me in terms of accommodations and brushing certain things under the rug this past year of hell, I'm ready to throw in the towel and just quit. 

I can see the merits of both sides: Just fight through the anxiety and go! Some days this is possible, others not. When I started my LOA I weighed 94 pounds...anxiety quite literally eats away at me. I finally took a Klonopin this morning to calm down and help me move through my routine, but it hasn't totally kicked in yet. And even when it does, after writing all this out, I've kind of come to terms with the fact that whether or not I go in today, I'm going to struggle like this every fucking day I have to go to work...and I don't know if I can survive life like that.

Severe chronic Stress can do awful things to the body. I pushed through it for years and now I‚Äôm permanently disabled because I did that so I never recommend just pushing through it. Is there any way you can apply for temporary disability while you pursue more help? Would you consider getting a referral to a psychiatrist? Not necessarily for medication, but they may have an idea of resources that would be available to help you. I was connected to a free cbt group through my doctor and it is really helping. Would you be willing to see a therapist to work on other coping strategies, discuss possible accommodations that eventually could be made, and work on things that could make your anxiety more tolerable? I‚Äôm just throwing these out as I have found these things helpful but different things work for different people. Quitting right now is likely not a good idea until you feel more in control of your symptoms and  it is probably better to pursue more leave if you can until you‚Äôve weighed all the consequences.

Just to give you a practical tip, you are probably better off financially letting them fire you so you can collect unemployment, or go out of short-term disability if you have that insurance.

"For people with a high ACE score, in an ideal world it would be a great help to see a therapist specialising in trauma, but that's not accessible for everyone so I've added a few things I've found helpful.

Anxiety is often the body trying it's best to protect you from something, fighting it (hating yourself for being anxious) or trying to ignore it and push through seems to make it worse in the long term.

The book 'The Body Keeps The Score' by Bessel Van Der Kolk is a really good book, and a lot of people recommend 'Healing The Fragmented Selves of Trauma Survivors' by Janina Fisher (I've only just started this).

Personally I like Internal Family Systems (IFS) for finding the root cause of anxiety, the basics can be done at home, again there are a few books and YouTube videos.

Dialectical Behaviour Therapy (DBT) skills are also supposed to be more helpful than CBT for those experiencing overwhelming emotions (there are workbooks if that is easier).

There is an app called Unwinding Anxiety which has a free trial that seemed really good.

Cannot recommend this youtube channel enough, it has some great videos on supplements that can help and basic therapy skills that can help reduce anxiety https://youtube.com/c/TherapyinaNutshell

"I never know how to take personality tests. Do I answer according to what my ""true nature"" is or according to the behaviors I cultivated to counteract it? E.g., I'm a really sensitive person at heart so I've lived my life trying to be tough and logic-driven. I have very strong intuitions that tend to be right but I rationalize everything to make decisions and avoid going on gut feelings. I'm a perfectionist but I make a conscious effort to stop at ""good enough"".

Of course you'd think the fact that I call it my ""true nature"" would tell me something, but surely at some point the overcompensations themselves become part of my personality as well, right? If I live according to a set of rules at odds with what comes naturally to me, isn't that just as relevant to who I am as the ""natural"" inclinations are?"	bedazzledfingernails	post	30.779030001444255	female	White	0.9961579442024231	na	na	na	5	MadOver30	failed
"My therapist once posed a question to me that really helped me clarify my ""real"" personality: what is the difference between ""faking""  a personality trait and ""really"" having that personality trait? For example, what's the difference between being a morning person and bouncing out of bed naturally at 6 AM every day to do yoga versus setting your alarm every day for 6 AM and dragging your body into the yoga studio reluctantly? The end result of both scenarios is that you're an early riser who does morning yoga. Then again, I believe result matters more than intent, other people feel differently.

I think it's also important to appreciate the complexity of human personalities. There doesn't always have to be an easy answer. One of the fundamental flaws of personality tests is that they force you to vastly over simplify your truth to select a single defining option. But most people are full of contradictory personality traits. I am argumentative, but I'm also avoidant of conflict. I'm logical and thoughtful, but also extremely impulsive. I think everyone has clashing truths about their personality, and that doesn't make either reality less, well, real.

"My last point on here was me basically throwing in the towel because life just hasnt been worth a dime. Shortly after my post i had a serious melt down asking my self why im in a worse position than most (save me the ""others have it worse speech"" i am/felt the worts).

Some later i called up a guy i heard sells magic shoorms, at this point i wasnt worried about what could go wrong because well the worst was already happening. I got 1.5grams as my 1st hit, my heart was racing so fast leading up to the time i was set to eat them. This opened my eyes to how much fear had governed my life and still does coz magic mushrooms only work for so long and till they dont.

I had always felt uneasy around people, extremely anxious, depressed and fearful for the silliest of reasons, my temper was not any better.

Ive never felt so energised and full of positive energy i was beaming and seeing the world from a different perspective. That of a ""normal person"" who could walk up to any one and make a sale a friend etc. Fear literaly left me , like if you had a cold/ wet patch in your body that would never leave and all of a sudden your whole body is equally warm.

I must note the amount i took wasn't enough for a full psychedelic trip just enough to alter the mind and re wire the brain. Might do a bigger trip later coz the effects seem to last/ linger a while after the trip.

Now i feel different bit life hasn't magically changed coz mental health prevents you from developing skills and routines needed to succeed at anything. Its important to be able to complete a skill regardless of your mental and physical state otherwise you are at the bottom end of the spectrum. 

I come from a country that doesnt have mental health care if its there its expensive. Society even shuns you if you exhibit such tendencies so yeah thats why i haven't been able to seek professional help. But a lot of online reading and visiting subs like this helped me better understand what might have been wrong with me.

A lot of people recommend you talk to someone or see a specialist or meditate or practice mindfulness etc that all sounds clever but its far from the solution. Magic mushrooms rewired my mind in a way all those techniques could have in less than 6hrs. The mind is more complicated than mindfulness seeing a therapist etc and recommending it is misleading many people who need more serious help.

Im better of from the experience but a long way  to being perfect. Although it was great i still feel some what anxious more in the normal sense.

For me, 1) I had to unlearn things that I was brought up to believe we're truths but were actually choices, 2) to love myself and everyone else as imperfect beings who are beautiful for who I/they are, and 3) to let go of a lot of my expectations for myself and others. I usually got down when something happened a way different than I'd hoped or expected, or someone did something a different way than I'd wanted. I learned that getting down about those things doesn't make sense. People have their own ideas and motivation and will act based on that no matter what you want or say. The things I may want to be a certain way are often not in my control completely so instead find gratitude in what happens and what you have, and appreciate people for who they are, not who they should be.

That last part applies especially to yourself. You shouldn't be anything other than you and it's okay that the you right now may not make sense.

"I was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, fictitious disorder and bipolar nos. I think the bipolar part eventually dropped off because once I was properly medicated and stable there wasn't enough evidence to support it. That was a bummer because even though I knew it was the least significant diagnosis it was the one I liked to tell people who kinda needed to know (dentist, eye doctor etc.)because it has the least stigma attached. 

I think the fictitious disorder and the borderline are kind of intertwined with each other.  It is rare to have a fictitious disorder without also being borderline. I always considered myself to have munchausen's (NOT by proxy, because I made myself sick not others), but I guess the doctors decided that it wasn't quite that severe and only called it fictitious disorder. Both are mostly in remission. 

Before I went to the RCF, I was spending at least one week a month in the hospital. Either on the psych ward or the physical ward. If I was in the hospital for physical reasons, it was illnesses that I had caused myself. I didn't really fake being sick. Instead, I would actually make myself sick. I always had a well planned cover story. But, if I were found out, I would still be sick and would still require medical treatment. I even made myself septic once. 

Shortly before going to the RCF, I had a major breakdown (not that I wasn't already broken) and came clean about what I was doing to my one on one person in a partial program I was in. That of course opened up a whole new can of worms.  It led me to the nurse practitioner who recommended the specific RCF where I lived.  I met the best psychiatrist who was a whizz with meds. He looked and dressed like Danny Devito from Taxi and was just as comfortable doing maintenance work at the RCF as being a psychiatrist. Sadly, he retired several years ago. But, as long as my med regimen stays stable I should be fine. I just hope that somewhere down the road I don't get a doctor who wants to change things up because it's unorthodox. 

In addition to finding the right meds, I also worked with an awesome therapist who has also sadly retired. But, I like my current therapist a lot too.

For a lot of us, I think the issue is as much chemical as it is environmental. It‚Äôs possible that you‚Äôll never get over your depression, but that doesn‚Äôt mean your life is over. I have to be medicated or I start self-harming and thinking about suicide, and I can‚Äôt control my temper or emotional responses (I‚Äôm a crier). At some point, you may have to shift your focus from getting better to finding ways to live and be happy despite your chemical imbalances.

It gets better and it gets worse, but it‚Äôs never all over, no matter how much it feels like it is at times.

"I was walking past a banner encouraging people to sign up for organ donation, and I thought how much more 'efficient' life would be if there is a system in which people my age and older (I'm in my 30s), who are relatively healthy, who really have no further wish to stay alive, could die and donate our organs with the help of available medical technology.

Being in my 30s, one can't say I'm immature. Or that I haven't lived long enough to have a reasonable understanding of life, or myself. I am educated to postgraduate level, and I have worked in a job that is relatively challenging for a decade (though my work performance is dismal). Certainly I have given deep thought to the million little pieces that drove me to this state, and countless hours have been spent on thinking how to make things better. And I can only come to the conclusion that I would be miserable till the day I die. I would be useless to the world, save for the few members of my family that I remain alive for. And by that, most of the time I feel useless in helping them with their problems - what I have to offer is not enough, and I am not appreciated for the little that I offered. 

Meanwhile, if I could just die and donate my organs now, at least I would have done some actual good. I am fairly confident that most of my organs are in fairly good shape, and a few people would really benefit from being given a second chance in life. 

I am not suicidal. Not actively so, anyway. But I would undoubtedly be immensely grateful should any god or devil decide to take me and end my misery."	stranger38	post	31.69028423838993	male	White	0.9961206316947937	na	na	na	4	MadOver30	failed

"Have any of you ever struggled with ergophobia? I didn't know this was a thing until Googled  ""anxiety before work""...and that's literally what it is...I read the brief description and was like, holy fuck that is [part of] what's wrong with me and what keeps me home from work on more days than I'd like to admit.

When I wake up and think about the fact that I have to go to work, I have a panic attack at worst along with physical symptoms. There are some days that the anxiety is manageable enough to push through and out the door and through my 10 minute commute, and usually by the time I'm actually IN my office, the anxiety is gone/manageable. 

I know it's a totally irrational panic/anxiety thing, because I enjoy most parts of my job, and I don't have issues getting along with anyone there. But I've already taken a 2 month leave of absence for depression and anxiety this past Aug-mid October, and I've run out of intermittent FMLA hours, so now any days I take off are ADA protected, but not FMLA protected. I am planning on emailing my boss with an ""update"" this afternoon just to kinda let her in on what's going on and that I still plan on going in on Monday (even though I know this isn't expected or required from me, but the fact that I called in 2 days in a low leading up to the weekend never looks good).

I took yesterday and today off and only made this ""ergophobia"" discovery this morning, and I don't know why it took me many, many months to figure out that I struggle with this. Whether it's diagnosable by the DSM I don't know, but it sounds like from everything I read that exposure therapy and CBT are the two most helpful therapies for this.

Can anyone else relate to this? What helped you? And even if you've never experienced this before, do you have any tips for working through the total irrational anxiety of getting up, getting ready, and driving to a job you actually like?

Edit: Don't know if it's important to know that I have bipolar 2 rapid cycling, generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, ADHD (inattentive type), PTSD, and severe major depression.

"Hey, I just want to let you know that you're not alone. I've been battling substance use disorder and bipolar 2 for years as well. I went to inpatient rehab about three years ago. It seemed super scary as I pulled into the parking lot to check in, but you ease into it pretty quickly. You realize almost immediately that everyone there has pretty much been in your shoes, and you can all relate to each other. And whatever guilt or shame you're carrying, you don't need to worry about the counselors there passing judgment, because they've seen it all.

Rehab is truly a place where healing can start. Just don't get caught up in the conversations outside of group that start up sometimes about using. Some people like to play the one-up game, and it can lead to bad cravings. It's much better to just quietly excuse yourself and go somewhere else, either alone or with someone else who's truly there to recover.

Rehab seems scary because it's all unknown, but it can be a priceless opportunity for you. I'm proud of you for reaching out to ask for help for yourself. It can be the hardest step to take!

"*\[ I'll skip the part where they assessed me as ""open to discussions"" as in fact i've just stopped reacting to their shitty ideas and behaviors as it only gets me in trouble \]*

So basically they told me that ""i've seen happy lately"" and ""this is how they want me to behave"".

thing is i'm anxious and depressed and they know it. what i don't understand is how they can reconcile wanting me to be happy at work while also telling me it's okay to be in therapy. i've already informed them that i'm going thru different meds to find a medication that works for me which takes a huge toll on my mood. they KNOW this, yet they berate me if i'm in a bad mood.

they're both authoritarian (in a way) and can't stand conflict or differing opinions, so i feel kind of trapped in wanting to ""justify"" my situation. I feel like i definitely COULD, but this would require something like:  


1. the right mood in order to triangulate my feelings
2. the right perspective in order to know what's ""relevant"" to bring up
3. the right social knowhow in order to formulate a message which will actually be understood
   1. in the way i need it to....
      1. and to ellicit the right feelings/response in my managers

basically they seem to take other people's bad moods personally and very seriously (like it's an affront to their dignity that people are depressed in their vicinity...smh). how am i even supposed to get on a different medication now that i know i'm gonna get shit for not being in a pristine mood?

"This last weekend was miserable. I sat in front of the TV all day Saturday and Saturday, stoned on pot, HBO and takeout. My phone didn't ring once. I was in that terrible and weird depression fog at once comforting and suffocating.

Sunday I was standing in my living room and this nightmarish feeling came over me. I wanted to scream and laugh, and beat the walls and myself. It was the closest to lunacy I've ever come.
Seriously. I've been unhappy since I've formed memories, in depressive states lasting years and it was the worst I've ever felt in my life. Just terrifying.. and embarrassing. I'd never tell anyone I know how it felt. 

Since then, I keep thinking that winter has barely begin and I'm going to be trapped in this house, alone, while the world shuts down again.

Winter's the worst. This winter will probably be even more miserable for everyone than usual. Advice incoming: I'd personally recommend taking vitamin D supplements, that helps with the lack of sunlight. I've also heard good things about sun lamps, but I haven't tried it myself. Even when it's cold & miserable, I think taking a walk daily is a really useful thing to do. It gets you out of your house, you can kind of clear your mind & take in some new scenery. I'd also take a good think about whether the pot is really doing you any good or not. I used to be a stoner when I was younger, but eventually it really made my anxieties a lot worse, not to mention physical health, so it's worth at least experimenting with quitting it imo.

"So mentally, I feel like I have a decent handle on my anxiety these days. It doesn't hold me back, I can do what I need to do, if less well than I could without. I work fulltime, have a small handful of close friends, etc. 

But I feel tired and sick all the time. And more recently I've started developing hand and eye twitches. I got everything checked out by doctors, thyroid, vitamin levels, even had an endoscopy, and there's nothing physically wrong with me. I'm pretty sure it's anxiety.

When I was younger, this was... ok. I wasn't any definition of ""hale,"" but I was still young and that made up for a lot. Now I'm in my mid-30s and it's getting bad. I keep losing weight, I can't sleep sometimes but also can't make it through the day sometimes. There are mornings where I'm physically ill for hours and end up calling out of work. I can't eat sometimes.

And now the hand twitches, which are frustrating. And eye twitches, which are embarrassing.  

I try to work out, but it's growing increasingly difficult with the weight loss and exhaustion. I try to eat healthy, but I think I'm starting to get a complex around food because I feel like I never know what's going to set my stomach off. I cut out most caffeine, just the occasional green tea, and only drink alcohol once a week or less.

Is there any way to get past this? I tried medications for general depression and bipolar disorder in the past, but either they didn't do anything or they had bad side effects, so I'd rather not go back to those."		post	18.82321233366135	female	White	0.9980377554893494	na	na	na	13	MadOver30	failed
"I'm still wondering if this is a digestive issue - the neasea, weight loss, muscle spasms. Nausea is an anxiety symptom, weight loss is not unless you are actually eating less. Having you talked to a doctors specializing in digestive issues? 

I'm sorry you're dealing with this. Assuming it is anxiety -- I feel you. I don't have a ton of anxious thoughts anymore, but my anxiety isn't gone. It's just more physical now, post-ACT or CBT or whatever. Muscle tension, nausea, insomnia. 

Do you have any strategies for anxiety management? Do you know what makes you feel unsafe and also what makes you feel safe? 

Things I find somewhat helpful for physical anxiety include: warm clothing, warm drinks, weighted blanket, my cat, talking to a few friends I feel close with, distracting myself with soothing low-key TV and games, hot baths. I think all the heat related stuff helps relax muscles and reduce muscle tension. Stretching is also helpful with this. Listening to the irrational but non-harmful urges I have when it's intense. Like I was recently staying with someone who was ill and might need to go to the hospital at a moment's notice, and I didn't want to take off my daytime shirt for bed. I think so I'd feel more ready to leave if we needed to. So I just let myself sleep in my clothes because it made me feel more prepared and no harm done.

"One thing that doctors often dont test for is food intolerance. The symptoms you describe might be alleviated somewhat by eliminating problematic foods. Unfortunately the best way to achieve this (to test for it directly) is an elimination diet. Its not an easy thing to do but can provide long term QOL benefits if something comes up that your body reacts to (ie gluten, nightshades, processed sugars, certain fats, dairy, etc). 

I do sympathise. I have had long periods of brain fog and severe fatigue with no help at all from any of the doctors I saw (years of this). My wife has been bedridden for the last 4 months due to an illness thats been worsening for many years. Doctors were unable to diagnose it, and we received inaccurate advice along the way which made her situation worse.

"> weight loss is not unless you are actually eating less. 

So, some of this is a result of eating less... because my stomach hurts. Some of it is... not andyoureallydon'twanttoknowthedetails.

My endoscopy was through a GI doc. He also checked my pancreas and put me on a couple diets. So far, cutting out dairy is the only thing that's made a real difference, but I'm still far from well in that regard.

Yeah, post-CBT is how I would describe my anxiety as well. I don't really have any conscious methods- I compulsively list things and fidget, but other than that it's just been years of kicking myself in the butt and intentionally doing things that spiked my anxiety so I would be forced to get used to them (bipolar helped with that).

> Do you know what makes you feel unsafe and also what makes you feel safe? 

Not always? I guess I don't really think of it in terms of safety so much as comfort. Some of it's social. Sometimes, I stack stuff in front of the door at night because I've had my place broken into a couple times. But a lot of times, it seems random.

I have clonazepam at my disposal in case of panic attacks, zopiclone to sleep better (and thus lower the amount and strength of my anxiety / panic attacks), and also medical marijuana for anxiety and sleep. Now I've had the worst of days (in term of anxiety only, otherwise I'd have nothing to complain about), and I'm at the point where I need medication to calm me down.

I usually don't take cannabis when I'm in my most stressful day as in this state, it could worsen my condition. So this is a no go for tonight. But I'm torn between the two other options. Both would help me sleep in their own ways (reducing anxiety helps with sleep, and the other is a sleeping aid in itself), both would help me anxiety (one is an anxiolythic, the other would have me sleep through it).

Even my choice of medication is triggering anxiety! I want to feel good AND sleep, and I have to make a choice... And I can't. I'm afraid taking the clonazepam won't have me sleep the whole night, and taking the zopiclone will have me endure my raising anxiety to a point where I will not sleep even with the medication.

"Therapy is a really mixed bag - it can be very helpful, but it can also be useless or even the opposite of helpful. It all depends on finding the right therapist, and because ‚Äúright‚Äù is so individual it‚Äôs very hard to give you a checklist.

If you go for it, you want someone you can build trust with. (You don‚Äôt have to trust them with everything in the first five minutes, and for me, a therapist who complains that I build trust in my time rather than theirs is not someone I can work with.) You want someone you can open up to and someone you feel you eventually could tell anything to - even the dark, grim, or shameful stuff. (You don‚Äôt need to be able to do that right away, and again, someone who pushed me to do that before I was ready would be a dealbreaker.)

If you‚Äôre in a city, you should be able to find low-cost or sliding-scale therapy services in your area. I don‚Äôt know the rural situation, sorry! You‚Äôre right that the NHS doesn‚Äôt cover therapy, or at least it usually only offers short-term therapy. Most NHS therapy is cognitive behavioural therapy, which you may find helpful, then again you may not (I struggle to make CBT work for me).

"If you see those things as part of who you are, you can still change them if they don‚Äôt make you happy. 

I saw general therapists for years with some small successes here and there. Then I did cognitive behavioral therapy and it was one of the best choices I ever made. CBT also has a lot of science and research to support it, which is reassuring. 

There‚Äôs a book called Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy, by David D. Burns, which could be a low cost way for you to check CBT out. 

In theory you can do a lot of CBT on your own with just a CBT workbook, but I‚Äôve found it‚Äôs better for me to do it with a therapist. 

Whichever way you try it (if you do decide to try it), you have to do the writing work that goes along with it. It‚Äôs basically just journaling but there‚Äôs a recommended structure for it. If you just read the books and try to think things through in your head it probably won‚Äôt help. (I don‚Äôt know why that‚Äôs the case. Anecdotally, I know several people who have done CBT and without exception the people who don‚Äôt do the work don‚Äôt notice a difference, whereas everyone who does do the work says it‚Äôs made a worthwhile difference.) There are also helpful online communities if you don‚Äôt have a therapist. 

So that‚Äôs my long answer to your short question. Yes, therapy is worth it if you want to change, but not all therapies are equal, at least in my experience.

"Hey there!

First let me say that I am sorry you're feeling this way, it can feel very isolating and lonely. I do agree with Hotel\_Oblivion for sure. It can be extremely daunting to search for a therapist (and frankly some of them can suck) and then trust them enough to tell them very personal things. You can take as long as you want to tell them something- this is to benefit you, not them.

A little bit about me: I  felt the exact same way about a year ago (depressed, anxious, very low self-esteem, mood swings, and suicidal ideation) and I too thought this was just my personality and it was never going to get better. The thought of going through therapy and the possibility of it not working wasn't worth it to me (at the time), plus I couldn't even muster the mental motivation to search this stuff out. It finally got to the point where I literally couldn't take feeling that way, I wanted to die and the minute I opened my eyes in the morning it was already the worst day ever because I was awake.

Fast forward: I'm on medication (I was diagnosed with Bipolar II and ADHD), I go to DBT group therapy and have a personal therapist. I meditate, eat very well, get good sleep, exercise and do not isolate myself from my friends/family anymore. I stopped self-medicating (I smoked so much weed it wasn't even funny) and I have goals.  I am still working on myself of course and everyday isn't sunshine and rainbows, but I don't want to die anymore and I want to fight for myself. I wanted to change and I made the commitment to do so. It was hard as shit and I had to go through 3 different therapists until I found one that understood me. She's a DBT therapist and I found that's what works for me. But what was the alternative? Feeling awful everyday of my life? No thanks.

I don't mean to preach, but you can feel better and you don't have to live your life this way. This IS NOT how you are or your natural personality, but you do have to put the work in. Also, you're not wasting your therapist's time- this is their job. If it does feel like a waste of time to YOU (because you are what matters) at some point, move on to another therapist, but you do have to give them a chance and not just see them 3 times. The only time wasted is feeling this way for years.

I hope this helps- I just know what it's like and you don't deserve to feel like this even if you feel like you do."	Throwthetrashout_666	reply	na	na	na	0.009967662394046783	strong	strong	no	na	MadOver30	no prediction.

"Yes if you can find a good match. It doesn't have to be the best in the city and maybe the same guy that ""worked"" for one person will not work the same way with you. I've been on more than a dozen different therapists and now I'm not seeing anyone because it feels like a luxury to me now.

A few of of them are actually pretty great from the first session and other ones will take MONTHS to begin helping you (specially psychoanalysis).

"I've just ""graduated"" from therapy a month ago and I think it's worth it, if you're willing to be honest and figure out what works for you.

I've done CBT in the past but not found it helpful- I understand the principles, but found that trying to logic my way out of bad feelings made me spiral into guilt for not having things figured out and then feeling worse because this is a good system that works for so many people and why isn't it working for me obviously I'm broken, etc. 

EMDR is what I found as my ""best fit"". Also research based, proven results, but it suits me better. A really decent introductory text is ""Getting Past Your Past"" by Francine Shapiro. Despite the cheesey self help title, it explains the theory in a way that's accessible, gives some exercises and gives you an idea of what you might expect from an EMDR therapist.

I think gathering books and information might be a good first step for you, especially since the stress of spending Big Money on a therapist is hard to justify when you're already struggling (or it was for me- no regrets now that I'm on the other side of it, but I remember how hard it was to commit the money!)"

"It can absolutely be helpful, and if you are feeling the way you described I would def suggest following through with it. However, it can vary with different therapists. Some are more helpful than others and some are garbage. 

I‚Äôm 31, and have been to therapists at several points in my life starting at age 14. I saw one a handful of times st that age til i convinced my mom not to make me go. Then I saw someone in my early 20s for about a year. Then i tried again when i was in my late 20s but struggled to find one i found helpful at that time (i had no health insurance from age 18-29) so i tried like 2-3 therapists/psychiatrists and just stopped going. Then, finally, I have excellent health insurance through my job. 

Once i got health coverage i knew it was time to get serious about my mental health. Since about age 22 i started show mote and more symptoms of bipolar disorder, thats when i had my first massive depressive episode that lasted 5-6 months straight. Thats when i saw one therapist for a while, and at that point i was only diagnosed with severe depression. At around age 24 i had my first serious Manic phase, also lasting several months. That was a new feeling and i really started to notice that i just didnt feel like i was normal and really started looking into things, but only online bc of my lack of health coverage... so i really couldnt do anything about it. I had owed the clinic money from when i was going to therapy years before so i was at a loss. 

Then when i got insurance at 29 i started seeing a psychiatrist bc i knew that i was most likely bipolar or had borderline personality, and i needed help. At some point after i was diagnosed with bad depression i was also diagnosed with panic disorder and anxiety disorder..not sure when though. So once i shared everything with my new psychiatrist she had an idea that i had either bipolar or bpd and we tried one last anti depressant to see how i reacted. I responded the same way i did to the last 6 or so antidepressants i had previously tried over the years. I was ‚Äúrapid cycling‚Äù which is how people with bipolar tend to respond to an SSRI (anti depressant). Basically my high highs would bounce to low lows and back and forth between the two with almost no time of normalcy, and it‚Äôs extremely exhausting. So finally, i was properly diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and started the journey of balancing my medications and finding what works. 

As for how helpful the actual therapy sessions are, it varies. I‚Äôve seen a handful of therapists over the last 15 years or so, and out of the 5 (i think 5 for just talk therapy) i have found 2 helpful. The lady i saw in my early 20s was very helpful but at that time it was too early to tell it was bipolar bc i wasnt showing manic symptoms yet or the extreme anxiety/panic disorder, so she was as helpful as she could be at the time. The other helpful one is now, and she is an amazing therapist. I have been seeing my current one since my diagnosis as well, so it will be two years next month. I see my therapist for CBT, which is cognitive behavior therapy, about once every two weeks when my appointments allow it, sometimes 3 weeks between. Then i see my Psychiatrist once every month or two months just to check in and make sure everything is fine with my medications and that they‚Äôre still working. Each person is different and their needs from a therapist might basically be the same, but the way they get there differs from one patient to another. You might need a stern therapist to guide you and another person needs a sweet, softer person. I suggest checking reviews for therapists in your area. 

In the end therapy can be extremely helpful and overall i highly recommend it for anyone thats thinking they might want to give it a try. In my experience, anyone that is thinking about seeing someone should probably see someone. If you yourself are thinking ‚Äúhey i should look into that, i really am not feeling okay‚Äù thats your first step really. You absolutely do not have to have a mental illness to have a good reason to talk to a professional. Think of therapy as a tool. When you feel that you could use some extra insight, or help working things out in life, utilize that tool. Life is no straight line, it‚Äôs highs and lows, for everyone. So when you are feeling low and have a lot of high stress things going on in your life, you might need to check in with a therapist to help assist you on maintaining the best mental health during a time that you have a lot going on. Covid has created an umbrella of tough scenarios going on from person to person, it‚Äôs not just effecting one thing, so it has a lot of people seeking therapy that never have. As your life becomes harder to manage, they can really help you maintain a level head during your low times. Therapy is great bc it gives you a better chance at working things out just by saying them out loud. Therapists are generally great at making your feelings feel justified and explaining why you are feeling that way and making a plan to help you shift things to feel better. Some of the things you discuss might seem silly or you just might be thinking ‚Äúi don‚Äôt know if this is even helping, feels like a waste‚Äù and will only realize later down the road that it was truly helping. Anyway, the therapist will judge how often they would like to see you, based on how you are doing and why you are there. As your life and your emotions become more level they might start spacing out your sessions more and more, til you eventually will be back at a point in life where you no longer feel you need to use that ‚Äútool‚Äù and you may only check in once every few-6 months or just be done with it for a while completely while you have a hold on  everything. You may never go back again, or you might return once life gets a little down again. 

In the end, you really get out of it what you put into it. I don‚Äôt mean day one you have to spill everything to them, but you have to want to be helped. You will be eased in anyway bc of all the paperwork and stuff, first appointments are usually just answering simple questions as the therapists types them out. Some days you might feel like you can‚Äôt even talk and have nothing to say to end up talking the whole tome and running over your time. Some days you might have so much going on that you think you‚Äôre going to talk so much and you end up being withdrawn and not saying much. Thats all a part of it though...

I obviously could ho on forever on this subject, but if you have any more questions about what actual sessions are like, how long til i felt better, or any other questions please feel free to DM me and ill do my best to help you.

"Yeah, that's tricky. :( Do you think you could be honest about your difficulty being honest? One approach might be to say upfront: I'm really worried that I won't be able to open up and that will make it hard to make progress. Or: I'm worried that I won't be able to be honest with you.

If you can, the right therapist for you will be able to say ""okay, I can work with that"". You might end up with the first few sessions (or months) being nothing but talking superficially about your day, or talking about what you thought of the book you're reading/TV show you're bingeing/music you're listening to, while you build up the trust required to go deeper.

Got the ebook on my phone now and whenever I feel anxiety or stress I open up some of my bookmarked sections and it honestly helps so much to read through.

"I'm 37 and living with bipolar disorder. Up until a year and a half ago, I worked stable office jobs. I switched positions in January of 2019 and the new job was a terrible fit. I left five months later without notice. It was a relatively high-paying job. I then worked as a baker for a month before getting an entry-level trade job in September 2019. 

The trade job has been a struggle. I switched to working with my hands because I thought it would make me happier. I can't tell that I'm any happier than I was when I was working my high-paying job and now I'm working at poverty wages. I can't tell if I screwed myself, or I'm just incapable of feeling happiness. I feel scared and stuck. I think: Should I go back to school? Am I even capable of committing to that? Every single day is a struggle just to exist.

"I am close to several people with bipolar disorder. I liken their struggle to that of Sisyphus; pushing his rock up the hill, only to have it roll down, forever. I suppose the only true way to get through the bad times is by taking pride in the struggle.  Know that you are important by just existing. It has taken all the parts of you almost 14 billion years to be where they are now, so no intention toward positive progression can be wrong. Personally I wake up, exist, and repeat most of the time, and that's fine too. I've known a hand full of people in my life that ""had it all figured out"" and they were miserable too.

Wow, I'm 41 and was just diagnosed with bipolar 2. I started Invega yesterday. I also had a high paying finance job that I quit quite impulsively in 2015 to become a therapist. I flamed out repeatedly in grad school, eventually needing to do inpatient for suicidality in 2018. I haven't had a job since as I believed I was taking time to move through and heal from a lot of childhood trauma. Fortunately, I'm in good financial shape but I've been petrified of moving forward with my life (indecisiveness, fear of imaginary audience). Finally, my therapist made the case for me being BP2 and it made perfect sense.  I'm quite relieved by the BP2 diagnosis and hoping the meds plus acceptance of my condition and my behavior while white knuckling it will enable to move forward eventually. But damn, I feel your struggle and would love to support you in any way I can. When were you diagnosed? Are you 1 or 2?

I personally don't think there's anything inherently wrong with only staying at a job for a short time, especially nowadays when companies show zero loyalty to their workers, so just remember that even though you're at where you are now, at any time you could apply for jobs similar to your previous ones, or something completely different. Also, if you are truly incapable of working, Idk the logistics although maybe others on here do, you can try applying for disability, if you go that route maybe try to find a couselor or mentor of some sort who can guide you through the process, since I've heard it can be complicated.

"Hey friend, I was going to make my own small victory post, but I saw your post and figured it might be more useful here. Maybe not, but it's worth a shot. This is gonna be long, I'm sorry, I'll try to edit it down, but I'm naturally chatty.

I'm 34 with Bipolar2 and generalized anxiety. I was on Zoloft since January but once I got the right diagnosis I started on Lamictal. That seems to help *quite a bit* so far, along with understanding my self-destructive and sabotaging behavior. One of those was getting addicted to heroin and crack. I've been working on recovery for almost two years but continue to struggle. I'm on medication and do therapy twice a week to work through old trauma that echoes still today. 

To cope, I grasped at straws, hoping *ANYTHING* would work. I'd try something for a few days and then quit. So my therapist and I decided to pick one skill and just focus on that. I committed to meditate every day for any length of time, doesn't matter as long as it's honest effort. I downloaded InsightTimer (best free meditation app IMO, 60,000+ free guided meditations) and made two calendar appointments in my phone every day (noon reminder to meditate, 7PM reminder to make sure I meditated). I've been doing that for about a month, and it's been a *really* positive change.  That's my first small victory: I'm keeping up with something that's healthy for me. 

I also started IOP (intensive outpatient) therapy over Zoom. I go for addiction, but mental health groups exist too. The community support and perspective of the group is precious. It's three hours a day M-Th so you start to feel safe quick. You can talk about daily struggles rather than trying to cram them all into one hour a week. That's my second small victory.

Combining these two strategies (mindfulness and support/community) has been a magic elixir of life. I've made more progress in the last month toward self-forgiveness than over my LIFETIME. I'm learning to combat my inner critic that tells me I'm stupid and a fuck up. It's truly the best I've ever felt. 

I don't know if or how this might help you, but this is how I'm surviving. I'm just learning how to function, not high-functioning yet, but I'll get there. I encourage you to embrace medication. Seek a therapist you really connect wiith; look for someone you respect and trust to give good guidance and that you feel safe disagreeing with. Expand your support community with others fighting similar fights. I can't answer how to feel okay about the lifelong struggle, but I understand it. It's like the Greek myth of Sisyphus. He was a shitty king, so Zeus made him forever push a boulder uphill, and whenever he's close to the top the boulder rolls back down the hill. Forever. That's what life feels like sometimes, I know, but we're all pushing the same boulder. It's a helluva lot easier to push that boulder forever with people by your side to commiserate -- people who will take on a little extra weight when you need a break.

I think that's all I have to say for now. I apologize again for the essay. If you ever need someone to talk to about the boulder, please DM me, seriously. We can talk and push together. 

I hope you're feeling a bit better today. I hope that you found something useful in my reply. I hope your weekend is peaceful and comforting. Sending you love and all the good vibes."	PsoriaPsthrowaway	reply	na	na	na	0.9987402558326721	strong	no	no	na	MadOver30	failed

First, I'm very glad you're in recovery and are aggressively pursuing therapy and medication treatment. That's no small accomplishment.

I have a doctor's appointment in three weeks.

Is your Zoom therapy part of a facility, or is it something else? For me, finances and general accessibility (working treatment around my work schedule) are standing in the way of therapy.

"I‚Äôve got CPTSD and all the attendant comorbidities like anxiety and depression. My whole adult life I‚Äôve struggled to work, finding that I only have the resources to work part time and even then there‚Äôs nothing left over for taking care of the house, myself, my elderly father. We‚Äôre at the poverty line, have been in spitting distance of losing our house for a decade, and the only thing that‚Äôs changed wrt my mental status is the diagnosis.

Then: COVID. I know so many people are suffering, but the last six months have been awesome for me. I‚Äôm working from home, I never socialize anyway, and I‚Äôm actually saving money for like the first time ever. We got an all new set of tires on the car, after years of having to fill the old ones with air like monthly because they would just go flat. I‚Äôve learned a couple of basic recipes so our diets have marginally improved. I‚Äôve had time and energy to have hobbies and be creative and fix things around the house. 

It‚Äôs hasn‚Äôt all been wonderful ‚Äî I can‚Äôt really leave the house without panicking. I dissociate in the grocery store now, when grocery shopping used to be my favorite thing in the world. I‚Äôm having an especially hard time sleeping. My self care has not improved, and not leaving the house means I can get away with doing even less. But overall I‚Äôd say life has improved. 

Well, of course that had to change. My workplace is going back to in-person in two weeks, but lucky me, I‚Äôve been called in starting Tuesday. They gave us a week to submit paperwork for an ADA accommodation, which is a bullshit deadline that they claim is ‚Äúquantitative‚Äù so they can measure how many people would be able to come back. But there‚Äôs only one person in the organization who can process the requests, so she‚Äôs looking at possibly 300 requests that she‚Äôs supposed to process in the next two weeks, and mine is buried somewhere in the middle. She‚Äôs not answering he email or phone, and I don‚Äôt blame her. I think what they‚Äôre really doing is trying to create a bottleneck to force people to work or quit. 

So, I‚Äôm fucked. I have played my mental illness close to the vest, so there‚Äôs nothing on record of me needing any accommodations. I have to go to work in person starting fucking Tuesday and I can‚Äôt! I can‚Äôt do it. I‚Äôm in no shape. It was a struggle before, and now there‚Äôs just so fucking way. My union says I should use my sick time to gain some time so she can process my request, which I guess I‚Äôm going to do but it‚Äôs awfully transparent. I guess I‚Äôm going to be using that time to look for another job. Suddenly the the small amount of money I managed to save seems really inadequate. 

My therapist wants me to consider disability, and that just doesn‚Äôt seem like a solution, certainly not for this immediate problem. But even if I made it through the years long process of getting on it, disability would just cement all the problems that poverty exacerbates.

""Inform your employer that returning to work violates the Governor‚Äôs Executive Orders and that you will be working from home so you do not violate the Governor‚Äôs orders.""

""As long as it was reasonable to quit, you would likely remain eligible for unemployment insurance benefits.""

I've been working through the lockdown with a company that threatened to fire people for reporting Covid-19 violations to our hiring firm, but eventually they made concessions (but even months later, workers still don't know how to wear masks correctly). My region is considered low risk, so that's fine for now.

The solution to employers who don't care about worker health is always to go somewhere else, but meanwhile, have a look and see if local services can give you advice on your particular situation.

If you do look for another job, employers are conducting video and phone interviews more often. I had one interview via a web app service, which required some familiarity to use with confidence. You might want to see what applying for a better job will look like:

And they worked with psych a bit. Eventually I was prescribed wellbutrin and seraquel. Ob was happy with the med choice as it was relatively safe for the baby. 
My second pregnancy I was a meds. The meds from before just were not working. I ended up in the hospital for a couple days and got refered to another psych. That psych had a better understanding of mi and pregnancy. I was prescribed klonopin again. He said it was better to save me and therefore my baby. I was not suicidal just having serious issues.

Titrating slowly is always a good idea and finding a support group (another poster mentioned) is spot on. They can help you more with specifics. 

If you need to you can switch to a med that is safer for pregnancy (I think zoloft was the popular option for a while but I'm not sure). 

IIRC First trimester is the most important here, as the baby gets bigger I think it affects them less. Again double check that just to be sure.

"For the last couple of months, we‚Äôve woken up at least 4 times to find one of the bags of bread torn into and at least 1/4 of the loaf demolished side on. It looks like an animal has been at the bread bag. 

We thought it was a mouse despite no droppings, and bought traps (humane) but didn‚Äôt catch anything. Eventually we invested in a bread bin. 

Last night, my wife and youngest son were away. So just me and my eldest at home. Bread was in the bread bin. And when my wife returned this afternoon, she saw that the brown bread bag was indeed torn into and shit tons of bread eaten side on. 

It‚Äôs either me or my son. 

It could be either. My son has had to deal with lockdown, not seeing friends, having a new brother born, and going to a new preschool and then actual school. So lots going on. 

But it could be me. I lost my job in July, rolled my ankle badly in August which stopped me running, supported my wife after she lost her mum, aunt, uncle, cousin, and two close friends, as well as a family friend, all in 10 months, and supported her during having a second child whilst also looking after our eldest. 

I feel like I‚Äôm going utterly mental. About 4 weeks ago, I started getting a pain under my right rib. I was concerned it might be gallstones or inflammation. But it comes and goes and could just be gas. But I get it every fucking year so it could be seasonal.

OP: certain sleep medications can cause sleep walking and sleep eating. I know because I sleep eat and it's definitely from my sleeping pill prescription. I tend to go for bread, crackers, dry desserts like tarts and squares. It took a few months to figure it out.

"I had this kind of reflexion (just from a different starting point, but that's not really relevant) with my therapist only last thursday. She ended up agreeing with me on what she called ""a really not popular opinion amongst her colleague"": keeping the ""option"" open for some might just be beneficial because it gives them control in a (personnal) world where they lost any sense of control. It's for some the ultimate display of freedom of choice, and yeah, it's kind of empowering.

I believe what you describe here is something akin to that. Lurking in circles about suicide keeps you in the real about it, makes it familiar... And it's easier to control something you know than something you don't !

In that view, I think what you are experiencing is really sane. Not for everyone, sure. But if it works for you ? Why not ! I also think you are the kind of people that are really aware of their own self and *potential* self destructive power, which makes me say that you going in those groups is perfectly ok.

"\[I don't think I need a trigger warning for anything--I briefly mention substance abuse and domestic abuse just in passing.\]

I'll start on a high note: after several years of battling alcohol dependence and undiagnosed CPTSD following a 7-year abusive relationship, I'm now 1.5 years sober and got my Associate's degree at the age of 35! I found that having academic goals (despite my unclear career goals) was really beneficial to my mental & emotional health and helped me stay sober.

The reason I decided to post here, though, was that I just need some support right now. I decided to keep pursuing my education and am now in my first semester at state university, and I've hit a big speed bump. We are about halfway through the semester now. I got off to a great start, but about 3 weeks ago I just...started to fall apart.  I'm in four classes right now. Two of them I'm doing great in, but thanks to mental and physical exhaustion, I have missed several assignments in the other two classes. Nothing huge, just those little daily things that tend to add up, you know?

I'm sure I am not so far gone that I can't pull myself out of this. I may not get the A grade I was going for, but I'm trying to stay realistic. The problem is really that it triggered major avoidant behaviors and catastrophic thinking that 1. Make the initial problem worse and harder to solve and 2. Put me in a really dark place mentally. For some reason, today is a ""good"" day: it's just a little easier to overcome the avoidance and start to work on making progress again. I decided that maybe the first thing I should do is reach out to the professors in question and let them know about my problems without going into my life story.

I just have so much dread and shame about it, though. It feels like a cop-out, and words like ""anxiety"" and ""depression,"" while applicable, just don't seem to convey how debilitating those things can be. I also hate to talk about PTSD because of stigma and association with the military. On top of that, everything is virtual this semester, so I have very little personal connection with these professors...it's just so different from my tiny community college.

I know I just need to do it. But can anyone here relate? If you've been in a similar position (or if you're a professor), any tips on how to avoid sounding like I'm just making excuses or looking for special treatment? My main objective is just to connect with the professors personally and maybe get some reassurance that I haven't destroyed my academic future so that I can overcome the avoidant behavior. If you've read this wall of text, thank you! I will read all responses and reply when I'm able, but it might be a while since I have a lot to do tonight and tomorrow."

"You are absolutely describing my entire time at university (except that I was in my 20s). It's so difficult and devastating - I couldn't explain why I couldn't do those things and I was still half a decade away from any sort of diagnosis or treatment for my mental health issues, I just knew I couldn't do it and I got stuck in a shame spiral.

This was... quite a while ago now, but even though they aren't great now, universities have really made steps to improve the supports that students have. (I actually went into working in student life at universities because of how bad my experience was, and I am trying to do my best to improve the experience for students.)

My advice is this: almost all of the supports available to you will work better and easier the earlier you tap into them, and the more proactive you are. (This is really unfair, because these are precisely the hardest things for people suffering from mental health issues to do!)

What this means practically is: talk to your professors now, if you feel up to it. You could maybe just lead the conversation with the fact that you are really struggling with the shift online and the transition to the state university. This is true for a lot of people and your prof may be more or less sympathetic, but a lot (some?) profs will be willing to work with you. Pretty much every professor I've met has also been way more willing to work with you if you let them know about issues before the due dates rather than after, so maybe talk about what they would like to see for you to get back on track.

Next, there should be some supports though your university's equivalent of Student Wellness - they can help get you in touch with therapists / supports if you don't have any and might be able to direct you regarding how to get your current supports connected into the university system.

If you are talking about recognized disabilities / accommodations (like PTSD etc.) you can also connect with a similar department to accessibility and/or learning services. The way this works in most places is that they can handle all your paperwork and medical info and help you set up any accommodations that you might need. One of the benefits of this is that you don't have to prove everything that is happening with you to every prof. but have a pre-approved list of accommodations that have been verified that you can set up with each prof. It's good to have this stuff in place before things get really difficult. This office can also often set you up with additional supports that your university has such as coaches, peer support groups or even classes (often run through the library) about skills you might find useful.

Depending on how your university is organized, you will probably also have an academic advisor through your faculty or college or similar. This person will be able to support you if you need to change courses or reduce your course load etc. They also may be a good resource to get you connected with the correct people if you are having trouble finding them at your university.

I don't know if any of this is applicable or even new information for you, but I'm always happy to chat about navigating universities - and how hard it is to be a student with mental health struggles."	WoodsWytch	reply	na	na	na	0.9936259984970093	weak	strong	no	na	MadOver30	no prediction.
"As a prof, I can tell you not to worry about talking to your professors. They have encountered all of this before and it is not going to give them pause (nor do you have to get personal). In fact, I'd bet that they have experienced issues like this themselves at some point in their career. 

The important thing is being upfront about things. Ask for what you need specifically (this can be hard). But really, just keep them in the loop. They will probably ask you how they can support you and help you to be successful. Tell them what you need."	WoodsWytch	reply	na	na	na	0.9936259984970093	weak	no	no	na	MadOver30	no prediction.
"So, it took me eight years to get a four year degree because I was in and out of the psych ward and in and out of school. I was on disability at the end of my schooling, and that meant I was entitled to 'reasonable accommodations'. You may also qualify even if you aren't on disability. No one was entirely sure what accommodations were appropriate for mental illness, but I think being excused from class if I were in the hospital and sometimes having extra time for assignments seemed reasonable. Also, being allowed to drop classes after the deadline because of stress came up.

In order to get my accommodations, I had to register with the disability office on campus and provide a letter from my psychiatrist explaining my disability. My psychiatrist was great at writing a letter. She had to be careful because she didn't want to tell them any more than they absolutely needed to know. She also didn't want to give them access to my medical records which were none of their business. 

Because I asked for accommodations and had a letter on file, I could go to my professors when I was struggling and get extra help or time etc. If I hadn't registered my disability they would not have needed to accommodate me and some of the professors who were very strict about policy probably wouldn't have because it wouldn't have been fair to the other students. I had friends with similar problems who were denied extra time etc. from professors who accommodated me because they didn't register their disability. 

Definitely talk to your professors. See if they can do anything for you and if they are willing to do anything for you. If they say school policy won't allow them to make an exception for you, then look at what kind of services/accommodations your school has for people with disabilities and register there. Maybe dropping the classes you are behind in is a solution if you can't catch up.  But, catching up if possible is probably better. Best of luck with everything!"

I know that my school has support services, and that is something I have thought about looking into, just to see what help they may have. First, though, I'm gonna work on getting back on my feet.

"Gah ... I just dont. ... unless I meet and get to know someone pretty well, and even then its only if I think they can handle it - and its relevant to the relationship for them to know. I might start to feel safer talking to them if, for example, if they have personal or family experience or whatever and arent likely to completely misinterpret everything I say.

Other than that I stay schtumm. I have family members I just dont discuss it with except in very vague and general terms. Mostly its not worth it.

I would say vague and general terms - and only if necessary - are often fine for whatever purpose. Specifics though, they can get really tricky.

&#x200B;

It occurs to me that if a person has cancer, or any other extended serious illness, everyone rallies around them and people will ALWAYS check in, ask how things are going, want to know if there is anything they can do to help, etc. People follow the trajectory of the thing. They want to make sure the person isnt getting worse, isnt suffering too much, want to help if they are.

&#x200B;

With mental illness though - maybe its just me and mine - but no one ever asks. I might have had the week from hell - without going into all the gory details - most people reading this here would understand the shit I am talking about - and then I see people at the end of that week and .... nothing. 

Theres no language or relationship aspect there that bridges the stigma.

N*o one ever asks how I am going.*  

This is one of the hardest things I think about having a mental illness - you do it pretty much on your own - compared, at least, to the sort of support people immediately offer their near & dear who have 'real' health issues.

"Hi ... to give some background, I'm a 46-year-old guy, married with a couple of kids. For most of my life I've struggled with social anxiety. A few years ago I got on a medication that has pretty much freed me of this anxiety. Before then, I'd been on numerous other medications over about 20 years, none of which helped much.

I get depressed, too, but I'd always believed my depression was a result of living with anxiety and the constraints it put on my life. I thought that once the social anxiety was sorted out, I'd be OK.

But lately, although my anxiety is under control and I have no problem being around people and talking to them, I've been feeling increasingly depressed.

I can't get over the feeling that life is meaningless, that nothing matters, and that therefore there's no point to anything. Some of this is down to my upbringing  ... my dad has always been of the belief that you live, do what you do, then die, and that's it. He's always scorned the concept of religion, an afterlife etc.

I work in a menial, brainless job, but I've never had the drive or motivation to aim for anything better. I've drifted from job to job, taking whatever came my way. Totally directionless. I always put that down to my social anxiety, which led me to avoid anything that provoked feelings of pain and self-hate.

But now, although I'm free of anxiety, I still have no motivation to do anything with my life. Work is slowly driving me crazy, but I keep plodding on, doing it.

Maybe the mindset I developed over the years has become ingrained, so on some level I'm afraid of trying anything else in case I fail. I just don't know.

My way of coping when the feelings of hopelessness become too much is to engage in risk-taking, reckless behaviour. Then I feel alive and forget myself, my life, the pointlessness of it all. But it's a short-lived escape, more a temporary distraction, and eventually the cycle repeats. 

My therapist says I should look at some kind of study, something not necessarily job-focused, but more to engage my mind. But I can't see how that would help, it all feels so pointless.

I know I must sound like my own worst enemy, that I'm never satisfied. I can see the road I'm taking leads nowhere, except maybe to disaster, but I feel powerless to do anything else. It feels like stuff just happens to me, and that I have no power to change any of it.

When it comes doen to it, we're born, we muddle along for a while, then we snuff it. From that perspective, how can any of it matter? Why bother?

For those who took the time to read all of that ... thanks :) I'm not looking for answers. Maybe more hoping that I'm not the only one out there feeling like this."	spane_44	post	31.25101682012263	male	White	0.9985470175743103	na	na	na	52	MadOver30	failed
"I know this may well be unpopular here, but here goes nothing.

It sounds very much like the main cause of your issue is caused by Capitalism's total disregard for human life and needs. And it's not uncommon. There are plenty of studies out there that are showing the isolation and the disconnection from the way we would naturally live.

What has helped me is to start thinking of what role I would like to have in a community if not for Capitalism and then start working toward being able to fulfill that role. Really make it the focal point of your life instead of your job.

For me that's been cooking and gardening.

Hey. Same issues, except my dad was religious and full of judgment and bs about it. Not to downplay how you feel, but religion done wrong brings a lot of crap into people's lives.

I dunno. I think it's true for the most part, life being meaningless and pointless. I don't know what to do about it either. I stay alive because of a handful of friends and my cats making me feel guilty, not because I actually want to be alive. No offense meant, but it's also why I didn't have kids. I just don't get it, you know? 

I know a lot of people are saying get involved, but well... I've worked in education and community services for most of my career. It's pretty depressing, seeing people day in and day out that you know aren't going to really ever be better. Some of the young people give me hope, but there are older folks that just... nothing's ever going to change for them. 

I do monthly park cleanups too- turns out a month later the park is dirty all over again. At least the animal shelter I help out with is nice. It's no-kill and conversely Covid has been a boon for animal adoptions. But in general I don't know why I keep doing it.

My problem is that doing what I want leads me into strife. I'm artistic, creative. I like to paint colourful artwork using spray cans. 

But for some reason, I'm compelled to paint on walls where such embellishments are, shall, we say, not permitted.

I've tried painting in places where graffiti is allowed, or at least tolerated. I found it boring, dead.

I suppose I get off on the risk. Controlling my fear and urge to leave, and creating something that looks good in daylight the next morning.

It's a cycle ... I gradually spiral down into hopelessness and despair, the urge to paint builds, I eventually give in to it and I feel good. For a while.

I'm also a regular gym-goer, but Covid has put paid to that for the time being. I'm missing the mood lift intense exercise gives.

"Hey, thanks for sharing. It's a difficult mindset to find a way out of. As someone here commented, it seems more something you learn to live with. I don't see how you can ""think"" your way out.

No offence taken about the kid thing. To he honest, I feel similarly. I didn't want children; it wasn't something I'd ever felt the need for, or given much thought at all. But to my wife it was the logical next step after we got married. So I gave in and went along with the flow ... as is the norm for me lol.

It's the story of my life ... drifting along. No conscious choice or direction. I've never known what I want to do, so I've done whatever has come my way. Anything ... some jobs better than others.

It all feels predetermined, that I'm powerless to exert any control or choose my path. When I hear about people's careers and ""five-year plans"" etc., I'm mystified. I can't imagine being like that.

So I respect you for choosing your own path in life. Doing your bit, making a difference. I hear you about it being depressing at times. But imagine doing a job that really means nothing to you, day after day of mindless drudgery.

I've often thought I'd like to do something that involves helping people, such as working with the homeless, or on a needle exchange program, along those lines. But I can't take the first step; something holds me back. Fear, maybe? Fear of failure? I don't know. It's buried deep within me.

It's hard to explain, but I feel powerless to change anything, like things just happen to me of their own accord. Maybe that's partly those ingrained habits learnt when anxiety had me in its grip, a kind of learned powerlessness, ""what will happen will happen, regardless"" way of thinking.

Yep. People who don't, generally, question the meaningless of life will never make much sense to me. I see it in all the mundane tasks. Women getting their nails done, people who garden, people who care about their fancy cars, buying useless decor for their home... just random stuff will remind me of the futility of life.

The whole picture (and I say this as someone with adhd and who has done a ton of research on the subject to try and understand the condition and better myself), namely feeling chronically unmotivated, holding menial jobs, still feeling unmotivated even after treating depression and anxiety. It just struck a chord with me. Of course I‚Äôm not a doctor and no one can diagnose you over the internet, but I‚Äôd definitely explore the possibility further. Start by maybe watching some videos my Russell Barkley, he‚Äôs awesome. Then maybe schedule a meeting with an adhd specialist if you still think you might have it. I wouldn‚Äôt worry about your depression meds, thats getting ahead of yourself and plus you can always get off of them before trying stims (if you do have adhd comorbid anxiety and depression tend to be drastically reduced with proper treatment).	spane_44	reply	na	na	na	0.9985470175743103	no	strong	no	na	MadOver30	no prediction.

"Haha well, I'm a woman so having kids would've been a bit more of an event for me. And uh... no thanks.

I often feel like a drifter myself. I've moved countless times, been in and out of relationships, change jobs every couple years. I told myself I'd stick out where I am now for 3 years, which Covid is helping with, ironically, but that old itch is still there. *I'm bored. This isn't right. This can't be it.* 

Even my relationship is starting to go stale again and honestly if this doesn't work out, I think I'm just going to stop trying. It's too painful.

Maybe for me, it's boredom more than fear. Or a fear of commitment? I don't know. I do know the mental health establishment is all but useless when it comes to treating anhedonia. That's been my experience, at least. 

I worked tedious jobs in the past before I'd finished school (retail~), and yeah. I get it. It's bad.

Whenever I hear 5 year plans, I think of Communist China, which always makes me laugh a little. I'm baffled by the idea too, but at least I find some morbid humor in it these days.

Well, if you do want to help, libraries are pretty low-key and usually need shelvers. You could try there, maybe even apply as a paige for some extra cash. Not sure if they're taking anyone right now though. 

Park cleaning I can just sign up whenever I'm available, no pressure. And the animal shelter is a 2~3 hour shift every 2 weeks where I just clean up after and play with cats.

"Perhaps it's just our perception, and everyone has these thoughts, or similar. I don't know. My therapist has said that being a deep thinker brings its own  problems, this kind of depression being one.

My wife and I are barely civil to each other these days, partly because of my lack of motivation/ambition. She has a job she hates, but feels she has no choice but to do it because my job is low-paid and not the most secure. She says she can see the potential in me and is frustrated by my acceptance of my situation and inaction.

I don't talk about all this depression stuff with her. My mental difficulties are kind of a no-go zone between us; she doesn't like to enter emotional territory. I suspect that (although she wouldn't admit it) she doesn't quite accept that depression is a ""thing"" ... she sees it as a self-indulgent luxury. I should man up, do what needs to be done.

I get the impression that family, i.e. the kids and her extended family, are what life is all about for her. I feel guilty that those things aren't enough for me.

I'm working as a cleaner at the moment. During Covid, for part of my day I'm wandering round a place wiping high-touch areas, such as door handles, sinks and so on. I try to squeeze a shred of satisfaction from the job, doing my best, getting the place as clean as I can. Removing a stain or mark that's been there for years is the highlight of my shift.

I have a fear of wasting my life, of waking up one day and realising it's too late to do anything about it. But I seem to be doing my best to head down that path. 

I apologise if all this sounds like a ""poor me"" kind of rant. I'm aware that I'm a big part of the problem here, if not all of it. It's just I can't see a way out, or more specifically a way forward. 

I haven't got the balls to kill myself, and obviously I know the effect that would have on the kids. So I just keep plodding on.

So you've tried to explain the way you feel to your family? It can be difficult for people to understand. My wife tends to take everything I say personally. My saying I'm depressed makes her feel to blame, that being married to her is the cause. So I don't talk about it any more.

Unfortunately, that's labelled as a lack of ambition, avoidance or laziness in this society where it's drummed into us to always have plans and seek promotion, a better job, more money and so on.

In a way I feel broken in some way because I don't hold the same values as most other people. Something, somewhere down the line went wrong to make me like this.

I guess it's a fair call to say I'm being selfish. My circumstances (married with kids) don't really allow me the luxury of doing what I want. If it was just me,  then hey, there'd be no problem.

But the difficulty is that anything I do has to be of my own volition, because I actually want and choose to do it, rather than feeling I'm being pressured and brow-beaten into it. If that was the case I know I wouldn't see it through; it would be doomed to failure.

And that's the catch - there's really nothing I *want* to do. I feel I should be able to put that aside and ""just do it"", but I can't. That's what makes me feel I'm being selfish ... I can't (or won't) take responsibility, be a family man, and do something, anything, for the greater good. It's as if I lack that ""bigger picture"" view, as my wife often tells me; the awareness that my actions (or inaction) affect those around me.

I probably freak people out when I talk about how I view life, but honestly, I'm not wrong. I just feel like it's a very enlightened view, and the truth hurts. Consciousness is a curse.

I don't mean throw caution to the wind and forget the needs of your wife and kids. There's embracing nihilism, and then there's just being an asshole.

However, that doesn't negate what you *experience.* I don't believe in meaning, however, I do believe in suffering.

Perhaps I do have one foot in ""asshole"" territory. This medication has changed me in some ways, though subtly ... it's hard for me to pinpoint. Without anxiety to drive me, propel me, I've become more inert. More at ease, but less driven, I think; not that I was ever the most driven person. And also more selfish.

The experience of living without, or with vastly reduced, anxiety was a novelty at first. Now it's pretty much become the norm. But it's changed things ... I feel as if I missed out on really living for so long, that now I want to do what I want. Indulge myself a bit, before I die.

"Hi, I've tried tons of meds, therapy styles, supplements, exercise, self help programs etc. I've read hundreds of journal articles on Treatment Resistant Depression because I have full academic access. I started a spreadsheet today of all the things I  tried, well over 100 and I'm nowhere near finished listing everything. But still, I get yearly several month long depression for over 20 years. The past few years I'm having more suicidal ideation during my episodes, even though I've also learned better coping skills, I can't always bring myself to use them. I fall back on avoidance of my negative/intrusive thoughts by staying in bed, binge eating or distracting myself with tv/screens. 

 This past year has been the worst for me mental health wise, like the depression never really lifted at all. Some weeks I exercised everyday, ate well, got some work done and some chores, while still being miserable.  Then I'd have another couple weeks of binge eating, crying and watching tv constantly so I won't have to think. A death in my family and covid19 just made everything so much harder. 

I've yet to try any TMS/anything electrical, MAOs, group therapy, any antipsychotics. Diagnosis MDD, GA, and BED. I'm just coming out of a lot of suicidal thoughts. 

I've got degrees, friends (though I've been terrible at returning calls lately so I'm losing 'em), relationship is strained because I'm not a great partner right now.  I've managed to make art and live life in between depression episodes. I'm Canadian,  I know my life could be way worse. 

Anyone figure out their mental health reasonably stable after decades of trying? Like I keep feeling like I'm figuring stuff out, gaining skills and insight, then I get depressed again and have to start over. I wish I could stick to some healthy schedule, but I always lapse.

EDIT: Its been really nice to hear peoples stories of finding things that work, especially longer term. And I've gotten some suggestions that intrigue me and it's just felt supportive overall, it's easy to feel so alone and exhausted from trying year after year. 

What has worked for me

-Having a roommate, helps me not get too stuck and isolated and I keep common areas clean because I grew up with hoarders. 

-Weekly therapy (have only had it sporadically due to health benefits) but man it makes using all those tools so much easier with a weekly check in.

"I have been pretty stable for many years now. Eleven years ago I went to live in a residential care facility for the mentally ill. I spent three years there, and have been on my own for eight years now. In addition to the great day program and other skill building activities, I met a psychiatrist who was a whizz with meds. 

I have different problems than treatment resistant depression, but severe depression is a symptom of some of my illnesses. I am on an MAOI and it has made a world of difference. I also take the antipsychotic Clozapine. Both those meds come with complications (special diet and regular blood tests), but they have helped tons. I am on other meds as well, but those are mostly for my self harm. 

Oh, I am 44 now and my problems became noticeably serious when I turned 20. So, I was struggling for about 13 years before entering the RCF. (Longer if you count the amount of time I hid my problems well). It's now almost 25 years since I got really sick and I am doing great."

"Hello! 35 years old. I have at least 20 years of depression, anxiety, and other forms of mental illnesses I have been battling. It has definitely been going on longer than 20 years but it was 20 years ago that I was first diagnosed and started doing therapy and taking medications. 

 I am by no accounts ""cured"" of depression, and like yourself I have gone through countless types of treatments for depression and the only kind that had any measurable amount of helpfulness has been Cymbalta, which I currently take at 60mg twice a day. While I am still often sad and crying every now and then, it has given me somewhat of a safety net to keep myself from falling too far into my depression like I used to. This is just anecdotal as I'm not trying to promote the drug as something that will help everybody, but it has helped me to reach a much more manageable state of depression. 

I'm really suprised you aren't diagnosed with a form of Bi-Polar Disorder, as that would emcompass the binge eating and monthly episodes, but that's between you and your doctor. 

Are your friends aware of your diagnoses or symptoms? I think it would help a lot to explain to them so they can understand why you sometimes don't want to talk, so that they won't start thinking you don't enjoy their company anymore.

Have you studied very much about the science of the brain? I encourage everybody I talk to with depression to learn about neuroplasticity and cognitive distortions. Neuroplasticity refers to the way our brains reinforce different behaviors, positive and negative, and how our neural pathways can change to cause us to think and feel differently. The optomistic aspect to take away from it is that we can break the pathways that correspond to negative thoughts and feelings and forge new pathways to positive behavior. This is possible at ANY age and even the pathways to the oldest, most reinforced negative behaviors can erode due to delibirate behavior correction. I am so awful at explaining it but there are plenty of good sources online to help you understand it. Cognitive distortion refers to specific thoughts or feelings we may have about ourselves that feel 100% true, but are logically incorrect or impossible from an objective point of view. Recognizing and correcting these are a key part in improving our brain health, whether depressed or not! I think life would be incredible if the entire world were able to recognize their biases and errors in critical thoughts and judgments."

"My life is still a mess... but I no longer suffer daily.  The feelings of pervasive helplessness, self-loathing and the like abate more often than they reappear.  And when they do, they now feel somewhat unusual and alien.  There's a ""wrongness"" to my feelings of depression now that was the exact opposite most of my life.  Either it was invisible and intangible, like air, or comfortable and ""right"", like familiar clothing.

I think the two best things I've done are, first, to stop looking at my depression as an outside ailment to be cured.  It's not.  It's like alcoholism or any other serious addiction:  It's going to be part of my being for the rest of my life.  Like a recovered alcoholic, though, that doesn't mean I have to give in to it or suffer from it.  I'm just always going to tend to want to react to adversity in a depressive manner:  withdraw, hide, sulk, blame myself, punish myself, rather than engage with my problems and face possible failure, disappointment, loss, etc.

Humans are pattern-recognition machines.  It's our biggest survival advantage after our thumbs.  Unfortunately, that mechanism for recognizing and exploiting patterns can backfire.  For many of us depression sufferers, the pattern is ""Things sucked either really hard once or pretty bad for a very long period of time and there was nothing we could do about it"", so now our conclusion to exploit that pattern is ""Don't try, because everything will always suck and there will never be anything you can do about it.""  Some of us add ""Because you deserve it.""  All of that is a lie, of course, but it can become a comforting, self-reinforcing one over time.

IDK about you, but my depression feels like pattern-recognition-error stemming from grief.  Grief doesn't have to be from loss of a loved one.  It can come from loss of or failure to obtain literally anything you desperately need, whether it's escape from an intolerable situation or an important life goal you can't seem to reach.  Inability to escape grief - emotional processing of one or more unacceptable but unescapable facts, like but not necessarily death - leads inexorably to depression, I find.

Yes, the problem is within us, but it's in how our minds process what's happening, not in those circumstances themselves or (not always) in our brain chemistry *per se*.  Everyone is different, but I find that changing my mind and global perspective fundamentally - as hard as that is - is a lot easier than thinking I just have some kind of brain malady and the right combination of drugs, meditation, therapy or coping mechanisms will soothe it.

The second best thing I did was get close to and help someone with similar Depression (and the inevitable anxiety that follows) to my own.  Depression is like an iceberg:  You almost never become aware of it until it's too late, and even when you do, there's usually a lot of deeper stuff ""below the waterline"" which you don't immediately recognize and often requires huge effort to uncover.  Our own problems are relatively opaque to us compared to those of others.  Just when you think you've gotten a ""handle"" on how and why you are depressed... you tend to find that it goes much deeper and is more pervasive to your life, your decisions, and your feelings than you ever imagined.  Watching someone else make those decisions and suffer those feelings outside your context can be very enlightening, like holding up a mirror to your problems."

"Back in March I'd be scoffing at myself for saying this: I found the right medication. I had completely given up. I was convinced I was untreatable by medication. I don't think medication is always the answer, or the *only* answer, but it helped even this skeptic.

I'm 33. Depressed since I can remember, but diagnosed around 15. In general, my adult life has been one long period of dysthymia. I managed it with Lexapro for \~10 years until it pooped out. After that, it was playing SSRI roulette and my depressive episodes became more severe and longer. They were always months-long before, and lasted longer after Lexapro stopped working. They were all meh, except for Trintellix which did seem to modestly help, but gave me nausea and was a top-tier drug at the time with my insurance and couldn't afford to pay the copay anymore.

I've been on Prozac for about four years now, and it's meh. I only kept on it because I was terrified if I went all-natural. I tried doing adjunct drugs - SSRI x2, SSRI + SNRI, SSRI + antipsychotic. Either no effect, or horrible effect (thanks Abilify, you fucked me up more). I also had benzos for anxiety, which calmed me but also made me tired, and during this last episode I was so beside myself about work performance that the tiredness made me even more worried and hazy.

In the fall I completed a course of TMS (36 sessions). It had a modest effect, but I was still depressed, and it wore off after awhile and I hit full-on suicidal again.

Then I started Lamictal in addition to Prozac. That made all the difference. I hadn't tried a mood stabilizer as I have unipolar depression and not bipolar, but whatever, it fucking works. I have no idea how long this might last and I'm mentally gearing myself up for SAD this winter but I'm enjoying it while it lasts.

Throughout most of this I was seeing a therapist. It helped in terms of learning some coping mechanisms and just being able to vent to someone, but it never really solved or improved my underlying depression, whatever causes it. My negative thoughts tend to come *after* I'm depressed. I get depressed ""for no reason,"" and then I feel shame and guilt about it and question whether I'm supposed to live on this planet since I'm so unfit. So therapy was just stopping the bleeding and minimizing the compounding of depressive moods causing negative thoughts and behaviors, which made the depression worse, which made me think more bad thoughts, etc.

You've gotten through so much, please don't lose hope. I know it's hypocritical coming from someone who gave up hope many times, but a history of depression doesn't mean a lifetime of it. You have a toolkit of things you know that help. I think it's just a matter of finding the missing piece of the puzzle. Keep trying and good luck."

"I probably shouldn't post this because my mental health is trash.. but honestly the only thing that really helps my depression/mental health is trying as best I can to have a time away from distractions, exercising on a regular basis and eating healthy.

These are all just my opinions but distractions are like bad mental hygiene. Things like this site, Netflix, news, social media, etc. etc. all clutter up your mind and distract you from feeling your aliveness, vitality, vibrancy, wonder, however you want to put it that feels so distant when in the grips of depression.

Exercise (in my case speed walking a lot) and getting out doors and NOT using any sort of music or distractor imo helps do some ""mental washing"". Try and not focus on your thoughts and just get in a rhythm of the walk. If you do have some thought's try to ""step back"" from them and be indifferent while at the same time reminding yourself that you'd rather not think at all. Sort of like you're trying to help a blind person (your mind) navigate through a room. Give consistent ""right orientation"" as the Buddhists say. I don't really know how to explain it better than that..

This along with eating healthy is better for mental health than so so many other things I have tried over the years. I'm not up to a 100 or so things but I've gone through a long long list and it all really seemed secondary to taking care of my body to help clear my mind.

Piracetam also when taken long term is a wonderful anti-depressant and cognitive enhancer, at least imo ymmv. It also doesn't have really any side effects and an impossible LD50.

"Wow  120mg of cymbalta used to work for me as well, until COVID19. I'd take 60 if I started feeling bad, and then 120 if that didnt work. No desire for sex, ability to orgasm and was constipated as fuck tho. And bad brain zaps everytime I went off it. 

No I'm definitely not bipolar,no mania ever. My dad and brother are, so its been a worry. What I was trying to say is that I can muster up enough force to do stuff and have some decent habits while being miserable and depressed this year, but then I fall back into bed and stay there for a while. The binge eating happens with the super low depression for me. The binge eating came after losing 120 lbs a few years ago and yeah I've gained most of it back which feels awful. 

I've read tons about neuroscience and trauma, and its helped with awareness, but not so much with behavioral change when I'm feeling low. I guess as someone who still gets hundreds of intrusive thoughts of self harm a day (when things are really bad) and I haven't cut since I was 15, neuroplasticity to me seems slow, you know?

Oh no! Please don't take antidepressants like that. They need to be active routinely in your system in order for it to work as intended, with 2-4 weeks being the average amount of time before you are likely to start feeling anything. Reducing the dosage at that level has to be done gradually and carefully or it can be very dangerous. If you were taking it on and off or went straight from 120mg to 60mg, then it is very likely to be the reason you were experiencing those brain zaps. It's a withdrawal symptom.

"Oh, yeah, that reminds me:  shame.  I'd almost forgotten how big an obstacle that can be.  I still dont' venture out too much or get into situations that trigger it, but I still feel it when I do.

The thing to remember about shame is:  nobody can *make* you feel it.  At some level, you are choosing to feel it.  Which means, difficult as it may be, you can choose not to, instead.  That doesn't mean you have to accept things, including yourself, as they are.  Dissatisfaction with the *status quo*, plus shame, equals inaction.  Dissatisfaction alone breeds effort & progress.

Feel shame when you hurt someone and knew better beforehand.  Never any other time.  It's a waste, otherwise.

As for changing your global perspective?  Start local, with yourself.  Question your perceptions.  You may not know or have a grip on the root of your trauma, but you know how you feel in the moment.  For example, I used to let trash pile up because my neighbor once said something unkind to me about something he didn't like on my property.  I was afraid to go take it out because I might run into him and he might comment.

Questioning that assumption... not only does my neighbor not really care that much about my comings and goings (nor do 99.99% of humanity), but even if he did, why should I care what he thinks?  It's not his property and never was.  As long as I don't break the law, there's nothing he can do but be annoying.  The reality is, he's uncaring and impotent as far as I'm concerned, so why am I letting him dictate my action (or inaction)?

This is symptom-level stuff.  Avoiding confrontation or challenges, lack of self-care, etc.  Lots of people like us have poor sleep hygiene; we stay up all night and sleep poorly therefore.  IDK about you, but I used to do that because I couldn't bear to think that tomorrow would be waiting when I woke up.  That's silly, but it's not from the depression/anxiety perspective, in that moment.  

That's the sort of thing to which you must apply critical thinking - analytical questioning, NOT judging - all the time.

"In my early 20s I took Citalopram, in my late 20s until now I have been on Sertraline (Zoloft).

The current problem is that 100mg per day of sertraline has, looking back, made me mega lethargic. My partner agrees the lethargy has had a big impact over time, although I'm very stable. 

In the absence of affordable therapy I'm thinking of going to my doctor to see if I can switch to another SSRI.

Has anyone tried switching? I am up for one last push to see if there are other SSRIs where the lethargy isn't having as big an impact.

"1. meds dont work for everyone. its a commonly believed myth that antidepressants 'treat' depression effectively. The truth is more granular than that: 
   1. people have to juggle any effects with side-effects. some of the side effects can negatively affect depression which offsets to whatever extent therapeutic effects. (Take for example sex drive - for many of us there is then the relationship / self esteem issues that come with not function as prior to meds)
   2. its rare as fuck that people take meds and it 'fixes' their depression. Usually there's a degree of effect, and often that can be marginal. (not saying it always is). 
   3. For most people it requires some degree of juggling to arrive at a balance of effect and side effect tolerance. for some people it can take a lot of messing about to get to a mix thats working to whatever extent and tolerable
   4. Be aware that any med you increase the dosage of will be harder to come off when you stop. Speaking from experience, stopping S?\*\* meds can be a long and uncomfortable process, particularly (a) after a long time on them and (b) if the dose is high. 
   5. A better option than a high dose med is a low or moderate dose med, and a better option than multiple meds is a single med, for this reason. 
   6. Wellbutrin is commonly well tolerated and has a high success rate (YMMV)

There are many different ssri‚Äôs and snri‚Äôs that effect everyone different. I think it‚Äôs smart to talk to your dr about your side effects. There are multiple options. You could lower your dose of your current med to see if it still has its intended effect with reduced side effects. You can switch to a different med to see if it is effective with less side effects. You can also look at supplementing your current med with another med like Wellbutrin, which tends to have a low side effect profile and can be energizing.

"I'm on bupropion partially because it has a mild stimulating effect. I like it better than any depression drug I've ever tried and anyone I've talked to about it says the same thing. I've heard of Zoloft being a drag to people. Zoloft pushed me into a black hole and was absolutely not right for me. My doctor gave me a small dose of non-time release amphetamine for the afternoons and it's been close to life changing. It's something I've wanted for my entire adult life. I do not like any of the time release stimulants (too strong too long) nor do I like methylphenidate or lisdexamfetamine (jittery, roller coaster-y, and also lasted too long). 

My doc is also careful to not give me anything that has lethargy tiredness etc as a side effect and to monitor new meds for those effects. For instance regular lithium makes me tired, but time release lithium actually has a stimulant effect on me, strong enough to where i can't take it after dark if I want to be able to sleep. She won't give me any real downers for anxiety, just buspirone. I also haven't had a drink in five years so I think that has some to do with it.

Try wellbutrin and see if you also can't get a 5 or 10mg amphetamine pill too. As someone who has abused stimulants in the past this has been super manageable and I routinely skip two and three days in a row on it and don't feel any withdrawal or anything.

"Title sums it up.  I had a normal life until 13 or 14.  After that I became addicted to the internet and pornography and slowly my friends went away.  I never had gf either, I‚Äôm basically 30.

Today I was digging through some cabinets and found a bunch of old photos and my grandmother‚Äôs yearbook from the 40s.

I started crying as I realized what I had missed out on simply due to being born ugly and having bad social skills, which I had no control over.

"By the way...

Don't get me wrong. I don't feel good. But...something that has helped me feel kind of a little less bad is Buddhism. Judging by your post, you and I have similar feelings. Well, some of those feelings for me are like, how nothing is permanent in life. The people we like will die. So will the people we hate. Or maybe we'll die first. Nothing matters. Nothing cares. Nothing exists. We're all just decaying and the only thing we know is suffering. That's just my natural disposition. And it also happens to be right in line with 'The Four Noble Truths'...basically the fundamentals of Buddhist teaching. I'm not usually into anything people would call spiritual but there isn't much of that involved with the Buddhism I'm into. And I don't really feel like I'm having to learn to be something I'm not...because I just naturally feel the stuff they're talking about in the writings. Anyway, I thought maybe it could help(ish) you too.

My suggestions aren't intended to invalidate what youre feeling, its obvious your having big, strong feels.

This could be an opportunity, too. Right now you're not tied down with old habits of hobbies or friends. This is an opportunity to explore that new freedom.

What other interests do you have? (Don't just say ""none"", there's more to you than the depression you're feeling right now) Explore those, learn about stuff that you've been curious about. Is there a book that you've been curious about? Read it. Curiois about Viking funeral rites? Research it.

If you meet anyone else who is socially isolated don't get your hopes up to high, these can be absolutely rewarding relationships as you both understand each other very well, however they might also lack the energy and or skills to really engage with you.

Did not meet anyone before spending the past six months stuck in my home office. As others have said, the best way I've found to cope is to at least do a 30-min walk every night. Listen to music, a podcast, or just work through what's in your head.

"I had a fight with my husband.  It's been three days now.  I was busy working and I had explained to him and our youngest that I would be busy for a couple of hours could they find something to do for a bit?  I thought it was taken care of and when my daughter got bored and wandered over to ask me for lunch I just sort of brushed her off.  ""Sorry hon, I'm busy, not right now."". Thinking she could ask her dad who wasn't that busy.  Then he jumped on me for being too dismissive and.. well a time crunch, break of focus, and criticized on my ADHD means I lashed out.  I felt like my time and work were not important, no one cares if they come bother mom... I literally can not break focus during a time crunch to have the emotional capacity to say much more than ""sorry, not right now."" Unless I want a ten minute rabbit hole of lost time... Not to mention this was something HE decided to change, didn't tell me till I was already stressed and then got upset I didn't take it well.  

So I thought, maybe he didn't realize how bad of a situation that was for me because of the ADHD.  That there would have been a much better approach and he just lacked the information to do better.  So I told him there are better ways and if you will spend a little time learning with me we could come up with strategies to help avoid this.  

But then... He said about the most hurtful things I can imagine.  He knew about the ADHD problems and he feels like I'm wrong because it was a Neurodivergent reaction that was the issue.  I shouldn't get mad if he treats me NT and therefore he shouldn't apologize.  Like... What?  I don't want to be that way.  I can't help it that my brain won't let me take in criticism in that moment.  All I ask is a slight accomodation of being told an expectation ahead of time so I don't feel attacked out of nowhere or to be addressed when I'm not so busy.  

He says he can't be perfect because he can't see my ADHD. And that he knew there was a better way but he did the the ""normal"" way and I can't be upset with that. So he refuses to apologise and I'm so so hurt.  I thought I was being reasonable. I have an issue I can't change.  I'm doing my best, but a few workarounds would be helpful to avoiding a meltdown. 

I'm lost.  This doesn't feel healthy, but it's also out of the blue.  He's been supportive till now.  Helped me get my meds, helped me remember things, helped with other accomodations so I thought he understood... I thought he ""got it"" but I guess not.  We have been together for 20 years.  Most of my life.  It's not just like he is some boyfriend I can dump.  

I'm to the point the stress is becoming physical and I'm starting to get sick to my stomach.   I'm managing to control it for now.  But this shit wrecks me and I'm not able to lift my head for too long.    So sorry for typos and being all over the place, I'm having to write this in small bits.

"There are a few things in life that will cause everything else to become much more difficult, and one of those things is poor sleep, and another is a being on a losing streak for several  years. These things tend to feed off each other, and eventually your entire life becomes a set of coping strategies piled on each other like a castle made out of playing cards.

Am I going somewhere with this? probably not. Here are some ideas

\- when backed into a corner where you've felt unwell for a long time, pharmaceutal help is often needed, in combination with lifestyle changes, especially for sleep. 90% of insomnia cases can be managed with lifestyle changes and CBT. But you still need that bottle of pills as a safety net for the odd night where there's addional anxiety or circadian disturbance. Some things are very simple; Accupressure mats, magnesium glycinate; sunglasses 1 hour before bed.

\- self-compassion is needed in a dire situation. You can only accomplish so much in a given day. Once you've made your x hours of effort, it's self-care time.

\- Back luck isn't usually the cause of problems. Unless you mean, the place you were born and who your parents are. People end up on a losing streak and it's much easier to keep losing once that happens. If you keep having bad luck, consider that you may not be living in a way that's moving consistantly in one direction. Most people don't examine their overall life direction as this is hard, written introspective work. It is totally normal to have mostly bad luck when you're in stagnation/avoiding mode, because you're not moving in the direction of potential solutions. 

Make sure you also subtract sources of chronic stress from your life , but replace them with other activities, don't replace them with youtube.

&#x200B;

If it helps, allow yourself to blame the system for your misfortune as you experience more bad luck, while trying to move forward instead of standing still. ""Playing the victim"" gets a lot of bad press. I find it empowering when on a losing streak to expect garbage output from the universe. Objectively speaking, walking uphill is hard, and there's no sense in trying to discount the obstacles you encounter as trivial."	stranger38	reply	na	na	na	0.998867392539978	no	no	no	na	MadOver30	no prediction.

That doesn't mean theyre happy it doesn't mean they don't suffer.  money isn't everything. It really isn't. 

I don't have any money any more either people can suffer with or without money . I guess what I'm trying to say is let's just try and be empathetic to each other we're all over 30 and struggling with our mental health and so we have that in common.

"To;dr: I‚Äôve fought my way into a better life: now I‚Äôm the only thing broken in it, and I can‚Äôt feel any joy about it. What now?

It‚Äôs the middle of the night here and I woke up from an unrelated dream to thinking about life when I was in my early 20s. I grew up with a traumatic childhood, always yearning for the calm stability I would be able to achieve when I moved out of my parents house, so my early-20s were never a party girl situation. I was a relationship that I overly committed to, eventually getting married at 23 then divorced at 26. 

Anyway, the memory I awoke to was a feeling of how much *adored* some things in that first house with my first husband. I adored my couch - I loved the color, the fabric, and the fact that I had bought it myself. I adored my two pets. I adored the paint colors I put on the walls - it was bold, a bit unexpected at the time and they were *my* walls that I got to paint. I loved a particular holiday and adored the decorations I  bought and put up for that holiday each year. 

Eventually, the husband cheated on me and the world that I had created fucking shattered. I had known for a long time that I could ‚Äúdo better‚Äù but he was a good guy and we laughed a lot together and I had decided ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt give this up, he‚Äôs actually good to me.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt realize how fragile my little world had been. 

I‚Äôve moved on, re-married to really great partner, had a lot of adventures, never messed my life up in all the ways the statistics about adults of childhood trauma say that I should have so, we‚Äôre doing good, right? No.  I haven‚Äôt felt level of adoration for my life again. The biggest issue in my life is my persistent depression (and now anxiety the last 4 years.) 

I had about 18 months of therapy, I‚Äôve been trying different anti depressants for the last 12 months and I‚Äôm about to graduate with a master‚Äôs degree. But, I still feel mostly numb, inadequate, and on the brink of losing everything. I think I‚Äôve closed my heart up since the infidelity - that was nearly 10 years ago now! I loved the guy but he wasn‚Äôt supportive of where I wanted to go in life (going to college and leaving our home town.) Like I said, my life is objectively good so why am I still fucking it up and not letting myself be happy or just content. I‚Äôve just e-mailed my therapist to ask about resuming sessions but, in the meantime, any advice or sharing of similar experiences to help shake me out of this would be appreciated."	purpleasphalt	post	28.533875471775595	female	White	0.9982271790504456	na	na	na	17	MadOver30	no prediction.
I struggle with this as well. So many things in my life have drastically improved in my thirties over past 5 years, yet I‚Äôm somehow still not the ‚Äúhappy‚Äù I feel I should be. My therapist tells me it is ok to feel depressed and frustrated and angry at the same time as being happy and grateful for the good things in life. And that they don‚Äôt ‚Äúcancel each other out‚Äù as I like to say. It‚Äôs ok to be feeling all of those things at the same time and it‚Äôs all valid. I don‚Äôt know if this will help you but it has helped my perspective and left me feeling less guilty and shameful for having these negative thoughts when I am supposed to be so happy for all the gifts in life I have been given.

"I don't think you can be 'shaken' out of it. It sounds like a deep set defence mechanism, if I'm not happy I can't be made unhappy!

It also sounds like you're holding yourself to an unrealistic standard, ie what happiness is like in the movies, or perhaps what you feel your life should be but it was robbed from you through infidelity.

Happiness isn't one all encompassing thing that you *find* abd it then permeates your life. I don't think that happiness exists. Happiness exists in small places, based on your perception and experience. You can build it up in enough places to be content, but never all the time, and never with every aspect of your life.

What some people forget about a life-shattering event such as yours is that, while picking yourself up and carrying on, you need space to grieve. Grieve your pain and losing the life you thought you were going to have.

Trust me, I know that feeling of everything being pulled out from underneath, the same feeling of panic as when you think you're in shallow water but suddenly you can't feel the bottom any more and your left threading water without support.

Stop looking for a fix. It isn't coming. Nothing will fix it you can't fix something that's already happened, you can only learn to incorporate it into your life in the right way, rather than fighting it.

"I feel this.  I too fought very hard to overcome ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù and I‚Äôve achieved what most people would call a successful life.  But I never quite achieved happiness.  I wouldn‚Äôt know this for nearly two decades though, because I was so numb to myself.  (I wasn‚Äôt unhappy, just empty, and that was ok because I thought I was doing ok.)  I‚Äôm in therapy now for the first time since my turbulent teen/young adult years and it‚Äôs really super hard.  The things I thought I could get for myself that would fix my life and make it worth living just weren‚Äôt working.  (Mind you, it‚Äôs still better to have things - degree, career, marriage, home - than not have things.)  I figured I was broken and I didn‚Äôt deserve this life.  In a way, it‚Äôs not far off the mark.  There is some ‚Äúbroken-ness‚Äù inside, some unmet needs, that can‚Äôt be fixed by anything external that I can fight, claw, steal from life.  I don‚Äôt know how, but I am therapy to try to heal.  

You have to figure out what the missing pieces are that would make you feel whole again.  I think you‚Äôre coming to these realizations a lot earlier than I did in my life.

Hey I just wanted to say that I went through something very similar.  I got married too young, then divorce happened just a few years later.  I've never been the same.  I also sometimes think back to that previous life, and feel guilty for missing it.  I've been working with a therapist for a while now and that helps.

Yeah, I totally feel you. I won't pretend to know what kind of pain the infidelity caused so it's possible that you are still putting up walls because of that but...I don't know man. Maybe it's just getting older and life losing some luster. I don't have any kind of trauma or anything other than that I was a friendless virgin for a lot longer in life than most people. Now I have everything I thought I wanted - amazing wife, nice house, starting what I hope to be a cool new job soon - and I still feel pretty shitty most of the time. It's not really anxiety or anything like that, I am just unable to feel joy at any of the simple pleasures in life. My wife can collect blackberries from our backyard and decorate our living room and be so enamored with it, while I can barely muster the energy to do laundry. 2020 has exacerbated the problem but it's been like this for almost as long as I can remember.	purpleasphalt	reply	na	na	na	0.9982271790504456	weak	strong	no	na	MadOver30	failed
"Sounds to me like you might need trauma therapy. Are your sessions with a trauma-aware therapist? 

I had a first marriage like the one you‚Äôre currently in and I did leave it because I felt a similar sense of unease. I went on to be in a second marriage that was more like your first. I felt really good in it, and then it all came crashing down. It wasn‚Äôt infidelity that did us in, but it was otherwise quite similar to your first marriage in the way it made me feel and how I look back on it. 

The thing is, if you‚Äôve been abused as a child (and this can include simple neglect, with no physical abuse, the range of how ‚Äúabuse‚Äù is defined here is very broad) your brain was wired to see love as abusive.  

It‚Äôs important to note that your first husband‚Äôs infidelity likely re-traumatized you. This is very common with trauma, to find someone who does to us what our parents did. My trauma, or core wound, is parental abandonment and I managed to find a man who was completely dedicated to me for 8+ years and then abruptly left me. It‚Äôs uncanny the way we find these people.  

I don‚Äôt know what your core wound from your childhood is, but I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if it involved deceit and some form of abandonment, literal or figurative or both. 

My first husband would have never left me like that, but I felt really uncomfortable with how safe that all was, so of course I left him. :/

When childhood wasn‚Äôt safe, we don‚Äôt readily get to feel safe as adults. Safety feels, actually, unsafe. And feeling unsafe feels normal, or even very, very good.  I think this is why, in your first marriage, you felt fulfilled. It was unsafe (infidelity) and somewhere deep down you knew that. And it spoke to you and ticked the trauma boxes. 

The key is to heal the trauma. We don‚Äôt heal trauma through our minds and intellectualization. It has to be a combination of our minds and our bodies. Trauma lives on in our bodies and causes nervous system dysregulation. This can lead, over time, to anxiety and depression. 

Heal the trauma so you can feel true safety. Then your life will start to make sense.

"Not much to add other than I had a very chaotic upbringing with trauma and abuse. 

I did the same thing and married young for the same reason divorced a year later because he was not the right guy for me at all despite me wanting to force it and turn a blind eye to how awful he was as a husband. It ended anyway. 

And then I never quite recovered I had a series of very strange emotionally abusive relationships. 

Finally I'm at a time where I need to just form a life of my own completely leave the past behind and stop looking to significant others to rescue (so that they can then rescue me) that will never be the answer and I know that now after 10 years of trying so hard to save myself through others. 

Whatever we were trying to fix about ourselves through marriage is still there and needs to be addressed differently . That's just my opinion I apologize if I made the assumption that we're similar. 

I can also say that therapy has not been the answer for me I found it through spirituality (religion) and faith in higher powers. That might not be it for you but I'm presenting it as an option.

"Wound up here somehow, thought I'd reply.

I don't know why this popped into my head, but I read a story once about a woman whose eyes kept weeping. She didn't understand why tears kept running down her face, no medical issues. Her life was going great. Ot turned out that sometimes our minds dismiss what our body tries to tell us. There was something deeply painful to her that deep within she mourned and did not accept. Once she accepted it, she mourned for real and then it passed and she was free of the burden. Her eyes no longer wept constant tears because she had cried it out. She was not free of sadness she felt at times about it, that came and went as is normal in life, but she was able to process her grief and release herself from the suffering and deadlock.

That dream sounds like a message, that part about adoring things in your life is what you go back to, might be good to explore that and see what's underneath, ask questions.

I had a weird situation where I developed a rather obsessive crush on a celebrity and I was never one for that so I wondered about it. I guess from experience with meditation I was able to just sit with myself and ask questions and try to be curious about it without completely dismissing anything as 'bad"" or ""silly', or even forbidden in some way. Basically I suspend reality temporarily and looked inwards, accepting what is, I don't have to act on it, only listen. 

When I listen I check in with my body sensations, what my heart feels, what my gut tells me. Sometimes I'd come up with answers and get a ""not quite it"" feeling in my gut, so I'd feel it out, rephrase, reassess. I paid attention to warning sensations, and checked to see if this is actual danger or a fear part I can comfort and take along with me to observe what is going on. If things get too heavy I allow myself to back off and be gentle. There is no forcing of things. 

It basically boiled down to the character being a white knight type, and it took a long moment because there was a scrong scoffing and horrified reaction. I am an independent person, not some weak princess stereotype in need of rescue, *I* run my life, no one else. Disgusting. There was also part of me that feared what a ""rescuer"" might do with my vulnerability or who might surface to take advantage of my weakness. I had to acknowledge all the things I felt, including the judgements. And I thanked them for bringing these things to my attention, for trying to protect me, and to take a step back in this space where anytjing can happen and to see what else is there. There was a bit of a struggle and me recentering myself before I was able to step back and acknowledge I wanted to be rescued. That is something that might not seem like a big deal to some, but to me it's forbidden.

It was when I acknowledged that forbidden desire that I unburdened myself. The fighting within stopped, and my mind cleared. I realized if wanted to be rescued then I must be very overwhelmed by my sitiuation. And I started to admit to things I was actually unhappy about and wanted.to change, rather than feeling like I should be grateful and suck it up. I also acknowledged I was too fearful to make the changes desired on my own, that not only they were big, but trauma was also behind them. So I looked for ways I could try to feel supported or take smaller steps that weren't as scary. 

I had been poo pooing baby steps before because I needed to man up and be an adult, but realizing that I was burdened by trauma and other things I felt maybe it does 'make sense to be gentler with myself and kinder. Not to mention that I wouldn't ever speak to someone else that way, I would probably be pretty patient and understanding, so it would make sense to be kinder to myself as well.

I'm not sure if you find any of this relatable, familiar, or maybe too woo woo, or what. While I have a tendency to examine things and get to the bottom line regardless of what emotions or fears could jump up, the process has beeen added onto over time. I've been in therapy for one. Some of this process came from learning mindfulness meditation, went to meditation classes sponsored by a buddhist institution. Also have been through DBT group, and the process does teach how to accept emotions and not let them overrun you, how to deconstruct what's going on, and how to maintain healthy boundaries while addressing your needs. I think it just kinda gave me the ok to keep doing wht I'm doing since I had people telling me othereise at the time...

Another thing that helps me is realizing that ‚Äúhappy‚Äù is an emotion that comes and goes. It‚Äôs not something you obtain and keep. It‚Äôs like being angry, excited, mad, jealous, sad or whatever.

"I can sense your pain and I wish I could take it away for you. 
I've felt this way so many times before. But listen: you have to understand that you ARE good enough. You always have been. The right person/people will see you and appreciate you just the way you are. And I don't mean ""see"" physically but truly perceive you, the inner you.  

I remind myself that in the end, I only have myself. And I know I'm a good person. I know I'm good enough - more than good enough. I know, because I've seen what's out there. I've seen how other people can make me (and each other) feel - and all my life, all I've wanted is to NOT be like them. To not hurt others, use them, cast them aside, abandon them, take advantage of their insecurities or point out their flaws. 

But people see in others what they can easily see in themselves.  People who are dishonest and mean and selfish assume other people have those qualities. People who have ulterior motives assume others always must too. Can you imagine how exhausting and sad it must be, to live life that way? Of course you might think someone isn't good enough for you if you had that sort of jaded worldview - but you would be wrong. 

Some people are mean just because they can be. 

Some people lie because they want us to only see the good. (Because they're afraid of their true self being rejected? Probably)

Some people deceive because they want your undivided attention, your admiration - and they know that if they were honest they might not receive it. (In some cases.)

You know who the ""good enough"" people are? The ones who feel things deeply, who have experienced pain so deep that they cannot stand to see it in another human being. The ones who question their worth sometimes because they can objectively see their flaws - but those flaws make us human. They do. Perfection does not exist. Only a perfect point of view - but points of view change, also, don't they? It's all temporary. Who are they, who are you, underneath it all, from another point of view? 

You know, deep down, that you ARE good enough. You know, in your heart, that you're good enough for yourself too. But it sure hurts like hell when others don't see it. And that's the crux of it. And so we've come full circle and I can say this: I feel your pain. It's real and it's valid. But not everything that you based it on is true, and you need to examine those assumptions. 

It's okay, though, to mourn not having the right kind of people in your life. That's okay. The grief will crush you if you don't allow yourself to fully mourn. And I'm here if you want to talk, because I get it."		reply	na	na	na	0.9993765950202942	weak	strong	no	na	MadOver30	no prediction.

As I read your post I am reminded of how hard we are on ourselves and you're right I think we do need to feel good enough for ourselves over anyone else.

I know how to give myself mental breakdowns by beating myself up  over things that I couldn't possibly have had control over.

As for self improvement, it's so hard. That's all I know. The only thing that works for me is long term tracking. For example, I'm finally losing weight consistently but it doesn't feel like it until I can look at the yearly chart. I've had luck with mood tracking apps and the x-effect for that.

There is not an ounce of self-awareness in the upper middle class, all they care about is being separated from the Poors and having a Publix and a nail salon at the same address.

I really feel this too. I live in the Midwest. Everywhere I go is just a row of either vacant storefronts or another chipotle or five guys.

Sure we‚Äôre surrounded by forest but it‚Äôs all so flat and it‚Äôs either green or grey or covered in snow.

The social isolation you mention is always a challenge - especially this year of course.

If our eyes should meet

From going to the place

Of wishing I was dead

Of course, this habit of staying up late gradually  takes its toll and makes the next day that much harder. 

The worst thing about tiredness for me is that you get used to it and it becomes your new baseline. Only when I get a decent night's sleep do I notice the difference the next day.

"I have always had very thin skin. It bothers me so much that I can‚Äôt fight back against people.

"I just finished reading the new book out by Marsha Linehan. It's literally about how she went from ""the worst type"" of mental patient to creating one of the most famous therapeutic treatments there is (DBT therapy) and it really helped me battle some of my own bias about appearing mentally healthy and recovery. 

Personally, I don't call my skin thin. I say I was never taught distress tolerance skills because I was raised by people that did not know them in a family that has been mentally unstable for generations. Generational trauma is a BIG and complicated issue. But, simplifying it to teaching myself tolerance skills helps me not feel overwhelmed, ""forever broken"", or like I'll never tackle it.

"You may want to look into autism/adhd if you haven't already.

It's difficult to comment on your strongly held opinions as you don't mention what they are, but just because people with depression/anxiety have jobs and are functional in society, that does not mean they are mentally healthy. You are not the set point where people achieving more are 'healthy' and those equal or lower to you are 'unhealthy'.

You sound like you are surrounded by some negative people. You shouldn't be mocked. You are entitled to have whatever opinions you want, but however strong they are, they are just as important/unimportant as everybody elses. Life is give and take, learning from each other, not being right at all costs. If opinions are about how people treat you or your body, then you are able to set your own boundaries. But if it's on something like general health matters or government policy, then the opinion of someone with education in that will hold more weight because they have studied it and have more knowledge.

If debating skills are important to you, take a course (they're often free if you don't want a certificate on Coursera/future learn etc). School should not be the end of learning. I really recommend the Yale Science of Wellbeing course on Coursera for perspective on a lot of things you've mentioned. Look into the difference between a growth mindset and a fixed mindset. Find what you are good at/enjoy and build on that. You don't have to be a doctor/lawyer to be successful in life.

For the freezing up response, look into trauma therapy, it sounds like you are going into the freeze reaction which can often be due to having bad early experiences in life.

"Hey. Those choices were not your fault. Yes, you made them and have to deal with the consequences, but that doesn't mean they were any sort of fundamental moral failure on your part. As you said, you are biologically predisposed toward certain conditions that lend themselves to unhealthy patterns of behavior. Your brain is literally wired differently from other people, so stop comparing apples and oranges. 

You weren't necessarily aware of these issues at the time you made those poor decisions. It's only after you start to understand yourself and recognize those behavioral patterns that you can begin to address them. Don't beat yourself up for things outside of your control. ""Worry is like a rocking chair: it will give you something to do, but it won't get you anywhere."" Learn from past mistakes and think about how you might deal with the situation now if something similar came up again.

I can totally relate to your frustration with not being able to argue your point. This is something I've struggled with for years and always hated it. My brother especially knows how to push my buttons. Even if I completely disagree with what he's saying, it's nearly impossible to articulate my reasons and try to make a counterpoint.

Part of the problem is that my brother knows this about me and uses it to his advantage. He is smug and enjoys getting under my skin, knowing that I will struggle to respond. If I do manage to make any kind of argument, he dismisses it out of hand. It's infuriating! 

I usually either try to change the subject or literally walk away from the conversation. Which, in his mind at least, I think he counts as proving he was right and won the debate. 

In the last few months, though, I've started giving him a run for his money. I've realized he fights somewhat dirty. My points and statistics or whatever don't have to be exact with 100% accuracy. If he can get away bending the truth to suit his narrative, then I'm not going to worry about absolute perfection in giving a quote or statistics.

"As much as having thin skin is, having thick skin is a byproduct of poor mental health. The better your mental health, the more you can properly weigh your interactions with other people. No one should be completely unconcerned with how other people view them, but you should be able to express yourself and do what you think is important without it getting in the way. I'm not sure how much a specific condition will hamper the usual methods for building confidence, but I know a lot of 'normal' people don't know the first thing about it either. Lots of false confidence, and sometimes people don't pick that up and think they're the only one.   

Here's a thing on developing confidence I wrote for a young musician:  

Bluffing.  
Biologically, there's only one reason animals make noise. Without this one trick, music would never have evolved:
There is no reason for a predator to let prey it's hunting know where it is. There is no reason for prey to let a predator it's hiding from know where it is. The only reason animals started making noise on purpose was to say 'I see you. Fuck off.' If a predator is stalking prey, and the prey just turns to it and goes 'There you are.' then the predator knows to stop wasting its time and go after an easier meal. It's a bluff, but it works.
Everyone has a bluff, or front. They don't have it because they're tough. If they were, they wouldn't need it. Everyone says fake it till you make it. I say hustle till you're legit. Real confidence doesn't come from within despite what our moms said. It comes from the knowledge that you're surrounded by peers who know what you know. You know they know, and they know you know. If a preda... I mean a producer is more concerned with looking like a producer, that's usually a sign they're hiding their inexperience. That doesn't mean they're dumb or useless, they may have a lot to offer and just stuck playing the game. But the more someone spends on intimidation, the less there is to be intimidated by. Once you get that your worth is decided by your skills and knowledge, and you know what your skills and knowledge are worth, then you have real confidence. There's very little real confidence in this industry because so many people compare themselves to either legends or scarecrows.  

The point is, everyone says have confidence in yourself. Nope, worth comes from yourself. Confidence is what you project onto others, and others project onto you, and it's not a real thing. If you look at yourself with worth, then look at others with the same worth you have for yourself, well not everyone will return it. But the ones who will, that gives you real confidence. Not a lot of people have real confidence; I don't. But I have worth because I didn't let myself be defined by how other people see my shortcomings. They have way too many shortcomings for me to let them do that.  

I don't know how much your difficulties set you back personally, but I do know that the answer is to stop comparing yourself to illusions. Work on yourself, at your own pace, in whatever capacity you think you need to. No one is as good at anything as you think. Artists almost never come up with original ideas. Lawyers couldn't do a thing without assistants. Doctors often have no idea what's going on around them. We're all a bunch of phonies and if you actually manage to be legit, that's something to brag about.

"I am a petty, pathetic person and I am angry at myself for it.

At work today, a junior colleague enjoyed some success (albeit there is no secret that the boss, being her father in-law, was the person who pulled the strings and did the work). But of course, results are results. Everyone was congratulating her as if she was some sort of child genius.

And I felt anger and despair, then I despised myself for feeling so.

 I was never given such treatment. Never. Even back when I was young, and occasionally got some results, no one gave a damn. 

As the years went by, my work profile shifted paths. The vast majority of my work is to handle matters that had already gone down the wrong track. Sometimes I could save them. Often, things were doomed by the time they reached me. So, the end result is, I don't get results.

For example, I have this seemingly very simple task coming up next week. More than 2 weeks ago, I asked the junior staff to show me what he had done. He off-handedly said, why the rush, the deadline is not until the end of August. 

I was finally shown the work last Friday. And I've spotted very amateurish but nearly-irreversible mistakes. I used the word 'nearly' because, well, technically I need to try to save it, so I need to pretend that there is still some chance. 

But guess what? It would be me who would be interrogated as to why there are such sloppy and amateurish mistakes. I would not be given the leeway that one would give to a junior and younger staff because I have been doing this for way too long. I also would have to face the wrath of the client. Yet, I have no excuse. I am responsible. 

 I would fail. And people, very possibly including the aforementioned junior staff, would comment on how could it be possible that someone who has been in the business for so long performed so poorly.

Stuff like dreaming about 20 dollars in my wallet, driving myself insane trying to find it when it's not there and eventually coming to the realisation that I probably dreamt it. 

Recently my ex-wife has moved house and she found some of my painted miniatures from when I was a teen. She gave them to me and I put the three best on top of my computer.

I had dreams like this when I was a teenager, for quite a while. My family life sucked and I was often feeling tense and scared at home, but I thought that was normal.

I would dream of very realistic conversations or fights, usually with family members. Finding money too, or finding an object I love, just like you ! Very mundane stuff. 

I distinctly remember telling people that there was no way I could tell dreams and memories apart cause they were just so realistic. 

I also would hear family members calling my name right before falling asleep... With the tone that meant ""you're in trouble"". Urgh, I hated it. 

I never looked into it. Maybe it was something like depersonalization, maybe it was nothing.

"First, i need to say that i will never give up on life. it's one of my mantras.

but.... the levels of hope i'm feeling are so low and i'm just feeling so dissatisfied with my life.

just a few years ago i was almost optimistic about my career, my social life and my love life. i thought i would be able to quash my anxiety and move forward in life and accomplish those things which most people in my socioeconomic background take for granted (friends, sex, dating, job prospects, hobbies). 

but the last few years especially the last 2 years have been very bad for my mental health. my daily struggle is just to work, eat, do chores and masturbate. base needs. i have loads of hobbies and while i haven't dropped any of them completely, i do them much less seldom, with a lot less gusto, and with GAD hanging over me almost all the time. i can't relax any more. i can bring myself to a decent level of non-stress, but i can't actually *relax* anymore.

i remember true relaxation: you forget the concept of time and other facets of life become inaccessible (basically all your worries melt away and the only thing that matters is the present moment).

i find that, while my social phobia has improved a lot thru the years, my GAD and my dysthymia have gotten worse, especially the last 18 months have exploded into a pandemonium of mental dis-ease.

i actually have a list of Life Goals i've kept for several years and each time i look at it (weekly or so) to see how i've progressed so far, i am just filled with a feeling of intense spiritual terror. the list includes ""finding the one"" and ""find an ecstatic job"" etc.

"Hi there. No need to apologize for your ramble, we all need to vent now and again.

I'm sorry to hear of your situation and how hope seems to be slipping away. It sounds like you've really been trying hard for a long time and things just don't seem to be going the way you want them. And the current COVID situation probably isn't helping things either.

It's great that you're hanging onto your hobbies even if they don't seem to be bringing much joy at the moment. I find hobbies help in their own way even if it's just as a reminder that life has many aspects to it. Maybe one day you'll find deeper enjoyment in your hobbies again.

I find it encouraging that your social phobia has improved. It shows how much you've worked at it! Sure, other areas in life may appear lagging but here's hoping they'll catch up.

Since you've got a list of Life Goals I'm willing to bet you're already ahead of most people who haven't even spent the time to self-reflect. It's hard to face that feeling as if one of your goals is slipping (or has slipped) away, like a knife that's found it's way deep into your chest. I've felt that feeling, I felt it far more recently than I care to admit.

My therapist once said something to me (over 10 years ago actually!) that has stuck with me: if I didn't feel fear or pain around the prospect of losing something then it wasn't that important to me. So if you're feeling fear or dread at not achieving your goals you can be sure that you've at least chosen goals that you find valuable, goals that are worth spending the effort chasing.

Things haven't been that great for me lately but I'm getting by. I've found myself looking back and regretting some of the major decisions I made (this rarely ends well). As a result of those decisions I too feel parts of my life slipping away, important parts that I've been holding onto dearly. And yes, hope does feel like it's slipping away too.

Nights are when my feelings hit their lowest. I've known that for years and tell myself ""this has happened before, things always look better in the morning."" And they often do."	the_cutest_void	reply	na	na	na	0.9984747767448425	strong	no	no	na	MadOver30	no prediction.
"Hey dude, sounds like you are in a lot of stress right now and with everything going on it's no wonder your mental health declined over the last few months.

Someone else pointed out the possibility of medication and therapy and I would definitely second this if you can't really relax on your own.

Our brains aren't really made to experience constant stress and doing so over a long period of time will often worsen our mental state as the chemical balances can't return to normal.

However if you don't want to cross that bridge yet I'd just ask you to take it a bit slower for a few weeks.

You already made it into your thirties and not comparing your current self to your goal list for a few weeks won't change an awful lot.

The best comparison might be a vacation for your ambitious self. There are many people out there who have achieved less than you and who still enjoy life and while I'm not telling you to lower your goals, I think just reminding yourself that there is more to life than just achieving mile stones from time to time is equally important."	the_cutest_void	reply	na	na	na	0.9984747767448425	weak	no	no	na	MadOver30	no prediction.
I'm in a similar boat. I wanted to be a writer or a professor and neither worked out. But I've adjusted and enjoyed smaller habits and goals. You'll find your life partner, it might take longer. And you might some day truly enjoy your job. Until then I would recommend trying to cultivate smaller habits and goals. I have general anxiety and dysthemia. Have you tried medication and or therapy?

"I've been there, and to some extent am still there.  I also suffer from GAD, and I think one of the things that makes it really difficult is that a lot of folks don't realize how debilitating being in ""flight or fight"" mode pretty much every hour that you're awake can be.  It takes a lot out of a person.  It's just one of those things that unless you've experienced it, it can be impossible to explain.  It's not that people doy care, they just absolutely have no reference point.

I do hope that you are able to reconnect with some of your hobbies.  I've found it very valuable.

"If you'd consider the med route, Nardil/phenelzine works great for social anxiety, GAD, and dysthymia.

I'm 46. I only started taking Nardil a couple of years back. Before then, I spent 20-odd years on and off other stuff, mostly SSRIs and similar, with no success.

I'd always had pretty bad social anxiety, and over time was also blessed (lol) with periods of depression and chronic dysthymia.

Nardil has really improved the quality of my daily life. My anxiety is zero and my mood is much improved. I still get my down days, but not to the levels I did before. 

I haven't felt any emotional blunting, which I always got with those other newer meds. I was at the point of giving up altogether on medication.

"For reference: I‚Äôve got disabling schizo-affective and crippling anxiety. 5 years ago, I was raped 3 times by 4 people over 5.5 months which led to crippling PTSD and suicidal thoughts and actions. My mom has metastasized cancer and my dad is currently going off the deep end, threatening suicide on facebook.


It‚Äôs the 5th anniversary of the first rape today. My ptsd has gotten better, but I‚Äôm still a hermit who cycles between rage and depression. It‚Äôs less intense these days, though. I am worlds away from 2015, even 2017. Not great, but not at the bottomless pit.


I found out today that my last friend and her husband blocked my number between last Saturday and today. I have no idea why. I stopped a friendship with a woman & her husband when she wouldn‚Äôt stop telling me how much she misses the old me (pre rapes) and trying to fix me with bath salts and alcohol. My best friend of 12 years atom bombed our relationship by going on and on about how horrible of a person I am after years of manipulation and possessiveness from her. My best friend from high school, a gay man, ended up being relentlessly biphobic which is awkward since I‚Äôm bisexual. This all transpired over 4.5 years.


All of this has been discussed in intensive CBT therapy and they agree with what I‚Äôve said above. They probably would say more, but I thought I‚Äôd keep it light and airy.


I‚Äôm just wondering if anyone else ‚Äúmad‚Äù has had their entire social life completely obliterated because I feel incredibly alone in this situation.

"Although no one may have had exactly your combination of things happen to them, some have had less and some have had more. That said many, many people have lost some or all friends due to mental health challenges. You are absolutely not alone. My first boyfriend and love broke up with me after I started having suicidal thoughts during a depression years ago. That wasn't my fault in the same way it's not yours. However in my case I understand and forgave him and let it go because just as awful as it is to cope with what is going on in your head, it's extremely hard for the people around you to know how to cope, they feel confused, helpless, and many bad feelings. It's not your fault, there are unfair ways that they shouldn't react or say, but they might because it is hard.

I suggest you keep up your good work, go places or do things where you meet people who never knew the before you where what happened isn't the first topic you discuss. Get to know them and when time makes it okay for you to share your story with the new people know that the person you tell will also struggle to know how to feel or act. Use professionals not new friends for the serious stuff. They're just not equipped. They're for hugs, a cup of tea, or help getting a laugh when you're ruminating.

"     I have always suffered from mental disease, but when I suffered a head injury when in was young it kicked into overdrive. I've lived most of my life with a projection plastered over reality. Half the time I don't perceive the stuff around as what it actually is, and inanimate objects are always moving around. Ive been seeing psychiatrist since 16, and tried every medication under the Sun. The only ""successful"" medication basically put me into a drooling comatose state for 6 months that i dont recall.  I managed to get a GED after I was expelled my senior year. Then, somehow managed an associates degree before my disease consumed my life. It seems like such a pointless struggle now; I failed to achieve the education I wanted, which left me with nothing but a huge pile of debt. Now I'm stuck on disability, which pays me a little over 700 bucks a month.  There is no light at the end of the tunnel. Just more of the same until the end. Now the minds of my older family members are going and I'm having to face my own inevitable fate.  I'm lost without a lifeline and I have no one else to talk to that cares or would listen.

I have also gone through nearly every medication in my psychiatrist's arsenal over the past 20 years to the point where we are re-treading over medications I have already tried that we are trying in combination with other medications. I know what it's like to feel as though all hope is lost. But I only recently came to the realization that there kinda never is a point in life where hope turns to fate. That can only happen at death. The future probably doesn't look much brighter to me than it does to you, and I know that I am not in your shoes, but we truly don't know what the future will bring. That sounds as cheesy as it felt to write it, but you can't say it isn't true. I also have a shaky and uncertain future ahead of me, and I don't know what I am going to do yet. I think that the both of us may have been born in a time before the medical world had the knowledge and technology to help us. But that time could be on the horizon. I know that there are at least a handful of truly compassionate people out there who are actively researching the miracles we are waiting for. If it takes until the last year of my life to receive that miracle, then at least I will have had that one year of freedom, because something is better than nothing. I wish you all the best, and all I can really think to suggest is just to keep fighting for you right to have a life, keep researching, and don't be afraid to ask for help. And remember that everyone's reality is created within their own brains, and our brains are sick, so our perception of reality is twisted. Don't give in to the negativity of your thoughts, because our brains are biased towards them and they can feel true and logical but that doesn't mean that they are. You probably already know about distorted thinking errors or cognitive biases or whatever they proper term for them are, but there are plenty of resources online that will remind you or let you know about them.

"Hello. A 33-year-old male here.

I had my first diagnosis (well misdiagnosis) of bipolar disorder when I was 25. My symptoms were paranoia, delusions and mild depression. A few months later I was correctly diagnosed schizophrenia, which developed in schizoaffective disorder a year later (a cycle of manic and depressive symptoms, along with psychosis and hallucinations.) Thankfully, at the age of 30 the affective part went away, and I have been schizophrenic since.

Now I'm on the APs Clopixol and Stelazine for sz, Prozac for mild depression, and a small dose of Thorazine for sleep.

How has it been for you? How do you cope? And what are you on now?

"I am 42F.  I started pulling my hair out before I was 2.  The doctors said I was a high stress child and pulling my hair out was my coping mechanism. I was an avid thumbsucker and would wrap the hair around my thumb and suck on it.  The concern was swallowing the hair so my parents cut it extremely short so I couldn't  wrapy fingers around it. I then started to pull it out of my favorite doll so they cut her hair too.  This led to gender identity issues because I was constantly mistaken for a boy, even in dresses.  My parents response was to pierce my ears.

I developed GI issues around 7.  I was diagnosed by 11 with a peptic ulcer and began prescription meds for it.  

At 15, I was raped and told my parents.  They sent me to therapy.  I don't remember much about it now, but one instance will stay with me forever.  After a few weeks the doctor wanted a family session.  My sister didn't come, but both my parents did.  The doctor said something about the household being too stressful for me and suggested I stay elsewhere for some time to heal.  My father attacked the doctor.  He screamed how he had no right to take his child away from him and was escorted out by security.  I don't think I spoke for days after that.

He died when I was 19 and my mom took off a few months later.  I was finally free to properly treat myself.

At 21, I was diagnosed with depression, general anxiety disorder, and PTSD.  

I was still broken. The meds didn't help the way we hoped and I gave up treatment until I had a total breakdown around 30.  It took a bit, but I found a great doctor and started taking Prozac and Xanax.  That lasted about 3 years until I had another breakdown.  Started therapy and seeing a psychiatrist.  I was then diagnosed with OCD and my life began to change for the better.  

Around 37, I changed psychiatrists and was FINALLY properly diagnosed.  I have depression, GAD, OCD, ADHD, and PTSD.  It took another few years to find the right meds and doses.  I currently take two forms of Adderall (IR & ER), Wellbutrin, Prozac, and Xanax on top of BP meds, GERD meds, and a fist full of vitamins.  

I'm currently going through a depressive stage that my Dr is aware of.  I think it's getting worse.  My husband has become increasingly abusive and I'm starting to feel like the little girl that wants to pull her hair out.

I'm 30. For as long as I can remember I've had very wobbly mental health, but it wasn't until the end of a v abusive relationship aged 21 that I seriously pursued help. 

I was prescribed my first antidepressants at 21 and diagnosed bipolar a year later. My psychiatrist was quite cold and dismissive and had a tendency to make me feel like a moron, so I've been reluctant to see another despite significant changes in my mental health since. Eventually I hope to be reassessed. 

I don't know if it's common, but I find it incredibly difficult to talk about my mental health. It's very changeable and unpredictable, and I've also developed a superhuman ability to forget stuff, so trauma needs some proper excavation before I even know it's there.

I'm currently seeing a therapist but often I feel like a genuinely lost cause. Time will tell I suppose."	Snoo45620	reply	na	na	na	0.004173994529992342	weak	strong	no	na	MadOver30	no prediction.
"I'm 32. Initial diagnosis of an eating disorder and depression at 19. Put on Prozac. Prozac shot my anxiety into overdrive. Put on Xanax. Then more Xanax. Then MORE Xanax. 

Then it was a BPII. Abilify. Switched to Celexa and Depakote, the latter gave me edema. Calex and Lamictal, which continued for a while. 

Then Seroquel was added a bit later to help with mood and sleep. I immediately gained 45 pounds. 

Then off meds for a while because I just gave up on everything. Now I have a good Dr. and it's much more straightforward of MDD and GAD, now on Zoloft and Buspirone and it's the most stable I've been in a while.

"Started getting symptoms of social anxiety in my teens. By 20's was unable to do a bunch of things that other people seemed to manage. I sucked up the courage to go and see a psychiatrist, who after about 10 minutes told me there was nothing wrong with me. 

Fast forward some number of years and its caused all sorts of issues for me (will spare the details, if you are familiar with SA, its pretty standard issue debilitation that varies in degrees)

I started really having a hard time with it when I started on a professional career in my 30's, and it got in the way of a bunch of work related stuff. Basically over a number of years I got more and more depressed because nothing I could do for it seemed to have any effect. I tried, literally, everything.

So then the depression took hold, I started reducing my hours, and eventually went on disability. 

Couple years into that I managed to start and run a successful business where I could 'pass' and the SA didnt get in the way of anything significant. Depression went into complete remission. 

Business folded 4 years ago, and I ended up really unwell with depression, hospitalised, ECT, and have been very disabled with it for that period. I am now unusure if I will ever get back to work. 

I have tried every SNRI medication, a bunch of SSRIs, Tricyclic, MAOI, ECT, CBT, and have seen about 15 different shrinks, psychiatrists, and generalist counsellors over the years. Along the way I got degrees in Psychology and Social Work, and worked for a number of years as a therapist. I managed to help a bunch of people but could never heal myself. 

When I got out of hospital one of the most useful things that happened, is a Psychiatrist looked at my history and suggested I look into the relevance of personality disorders to my situation. I suggested I didnt meet any of the criteria, and she suggested I look at the whole cluster, and the common experiences of people that fit the category and see if that could shed some light on the way I was reacting to certain situations. On investigation, it made sense to me, and has lead to a lot of insight, and hopefully allowed me to manage my feelings a little better than I was.

These days I have some quite strong critical perspectives on the Mental Health System, having seen it fail so many people over the years. One of the reasons I set u MO30 was as a place where more progressive approaches to mental health and illness might be freely discussed."

34F, diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder at 29, triggered by my dad passing away when I was 28. Really I should have been diagnosed with GAD in my late teen years, but I always explained the obsessive thoughts away as ‚Äújust being a worrier.‚Äù The panic attacks finally forced me to seek help. Then I developed fibromyalgia at 30, most likely as a response to the panic attacks. And finally was diagnosed with moderate depression a couple months ago and started taking an SSRI. I also take vitamin D and B supplements because I was deficient in both and that‚Äôs improved my anxiety some as well.

"It's been a few years since I last worked. In a moment of hypomanic enthusiasm, I decided that now would be a good time to try working again since there are so many work-from-home positions available right now. 

My hypo week is over, but even though I'm not really gung-ho about it anymore I still think it'd be a good idea to try and find something low-key to do maybe 10 hrs/week. Having a scheduled activity is probably good for me.

So, for those of you who went from doing nothing for a long time to working again, how did you handle the transition? Was there anything in particular that helped you deal with suddenly having actual expectations to meet?

In my return, it was a very structured and gradual return. I started doing a project that was related to my career, in my case it was programming. Scheduled it in during the week just like shift work and built on it week after week. 

This does a lot to prepare for a return to work. Builds you ability to concentrate and not become fatigued so quickly. It also builds confidence when you're progressing and seeing the results of your hard work.

You know this but you are thinking ahead, catastrophizing, predicting the future etc etc. That's not realistic. I like to tell myself that the way you feel now doesn't predict future feels. Also those feelings are transient impressions brought to you by your brain which is designed to seek threats.

"I've recently joined the workforce very late in life due to some very extreme problems with depression and anxiety from childhood to today. Before now I've worked for a family business which kept me afloat and I've been working hard on my problems. They're now a thousand times better so I've switched my focus to getting to a normal life including work. 

However since joining the workforce I find myself surrounded by people who are all younger, more experienced and more qualified than me. They have more life experience and are more socially able aswell. My depression and anxiety are coming back hard and being around these people makes me feel so small; instead of being proud of myself or optimistic about my future I'm just reminded of how bad  I let things get and how impossible it will be to catch up.

What makes it worse is the fact that I can't be open about this with colleagues. I've had to weave a web of half truths and outright lies about my past so as to avoid telling them about how bad I was. Partly this is out of shame but mostly from experience of opening up to people and seeing them disappear from my life as they don't want to deal with it. Being forced to work with people who think I'm a freak would be a living nightmare. 

Now at work I'm constantly on the defensive, worried I'll be ""found out"", and feeling like an insect.

You are not ""succeeding"", you're ""recovering"" and ""overcoming"".  That is a GOOD story.  It's as good if not better than the narrative of ""getting ahead"" or ""never making a mistake"".

Your mental health 'vulnerability' will help you see areas that could cause burnout for everyone. Also, how do you know your colleagues don't see you as kind or wise? I bet you are both.

In my 20's I was a tutor in a Very wealthy town. One of the families lived at the top of a mountain in \*literally\* a castle. I was talking with the dad, a high-powered investor and he shared this with me: ""When I hire people, the first thing I ask them is 'tell me about a time when you failed'"". At his level, he wanted to know how people handle adversity; can they admit their missteps; can they be vulnerable; can they bounce back. He was the epitome of successful and he wasn't interested in the easy wins. He would have been captivated by your journey back to the workforce. It would have given him deep respect for your tenacity and persistence.

You may, also, find tremendous relief from sharing \[something\] about mental health, too. You may find others with similar struggles.

"I can completely understand why being around younger people who appear to have it all together makes you feel bad.

It's easy to say, but we cannot compare ourselves to others, they have all had different experiences, upbringings and genetics to deal with. The younger ones around you just started out from a more advantaged position, and you don't see the ones who are doing worse, as they are still at home or not around anymore.

We can only compare ourselves to who we were yesterday, and right now, you are doing better. You have done the best you could with the rough start that you had. Complement yourself on getting a job, you did well. You are worth caring about, so internally talk to yourself the way you would someone else you love.

Internal family systems is starting to make a big difference for me, you can look it up on YouTube for the basics. These critical thoughts are only one part of you, and it doesn't have to be the part you listen to. They are trying to protect a more vulnerable part of you that has been rejected in the past (can't get hurt by new people if you don't work with them). With some work, you should be able to help change these thoughts to be more positive and actually support you."	Feelsmall	reply	na	na	na	0.9986625909805298	weak	strong	no	na	MadOver30	failed

"I want a good day. I really really do.

But every single day, I feel tired, fearful, angry, and depressed. 

I let myself have time to do my own thing, like read, watch some tv, to make myself feel better. But that's really all there is to it. 

There's simply no way for me to turn things around. 

For want of a much better analogy, this is a race which is doomed way before it is over. I pretty much knew it was over 10 years ago, but was fuelled by blind optimism to soldier on. Being in my 30s, it is entirely possible that I have more than 30 years to go. 

There's a timing for things and I missed them every time round. I was serious when I should have been more carefree and enjoyed my childhood and my youth. I was withdrawn and depressed when I should have been more ambitious and courageous in my 20s. In my 30s, I should be responsible, decisive, and experienced - yet I live like a child. My former classmates are mostly married, with children (some even old enough to be starting middle school), reaching the height of their careers. I read about their weddings, their children, them becoming partners in their work or attaining a senior role. None of which I share. 

I've given up on finding a spouse a long long time ago. But my career is also lacklustre. I'm pretty much still at the lowest rung of my career ladder, despite having worked for over a decade. Heart of hearts, in  the long nights when I lie awake in bed, I know I'm not going to succeed in the way I had wanted. 

My consolation is that one day this will all end. All my fears, and disappointment, and sorrows, will certainly come to an end, one day. I just want this day to come asap. Sometimes, in those dark nights, I console myself by thinking that, it really doesn't matter, nothing really matters. I only need to go on for about 20 odd years and outlive my mother. Then I can immediately, unreservedly, kill myself. 

The weather is nice today. I should have stayed home instead of going in the office - as I did not do anything at all which was constructive."	stranger38	post	27.552027111955013	female	White	0.9989385008811951	na	na	na	20	MadOver30	failed

"Definitely üôÇ If you can translate hobbies into paid work, all the better.

For me, I've always regarded work as a necessary evil. Not to be enjoyed, but a means to an end.

Much of that goes back to my upbringing.  My dad stuck it out in a stressful job he didn't particularly enjoy. He would come home and slump in front of the TV, grey, drained. So that was the template I internalised, for better or worse.

I guess I've been wary of trying to convert my interests (I'm artistic, creative) into paid work. My fear is that they will then no longer be enjoyable, reduced to a source of income.

More fool me ... my way means I've ended up in jobs where to some extent I ""switch off"" mentally. I live for the time when I'm not at work.

It isn't all that bad. Life is what you make it, how you perceive it.

But i imagine your way would be more rewarding.

I often wonder if there's something wrong with me. Everyone seems to have some kind of plan, an idea of where they're headed. I've drifted through life, taking opportunities as they've come up, rather than actively taking control and seeking out opportunities.

"I‚Äôm 38. The last 8 months have been hellishly hard. 

In December, my best friend‚Äôs wife passed away from bowel cancer. They have two young sons. 
In late February, I got sick with what I now think may have been coronavirus. Two weeks later in early March, I was sick again, with what felt like the same thing. I quarantined for two weeks, then went back to work (which became working from home due to lockdown). My wife and I were then instructed that our son couldn‚Äôt go to preschool. So both of us working from home with a 3 y/o at home. 

My wife‚Äôs mum then passed away with lung cancer from coronavirus related pneumonia. The following week, her aunt and uncle also passed away. Then a week later we lost a family friend. April 14th, I was put on furlough. Four days later, my second son was born. So, at this point, grieving, furloughed, and stressed trying to keep it together for the sake our our boys. 

Then I‚Äôm guilt tripped by my boss into doing a personal project on furlough. So I begin worrying and find it hard to cope because I‚Äôm tired, stressed, upset, and have the added fear that I‚Äôm not keeping my skills up work wise. 

Then comes the ‚Äúat risk of redundancy‚Äù email. That has now progressed to ‚Äúyour role is being made redundant‚Äù so I am guaranteed to be losing my job at the end of this month. After 12 years, and during the worst possible time. 

I‚Äôm now having nightmares because my industry has no work at the moment and jobs are scarce, and I have a meeting on Friday to discuss the score I received which is arbitrary anyway (and doesn‚Äôt reflect remotely my last two annual reviews). Kind of reaching the end of my tether.

"I've spent the last year or so really focusing on my mental health. I realized not so long ago that all of my issues stem from my dysfunctional family and the enablers in it. I've lived my entire life in denial and avoidance and fear and I'm tired of it. I've decided to make a commitment to myself to improve my life because I cannot live like this any longer.

My original plan was to find myself, and I guess I succeeded. I really hate that my identity is a dysfunctional person. I hate that this is what I'm going to have to deal with for the rest of my life. I wish that I could focus on something that's more interesting. I wish I could be an expert in something that I could eventually do presentations on - this is how I'd like to contribute to society. But I can't do any of that because I'm stuck with dealing with childhood issues and I don't want to become an expert in this area. 

As a result, I've become a very jealous person. 

I'm jealous of people who spend $3k on a guitar because it's their passion.

"What caught my attention from your post is the mention of jealousy. I have become extremely jealous of others, for everything: their youth, or money, or hope, or prospects, etc. 

Those people don't understand what it is like being trapped in despair, in real problems, for forever. Perhaps all they see is this sad, pathetic, middle-aged woman.

">internal family systems

i've never heard of this. i'll check it out thanks!

i gave up and got a therapist for a short time this year and i ended up terminating her. i realized/confirmed for myself that the only person who could help me is me. therapy is only as good as the information that i provide. i also prefer to figure shit out myself because i'm not neurotypical.

i have a hunch on how it might click for me. a few days ago i figured out my core underlying issue. i practically threw a party. it's actually kind of cool because all of the symptoms describe me very well. my goal now is to figure out what specific circumstances trigger those dysfunctional parts of me. cus i'm not 100% dysfunctional. 

once i know my triggers, i'll work on identifying them in real time. my other goal too is to figure out work arounds, on how i can respond functionally. 

i'm also working on figuring out who i am. i've been keeping notes on my thoughts and i found it to be really interesting that 60% of my thoughts encapsulate only 5 topics. 25% of my thoughts are about 1 topic. once those topics get resolved, my brain will have the opportunity to think of new things/not ruminate as much because those issue have been dealt with. 

the other thing too, i've started a list of things that i like/things that i'm good at and i've started combining these things together. so like something that i may want to explore in the future is learning how to shade spherical shapes, which could evolve into drawing/shading furniture or animals.

in any case, if you've read this far i wish you luck. i think if we continue doing what we're doing eventually it'll work out. the only crappy part is that we'll always have to be on our toes to catch our triggers and to monitor our responses... at least that's the way that i see it."	aceshighsays	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9923197627067566	no	strong	no	na	MadOver30	failed

my goal is to figure out what my goal is. my goal is to figure out what i want. my goal is to have a vision and strive for it. i'm completely blank. that is the problem. i'm no where closer to where i was when i started.  that is what's driving me crazy. that's why i'm jealous. i'm jealous of people who know what they want."	aceshighsays	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9923197627067566	no	strong	no	na	MadOver30	failed

"you just reminded me of something that i've been meaning to post.

i've been reading/listening to podcasts and what drives me insane is that many of the presenters/writers are these high achieving individuals who had some kind of a setback but were able to overcome and still be the 1%. what about everyone else? 

like james clear, who wrote atomic habits. i'm only picking on him because today i heard a podcast that he did. he was a star athlete who was injured in high school and had to take a lot of physical therapy after the injury. a few years later he got into a very prestigious sport group. this is what made him realize how important habits were... this story made me NOT want to read his book.

where are all those people who had a difficult childhood from the get go and were able to find themselves and overcome adversary? where are the ""lost children""? where are their stories? 

it's really hard to find like minded people who are on the same path. i feel like consciousness is a range and it's really difficult to find someone on the same range as you and also who had a rough childhood. i'm fairly social and i haven't been able to find anyone that i can connect with like that, but it's also an effect of my trauma. i'm forever going to be self sufficient. i'm forever going to be independent. i just cannot connect with people. i have a lot of surface level relationships, but it's impossible for me to have deep relationships. it's like asking me to grow another arm."	aceshighsays	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9923197627067566	no	strong	no	na	MadOver30	no prediction.

that sounds highly unlikely. i mean, statistically speaking there are millions and millions of people that have lived/live on the planet and not one ""lost child"" found their way? much crazier things have happened. 

i think what's more likely is that the term has changed over the years, like it seems like abandoned child syndrome is another term for it. and it seems like that term itself is fairly new. googling abandoned child syndrome the earliest reference i found was from the mid 70's and nothing else until the 00's. very few references all around. so it doesn't look like much research has gone into it. therefor my best guess is that people just don't know they had it, and were able to solve their own issues."	aceshighsays	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9923197627067566	no	no	no	na	MadOver30	failed

The successful people who had a setback always wanted attention from people, that‚Äôs why they wrote a book about it. That‚Äôs why they do podcasts. All public figures are attention whores.

"I've had the worst of months in the last year or so. Been crammed into a work position I did not want, my overall anxiety (GAD here) hasn't been at its best, and, well, pandemic. Working with my therapist for the past 2 years , I've been on the road to discovering who I am, who I wanted to be and how to make space for myself. It started to pay off actually, my last session with the therapist friday ended up with me saying ""I'm now at the point in life where I have what I asked for in term of needs for me recovery, the summer is going to go well"" and like that, I realized that I just had the best 3 days in a year, mental health wise.

Driving back home, I started to sort mental files. There was one opened that needed immediate attention. Last summer, my wife and I decided to see how the year went to decide if we where to have any kids (the idea was to adopt if we decided so, she's 39, I'm 36, and we both had mental health issues in the last years, and she has physical health concerns too, so it seemed the best option). And I decided, you know what? I'm not willing to have any, not like this. I'm not in a good place mentally, she's not either. And I decided I'd create a space to talk about it saturday. Come saturday, I had a *really* shit morning because of no good reasons, but my mood was dead and it was not one to speak about future and kids.

Sunday morning, I'm having breakfast, and my wife gets up, do norming stuff, comes to see me and accounces she just peed on a stick and she's pregnant.

We've had sex **once** in *at least* 12 months. We just don't get it. But it's there. Blood test confirms, 6 weeks in. It was 5 days ago.

I've been dead inside for the better of those 5 days, I'm sleeping like shit. I know my life is over (my life as I know it), and I'm not ready for this. The only clear decision I made in months was not to have kids, because it (to me at least objectively) wasn't a good idea. And now I'm going to be a dad because she wants to keep it, and let's face it, I have no say in this decision (and I'm ok with it part, it's not my body).

This morning she was in tear because she was pregnant and I am ""not there"".

It's been 5 days, and I already feel like I need to swallow up my own feelings, and deal with it for the good of others.

I can't do this for my now pregnant wife. How the fuck am I supposed to do this for a kid for the rest of my life?

I know it's not *that* bad, but I just can't see how my life is not over. Can't see how it's a good idea. Can't see how we, and her, and I, will survive this. This will just make a not good situation, mentally, worse.

"This film seemed like, to me, the standard anti-med trope. By title alone it establishes that what people are experiencing is completely normal and medication is not needed. Definitely not a responsible opinion when there's plenty of evidence that shows the benefits of psych/anti-depressant/anti-anxiety meds. It's not responsible because people have a hard enough time reaching out for help, messages like the one in this film aren't helpful, and sometimes dangerous.

At least one of the patients profiled in this video went off medication abruptly. But there's not much discussion about that, it seems to just say, ""See his complications. Therefore all these meds are bad.""

Only around 50 minutes in does it even allude to the fact that some people are actually helped by these meds.

It touts several anti-benzo backers but only follows one benzo experience where it appears the patient was not well informed by their doctor. Addictability of benzos is well documented. In my personal experience, doctors were upfront about that and vocal about wanting to stay away from them.

Not being well informed by doctors seems to be the primary plot in most of these stories. If they wanted to stick with that and how pharmaceutical companies promote these meds to doctors, it might have been a legitimate documentary. The heavy implied ""all these meds are bad"" kills it...and that trope kills people, too.

Having struggled with anxiety, depression, OCD, panic attacks, and dissociative episodes for several years...I've made my way through the list of popular SSRIs. I took one for 4 years that helped but also made me very unmotivated and unhappy. So, I tapered off. I tried one briefly that made me extremely angry. So, I told my doctor and we changed meds. I was on them for 4 years, off them for 4 years...but this was all done considering the clearly presented warnings. I'm on an SNRI now and it's been the best thing for me since I started this whole journey. The thing said by doctors, therapists, and friends also on this journey is that no single solution works for everyone. And that's where this documentary fails. The stories presented here are presented as the norm.

The message in this documentary is dangerous.

Irritatingly, the response I've had when I mention this to people promoting and sharing the doc is, ""That's your opinion.""

"I've posted often here, so some of you might already be familiar with my problems. Nevertheless, short summary: decades of depression and failure (long term problems), family bereavement and fire damage to property (more recent problems).

As it has become foreseeable that I would not be seeing my shrink for a long time (I really don't think I can afford it), I've started to stop taking my meds. The meds that I've been prescribed are not really for long-term use anyway: stilnox for sleep and pregabalin for anxiety. I hardly take the latter, but I do take advantage of the former.

I didn't take it last night and I had this really long 'nightmare'. Perhaps nightmare is not the right word, because it felt realistic. It was very prolonged and I simply couldn't wake up. When I eventually woke, I felt deeply depressed and I'm still shaken despite it being already noon.

Perhaps it's side-effects from not taking the meds; perhaps it's just me being too stressed. It goes without saying that I'm trying to stay away from the thought that the dream was prophetic.

Whilst I was commuting to work and staring into the railway, I really wished I would just fall in and die. Certainly not my first choice of death, but at this point, even that felt better than going on. To be clear, I would not jump into tracks - it is a lot of trouble for a lot of people.

"Brain chemistry can make for some really weird vivid dreams/nightmares. Unless you regularly have self-fulfilling dreams, I'd dismiss the idea of this one being anything special.

"I had a prolonged panic attack last night and it was one of the worst ones ever.

On top of being scared by the feeling of being convinced that I'm in the process of an immediate and imminent death, I am also left with a profound despair and deep sense of pain and hopelessness about my life in general, which lingers for hours or days afterwards.

It's exhausting and frightening and it brings me to my fucking KNEES. I'm supposed to carry along and just keep going to work, keep waking up on time and keep hoping for a better future while my inner core is just screaming the absolute opposite of hope.

I am in pain. Deep, life-shattering existential pain, which I have felt for almost 20 years, and it keeps getting worse the older I get (32).

I'm generally ""fine"" during the work days (the anxiety is manageable altho still horrible), but when evenings and weekends roll around it hits me like a shovel to the face and yeah like I mentioned earlier I am routinely brought to my knees, almost literally so. I am scared that I will have to start planning my demise in the near future (either suicide or permanent inpatient care).

 The only hope I have left is to find a medication that works, and that is a hellride which is going to take a few more years...

I know this pain and this despair and this hopelessness. I've been white-knuckling it for years. Tried suicide a few times. Been in the hospitals. Very familiar with the horrible panic attacks. I had to go to the ER on March 27 of this year because I had been panicking for 20 straight hours. Knew I was dying. I've done that a lot of times. I'll probably never get my medical debt paid off. I don't know how to tell you to proceed. For me, it was my faith that kept me alive. It's still very difficult to go on. Anxiety before, during, and after work. I cry every day. I commiserate with you. You are not the only one like this. Maybe it won't take years to get your medication situation sorted. Maybe something good will happen. All I can say, is that if you aren't going to give up, then you have to try to do what you can to be good to yourself (*taking that step to get meds*), or else you'll certainly do nothing but suffer further. I finally got the courage to try therapy again for the first time since 2018. In fact, my first appointment was yesterday. I think it's going to help. I hope so. We are in this together.

Medication - such as benzodiazepines and SSRIs really did help.  But  the biggest help for me was taking a Mindful Based Stress Reduction (MSBR) class.   It may be worth looking into that or seeking out help with ACT therapy too.  

I still have panic attacks, but my relationship to the panic attacks themselves has changed.  I think writing or talking about it is a great way to recognize what you feel.

thank you for these words. yes, i'm white-knuckling it. good term. usually i'm a nanosecond away from shattering into a million pieces out of sheer existential angst. i'm so sorry that you cry every day, i hope it serves as a safety valve to reach some level of emotional catharsis or at least a reset. i'm not religious but i am spiritual and it definitely helps, in fact i think it partially saved my life (perhaps not literally, but it has helped immesnely). i had planned for several years to reveal my mental health issues to my manager in order to feel less alone and to be able to speak freely at work about shitty things, and to be able to go off to therapy and be allowed to do so without risking being fired. and last month i did it. it was a huge relief in that aspect. well actually i told my business manager , i still have to tell my supervisor.... i was gonna tell em this week but i procrastinated it. i'm working on it tho. it could take 4 months to find the right meds but it could take 4 years too. either way i'm not giving up, not yet. i think therapy will help you. i'm glad you got back to it. i haven't been in like 6 years. i'm trying to remind myself that i'm not alone in this. this is precisely why i made the thread. to have some proof that i'm not alone. that in fact i am alive..... i feel like this meaninglessness is caused by feeling that i'm lacking in purpose. i technically i have a purpose, because i work in a service position so i'm helping people every day.... but perhaps it's not enough. i've been thinking a lot about human rights and i'm going to see if i can somehow move into doing that for a living. but i'm not sure if i have the stomach for that stuff. reading about human rights violations absolutely kills me.

"Hey!  So not a big poster and finally saw your reply.  I hope that you‚Äôre doing better in the past few months!  

So, thinking about your response - you‚Äôre right ‚Äî panic attacks totally can pull you down while they are happening. No fun at all.  It just sucks. But on the plus side you‚Äôre not really dying (which would be worse) than just feeling like it!

Feelings are just that - a feeling, or maybe kinda like a ‚Äústicky‚Äù thought, and nothing more.  They don‚Äôt have to be correct, and for me, can be totally wrong. 

I think just realizing panic attacks / anxiety are just an experience that I have from time to time - and allowing myself to accept that - rather than saying  ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt feel this way or it will lead to x and then y and so on‚Äù really was my game changer.  

I spent so much time looking for the magic ‚Äúoff switch‚Äù to panic attacks.  And if I found one and could turn them off, I would! 

So, next best thing is to be kind to yourself and realize that these are transitory experience and only a feeling  - and it‚Äôs ok to feel it. At least that what really helped me. 

As for the meds, they helped me a lot.  And even that takes some patience for things like  SSRIs to kick in.   But good advice on those from your dr. might also give you the boost you need.

"Anyone have insight into reasons why someone would be like this? I can see in some other people, the reason is seeking pity, but I don't even have anyone to pity me to be asking for it. Maybe self-pity? But I feel too self-aware to let that be the reason... though it's possible.

Many people in tough situations use that as motivation to rise above. Instead I push myself further into the shit. If something bad happens, I get depressed and then just stop eating, stop working out, force myself into isolation so I won't meet anyone. Almost like I'm punishing myself.

"Just a few thoughts...
Your second hypothesis - ""I don't know how to life"" - probably has something to do with it on a practical level. Therapy can help with that, but there are workbooks that could also help if you know what you need to work on.

On an emotional level, the self-sabotage is probably related to your self-esteem. Maybe somewhere, deep down, you don't feel like you're good enough for a good life. So, you self-sabotage to deal with the cognitive dissonance. 

If you've never really felt happy it's scary to consider what life would look like if you were. I can imagine anyone needing a roadmap in that situation. Knowing intellectually what's going on won't translate to the emotional work needed to move through it.

">Knowing intellectually what's going on won't translate to the emotional work needed to move through it. 

This statement hit me hard. It's so true. I consider myself quite self-aware and intellectual, if I may say so myself, but I'm learning that this doesn't translate into the emotions required. I am also quite emotional, but it's not the right emotional responses. There's a really big disconnect here and I'm trying so hard to fix it. It's probably due to my past addictions I used to cope... I didn't develop properly somewhere. It's just difficult to find out where. Professional help would be nice, but I can't afford that. So I will look into workbooks - but funny enough, even with that I sabotage. It's almost like I just don't want to put in the work to be fixed because... I'm scared of being happy?

"I am close to a breakdown.

Since my father was hospitalized in December of last year (and subsequently passed in January this year), I‚Äôve accompanied my mother every weekend. Not really doing much. Just grocery shopping, watching tv, etc.

Last night I received a job. I haven‚Äôt had anything to do for a long time, and though it was just an assignment that my colleagues didn‚Äôt want, I took it and I went back to work this morning. I needed the money - so I swallowed my pride when my colleague (younger) handed it to me in an arrogant manner. 

One hour after I was in the office, my mother phoned me and told me that the apartment below us was on fire. She escaped safely and was waiting at a nearby park. I immediately left the office to join her.

Hours later when we were finally able to go home, we found several of our windows had cracked, there was some wall damage, and an air-conditioner destroyed. I sought a quotation from the shops and it amounts to about USD$2,500 to fix everything. 

We have home insurance. I don‚Äôt really know how to file a claim. In any event I guess it‚Äôd take a long time to process and probably wouldn‚Äôt be full compensation. 

I‚Äôm so very very tired. I am of course relieve that my mother is well and unharmed. I know that things could be worse. I know the ppl in the apartment that had the fire is suffering much more than I do. But still. 

My financial situation has been bad for a long time. I tried to feel better that I finally had work. But my earnings from it wouldn‚Äôt even cover the repair works. I tried to stay positive for my mother - so that she wouldn‚Äôt worry.

"I had this amazing high last week, I was feeling confident, strong  and like I was on the right path. Somehow this week I fell back into a bit of depression. I'm not sure exactly what brought it on, but I keep pushing myself and pushing myself hoping that feeling will come back but that depressing cloud is hanging in the back of my mind. My only support system right now is my best friend that I live with. On monday I get evaluated for a new therapist covered by my insurance to meet regularly with. I was using an online therapist for a while but it was costing me almost 30$ a week and working a minimum wage job wasnt making it possible for me to keep up the payments. 

My mother passed when I was 15 years old and it caused my severe depression for over 16 years. This was made worse by the fact that I had an extremely manipulative and emotionally and verbally abusive step mother and bio father (see my previous posts history if you want an example). After I officially cut them out of my life 6 months ago, I was feeling free and happy for the first time in my life and things seemed to be going well until the last few days ago. I saw groups of friends walking by at work and couples walking together and I wanted that so badly. To be apart of a social group of people who actually enjoy having me around.

I've tried support groups both online and in real life, dating/social networking/friend making apps, meetups, events, protests, forums, and plain walking outside and just talking to random people. I'm always polite and try to ask people about themselves, listen to them and try to be engaging. Yet I never get that ""Hey you seem cool want to hang out some time?"" Of course, Ive tried being on the offensive and getting peoples phone numbers,  trying to plan meetups etc. At best we hang out maybe 2 or 3 times before they suddenly just up and disappear from my life and I never hear from them again. I hear people tell me about the group texts and chats they are in or about the plans they have with a group of friends this weekend, and I smile and I'm genuinely excited excited for them! But in the back of my mind I'm thinking ""Man I'd LOVE to be apart of that!"" And yet..it never happens. Sorry for the long post guys.

Do you feel ignored by the government for not getting better than one $1200 payment? We have all the expenses any other household has plus a lot they don't. I recently had surgery and can't get out, yet I can't afford to go to the doctor for follow up, order groceries and/or pay basic bills. My depression has plummeted. I sleep on avg about 20 hours a day and have virtually no appetite. My cell service was disconnected during a pandemic with almost no warning.

"there are good and bad therapists.

therapists work from different 'schools' of therapy. some approaches will work better with some clients, others (ie therapists using a different 'school') will be more beneficial for others

the relationship matters. If you feel like theres a click there, its a good start. conversely, if, after some number of sessions (or just one) you feel like they arent the right fit for you then they probably arent and the smar move might be to move on and find someone that does

you are the boss of the sessions. Its really important to keep this in mind. If the therapist is doing things you find useful, tell them they are being helpful with that approach. Conversely, if you are feeling uncomfortable, or upset by something they are asking you about, you absolutely have the prerogative to tell them its not helpful, or to tread lightly with that topic, or to handle it differently.

Be wary of therapists who like to talk or offer advice / opinions about your life. Unfortunately there are a number of people working in the field who are there to soapbox their pet ideas about certain issues. A good therapist should be asking you questions, and helping you to find your own answers to the issues you are dealing with, not telling you what they think you should do. 

If you are feelin exhausted or emotionally crushed after therapy sessions, and arent seeing any lights coming on in the process, its not good therapy. Unfortunately there are still a lot of practitioners and clients out there that think 'no pain no gain'. Therapy shouldnt have to mess with your wellbeing in order to help you. Really good sessions should result in you having a bunch of fresh insights on things you have been stuck on, and feeling stronger or better about yourself should not be out of the question.

If 1:1 therapy just doesnt work for you (it doesnt for some people), consider group. Its a totally different experience and peer support can offer some things that 1:1 cant. Im not saying its 'better' and im not saying 1:1 isnt good. Just that its an alternative a lot of people dont explore because so much emphasis is placed on individual sessions. They arent necessarily the be-all and end- all for everyone.

"I'm over thirty and it's too late. 
I should have building blocks I can use to base my life on but I feel like I have nothing. 
I can't get motivated, I try something new but it's hard, I can't do it, it reminds me of what a total fuck up loser I am and I meltdown. 
Even other people doing something positive can trigger me. A friend I live with is learning how to Forex trade and it got me thinking about the difference between me and him. He can see a life where he's happy, he gets what he wants and he has the faith in himself that he can learn and move forward. I can't, or it takes me so long that I get frustrated and meltdown. 
Or I just can't focus and get on with it. 
Nothing makes me feel better, I've lost all drive and passion because everything's become about trying to avoid the spiral of depression and anxiety. 
But everyone's going to leave me behind. 
I'm the oldest in my friendship group and by far the least accomplished. I have to spend so much goddamn fucking energy just to stop me from feeling like it would be better to kill myself. I had some small early successes but it never led to anything and now I'm stuck, with the best part of my life behind me already. No future. No hope. 

Its just a waiting game now until enough people move on with their lives away from me and I'm left with nothing, no-one and no hope for change. Then I'll inevitably jump in front of a train or something. 
Sometimes I fantasize about dying in an accident and becoming another statistic. I might be able to help people then. As an example, or an inspiration to someone to help people.

Other than that, make sure you're doing everything the right way outside of work. Take your meds, go to your therapy, eat well, exercise, and socialize. It's easier to tackle one problem at a time than have others pile up. 

Finally, be patient and forgiving with yourself. Your only concern, i think, is the effort you put in to fulfilling your obligations. You can find a lot of relief by simply doing the best you can.

"THIS. This same thing happened at my previous job, during a period of time that I was in and out of eating disorder treatment. The stress of the job plus the fact that there were no structured breaks for employees made it difficult to implement many of the things I should have been doing for recovery, and anywhere from weeks to a couple years, I'd wind up back in inpatient. Not that I blame this on my previous job...but some things about it just didn't help my situation.

AND 99% of the time, i would go back and immediately start working 40-hour work weeks. I had a couple managers who were emotionally intelligent enough to talk with me and ask ""Do you want me to take you off overnights/not work overtime for a while?""...but inevitably someone would call in sick, or there would be need for extra staff. Because my previous doctor never gave me any formal restrictions for returning to work, and because I felt a deep sense of guilt of missing work every time I went to treatment, I would usually quickly find myself working overtime and overnight shifts. Thankfully at my current job I don't have to worry about overnights, and we seldom are given permission to work overtime. 

But I definitely see what you mean about the time period after you discharge being so pivotal in your success outside the hospital, in the ""real world""...that truly is when you start to build/re-build foundational skills...I don't think I could have said that better myself.

I'm working with a psychologist/""return to work coach"" through my company's EAP, but so far I've only had one session.

And I think that's some solid advice right there...as the previous comment said, coming out of the hospital is when the real work begins, i.e. rebuilding your foundational skills, making sure your most basic human needs are being met, developing some structure in your life.

My therapist is attractive. He's a man and I'm a straight woman. I'm losing interest in my boyfriend because frankly the therapist is easier to talk to. I've pretty much decided to try and get with my therapist once he resumes in-person sessions. We already have an emotional connection so a physical connection would obviously follow.

My friends and family are nice but they don't understand me as well as my therapist does, so why should I keep having them in my life? Why should I have someone in my life who can get a B+ in one aspect of my life when I have someone else (my therapist) who gets an A+ in every part of me?

"If your therapist is even a remotely decent human being they will not 'fuck you' while you are a client. There are good reasons for this, which Im sure they will explain to you if you raise your interest with them.

The correct procedure if you both, as consenting adults, do decide to see each other, is to end the therapy. The therapist is professionally and ethically required to initiate this.

This would normally entail a referral to another therapist for the client so that the sexual relationship does not curtail the therapy.Consequences for therapists who do 'fuck clients' vary but can be professionally damaging. I hope you are considering this in what you are thinking of doing.

A simple google search for ethics sex therapist should provide ample information about why this it would be highly problematic for a therapist to have sex with a client and attempt to keep providing them with paid therapy. The short story is, its potentially harmful to the client. Its certainly a really good way to kill most of the positive aspects of any positive therapeutic relationship that may have existed prior.

When I was a therapist I did have clients make passes at me. Its not that unusual. Let me be frank with you as you seem really to not understand some of the necessary mechanics here. Your therapist is not your friend. They are a person who is paid to listen to you talk (often this means 'complain') bout your life and to help you find new ways of thinkng about it. Its actually intellectually and emotionaly hard and sometimes very challenging work. Thats why they get paid. Because its a job, that takes work and effort and is demanding of the person doing it. It can be psychologically draining, and its various associated human services professions can have significant professional burnout rates because of this.

Therapists when they are not working, are generally not looking to 'do therapy' for their partners /  friends / family. Sure, elements of that type of relational stuff can be present, but its not the same thing as formal sessions where they are at work and paid to be there. It just doesnt work like that. The whole basis of therapy is the formality of the relationship, the strict impartiality of the process.

"It's weird that time flies by, even when I'm depressed.

Perhaps one of the reasons of my depression is of time gone and wasted. 

I never fitted into my age group. I was an adult when I was a child. And I'm a teenager as a middle-aged woman (not in any of the good ways - I was referring to the confusion, delusions, depression, lack of direction, etc). 

And I'm never gonna get back lost time. I would never have the carefree childhood, the teenage milestones, the freedom of a 20-something, that I craved. 

What I should deal with is the responsibilities of a 30-something; and the acceptance of life, as it is. That, this is as good as it gets, and that I should really really find something, whatever it is, to be grateful for, so as to avoid losing my mind. I was never the kind to appreciate the small things. I find that rather demoralising. But unless I start becoming grateful for air, water, etc., I really have nothing. 

In front of me is just deterioration. I have no spouse or children, so there is no further 'life' to speak of (not that I'm complaining - my life would be much worse had I had children). My life goal is to outlive my mother to prevent her from suffering the loss of me. Not that I consider myself benefitting her in anyway. I've done the math (literally. my very expensive tuition fees and the fact that I continue to live with her) - she would have been much, much better off had I not been her child. But for my existence, she would have had the means to acquire 2 properties for rental profit. Which means she would have had much more security in her old age than, well, having me around.

Your mother chose to have you and clearly cares. It's not your job to have made that worth it for her or not. You don't know what her life would have been without you. It's great you want to outlive her and prevent her suffering. Just remember, she chose to have you, clearly loves you and if you respect her as a relatively smart person then there's probably a reason. Spend the rest of your life (before and after your mother) discovering why she loves you and why you should love you.

Our brains tend to pay more attention to negative things, to keep us safe. But when you're in a depressive state, it can become really really hard to look past the negatives.

"As an introvert in self-quarantine due to a pandemic, the \*showing up\* part mentioned by others is the hardest. I love my house, family, and pets. I'm perfectly happy, sometimes, with the thought of staying home forever. But I know eventually I'll get depressed and fearful in my near-agoraphobia. When it feels safe to gather with people again I know I need to, for my mental health, if nothing else.

A couple of years ago I had to dig myself out of a similar hole. I found a group of like-minded people (atheists and freethinkers) and just jumped in. Started attending their social meet-ups and informational meetings, eventually starting a sub-group of my own, focused on a mutual hobby that wasn't being addressed in any of the other sub-groups (fiber arts and other handcrafts). We talk in a Facebook group and, before the pandemic, met twice a month in a room at the library to show off our projects, socialize, and form friendships. It was really working. When our group first started it wasn't unusual for just one other person to show up for our meetings. But now, the FB group has 32 members and meetings would have 6 to 8 turn up. It took 2+ years, but I feel like I have that core group of 5 or 6 friends to hang with and chat about something we all enjoy, and about everything else. 

Truth be told, we haven't kept in touch very well since people started getting sick and having to isolate and quarantine. Nothing like a pandemic to derail one's social life. When the library opens their meeting rooms again, and my group feels safe getting together, we'll start over. We must. I must, or this pandemic and my social awkwardness will gain control and my life will remain very small and narrow.

"How come you don't have those friends now?
Moved away? They settled for family and kids?

I know how it is. On top of that I have moved countries a few times. It is hard every time to build up a new social circle, but I have done it 3 times now.

First of all, it takes time and with age gets harder. But that's ok. The good thing to understand is though that there is other people like you, looking/longing for a bestie to hang and do things with etc. It's just a matter of finding them.

The other aspect is that it is an active thing YOU need to do. You need to pick up your phone and text, come up with ideas and invite, look up cool things to do. 
I would start with doing things that you like. There you will find like-minded people. Be it a sport or board games or a music genre.
At those you can get chatting with people. Over time you might recognise some faces and why not suggest after ""hey, fancy going for a beer after training? We could also ask Jacky and a few others?"". 

Activities at are relatively good for this as you are doing something, often have to talk anyway with each other because of the activity and don't get nervous/stuck in your head as you're just there to do this activity. Think dance classes, mixed sports like Beach volleyball or tag frisbee, board game clubs...

Last one, this doesn't happen over night. You gotta keep showing up to the same place, so your face becomes familiar. The other people are just as shy as you (not implying you are) and also need time to warm up. ;)

"Ive been off work for a few years since my brain kind of broke down and landed me in hospital. These days I generally do pretty well on a regimen of meds, diet, exercise. I do still have the occasional bad day, or sometimes a few days. Most of the time Im doing pretty well.

The main danger to my mental wellbeing is stress.

There are a couple of things that will trigger it, and then I get stressed, spiral and crash. So I have to be careful to stay away from the triggers as much as possible.

This much I know.

I think though, that I am gradually going downhill because my life has become so bloody insulated from 'normal activities' (like work). Generally I have waaay too much time on my hands and I think thats starting to take a toll on me. I feel useless, which, I think, would be bad for just about anyone.

So, I need some kind of meaningful activity.

Ive tried all the hobby and group type things, and none of them really stuck. I keep coming back to work as being probably the most reliable way of feeling useful, and having a reason to get up each day.

Problem is, stress.

When I get stressed I want to kill myself. The more stress I am under, the more I am at risk. Even with all the meds, diet, exercise therapy, and all the other self-care stuff - bloody years of it - I seem stuck with this reflex. I really, really want to die when I get upset, and Im pretty likely, I think, to do something stupid.

So I dont know what to do with myself.

Please wise fellow Mental People of reddit (This term is meant with humor and affection), those of you who have experience of taming this work/illness Dragon, tell me how might I think of going about it?

Thats  turning out to be a much longer process than I expected, and now, after 3  years, Im still adapting to the changes and feel like I still have a  really long way to getting used to how I am now.

"I had a breakdown about 7 years ago. After about 2 years, some meds and some therapy, I convinced myself that I was ready to go back to work. I just felt like I *had* to work, I had to earn my way, ""make it"" by myself or my life wasn't worth anything.  I felt like i was ready, I was more stable than I'd been for a while, I'd finally gotten a diagnosis, therapy, and meds. I lasted a year and a half until I had another breakdown. I can never work again, my brain simply doesn't function like it used to.  Work is stress, whether you like your job or not. I would suggest using a very great amount of caution if you are thinking about trying to work. Perhaps try to volunteer somewhere instead, like the local animal shelter, or with the elderly. Ask someone for a set schedule, a few hours a week, or specific goals for you to meet, something to make it a bit more like a job. See how you do for a while. If things go well, then try a very part time paying job. Stay in therapy, and don't rush it. Take care of you first. Good luck to you."

"I was on disability, graduated college went to work, got off disability, had a huge breakdown and am back on disability. I was completely unable to work for a while. Now, I am working part time and still able to keep my disability. I am terrified that someday I will be told I have to work full time and I will lose my disability. 

I really like my job. I am an essential worker, so I still have my job even with Covid going on. I fill online orders for a grocery store. We have gotten much busier and we had to hire many more online shoppers. I am a bit sad/stressed that my job has changed and I have come to terms with the fact that it will never go back to the way it was. 

I got my job through a job coach. My work knows that I can't work too many hours and they are super willing to work with me on schedule etc.  Right now, with Covid, it may be hard to enter the workforce.

"I'd like to suggest volunteering in a field you would consider as a career.  Volunteering takes away some of the make income=lose benefits stress and may be more flexible about needing to take mental health days so you can see how much you are able to truly fulfill commitments of time you have made.  You may find that you do just fine and can use the volunteer experience as a stepping stone to employment, or that you are too ""unreliable"" (which just means you are ill more often than the job can accommodate) and paid employment is too much of a risk.  Specifically, look at peer support clubhouses for people with mental illness, you might be a great mentor for someone struggling with issues you've coped with.  Or administrative support for a non-profit to get office skills experience. Voc Rehab is a resource to place you in slots to get work experience, but I'd only do that if you are unable to arrange something yourself.  There are benefits to VR, but sometimes having to take what they have available isn't worth passing up on opportunities you can find yourself.  However, being officially affiliated with VR can get you access to resources to fix a car you need for a job, buy dentures so you are more successful on interviews, get help with childcare (all examples of situations I've helped clients get as a mental health social worker, going to be very state and local agency dependent, and even depend on individual case workers experience and motivation).

"Seconding this as an excellent plan, and adding my two cents.

 There's a lot of moving pieces in the world right now, and even attempting to find a job right now could be more stress than you could ever want. As someone who has managed to stay employed through covid-19...so far....  

The work environment and the job market are completely alien places right now, simply because no one has any idea what's going to happen.

 Its literally frightening at times, both from the risk of illness, and everything else that's happening. People are on short fuses because they are afraid. 

If you're from the US, financially this probably wouldn't be the time to even consider dropping off disability. If you have it, you already know how difficult it can be to get. Volunteering can give you the satisfaction without the risk to your income and insurance.

"I never used to be like this (Im male, not that it should make any difference really, but I do believe theres more social pressure on us not to cry, especially in public, or even in front of others).

So I just dont talk about them, because I just cant feel comfortable crying in front of others (even my wife). I know that probably sounds fucked up - maybe it is - I dont know. I can intellectualise that its stupid that I feel so uncomfortable and that its also completely unnecessary because crying is a perfectly reasonable human response to pain and loss. I guess Im just not wired to do it in front of others. The embarrassment is too much. Fuck that.

In answer to your question, as a younger person, I almost never cried. I think once - when my mum died I was about 27 and I cried. It was the only time.

I know it was a bad idea to stop on my own but the anxiety was too much. I am pre-diabetic and take Metformin which made me fearful of the medicine since it can raise blood sugar. With Metformin and exercise my labs are good. However both of my parents had diabetes and suffered terribly with it and I fear ending up the same way. Remeron took my motivation to exercise away and I slept around 10 hours a night. The only thing I enjoyed about it was the vivid dreams. I have a follow-up in a few days and am dreading telling her I quit. Especially since I am a new patient. I am treatment resistant so I expect her to get frustrated. I still take Lamictal and a small dose of Wellbutrin daily but feel more depressed than ever. Also, I took the Genesight test and I only process one drug normally. I'm not sure how valid that really is for treatment, though.	the_noise_we_made	post	30.37680306776523	female	White	0.999182403087616	na	na	na	11	MadOver30	no prediction.
Remeron had other side effects I couldn't deal with (one dose made me sleep for like 3 days @_@) and I stopped after the first dose. Treatment resistant as well. But I went in, told them what happened and we agreed I should try a different medication to see if it works out better. No anger, no issue, just another appointment. Hopefully yours goes the same. Psych professionals showing frustration like that is rather unprofessional anyway. Like it isn't hard enough already trying to deal with whatever we needed treatment for. If your doc tends to act this way, it's a good idea to find another. But when I was newer to treatment, I had similar fears because of how I had been treated by others in the past. Hopefully your doctor will take it in stride. It's a pretty common thing to happen. I lost count of how many different medications I tried before I found the one for me (Lexapro, takes the edge off my anxiety along with the depression), but it was at LEAST 10. Yeah, we are supposed to ask first, but not all side effects are tolerable enough for it to make sense to wait until we can ask them to stop taking the med in question.	the_noise_we_made	reply	na	na	na	0.999182403087616	no	strong	no	na	MadOver30	no prediction.
It‚Äôs very rare for it to cause an elevated blood sugar however since you are on Metformin that‚Äôs what we would use to prevent any problems so in general you should take Remeron without any difficulty.

Medication used to treat PTSD such as praosin and or Topamax can help with nightmares and ability to sleep which then have a tendency to reduce your flashbacks and intrusive memories. The newer antidepressants seem to be somewhat better such as Trintellix. In regards to the older medications Lexapro and Pristiq in higher doses than average can have a good effect.

I'm with you on both the mistrust as well as the need for something more than nothing. I went, and while now sometimes I feel like I'm in the carousel of halfass treatment, it helped more than my depressed brain was trying to lead me to believe ahead of time. Sleep meds were a big mistrust deal for me, but my god an uninterrupted night's sleep has gone from a fantasy to a nightly thing and that's huge. It didn't fix anything though, I'd still welcome a lightning strike, but that's my life journey. I will say that my mom's experience with medication, combined with my own history with chemical abuse, and my own observations of the lack of efficacy of antidepressants, made an argument against seeking treatment that seemed really strong in my head, and really dumb when typed out.

Psychiatrist can be a good vent, if nothing else; it really depends from person to person (the docs I mean). A lot of them are jaded or lost in their own problems. Trying can't hurt on this situation, but do extensive research on anything they prescribe you.

Thanks. I had intense psychiatric treatment during my late teens and early 20s (whilst in university), and sporadic treatment act 2-3 years ago.

"I am on the same boat as you are. Seems like you are feeling anxious right now!? For me the struggle is I just want to finish tasks and get things off my list more than anything. So small things that get in the way make me spiral and it‚Äôs retrospect it seems so silly.
A few things have helped me: therapy , I‚Äôve been doing it regularly for 1.5 years now and it‚Äôs helped immensely to understand myself better. Yoga : I‚Äôve been doing this for 6 Months, initially just once a week in an online class but now I try to do it myself every weekday. Try choosing a hobby that helps you relax and something you can focus on without any planning or effort. My small garden helps me here, it‚Äôs not big that it‚Äôs overwhelming and it gives me a lot of joy. I‚Äôve also tried acrylic painting. I also cook something new.

When things pile up chalk it down to a bad day and don‚Äôt badger yourself. Everyone has a bad day once in a while. It‚Äôs important to acknowledge the bad day and then say okay tomorrow is another day altogether.

"let me ask you u/tj_bhm and u/evhan55 and anyone else, how can a SO support someone with anxiety like this? If you have a SO, have they been an overall benefit to your treatment/recovery?

My SO gets anxious sometimes. I've read a few self-help books and have been working on my communication skills so I can be an active listener and validate what they're saying. I try to do something meaningful with them every day since we're in isolation and can't do much else (art, baking, sitting outside, whatever.)

I agree that therapy helps immensely, I have been going for five years now (both CBT and somatic) and it transformed many things for me. Also agree on the small garden, yoga, and painting: check, check and check! I haven't been so good about the yoga lately so this is a great reminder to try again.

Thank you for the reminder, too, that some days are just bad days. I do feel like I am finally reaching that point where a bad day is accepted and acknowledged, and I am even able to express it to my husband which is a huge improvement. Also, quarantine is happening so I should cut myself some slack too. Social isolation at this severity is bound to cause destabilization. Also I'm trying to lean into wearing earplugs if noise is extra bad some days.

"So it‚Äôs been a very hard journey for me. Initially when I met my SO I completely unburdened on him and expected him to be totally empathetic. My SO is my polar opposite so he doesn‚Äôt understand anxiety or depression at all. And that  infuriated me further. He also contributed to my anxiety and worries because of severe financial mismanagement . I then had a baby and anxiety in the first year was through the roof. I felt everything collapsing around me.
That‚Äôs when I decided to do regular therapy and I found an amazing therapist. Slow and really patient . It took me almost a year to have any sort of clear breakthrough . Since then my relationship has improved significantly. The fog and mistrust was basically anxiety. Anxiety doesn‚Äôt help you see the picture clearly.

"That's so lovely of you!! Your SO is very lucky to have you. My SO has his own issues so when I first had my mental breakdown he didn't take it well and he thought I was abandoning him. He invalidated my feelings, made me feel bad about them, and overall made the beginning of my recovery much harder. This complication of triggerings on both sides could be one of the reasons SOs aren't always mentioned in someone's recovery? It really takes a strong person (like you sound to be!) to be a support structure..... just like a building needs strong supports I guess.

Anyhow to answer your question, things that would have helped me, and some which my SO now does:

1. Listening and validating feelings is the most important for me, instead of nervously offering solutions trying to ""fix"" the person

2. Asking what they need

3. HUGS!!! and body contact

4. If they can't tell you what they need, try guessing and just doing it without waiting, bring blankets, tea, make them comfortable

5. Support them in their own ideas to seek help such as therapy or medical visits

6. Ask around or read up on their condition

7. Make sure you are feeling secure and comfortable as well, the more secure you are the more you can help from a place of empowerment ‚ù§Ô∏èüíôüíú

"thanks man, I am glad your SO has started to be more conducive to your recovery. Honestly I started out also being unhelpful: I love solving problems and my love language is acts of service, so often times I'd be like ""You told me about Problem A, here's some possible solutions along with probable outcomes and risks involved in implementing each solution."" when what she really wanted was a sympathetic ear. 

Not to say problem-solving isn't well-intentioned. My thought process was something like ""I love this woman and Issue A is causing her angst. I want my SO to be happy so here is the most efficient solution"" which isn't necessarily bad, it's just not the best tool for the job. 

Probably since isolation began I have been working on myself. I have always been a self-reliant guy. Realized I had many of the typical man problems: not in touch with feelings, cannot talk about issues, etc. Started mood tracking and journaling and now I can talk about those concerns in a non-judgmental way. 

Now instead of solving problems I say things like ""Wow, this issue you're dealing with is a real doozy. I know it's challenging for you because X, Y, and Z. But I like that you addressed it with A, B, and C. Those are coping mechanisms you've really been improving lately!"" It's nice to be seen when you're making progress.

"Not at all! Look, in my case, I‚Äôm working with people who have had an injury or illness that‚Äôs sidelined them from life, right? Could have been a stroke, or a hip replacement, or a spinal cord injury, MS, COVID...any number of things that make them unable to function at the level they were at prior, or want to be at. (The ETA at the bottom has the best example). 

I can‚Äôt wave a magic wand and make them better. If I could, I‚Äôd be making a lot more money and probably working for the government somewhere. No. It takes work. Generally, hard work. I only come 1-2x/week (thanks, Medicare) so a lot of their recovery is on them. 

There are some folks that work really hard, and they do really well. I‚Äôve got a guy who had a stroke a year ago, and he is absolutely kicking ass. Why? Because he‚Äôs putting the effort in both when I‚Äôm there and when I‚Äôm not. 

I have some folks that make excuse after excuse. They don‚Äôt let me come out, and when I do, they refuse to work. I‚Äôm not a monster...I meet you at your level, and of course everyone has days where they just aren‚Äôt up to it. That‚Äôs fine. But if my 96 year old who was just out of the hospital with double pneumonia is willing to *try*, I expect the same willingness to *try* from my otherwise healthy 60 year old knee replacement. Because without that effort, my friend you‚Äôre in for a lifetime of pain. 

So that‚Äôs what the saying means. It doesn‚Äôt benefit (or cover) MY ass at all. All I have to do is document that the 60 year old is non-compliment, has been refusing visits and not participating when he allows me to come out. Make sure that I write how much and what I educated him on, and the third time he cancels, I discharge him. Not my call- Medicare standard. The only benefit I‚Äôm getting out of visits to a non-compliment patient is the $0.39 per mile they pay me to get to his house.

ETA: my stroke guy wants to be able to use his hand again. It‚Äôs a tricky issue because he has one of two things that are keeping him from using it, and it‚Äôs honestly probably a mixture of the two. If it‚Äôs more one than the other, he probably won‚Äôt get much function out of it. That‚Äôs an unfortunate reality of stroke, but we can work around that and he can live a pretty full and independent life. If it‚Äôs more the other than the one, we can probably get some function back. Neat! Unfortunately, we won‚Äôt know until *after* he‚Äôs put in the (often quite painful) work.

The vast majority of people I know with a mental illness are trying. Both in the sense of having attempted different strategies and in terms of effort.

"Recently, I was reading about Andrea Circle Bear. An American Indian who gave birth while in a coma in prison and died of the virus. But it's not about this situation I want to speak. Andrea had 5 children at 26 years of age. That got me thinking about a girl I dated.

This girl, we'll call her Sally, was 16 and had a big scar across her face. Sally tried to initiate sex on our first date. No, we didn't... I was too shy, but it made me ask her why and she replied it was the only way to get the guys attention. Think about that. Guys only were interested in her for sex. Her scar didn't phase me and we continued to date. I really liked her, but it makes me feel bad for girls like her.

When you read about a poor younger girl with multiple kids, do you just get angry or do you ask why she has so many children in the first place? It could be she just wants to be loved and either getting intimate is the only way to attract guys or she associates sex with love. Did Andrea have 5 kids bc sex was the only way to get the attention she craved? Is she to blame or are the guys who used her? How many girls are growing up in dysfunctional homes and try to fulfill a void the only way they know how? Why and how are we failing them?

I don't have any answers. Guys don't have this option... we become incels. No matter how long you go without sex or love, you never stop craving the affection. Eventually you may question your worthiness to be loved and/or question what you have to offer. A feeling I know all too well. I haven't dated in forty years. I am used to being alone. That doesn't mean I don't crave affection, I do, but I don't see me as dating material anymore.

So the next time you read about a poor girl on welfare with several kids, ask yourself, does she deserve your scorn or your sympathy?"		post	29.06763087512291	female	White	0.010376806370913982	na	na	na	5	MadOver30	"ethnicity: no prediction, age: 60s, gender: male, explanation: the author mentions not dating for forty years, which suggests that he might be in his late 50s to early 60s considering that he mentioned dating when he was younger. the use of words ""we become incels"" suggests that the writer is male. no specific cultural or ethnic references are made in the passage to aid in determining their ethnicity."

"Maybe it's because I used to go to church and my mother truly believed in all those things. Maybe it's because of the post operation ""blues"" and the heavy medications.

Yesterday I gave a lot of clothes to a family who lost their house for a fire in the neighborhood. When I woke up this morning I saw that very little wardrobe is left for me.

"Confession time. I have a rather thin skin. I don't get angry, I get depressed. It comes from being autistic and having a low sense of selfworth. A little background. I tried removing some callous, cut my foot, it got infected and was amputated. I live on the second floor and can't get my wheelchair down the stairs, so I need to move. Now to complicate things, I've developed a foot ulcer in the same foot that threatens to take what's left. I have a GoFundMe I have been promoting on Twitter for some time. So far, I have gotten one donation.

Last night, a lady I've never seen on my feed, posted her need for donations. Apparently, she has a lot of friends, bc it went around like wildfire with people offering to help. This does nothing for my self-esteem. I already feel worthless. I bailed on Twitter. I guess I have to accept that no one will help me and I will stuck in this apartment when I lose the foot. I also have a issue with chronic dizziness and am subject to falling a lot. I should blame myself bc I am a loner with no friends. It's the price I have to pay.

A guy loses his job for protesting and gets tens of thousands in his GoFundMe. He can get another job. I can't get another foot. I wanted to sue the manufacturer, but no lawyer would take my case.

"Please pardon and incoherent brain dump.  I'm really shaken up right now and I just need to vent.  Was hoping to post anonymously but don't want to take the time to create an alt account.  Not sure if having panic attack.

As you can imagine homeschooling is pretty rough right now.  Working with my 8 yr old son on math just this morning and it took him 2 hrs or more to get through a 7 question math practice exercise dealing with plot graphs on Kahn Academy.  No matter how much I stress reading the entire question and understanding what the question is asking before answering, he just doesn't do that.  So he answers the question with partial understanding, gets the answer wrong, throws a fit, rinse repeat.  I get it.  But I don't.  He gets frustrated, I get frustrated.  We're all frustrated.  My voice gets elevated.

I have ADHD.  Emotional regulation is something I struggle with.  I have a psychiatrist PA I talk with once a month.  Was also diagnosed with severe depression, or another mood disorder.  Don't think we ever explored mood disorders deeper than saying there was one.  I think the thinking was that if we can get a handle on ADHD then we could address everything else.  Wife thinks I have bipolar II.  

After the so much fighting about reading and understanding the question to the math problem I realized I needed a time out and was going to get in the car and just drive.  The thoughts of throwing myself into a reservoir freaked me out and I locked myself in a bedroom to keep myself from doing something stupid.  Wtf.  I'm still trying to process why I even went there.  I'm still freaking out.

Wrote my PA saying we desperately need to figure out this mood disorder and find some sort of therapy.  He has encouraged me to seek talking therapy but I freeze when looking at the list of possible psychologists.  How do you choose one?  Which one will accept my insurance.?  I don't need talking therapy.  I'm not depressed.  I am so depressed.  

Finally I don't feel like I'm going to do something stupid so I got in the car and left the house.  Don't know where I am going.  Just need to go somewhere quiet.  Somewhere peaceful.  

I found a quiet neighborhood to park in and now I'm typing this out.  I know I need to talk about this with my wife but I don't have anything to be depressed about right?

"This is embarrassing, but I'm a grown man, early 30s... still living at home. I was supposed to become a writer about 10 years ago. Although I wrote a tiny bit, what I really did was isolate myself socially, and slip into this low-level depression and waste over a decade of my life just doing whatever. A lot of internet surfing really. I got caught up in porn addiction (approaching 2 years sobriety by some miracle), online ""relationships"", chatting in general, YouTube, TV shows, movies... the only real productive thing I did was go to a gym regularly. I do have a natural curiosity about things, so I did learn a bunch of random things here and there to the point where I can usually converse about anything.

Any way, I suppose I have a lot of anxiety. I'm quite attached to my parents, even though for many years I barely interacted with them... I was hung up on this idea of becoming a wealthy writer then taking care of them and getting to know them, and getting my own place close by and marrying and having kids. But at the same time, I think there may be a scary truth in that, I really just fell in love with a fantasy to cope with my existential depression. I don't know if I ever would have been able to even pursue any of that. 

My parents are seniors, had me late in life. And now they're falling apart, and one has terminal cancer, and the depression of it all is taking me, and it's just hitting me that they'll die without me having made anything of my life to make them proud, without me getting to experience what I had envisioned for them, without me ever wanting to move out and leave the other one living alone, and without me even having any desire to do anything anymore.

Sometimes I slip into this frenzy mode of let me buckle down and just put out a great piece of work and maybe I can salvage this all in the end. But then the anxiety of even starting on my ideas or not making it in time and whatnot just cripples me. Not to mention the delusion of even thinking I could do that!

There are also so many other issues involved... but I think it mostly all boils down to existential depression. I'm paralyzed in fear of my own existence and mortality. My only real drive to live/purpose was to make my parents happy and to somehow create an ideal relationship with them. And I've pretty much failed. Yet even if I did ""make it"", their death would have still ruined me eventually. I can't leave them alone, and when they're gone, I will just be this depressed mess stuck in one place.

I went back and added random sentences and was a bit repetitive, so I apologize if that was a confusing read. It's just a blurb of me trying to explain my thoughts...

Can anyone relate to any part of this? I have no social circle, I don't know if I'm legitimately insane sometimes because I've lived most of my life without any real feedback, just merely trying to rely on self-awareness."	vortexmonk	post	24.75755312362285	male	White	0.9986587762832642	na	na	na	36	MadOver30	no prediction.
"I can relate I'm 35 living in my mom's house. I have no job, I dont really have any friends I've dealt with mental illness for 10+ years. I've seeked help but stopped cause they weren't helping. They did Google searches and printed out copies from the internet. Which is really bad on their part. I was working, living in a shared apartment and paying for my bills. I did go for a computer coding boot camp and got a certificate. It's extremely hard for me to find a job cause if I got back into the service industry or work manual labor jobs I will lose control again.

I like to think that she knew I‚Äôd be noticing all the things I learned from her, every day, for the rest of my life.  For now, just being present with them, and with yourself, is probably the best thing? Have you talked with them directly about your feelings?

"\> I'm paralyzed in fear of my own existence and mortality. 

Honestly, I find myself constantly amazed that there are people who \*don't\* walk around feel this way most of the time. We are going to die. People will lose their shit if they find out they're going to die, but you put the date a few years off (a few years that fly by with increasing rapidity so that it all become more and more of a blur? Suddenly it's absolutely no big deal, shrug it off, just a little sidenote about life. I think you literally have to have some level of denial in order to be happy without recurring thoughts of your own terrifying end. 

&#x200B;

What you're going through right now is really rough. Nothing is going to make it easy. But hold on to the fact that your parents genuinely love you, and you love them so much that perhaps the most important thing in your life is to make them happy. None of us ever really reach a place in life where we're totally satisfied with every aspect of our existence. It's okay to want better for yourself but it's also important to acknowledge that your parents really do love and care about you. If you write and you love to write, you are a writer. Not every great talent gets the credit they deserve or makes a ton of money, but that doesn't invalidate what you do.  Of course you're upset and it's okay to feel discouraged. But you have nothing to be ashamed of. Things are hard right now and you're doing you're best.

"You sound to be in a really tough place right now. It probably won't feel like it, bit you're still young, you can still still change your life if you want to. That you've recognised there's a problem and want to make it better is the first step.

Covid sucks, but it's meant that there's a lot more online support available at the moment than there would normally be, so now is a good time to start.

After having similar issues myself, I'm in the middle of the Yale Science of Wellbeing course on Coursera, and it may be a good place for you to start (it's free). It gives starting places for finding and working on your strengths, building connections and showing what things are actually worth working towards to be happier.

There's also an app called Unwinding Anxiety, it is fairly expensive to subscribe properly (although much cheaper than a therapist), but even the first few free trial lessons should help a little.

I hope things improve for you. As a parent, what I want most is for my children to be happy.

"I can relate. Tried to live on my own a couple of times over the past ten years and never succeeded in being able to take care of myself. I'm now thirty and have been living at home with my aging parents for the past few years. Their health is stable but I do worry as they get older. I don't have the best relationship with them. At times I can have a good conversation with them, but most days I spend almost the entire day in my bedroom by myself. 

Haven't had a job in a year. Have had almost fifteen jobs in the past ten years. Quit all of them. Couldn't cope. I struggle with getting along with others. Can't handle stress real well either. In student loan debt without much hope for ever being able to have steady income from work.

Wish I could reclaim my physical health at least but have been unsuccessful so far. Now close to 300 lbs. I also have had aspirations to be a writer. But confidence is hard to grow in my living situation.

I feel that I am a stranger to myself sometimes even, lost scrolling through endless info on a bright phone or computer screens, filling my mind with information instead of filling my time with human interaction. 

There are a lot of people out there who struggle with these things. But we all feel so damn alone. I know being a man may add a different twist to the whole situation because culturally we are supposed to be stoic and not feel any pity for ourselves--or feel anything, really. 

But culture ain't your friend.

It is ironic--this situation. More and more people our age are finding themselves living lives like ours that they did not imagine for themselves. Loneliness is at an all time high. 

I think of this lyric, ""the television went from being a babysitter to a mistress/ technology allowed us to stay in touch while keeping a distance/ till we just stayed distant and never touched/ now all we do is text too much."" (Sage Francis)

Sorry to hear about your parents' health situation. Best to you.

I know how it is hard to have a big writing dream and continually be faced with the reality that time keeps slipping by you while you've yet to publish anything.

And that is a bit of a comforting though, from a parent, that this is your ultimate wish for your children. I think my parents do think I'm relatively happy though.

I know it's tough to make moves whilst depressed, but I really hope you can get some sort of inspiration to try and form relationships with your parents, and maybe spend a bit more time with them. I know that's not always easy given the dynamics. My dad isn't easy to get along with. But now that his time is clearly running out, I wish I had put more effort into it earlier. There were years where I'd barely see him daily, sometimes not at all, despite living in the same home. All time wasted. I'm learning one of life's harsh lessons, so I hope someone else can act in time.

Although I'm plagued with all of these negative issues and traits, by some weird miracle, fitness motivation came easy to me (except during major depression periods - like now). I must have developed some type of hero complex from reading comics, mixed with being a victim of physical bullying as a child, that pushed me early on in life to workout regularly. But I do think getting a grasp on a workout routine is a game changer. I'm no expert, but PM me if you need any tips. Though I'm sure you know the run - lower calories a bit, and move more.

&#x200B;

And \*\*BREEDING\*\*. When you think about the logistics of creating a kid, it's all expense, stress, pain, worry, and ultimately disappointment when the child either doesn't grow up to be independent and you've failed or \*does\* become independent and leaves you... I'd say it's 90%+ just people telling themselves that they matter in the universe because now they're ""immortal"".  For some, I'm sure the mythos of it being magically fulfilling is true, but based on the amount of time your average parent spends complaining vs rejoicing, I think it's fair to say quasi immortality is a super common motivator.  I'm just really glad I was one of the people who realized how miserable I would be having kids \*before\* I wasted my life on them lol

&#x200B;

\>how can I ever find comfort in failure?

&#x200B;

It's not really finding comfort in failure, it's reminding yourself how relative ""success"" is, especially in your own mind. Times that you've accomplished things big and small, have you found it's typically a lasting feeling of accomplishment, or is it more ""Well yeah, I got an A in that one single class, but....."" It sounds like you have that kind of mindset that rarely finds satisfaction in success. Therefore, in order to find a healthy, fulfilling balance, it's important that you change both what you consider success and how you react when you've achieved something.

&#x200B;

\> I'm not actually doing my best

&#x200B;

This is another problem I've run into, myself. What is ""doing your best""? I know it sounds like I'm just redefining things here, but in actual fact, that's what needs to be done when your mental health is being affected by your current definitions of things. So here we have this issue where we put ""your best"" at this impossible standard. If we're defining success by trying, then not trying ""your best"" makes you a failure in your mind. Now I'm not saying you're currently successful in your chosen path in life, but hear me out; possibly the reason you're not successful is because you're paralyzed by the perfectionism that leads you to define 'good enough' as 100% effort, no breaks, no lazy moments, no cut corners ever. That's not human. We can do that some of the time, but it can't be kept up. And if your response to giving up or doing something poorly is to call tear yourself down and berate yourself in an intense way (and perhaps your response to success isn't positive enough to make up for all of that self cruelty) then your only real emotional motivation becomes not to fail. And the only way to be sure of not failing is by not trying. Which may be exactly the system of beliefs and behaviors that has created this problem.

&#x200B;

So then my recommendation is this; start completely over. New definitions of success. New responses to failure. Trying at all is reason for praising yourself. I know it can feel like ""oh sure but I'll probably only try for five minutes and then just always give up and feel like a failure"" but that's actually not how it works. If you can get to a place where you stop tearing yourself down and just genuinely say to yourself ""Hey good job. Five minutes is better than nothing!"" Then next time, you'll be more comfortable working for ten. It's sort of a counter-intuitive process of doing more by struggling less, like getting out of a Chinese finger trap lol

&#x200B;

Anyway, I hope you're doing okay. It's actually been sort of therapeutic to think this all through. I'm sure you're busy with other stuff and fully not interested but hey, if you'd like to vent or talk about this more I think that'd be nice. Inbox me :)

"I think you'd benefit a lot from meditation. Being mindful of what goes in your thoughts is a powerful tool to transform your thought pattern. If you can go to therapy, that'd be awesome as well, but if you can't, I suggest meditating. There is r/Mindfulness, r/mindfulnessmeditation, r/meditation to get you started. It will help you know when these thoughts come and by observing and contemplating what goes on in your mind you'll be able to change the patterns, and catch yourself when your brain goes to them. It is difficult, it's a job that takes time but there's no other way around it to change it. Your brain gets stuck and you need to exercise it to change the neural paths it's used for ever. Teaching yourself there are other ways takes time and effort. I've been meditating since january and at least now I don't have daily panic attacks and meditation has helped me tremendously. I can't go to therapy now that everyone's in lockdown but I'm doing my best now on my own. Hope it helps.

Don‚Äôt remove a bean for a negative thought- that‚Äôs counter productive. Just look for those beanable moments. Song you like comes on the radio or Spotify? Bean it.

Are you dead?  No?  Then you've lost no time.  There is no right or wrong way to live (provided you aren't hurting anyone).  Take a deep breath.  Understand that you are not the only person who feels this way - you are not alone.  

I'm severely depressed, and my technique on helping me cope is to ask myself what I would tell one of my students (or niece/nephew) if they came to me for help.  Then I take that advice to the best of my ability.  It helps me distance myself from my issues, and I can look at them less emotionally.  When you can distance yourself from your emotions, it'll help you figure out what you want from your life and what you could do to achieve it.

"More and more, I feel that everything is controlled by fate. It is fate that I am me - with all my faults and failures. God knows I have, at least for the first 30 years of my life, tried to 'do better'. But ultimately I always fail in whatever I do. Even simple tasks end in disasters when I touch them. I am a magnet for bad luck and coincidences. I have been a failure my entire adult life, and I don't even know why. I have never had a proper career. My 'friends' all treat me as if I didn't exist. I don't have a partner/spouse. My remaining parent is perpetually disappointed in all of my life choices. 

Every day, when I go in for work (or, more accurately, hoping I have work, as I am in essence self-employed), when I send messages to 'friends', when I spend time with my mother, I ask myself 'what is the point?'. My work hates me, mocks me, despises me; my 'friends' prefer that I leave them alone; my mother regrets that I never married and that she would never have grandchildren, and at this stage, I think she would rather I spend more time figuring how to make ends meet. 

I don't know what to do. I take walks. I give myself me time. Despite the binge eating of junk food during the COVID-19 period, I have slowly returned to a more normal diet. None of this helps. Because, heart of hearts, I think I'm not really mentally unwell; rather, I have played my cards wrong 10, 20 years ago, and all my wrong decisions snowballed and accumulate into a highly-unsatisfactory life that I can't get myself out of. 

I've made compromises all through these years. No spouse? Alright, I would be happy with a partner. My career wasn't the stellar success that I had worked for my whole life? No problem, I would be happy with an income that affords security to me and my parents. My friends want to have nothing to do with me? Sure, I am ok with just being an acquaintance, no phone calls, no meetings, just an occasional message. But lowering my expectations didn't manifest into higher satisfaction, I just become more disillusioned when even my lowered standards didn't come into being. So I end up being a middle aged woman, single, lonely, highly educated with a very low paying job, living at home with my mother, my only relief is lying in bed trying to blank out everything. 

I have been tempted to book an appointment with a shrink. Not that I could really afford it. But my misery is hard to handle and I am willing to give nearly anything a shot. But all these years of treatment didn't do me one bit of good and I know I would just end up spending money that I wish I hadn't spent."	stranger38	post	32.81886562775182	female	White	0.9985297918319702	na	na	na	20	MadOver30	failed
"You're not broken, or a failure, or crazy.  You're just blind in one eye, so to speak.  You're only seeing half the picture, and it's the ugly, distorted, bad half.  Everything and everyone has an ugly, distorted, bad half, all of life and every person in it, including you and me.  But if that's all you look at, of course things are going to seem hopeless.

How can I possibly know that, make assertions about you from just your words?  Because I've been there.  I'm also helping a family member though that place I've come from and that you're in right now.  She's said just about the exact things to me, here and there.

Yes, we fail.  Yes, things are hard.  Yes, the world regularly will throw bullshit terrible things at you randomly whether you deserve it or not.  But there's also sunshine and fresh air and good luck and opportunity and people who love you, somewhere, whether you can see thm with your blind eye or not.

Depression takes that from you.  Makes you see only the worst, only the most devastating possibilities.  They're real.  But they're no more real or likely than the others, the good ones.  Humans are pattern-recognition machines.  We're built to look at the world and find meaning, or at least recognizable patterns in the chaos, which we then try to exploit to make our lives easier and better.  Depression misaligns that super-important mechanism.

Trauma acclimates your brain to feeling sadness, grief, rage, pain, whatever combination is unique to you.  To try to protect itself, your mind kicks that pattern-recognition filter into overdrive.  Looking for the next trauma, the next disappointment, the next pain, so it can be avoided.  Your mind must be filled with the previous traumas in order to focus on their patterns to do this.  But that prevents you from healing, from absorbing those traumas and moving beyond them.  You get stuck.   
 And in the process... all you can see is pain.  Failure. Death. Sorrow.  All the other things - joy, wonder, contentment, love - are *all still out here, waiting for you*.  You just haven't been able to see them.

This isn't blind, naive optimism.  That's how I used to see it, but it isn't.  The things that make life worth living, the goodness & rightness in the world haven't gone.  It has always been here.  If trauma and pain and grief and sorrow can exist, it must be because joy and love and fulfillment do, too.  One can't exist without the other, therefore no matter how bad things seem, to some small extent at least, they must always be within reach.

Treatment didn't work for you - *yet* \- because you haven't internalized this blind spot.  Therapy isn't for everyone.  Sometimes you need the help, but whether you take that route or work it out on your own formally using CBT or informally, the first step is recognizing that the biggest effect of depression is skewed, monochromatic perception.  Nothing helps because you do not believe anything can help, that there is any other way to be but your current misery.  It's not you, it's simply the nature of depression, because of how that pattern-recognition feature of our minds works.

Once you finally, deeply admit to yourself that it is *possible* to feel better, to have and get good things you want in life to some degree - even though it may still be hard, it is not impossible or even unlikely - it will be like the scales have fallen from your eyes.  You will cease to be your own worst enemy and start being an advocate for yourself.  And then, if you still need help - heaven knows I have more problems than just depression - you will be able to seek it out and it will do some good.  Nobody can help lift someone out of a hole if that person actively fights back.  And it's a lot easier and more likely to succeed if they cooperate.

Depression may be a short circuit in our minds.  But it's not written in stone.  Your mind is, after all, just about the only thing in the universe you have any real control over.  In the depths of despair, the pattern-recognition that wants to help you avoid pain tells you that you don't.  Because that's comforting in grief; that there's nothing you can do.  It's a lie, however.

You'll backslide.  Everyone does, sooner or later, to one extent or another.  Sometimes it's just a bad day.  Sometimes it's a bad year.  Sometimes all you lose is that day.  Sometimes you lose a career or a partner or a friend or something really valuable like that.  But in the depths of depression, what you've lost is *yourself*, and you have to get that back before you can get anything else in life.  My point here is that you should not concentrate on accomplishments.  Concentrate instead on *progress*.  It's not about a job or a relationship or a perfectly clean home or a completed project or a milestone.  It's about progress.  Don't let ""good"" or ""perfect"" be the enemy of ""better"".  All you really need in the depths of depression is ""better"".  Even ""a tiny little bit better"".

First, convince yourself, really believe that it is possible.  Good things can happen, progress can be made, things can be accomplished.  So what if you didn't, if you failed?  You're still here.  The only time possibility is gone is when you stop breathing.  Every second up to that point is a gift, and can be literally anything.  There's no such thing as ""too late"" for Better.  There's always room, space & time for Better.  There's no law or rule that says you have to feel or be this way, if you really don't want to be.  But the only person who can make that decision is you.  Nobody can rescue you until you do that, because we can't save you from yourself.

In terms of Kenny Rogers' *The Gambler*, depression is ""counting your money while you're sittin' at the table"".  You're always going to be dissatisfied with the result, but there'll be plenty of time for counting when the dealing's done - i.e., when we're dead.  Up until then, it's not time to count.  It's time to play, whether that means betting heavy or folding, or even finding a new, better game with better players or a fairer dealer.

I don't know if you will eventually be OK.  But I do know, with absolute certainty, that you CAN be, if you decide to be. If you admit it to yourself that you could be.  I don't have a perfect idea of what the following steps look like and they probably diverge a lot from person to person as you get further along the path... but that, believing it can be better, and that you are the agent of making that choice, no one else... that is Step 1.

It took me 3 major episodes of depression and countless longer ones, some longer than 5 years at a time across 30 years of adulthood to realize that.  I've lost countless opportunities for romance, a 20-year career, one not-so-nice and two nice homes... and several close friends in the process.  It takes as long as it takes, and it costs what it costs.  If a stranger can take the time to type all this up for you, un-asked, what are you willing to do for yourself?  Start with forgiveness, and go from there.  A good friend of mine used to say ""Let go, or be dragged.""  The choice is yours, no matter how much it seems like it isn't."	stranger38	reply	na	na	na	0.9985297918319702	weak	no	no	na	MadOver30	failed

"I feel all of this so often, and I have job and family stuff that you are feeling this way about not having. Our depression tells us that we are a failure and that people can't stand us. It's not true. Concerning friends and family not communicating enough or in the right way: people are busy and flawed like we are and usually their mind is consumed with a lot of the same thinking that we have, but they don't share it with others like we do. 

You are just a human, existing. You don't have to do anything, except do no harm to others or yourself. You aren't a failure. You just aren't living the life you imagined. Few of us do. Maybe you can try to forgive yourself, because you haven't done anything wrong. 

I am trying to find professional help and that's generally as frustrating and unsatisfying as I imagined it would be when I was not. But you are right the misery is exhausting for so many years. Medication doesn't fix anything but it does help a little. And there are doctors with sliding scales. Let me know if you would like me to help you find them.

At least in my own eyes, I gave it my all. The fact that my efforts didn't come into fruit seems to be a mixture of bad luck and normal human fallacy rather than lack of trying. What I want to say is, I don't make more mistakes than the regular person. It's just that when I do make a mistake, it seems to have much more serious result than if another person made the same mistake. I have remained hopeful for so long that I feel foolish. I have made zero progress in my 10-year career. I hate the fact that my colleagues think that I am stupid and lacking in talent.

It's helpful if you separate your work environment from your personal environment. Maybe if you have a spare room or any other area of your house which is not used for anything, use it exclusively for work. If not maybe just hang some sheets (with enough space to not make yourself feel claustrophobic) around your table and yourself to make a separation. Never do any work related stuff in your personal environment. You can also listen to binaural beats to help you focus.

Think about it my way. When you get into a new relationship (romantic, friendship, etc) you develop new relationship energy. This new person is new and exciting. 

Add onto this that you're supposed to have an emotional connection with your therapist and you'll see that a physical relationship with them is natural and maybe even good.

"My mom just moved in with us after a brief stay at the nursing home for some physical therapy after she fell out of bed and couldn't get herself to the bathroom anymore.  This was all brought on herself because of drinking and smoking herself into an oblivion.  She has been taking care of my younger sister's 4 kids since they were in elementary school.  She made a choice to love and spoil the oldest son and find problems with the two girls and youngest boy.  She didn't love them in a nutshell and favored the oldest.  She received social security death benefits for three of them because their father passed away and let the oldest spend all the money.  Fou d out the Golden child was also taki g her money and her response was I love him he can have all my money!  Now the girls are 18 and getting the checks sent in their name so they can take care of themselves. And the golden child has ABANDONED her COMPLETELY.   He never called or visited when she was in the nursing home. She treated the others so bad and unfairly.  Now I'm stuck with her.  When my mom was in the hospital she thought she had brain cancer when she found out she didn't she got upset.  Upset that she did Not have cancer. Instead they said she has calcium deposits on the brain. She is walking with a drop foot and doesn't like to do anything.  She doesn't know how to converse with people.  She never asks questions about what her grandchildren want to do or anything. She can't talk current events, can barely use her cellphone, not up to speed on current events and can't use a computer.  
My in laws are the total opposite.  Active, healthy, traveling, Fun, outgoing people.  
I had a couple of friends stop by yesterday and she was just being annoying.  While we were talking and having a good time she comes down and interrupts to ask me if I can take her to the store.  She needed something.  I said i will later and then she went outside.  After they left she said she needed some bobby pins for her wig.  That was it!  It's hard to explain her self centered personality.  She is 75 by the way.  Any advice is appreciated."

"I know everyone is different and what works for some doesn‚Äôt work for others. That‚Äôs pretty much all diseases and treatments. I‚Äôm not pushing meds here, just telling my story. It‚Äôs kind of long, feel free to skip it. 

I‚Äôm a pharmacy technician and I work for a pharmacist that ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt believe in medication.‚Äù She told me this after I told her that my medicine is why I‚Äôve been so much better lately. To be clear, she absolutely believes in medicines for definable, testable diseases. 

A few years ago, I got off of sertraline. I didn‚Äôt feel like it really made a difference anymore, and couldn‚Äôt afford to see a doctor for a new prescription. It was painful. I‚Äôd planned on going back on it once I was employed, but I never want to go through those withdrawals again. Those next few years, I went through a steady decline. I‚Äôd changed jobs and moved cross country twice, got two promotions that I worked hard for at my current employer, and realized I‚Äôd completely lost control. I was having frequent attacks of rage and anger and sobbing. I was lashing out unnecessarily. I was thinking about suicide constantly. I was working toward a job I found I love and self destructing along the way, and not just at work, but work was where I couldn‚Äôt hide it as well (not that I was, but I thought I was). 

So I went back on my meds. I‚Äôd already learned a lot working in the pharmacy, so I asked my doctor to have my thyroid tested. A lot of diseases can cause depression! And, if you have depression anyway, they can make it so much worse. Turns out I was right about my thyroid (I had other symptoms of hypothyroidism). I was also put on buspirone for my anxiety. Don‚Äôt know if anyone cares, but I do love my job and medication is my job (remember, what works for one person doesn‚Äôt work for another! Every therapy needs to be personalized for the individual!). 

Over the next few months,my head cleared, my memory returned, and my patience returned, slowly. My friends and coworkers (manager included) tell me they didn‚Äôt notice about my memory and that I‚Äôve always had a good memory, but my head was so foggy I really struggled to recall things. 

Fast forward to a few months ago, very beginning of the year. I‚Äôd gotten my license, then had to have two major surgeries almost back to back. Ok, not sure what counts as major vs minor, but the first one literally saved my life. That gave me a lot of time for introspection. When I went back to work, I made a point of avoiding getting drawn into the negativity. It‚Äôs like a magnet there (yes my work environment can be quite toxic). I avoided eating lunch with coworkers that just wanted to complain, and if they sat with me, I didn‚Äôt join in. Instead, I brought a book and would spend read it throughout the break. I tried to avoid arguing with my colleagues, and bite my tongue more (they love to gossip and talk about the others, and I know that means they talk about me when I‚Äôm not there, too. I‚Äôm not joining in, but I do occasionally have my setbacks). My manager has made a few comments about my behavior and self control over the last few months, before the pandemic. I told her it was largely due to my meds. She was genuinely surprised and asked me if I really thought so (she doesn‚Äôt need to know the rest. My personal therapy is not her business). She then laughed and asked if we wanted to hear something funny. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt believe in medication. Isn‚Äôt that funny? A pharmacist that doesn‚Äôt believe in medication!‚Äù Cue awkward silence as the other tech (also on mood medications) and I don‚Äôt know how to react. 

I‚Äôll admit, the stress of working through the pandemic right now has me on edge and I‚Äôve had setbacks. But I‚Äôm working on it. It‚Äôs exhausting. Now my manager has decided that what will look best to corporate will be for each of us to pick one thing we have to work on to improve, and she‚Äôs really pushing for that one thing to be somewhat abstract, like how to speak to people or how people perceive you. For example, one person will work on sounding less curt so as not to sound rude. I have been working on improving everything, both internal and external. I‚Äôve taken every criticism to heart and, even if I thought it was redundant or ridiculous, and made adjustments. I find this request of hers incredibly invasive. It took me all day to come up with an idea, one that wouldn‚Äôt reveal anything about myself I don‚Äôt want her to know about (she‚Äôll try to ‚Äúfix‚Äù me, and I‚Äôm having none of that!). Compliance. I‚Äôm going to work on making sure I do everything by the book, which means I‚Äôm going to make sure I know the book. Nothing makes corporate happier than people following their instructions, except money, of course. 

There has been a lot of positive changes for me lately. Since I stopped joining the gossipers and the gossip, I‚Äôve started getting to know other coworkers and made a couple friends! One has been helping me find a job elsewhere using her connections. I know these changes aren‚Äôt because of meds. They‚Äôre because I made them happen. But I don‚Äôt think I could have done any of it without meds, and I‚Äôm good with that. I‚Äôm not cured, don‚Äôt know if I ever will be, but I‚Äôm making progress. 

If anyone read this all the way to the end, thanks for listening. In case you‚Äôre wondering, I‚Äôve been planning to leave since I got my license, then I got sick, then I got sick again, then corona and lockdowns. I‚Äôm hoping to transfer, but I am looking into other places, too."	ScienceUnicorn	post	26.76485241927595	female	White	0.005604468751698732	na	na	na	11	MadOver30	no prediction.

"I've suffered from depression from roughly age 5 but was always able to function enough to have a decent social life, active dating life and I was always very very career focused until 2 years ago. I had a few medical issues 2 summers ago and now everything has changed. My depression got so bad I couldn't get out of bed for days. My job, which was once my happy place and my escape, was now giving me anxiety. I actually ended up in the ER one night from a panic attack which I had never had before. Then I would have anxiety attacks constantly at work. Last summer I decided to start seeing a psychiatrists instead of a primary care Dr. for my mental health but things didn't get better they got worse. I ended up walking out of my job that I had been with for almost 11 years and dedicated my entire life to building a career. I had no plan and a not a very large safety net to survive. Not to mention the absolute mess I had made of my personal life from unnecessary fights to embarrassing behavior when out with friends. 

It was at that time my psychiatrists diagnosed me with bi-polar and the meds I was on were worsening my mental state not helping. A month after being on my new meds everything was amazing. It felt like the fog in my brain was lifted and I could finally see life clearly, rationally. I found a new job, I cut all the toxic people out of my life everything was looking good...until about a 3 months ago.

Everything stated failing apart again but not like last time there's no fog in my brain this time making good judgement impossible. I stopped interacting with my friends, I walked out of my job again (this time with somewhat of a plan) and all I do is lay around dreaming of a different life. A life where my plan has worked out and I've become successful. I'm happy, healthy, and have an active social/dating life. That's never going to happen if I can't get out of bed.

 I'm 36 years old this isn't how I pictured my life. The smallest of tasks seem sooooo difficult to me. I want this to stop. I want to have my life back but the better version I'm constantly dreaming of. How do I make this stop?"

"I'm bananas, fortunately I was always able to tick the boxes. But it was hard and there were many situations that make me cringe now.

Now, I managed to develop a skill that that enables me to work self employed in a field where calls in to work sick arent the end of the world. Also being a bit of a 'personality' is a plus. I have cultivated a network where I am accepted and can always find well paid work. I also have a mate with businesses that pay me under the table for bits and bobs.

Recently I started learning another skill that works self employed. 

I think you just have to accept that 9-5 isn't going to work for you and start up an own project. I fully accept that I was able to do this due to past own money and family money. But to me, beg, borrow or steal money that will enable you to be more self sufficient.

I'll share some of my story. I had severe attachment trauma in early childhood and grew up in an abusive and toxic household which compounded the trauma I already had and added to it. I was never able to get better until I spent nearly a decade outside of the environment. It wasn't until I had enough distance between myself and the people who were toxic for me that I started to become aware of the reality that I endured. How I was abused and brainwashed and even had repressed memories surface. Well, I've spent the last 7-8 years recovering from it all. I had a whole host of cluster b personality disorder symptoms and a bunch or diagnosis depending on which Dr you talk to. Anyway, I had faith I could get better but not so much in doctors. I started googling everything. My symptoms, how I was feeling. All the stuff I couldnt talk to a doctor about. Google really saved my life. My other point is that it has taken years of teeny tiny steps in progress while having pretty bad depression pretty much the entire time for me to get better. If it wasn't for little insights or the smallest piece of progress, I don't know how I would have made it. Listen to your heart. Don't let any doctor tell you that you can't get better if you believe you can. It takes time though. It took me so much time. I literally thought it would be like two years and I'd be where I imagined, healthy on all levels. It's almost eight years later and although I'm really close, I'm not quite there yet. I just want to say, don't give up. Focus on your progress, no matter how small. Meditate. It will help you start to feel these patterns that drag down your mental state. It's the best thing you can do for yourself, develop a regular meditation practice where you focus on the breath. I'm sorry you're struggling so much with depression. It's the worst. I know. But you can get better. If you need anything, don't hesitate to PM. Support and validation is really important. You don't have to deal with it alone. Feel better.

"I'm sorry to hear of your struggles with your thoughts. When you're cooped up indoors it can make that internal voice all the louder.

If you're up for it, why not try some techniques based on Acceptance Commitment Therapy (ACT)? When the memory comes, make the details less salient. Here are some examples:

* If the memory plays like a video, turn everything black & white.
* Imagine the memory is playing on a TV then move the television really far away so that the picture is blurred.
* Keeping with the television analogy, imagine clicking the ""mute"" button so that all sound is off.
* Or how about slow-mo? Slow the memory down so that voices are distorted.
* Freeze-frame the memory. Then in your imagination put that frame in a completely unrelated environment like on a t-shirt on sale at a small beach shop.

Another technique is to play around with the sights-and-sounds of the memory itself.

* Is someone in that memory that's causing you pain? Put them in clown clothes complete with huge shoes, giant gloves and a big red nose.
* Is someone talking in the memory? Give them a funny voice (I like to use Donald Duck or Goofy)
* One of the earlier suggestions was to turn things black & white. Play around with the picture quality, turn up the saturation, flip it upside down, rotate it 90 degrees.
* Change the environment entirely. Play your memory but it a library. Or how about a busy train station? Or in the middle of a food fight?

Part of ACT is learning that memories and thoughts are just that: memories and thought. They can feel real and can ignite real emotions within us. But in and of themselves they can't hurt us."	burner00101	reply	na	na	na	0.9962640404701233	strong	no	no	na	MadOver30	no prediction.

"Canker sores can easily last a week or two, and are just result of a vitamin deficiency or minor skin virus IIRC.  If it lasts more than 2 weeks, then consider alternate explanations.  It's unlikely to still be there that long, or at least it should get smaller in that time.

If the lump in your throat is under the jaw on one side or the other, you likely do have a minor infection and one of your lymph nodes is swollen.  That shouldn't last more than a week, either.  I just had a sinus infection that lasted a full month, but the swelling in my lymph node lasted only about 3 or 4 days.

Never forget that, absent a reason to expect it NOW because of your medical history (i.e. you had a tumor removed there last year or something, not just a family history of any random type of cancer or that type), cancer is always the last explanation for a symptom.

"...who finds it increasingly difficult to find real.

This is more than a feeling of things being strange, or surreal, or unreal. This is a growing belief which I struggle to find any certainty in this life. Yes, there's the global political issues, the virus, etc. There's also something else or lack of something else, I'm not sure. My brain has always struggled to reconcile itself with itself.

Everyone has many parts to their brains, yes, but I have separated mine into two distinct ""selves"". One, my logical self, where things make sense, where thoughts go in straight lines. It is a comfortable place. Second, is my other-self. The other-self, where thoughts go to mutate, thoughts become cancerous, benign, loathsome, incomplete(?), ridiculous, never rational, never easy. Working like a kaleidoscope for emotional comprehension, it makes everything seen through my other-self refract, distort.

Using that nonsense to sort-of create a background, here is my biggest existential problem. (Actually, I am not sure if ""existential"" is the proper word. But, it's all I have for now.) I am falling out of my usual 90-99.99% certainty of perception of reality. More and more often, those numbers are getting close to bottoming out. Bottoming out would be devastating to my consciousness. I am not sure I would be able to function. I'm afraid that I will lapse into a coma. My other-self will overpower any reason or logic remaining in my head and send things into such an incomprehensible fuzz that reality becomes impossible. The impossibility will render me catatonic. There would be no reality anymore; no *this* reality anymore. Maybe I will get lucky and find myself in a different reality. One which is trustworthy. A state where my selves can unite, make sense of everything, understand.

Now, I must fight for this reality which I currently seem to exist. It's becoming increasingly hard to do. And it didn't start recently. It has been on a downward slope since my early 30s (\~10 years ago). The slope has become steeper in the past 3-4 years. Therapy, drugs (prescription & 'other'), hospitalization, self-harm, and many other distractions and treatments continue to fail. My other-self brain, in so many words, does not care. The other-self is on its way down, and it is dragging the rest of me down with it.

Does anyone else feel anything similar? I'm not looking for tips or encouragement in this post. I'm looking for commiseration; those who can relate--if only a little bit. Finding that I am not alone will go a long way into helping me feel a little secure in this particular universe.

There is more. Anxiety, dysphasia, tremors, headaches, vision issues... I could write a book on only those, but not now.

"i have so many goals to reach, and so much stuff to do i just can't do it all.

i have constantly like 10-20 things that needs fixing or ""done"" and i just can't. i have music to listen to, movies to watch, video games to play, clothing to sew, a home to decorate, computers to tinker with, furniture to fix, therapy to undergo, spirituality to cultivate, exercise to do, confidence to work on, relationships to look for, a career to keep afloat, finances to maintain, hygiene to upkeep, recycling to take care of, politics to keep up with, people to interact with, loneliness to deal with, finding the right combination of drugs and vitamins to optimize my health....

i used to be pretty content with what i managed to do in life but either my mental health made me lose my groove or i realized i had less time than i originally thought. either way, things are not being done fast enough and i'm struggling to prioritize and just feel like i'm GETTING somewhere in life.

several years ago i made a list of hundreds of movies to watch. well guess what? new movies are still coming out every day and i've only watched like 10 movies the past year instead of the 1-2 per day i envisioned that i would watch. i feel like my life is slipping thru my fingers like a fine-grain sand.

"I was in the exact same place you were 3 years ago. I'm still struggling with anxiety and depression but I have come a long way from where I began. I hope you can take something away from this post.

Let some things go. Start very small. Trust me when I say you don't have to watch all of those movies and TV shows or complete those video games. Trim down the lists and just try to accept that you'll be ok not seeing or playing them. I used to obsessively watch TV shows to completion. If I made it 3-4 episodes into a show, that was it. I was going to watch every single episode.  

Same with movies. I was the ""movie guy"" amongst all my friends. I took pride in seeing everything and being a sort of curator that could recommend great movies to anyone based on their personal preferences. But more movies just kept coming, life kept getting in the way and my list kept getting longer.  

At some point early on in my therapy and self improvement journey, I realized I was wasting the little time I had to myself by watching a bunch of stuff I didn't even want to watch anyways. I took the big step (trust me, it felt big at the time) of actually deleting some shows from my PC that I had invested several episodes or even seasons in. It felt good and sort of empowered me to start cutting out other bullshit that was just wasting my time and energy.  

I read some good advice that I have not even implemented into my daily life yet but it might help you. Someone said to go through your to do list one by one and either schedule that thing into your calendar or delete it from your list. It's either so important that you need to find the time to do it now or it's not important enough that you don't need to worry about it.  

Finally, try meditation. I don't want to add something else to your long list of things to do but trust me when I say that it only takes 5 mins a day and could very well change your life. It did for me and I am a very skeptical person by nature who has also resisted any sort of ""spiritual crap"" or self improvement bullshit. All that changed when my therapist finally convinced me to research it and try it. There is tons of research and evidence out there showing all kinds of benefits to meditation and [this is a great video to get you started.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPahMgtxnR0&list=PLOntSt0X6lWHJn9p6NcSj6ees6EL8Uf8B&index=2&t=0s) When you find some time later, message me and I can recommend a fantastic book that literally changed my way of thinking as well.

"I keep a bullet journal to help manage some of this productivity anxiety- it lets me organize my thoughts, schedule tasks, and (this is important) it makes me pay attention to the things I actually have accomplished.

At the end of the day, I have concrete proof in front of me that even if I didn't get any closer to my goals, I still did a bunch of things. Like, maybe I didn't get any farther in my knitting project, but I did the dishes AND put laundry away AND took the recycling out AND showered.

Sometimes when I'm feeling overwhelmed by all the yet-to-do things, it helps to take a closer look at what I *have* done, even if it's not stuff off that long list.

1, capitalism alienates you from your labor so badly at work; like all the profits your labor makes at work are usually kept by some shareholder, not you -- so it's hard to take as much pride in a ""job well done"" because you rarely see the full fruits of your labor, and certainly don't get to possess and enjoy them. That's a big reason so many of us feel awful and meaningless and wortheless.  Instead, if you, say, garden and work on developing a relationship to earth and such (just an example!), you keep what you make and there's no ""*shareholder""* who gets their big take first.  I find that's very helpful when trying to find meaning.

2, i also find that if you ""find something you love and make it your job, then you'll never work a day in your life"" is actually bullshit.  Turning something you love into your paycheck means *comodifying* that thing you love, turning it into a product to be tramped up and sold.  Also, you'll have to keep doing this activity you used to ""love"" way past the point of enjoyment because even if you're tired of it at some point you have to keep doing it to get your paycheck, which is a great recipe for learning to resent the thing you used to love.

Become something useful and recession proof--something very few truly *love* (that gives job security!).  Loan officer.  Fund raiser.  I would say programmer, but you've tried that.  They ain't glamorous, but if you find a decent workplace and decent boss, they're fine enough.  And then you can feel relieved that you're done looking for ""meaning"" at work and start looking elsewhere using that reliable, steady paycheck you're getting."		reply	na	na	na	0.999054491519928	no	no	no	na	MadOver30	no prediction.

"TW: CHILDHOOD SEXUAL ABUSE

Also, I cross-posted this to a few other groups I'm in.

.

.

.

Hi  all. I have PTSD from multiple events, but one of the ones that I feel  affects me the most is being molested by my cousin on at least two  occasions. Some adults in my family walked in and interrupted one of the  times, and they reacted with horror at first and then later assumed it  was more innocent than it actually was because of my cousin's cover-up  story. I've always felt a deep sense of shame and revulsion with myself,  and no matter how much I would not believe it of anyone else,  underneath it all I feel like I've been irredeemably tainted by the  incest and abuse.

Less logically,  I've internalized the disgust with incest and feel that it's hard for  people to make peace with once they know - and I also feel that some of  the triggers and behaviors that I developed because of it drives people  away. I feel like I'm always trying really hard to be at my best, and  kindest, funniest, hardest working, etc, because I'm scared that it's  the only way that anyone will stay my friend, or partner, or whatever.  It's not healthy, but it's so deeply seeded that I don't know how to get  rid of it.

Has anyone had any  progress or breakthroughs with feeling hard to love? I've been in  therapy, and do work on my own, but I don't know how to even start with  this."		post	15.921503220101293	female	White	0.9962087869644165	na	na	na	2	MadOver30	failed

"Same stuff, same dosage here.

Can only go from personal experience of 3 years with sertraline and most of that time on 100mg. Apart from one spell at the beginning I haven't had reactions to this SSRI which make my life more hazardous. But feeling so faint in the way you're describing could make things much worse than they have to be. 

Speak to your doctor. It's common to have unexpected reactions, they'll be used to helping with it. It's worth keeping in touch with them until you know you're on a medication you're comfortable with. That makes it one of the firm part of the foundation you need to get yourself feeling better.

I 'persevered' with Citalopram a few years ago, didn't want to go back to doctor and discuss the side effects and then just ended up stopping - I really wish in hindsight I had taken them up on their advice to let them know if I was finding reactions which made things worse."	buildsandcastles	reply	na	na	na	0.994796097278595	no	strong	no	na	MadOver30	failed

This last major episode of major depressive disorder which started last August, 2019, I started to notice a change in me. I have focused more on being careful of being compassionate and not causing others suffering. I used to be I‚Äôd say 60% vegetarian. Maybe more like 70. But now I try to eat zero meat. I can‚Äôt stand to think of the cruelty towards and suffering of animals . I feel like I cry more easily when I think of all the sadness in the world. I feel that this was a result of this last episode of MDD, which has still not lifted. Maybe something good came of it. Has anyone else had an experience like this where their compassion/empathy increased due to suffering themselves?

I haven‚Äôt thought of MDD increasing compassion, but I have found that intentionally focusing my attention outward with compassionate acts for others is the only thing that has ever worked for me to end a depressive episode.

"I don‚Äôt know if I experienced increased compassion *because* I was majorly depressed.  I think for me, being super close to what felt like the end of my life made me stop caring about the ‚Äúlesser‚Äù things.  I am normally an extremely anxious person by nature, and being that seriously ‚Äúdepressed‚Äù (again, not sure if it was the depression) sort of made me not give a f* about things that would normally make me anxious, like caring what other people thought of me.  

It‚Äôs like whereas before I‚Äôd rush my way to work, and even being a tiny person, I could out-walk, out-shove, with the best of them on public transit, but suddenly I found myself noticing the random person in need of help or steadily meeting the gaze of a homeless person asking for money.  I wasn‚Äôt any ‚Äúbetter‚Äù than anyone else after all, and my time and my interests were not more important.  It‚Äôs easy to get caught up... think things like ‚Äúif I stop to help this person I‚Äôm going to miss that train and then be late to my meeting and look bad in front of my boss‚Äù (not that there‚Äôs anything wrong with wanting to be on time, it‚Äôs just that I‚Äôm overly anxious about something that‚Äôs not even been a problem) and then start to resent everything that ‚Äúgets in my way‚Äù.  It would be like resenting my kid (I don‚Äôt have kids) for wanting my attention when I have to prepare for a big presentation tomorrow.  

Also, instead of being afraid of making a fool of myself or embarrassing myself I decide to take a risk because who gives a f*, right?  Or being honest and saying what I really think instead of trying to protect myself and not to make waves.  Because telling the truth is more honorable and more important.

I‚Äôm not sure where I was going with this, but your post reminded me of my experience and it made me think.  I‚Äôm still trying to figure it out.

Yeah, that makes me so angry. Healthcare and mental healthcare professionals are personally and financially invested in propagating the falsehood that mental health care is effective. I think a lot of this is reinforced by the fact that a lot of people who don‚Äôt have serious mental problems go to therapy and their life and problems just so happen to get better during the time that they are going to therapy, but the therapy itself had no impact. A lot of people and professionals mistake people for having depression when really they are just having a rough spell. In other words, the depression goes away on its own, but the mental health care professionals pay themselves on the back for making it go away.	wastedmylife1	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9986948370933533	no	strong	no	na	MadOver30	no prediction.
And here is my story - my bf broke up with me exactly before the lockdown, because he fell in love with a woman, he communicates only trough Facebook. I lost my job, because I work in a tourism industry, and no chance to go back to it any time soon. Living in a third world country, the situation with the money and savings is very, very bad. No support from my family, no friends around, I have the feeling that the world is just crushing over me. I also have good and bad days. Trying to stay positive, I have days when I convince myself that everything will be fine, and I just need to survive probably the worst period of my life. But then I have moments when I‚Äôm completely down. I had few therapy sessions before the lockdown, which I cannot afford at the moment, because I need to save my money. In my country therapy sessions are not for free, but rather very expensive.I read a lot, I started studying Italian on my own, but there are times when I just can‚Äôt concentrate. I started to question my life choices. I‚Äôve been always working and earning my own money. Taking care of myself, I had bad periods before, but not like this - completely helpless.I could be married and have kids, however I‚Äôm all alone. I‚Äôm 32 to be soon, and I just don‚Äôt see how I‚Äôll manage to pull myself up from this situation.

First, give yourself permission to cry as much as you want.  Crying helps ease stress.  Second, try to take one day at a time.  What do you need today to get through it?  And last, remember that there are a lot of us in the same position, so you are not alone, even though it feels like it.  I would suggest you get a pet, if you can.   I find that my cats have been a major help, especially lacking physical contact.  I get hugs and love from my cats and that always brightens my day.	foreveramber06	reply	na	na	na	0.994063675403595	weak	no	no	na	MadOver30	no prediction.

"Hi, I‚Äôm 34 years old and two years ago, I went through something very similar to you. My 14 years relationship ended. My heart goes out to you. Being in quarantine during this time is very tough. Here are a couple things that I learned through the dark days: 
1. Whatever you feel, however dark and hopeless, it‚Äôll pass. So just focus on today, just one day. Whatever you need to do to get through the day. Some days, I literally didn‚Äôt want to do anything so I just lay on the couch, and at the end of the day, I found that I got through one day. Some days I wanted to cry, so I cried, and I let everything I had inside me, all the hurt, the sadness, the anger. I cried it all out and felt much better (exhausted, but lighter). I think a lot of my healing had to do with those crying moments I gave to myself. I‚Äôm like you, I carried the world on my shoulders and didn‚Äôt let myself be ‚Äúweak‚Äù or soft. Those moments, I told myself that I don‚Äôt have to be strong, I can just be weak and it would still be ok. And it was. I released my pain, took time for myself and the world didn‚Äôt collapse. So I took it one day at a time. Now, it‚Äôs been 2 years. It‚Äôs so hard to think 2 years has passed but I did that. I survived those moments. So will you. Start with loving yourself. Really sit and feel your feelings, and give yourself whatever your heart needs. 
2. With the past relationship, whatever you put in it, you get to take it with you. The fact that your ex boyfriend broke up with you just mean that he‚Äôll miss out all of the things you used to do for him, all of the love and care you put in it. What you are mourning now is the hope and dream you had for that relationship. You have to let it go. I had to envision everything I dreamed for him and I and mentally let it go. It was very difficult, but it made me feel so much better. Then all the love, and care, and actions that you put into that relationship, you get to carry that forward with you into YOUR future. He is the one that lost all of you, not the other way around. He missed out on you. You don‚Äôt want to be with someone who don‚Äôt want to be with you. 
3. After the mourning period passes, start to find out who you are as a person. What your non-negotiable values/boundaries are. Then you can communicate those with people who love you. Teach them how to treat you well. The only way to do it is to treat yourself well first. 

You are very young. Your whole life is still ahead of you. Imagine a bright path and start walking on it. You can make that path whatever you want now because you are literally the only person that decide how your life will turn out. You‚Äôll be great. Hang in there.

Don‚Äôt worry about dating apps right now, I mean to say use this time to concentrate on yourself, you are doing great with the positive thinking just sometimes it‚Äôs harder than others. Try to think of things you wanted to do before but didn‚Äôt have time or energy, like would you like to do a yoga video everyday? Or draw? Or paint your whole body? Or dance!

"I've been getting more irritated and angry at a coworker the past few months. He's a perfectly nice person who goes out of his way to please people, universally loved by everyone, smart and attractive, has had a very easy life. We're opposites: I care more about doing quality work than pleasing people, I'm not popular, on a good day I'm mediocre in brains and looks. I grew up with a lot of childhood and adolescent trauma. I've had to struggle and fight for a lot of things in my life, and I often feel like it's a minor miracle that I survived to middle age.

There's nothing wrong with my coworker. He's not a bad person. But his breezy attitude towards everything is incredibly triggering. I resent him. And then I feel bad about being resentful because it's not his fault he's had everything handed to him.. I just don't want to be around people like him.

"God help me, I've reached the point where I'm turning to the internet for help again. Been down this path before, and it rarely helps but. I'm turning 34 in a month, and my life has only taken more away from me.

**Teeth;** When I was a kid my mother left my dad and I lived with her for a year, during that time among many other things she didn't do, she never bought tooth paste so my teeth were in a hell of a state when I came back. we couldn't afford dentist work thanks to the divorce and we weren't covered under my dads plan. At 22 I finally had my own plan and saw a quack dentist that suggested I have all my teeth removed and dentures put in, which I did because he was apparently a dentist. 10 years later I find out that never needed to happen from another dentist.

**Knees;** Osteo-arthritis runs in my family and can hit at a pretty young age, and I was no exception. At 25-26 I couldn't take the pain in my knees anymore so I spoke my doctor, and then a surgeon as apparently joint replacement surgery for someone as young as me wasn't an option but going in there and cleaning out all the damage might help me. it didn't. I went through with that surgery just on my right knee because that's what the doc recommended, but afterwards that knee has become so damn weak that I can't go without using a cane to support myself. I was 27 when that happened, a few years later I speak with another surgeon about options and he tells me that that first surgery never should've happened.

**Job/Career;** Once that surgery chaos happened I could no longer work the blue collar jobs I was used to, nor can I do much in the way of just basic work like cashiers or any store really because I can't stand for more then 3 hours a day without being bed-bound for the next 2 days. In that time, I realized that both my father and grandmother needed someone at home looking after them so I took initiative and have been their sole care giver for the last 7 years or so, unpaid because its family and I can't do that to them, plus there just isn't the money to pay me. Granny passed over a year ago and my dad grew very ill the last year and a half from sepsis (an infection spread to his blood, we didn't know about it till shit hit the fan. combine that with the family arthritis, he needs all the help he can get) and now he needs me more then ever. I can't leave him, I just can't, my father's my hero and he saved my life from the hell hole my mother put us in. I'd do anything he'd ask.

**Love-life;** My last relationship ended over 10 years ago and I've been single ever since. I've never felt loneliness like this before, but I can't do anything about it. A) I'm unemployed. B) I can't leave my fathers side and C) All any woman ever sees in me is that damn cane. I don't stand a chance, but I can't shake the loneliness at all anymore, its all I think about. The longer I feel undesirable, the bigger the loser I become in my own eyes, but really what woman would want to be with an unemployed, toothless gimp with no future? Whats the point of even pursuing that when nothing will change?

**Interests;** This will make you laugh, as if I needed to complete the look, I am a stereotype of a ""Nerds-Nerd"". Yup, comic books, video games, movies and sci-fi shows, I've always been a fan of bombast over subtlety, and those mediums have always provided loads of the stuff. Now that I'm almost 34, oh yeah, feeling like a big time loser because of those interests, but nothing else has ever really grabbed my attention all that much. I'm a casual hockey fan but that's about it.

**Suicide;** I don't know what to make of that aspect. I feel like I want to do it, I want this to be over sometimes, but the afterlife scares me and those few who do care about me I know would be devastated. I don't want to hurt them. Still though, I think about what I would say in a note or recording quite often. I think about how I would phrase things to try to ease the blow, knowing full well I can't go through with it.

**Other Health Issues;** I don't even know where to start. Hell, I don't want to share any of them because they're all humiliating and possibly even unfixable in some cases. Nasal pollyps, IBS, a severe ulcer, insomnia, depression, oh and I smoke because who the hell wouldn't after all this?

The only thing I've ever been good at is being a storyteller, not writer. the stories are all in my head, but I don't have the training or skill to put them to paper. At this point though, damn near 34 years old, the only thing I want out of my life is for my father to get well again, to find steady work, get married, and have a couple kids before I'm too old to do so. But I can't get my foot in the door because of my disability and the reality that my family needs me where I am. Its not their fault that life dealt them a raw hand, nor is it mine, but there's also no way out and now that my depression is at a steady increase, I'm falling apart here. I see no way out, just more of the same every empty day."	ThunderWolfVX	post	30.770517984913116	male	White	0.9967688322067261	na	na	na	31	MadOver30	failed

They come in all varieties too. They also get depression, IBS, bad luck etc. Some might be nerds too. And you can find a connection. 
I don't know what your Dad's financial situation is like but if he can afford extra care then you need to carve out some time for yourself. Caregivers cannot give and give indefinitely. It is not sustainable.  
You need to be kinder to yourself in so many ways (particularly how you talk to yourself) because that kind of negativity manifests more negativity. I realise it is not easy because you are used to negative self talk so it's almost wired in. Look into mindfulness.

I get what you're saying, but I have to ask how do you not as you say put women on a pedestal when you haven't had so much as a hug in that decade? Logically, I know for a fact you're absolutely right, but I can't shut that part of the brain down anymore. Every time I worked up the guts to give it another shot, I'm shut down because of that damned cane. Its been a constant deal breaker all along.

Unfortunately no, not really. My father's financial situation can't afford an at home caregiver or for that matter any other kind of at home care out there. We're stretched pretty thin as it is, and I can't just leave him. Welfare, EI, nothing I have found so far has been willing to accept me due to me being so ""young and healthy"" as they put it. I've been told that these institutions won't even consider me because my disability isn't that severe in their eyes and because of my age, repeatedly. 

Now on that I do agree with you in a big way, you along with many others have said that I am way too hard on myself for years and none of you are wrong there. Once again though, I don't know how to shut that part of my brain down. Can I ask, what do you mean when you say Mindfulness?

My doc could tell that I wasn't handling things well so he prescribed that and I really didn't like the effects it had on me.

"This is the only thing I think I can handle talking about right now, so I will address it.

I don't honestly know if the surgery was necessary or not based on how things are now, but the reason why I didn't do any physical therapy was according to the surgeon there really wasn't a need for it because it was a ""Minor"" surgery. The damage done to my knees started when I was a kid, I had a ton of twists and sprains all in the knees and ankles. Once I turned about I'd guess 21, that was also when the arthritis started getting really bad right along side the ripped up knees. by the time of my surgery there was nothing but damaged tissue just floating around in there and it had gotten so bad that all movement was just bone on bone (according to the x-rays, my kneecap is about the size of a quarter and the back part of it no longer has that, I don't know what its called, nub that is supposed to grind along the groove of the bones with all the necessary cartilage, ligaments and whatever else was there). They gave me the impression that their intent was to remove all that damaged tissue by making an incision on either side of the knee cap and then basically take a ""medical vacuum cleaner"" of sorts to remove it all. After that I recovered at home, gradually working my leg back to a normal walking status-ish, but ever since then that joint now feels so damn weak that were I to turn just slightly in the wrong direction, the joint would and has buckled and I've collapsed. I can still walk even without the cane, but it does provide me with enough support to ensure that I can walk around safely and with less time spent on that bad leg.

Yeah, 10 years, that's exactly what they told me too. That was a hard pill to swallow, ""No good kid, the effectiveness of that operation would only be useful to you for about 10 years. And then you'd be back here for another joint replacement surgery but this time with severely diminished results because now you might only have 7 years before you need another operation""."

"Hiya mate. I meant to reply sooner, but have been wrapped up in my own crap fot the past few weeks lol.

Yeah, I do understand that caution around trying medications. But I've been on and off this stuff for years, since about 2000. So any initial fear I had is long gone.

Like you say, some meds can be very emotionally numbing. Unfortunately, for me these were the ones doctors kept giving me. The trend now is to prescribe SSRIs and similar, then if no success to try another drug of the same class,  and so on. Unfortunately, this went on for 20 years in my case.

I would be feeling anxious, get depressed, see my doctor and start one of these meds. After 6 months or a year the emitional blunting and apathy/lethargy became too much and I'd stop taking it. Then I'd gradually start feeling anxious and depressed, see my doctor .... and so on.

In the end my psychiatrist had tried so many antidepressants on me that he started going on about electroconvulsive therapy. I wasn't overly keen on that, so began asking for a medication I'd read a bit about and that seemed to fit my symptoms.

It's called Nardil and is an old drug dating back to the 1960s. It isn't used much now because taking it requires adherance to a restricted diet and it also interacts dangerously with many other drugs. It has a reputation as being old and dangerous, with severe side-effects. So the newer, safer, but in my case useless drugs are handed out instead.

Anyway, long story short Nardil has worked great for me, and best of all it hasn't caused any emotional blunting. I still feel like me, just heaps better. Anxiety is a thing of the past, thank God. 

There is a trade-off, though, with the side-effects. I've put on 10kg in 2 years, and my sex life isn't the best any more. Sleep can also be difficult to come by. The diet isn't a problem for me, it's become second nature. But all that is minor in comparison to the benefits I'm getting.

So that's a summary of my journey through medication-land. I won't waffle on any longer.

As a footnote, though, Nardil is in shortage everywhere at the moment, so I may have to go back to the drawing board and search for something else that works.

Like I said before, you're clearly a good guy. I really do hope things improve for you, whether that be in your circumstances or your outlook.

This pandemic has highlighted the use of video platforms I have no idea how to use, grocery delivery I probably couldn't figure out, rapidly changing news I cannot find in the first place, online school I could never navigate, takeout ordering and food service delivery I've never used, and apps and hangouts  I've never heard of.

However,  it's extremely discouraging to hear the growing dependence on these options with no idea how to use them. Does anyone else struggle with a lost feeling?

">Or, are they easier than they appear and I'm being overly harsh on myself?

I think this is the answer.  I also get overwhelmed easily with technology stuff & thus avoid a lot of it, but whenever I actually do get around to using a new app like for grocery delivery or whatever, I've almost always found it to be very easy to figure out.  These apps are designed & built so that as many people as possible can use them easily, so a lot will start out basically guiding you through the process til you get the hang of it, and if that doesn't work & something is confusing you, they all have support people you can communicate with.  You definitely don't need to be on every single new platform/app, but if there's something that seems like it'd make life more convenient, just sign up & try, you will most likely find it easy to figure out, & then you can decide whether it's actually worth using or just to delete it.  I've deleted way more things than I've kept, based on what's actually useful.  But don't worry if you never really enjoy or get into this sort of thing, you don't technically *need* any of it.

"i've been depressed and anxious for 17 years so i thought i'd ""seen it all"", **but i haven't.**

i just recently was intimately and vividly introduced to the feeling of needing to die. not merely wanting to die, but actually feeling a *need* to die as the only solution for my pain. there are no adequate words to describe that pain. it's not like a panic attack. it's not an attack, it's just a state of mind that washes over me and lasts for a few hours up to 2 days. it feels like my soul has cancer, like i'm dying, like i'm already dead. like the wave of nausea you get just before vomiting except it lasts for hours.

i feel better now, but i still have episodes where i feel like that. and it's terrifying. on one of the days i felt it, i went to the cinema and just sat there, i could only pay attention to the movie with 30% of my mind.

*i need so much help*. i'm trying to work up the courage to talk to my manager so i can get a dispensation to see a therapist.

I don't have any helpful words, other than I have experienced this feeling somewhat recently. Instead of wanting to die, which many people do from time to time, I actually rationalized my need to die based on finances, age, being non-responsive to therapy, etc.. I felt I had nothing to give, that I can't continue to be a burden for money and space, and that I was incapable of getting better. Therefore, the need belief arose.

I'm spending more time in bed and have lost my physique. Going to get food is becoming a major effort. I'm not creative with my time and have no interest in videos or how tos.  Past failures and memories are all making sense and the early (missed) cues of being destined to be underachieving and depressed are vivid. I'm fixated on formulating a plan to throw everything into the car for a final road trip. Really becoming unwound. What's unsettling is I'm strangely becoming comfortable with it.

"Worse. Fuck this. My anxiety is nonstop through the roof. That causes my dysphasia (trouble speaking) to act up, which just sucks.  I've never been a very social person, but I'm definitely feeling the distance part of social distancing. 

I live in NC, and people are very welcoming and polite, usually. They smile and nod, say hello to everyone they happen to make slight eye contact with. One of the reasons that I love it here! But now, everyone (at the grocery store, on walks) stares at the ground, afraid to make eye contact, or feeling strange about it. I don't know why. You're not going to catch anything by smiling at a passerby. 

This spring has been really gorgeous, and all u want to do is go to the lake with a few friends, wifey, and the mutts, but can't! We were supposed to go to an awesome music festival at the beginning of May, that got canceled. One of our yearly traditions for the past seven years. It's camping & music & new friends, old friends & just freaking fun. Then we have a trip planned to NM in early June, that too probably isn't going to happen.

This thing is also really, really fucking with my sense of the real. I've always had issues with not being able to be certain as to whether the world exists as I percieved it anyway. Add this (along with all kinds of other related & unrelated junk), and it all seems so surreal.

"I think we were all bound to find this very challenging, even those of us who are hardcore hermits when the chips are down. So whilst in general I am worse than before, I am proud of the things I‚Äôm still managing to do.

Worse - Washing myself has dropped to once maybe every 4-5 days. Wearing same clothes all the time. Today was the first day in 6 weeks that I‚Äôve not managed to get myself up before noon. I don‚Äôt want to go shopping so I‚Äôm eating rubbish. Dinner was a chunk of cheese and 3 dried figs for dessert. I have a fear of being outside alone so I‚Äôve not been outside to exercise other than my very small garden for 6 weeks now.

I really need to go shopping. I just get really, I dunno, uncomfortable, I guess, about standing in the queue waiting to be let in, I feel like everyone is judging me standing there. So I‚Äôve been avoiding it.

Good things - I have yet to find myself unable to get dressed, even if it is into yesterdays clothes. All my pets are well fed and provided for and we are all loving the bonding time. I have caught up on all those tv series that were hanging over my head as ‚Äúmust watch‚Äù. My plants are doing well because I‚Äôm here to notice they need watering. I am managing to do tiny bits of crafts, which feels like an achievement although I know I‚Äôm doing it to avoid tidying the house.

"No, I think this is the wrong idea. Mental illness is still an illness - you can't tell someone to be over their cold by such and such date, or stop taking chemo meds by this date regardless of where they're at. 

What you CAN do is require that the person with an illness, mental or otherwise, take steps to try and get better. IE: Call a therapist by this date. Once that's accomplished, go to therapy regularly. Take medications if they have them. 

The problem, of course, is that having a mental illness makes it harder to do the things you need to in order to get better. That's why in order for it to work, you BOTH have to agree to the goals and timelines. The person you're dealing with will have setbacks. They will not make steady, continual progress. You have to set small, realistic goals they can actually accomplish. 

And to be honest, if you're dealing with a partner who has a mental illness, it wouldn't hurt for you to be in therapy either.

You ultimately cannot control other people, only your presence in their life and them in yours. Ultimatums should be about boundaries and that's really all you can do. Say, I need to see this improvement by this time, or I just can't do this anymore for my own self, my own needs, my own patience, sanity, and whatever else. We are a different and entitled to our genuine boundaries. If an illness gets in the way, it gets in the way. Life isn't fair. But both people should be doing what they can, when and where they can, until they can't anymore. That's where ultimatums should come into play IMO. does not negate a different person's right to be happy. Depression should not take 2 people when it could only take one. Both people should try their best, but limits are there for a reason and need to be listened to, no matter how it makes anyone feel. Life isn't fair. Set goals and communicate needs,standards, boundaries. I've had a lot of mental health problems. If my partner decided they can't handle my issues, that's their right. An ultimatum might be what comes out first. But it's still just another way to communicate. It is not a solution in itself, it's just a warning for an approaching limit. Limits are natural and necessary. People can't force things to work, but they can try to communicate when the limits are being reached, and ultimatums are one way to do that. It's better than saying nothing and being miserable, or simply leaving, unless safety is being compromised in which case, leaving quickly would be the better survival choice. Ultimatums are just an expression of patience running out, and everyone is entitled to run out of something that is not an infinite thing to keep giving to anyone else.	reddittdepression	reply	na	na	na	0.990731418132782	no	no	no	na	MadOver30	no prediction.

I keep up with basic hygiene (shower, shave, etc,), eat relatively healthy although there's no real variety, clean and do laundry, keep up with bills, read the news related to the pandemic, come online to see how others cope, and comment as much as I can (this surprisingly is very helpful).

"I've been with my husband for 12 years, married for 5.

Last few years have been tough. No foul play involved, just stress from life.

We are best friends and each other's world. We've gotten through a lot.

Lately I've been frustrated with his his lack of effort in our relationship and his breaking of promises when he vows to be better.

We tried seeing a marriage counselor before the COVID-19 crisis but the person wasn't a good fit and her only real solution to us was to ""buy lingerie"".

We've both been working from home due to the virus. It's been even more stressful. 

Recently we sat down and hashed it out. He told me how he felt and what he needed. I promised to give him more space while we both worked from home. I told him how I felt and what I needed. He set daily goals to better himself and the relationship. Simple stuff like ""spend 15 minutes a day reading about how to be a more thoughtful person"" or whatever. He promised me he would work at this every day. 

Within 3 days he had failed. He was too busy playing video games for 5 hours. He couldn't even give me 15 minutes.

I feel so disrespected and hurt. He says he loves me and respects me but his actions don't indicate that. 

It's like I'm begging him to respect me. It's not fair. I have spent time very day for months (really, years) working on me and on our relationship. He has proven he won't do the same for me.

I guess the writing is on the wall.

I never thought it would be this way.

I'm so depressed. I feel so alone and like I can't talk to anyone. I'm so ashamed. I just wish I felt loved."	ZestycloseReflection	post	32.60323994033681	female	White	0.9992907047271729	na	na	na	7	MadOver30	no prediction.

"It's so hard being in the ""alone and ashamed"" stage of a relationship breaking down. I was there not too long ago. If you're right and this isn't going to work, I hope you can have trust in the process. It will suck and suck and suck and then some point your desire for a richer, better life will begin to outweigh everything else and the sense of paralysis will lift. Let yourself get sick and tired of his bullshit.  Ask yourself what you would want for a sibling or friend you admire if they were feeling in their relationship the way you currently feel in yours.

If you are in the grips of  shame and loneliness it makes sense that you feel like you can't talk to anyone. Try to trust that your people are going to be supportive and a lot of them will get it- more people have been through this than you think and they remember how confusing and sucky it is. It will be less embarrassing than you think and eventually little by little your chest will begin to feel lighter and lighter.

It sounds like you've tried as hard as you could for a long time and he isn't doing the same, and that's something you have no control over.

"NO! An emphatic no. I have seen many therapists and tried many medications over the course of more than a decade. I have always made an effort to do what they advise, though I often fall short or it takes me a long time. Examples of this are getting sober, socializing more, exercising and changing diet, meditation, mindfulness, visualizations, etc. I have done a lot in my experiences in therapy and it has never yielded any meaningful results - I‚Äôm still miserable.

The entire dialogue around therapy all sounds the same, whether you hear it from lay people or the therapists themselves - and it is actually already been said in the reply before me. Basically, it distills down to this: if you do enough therapy, remain committed, and put in the work, you will see progress. However, what the ‚Äúwork‚Äù is is never clarified or elaborated on - I have confronted several therapists about this in no uncertain terms, asking them ‚Äúwhat EXACTLY is the work we are going to do that will help me feel better?‚Äù Their answer is always either one of two responses: 1, we are going to talk about your problems, and that will help, or 2. A purposely vague and inconclusive answer that has no substance to it. This is because therapists themselves know that what they do is largely nonsense. People who are therapists do not study how to help people; there is no formal training for therapy. What therapists studied in school was pathology. They understand brokenness, but not how to fix it.

The best analogy I can make: imagine a whiteboard, written on which are variables and numbers, followed by a bunch of question marks or white space, and then at the end, ‚Äú= 59,389.‚Äù The meat of the equation, where the actual work takes place, is missing - because therapists do not know how to solve the problem."	reddittdepression	reply	na	na	na	0.9992907047271729	no	strong	no	na	MadOver30	failed
"Some of it did help, some has hurt, and lots of it did nothing. The worst part is that some of it seemed to help in the beginning but actually made things worse long term. I don‚Äôt mean to ruin it for anyone, if you need it and its helping, more power to you.

About being blamed for it not working. In the beginning I get told that I did it wrong and I am corrected. Then I'm told that I‚Äôm not waiting long enough for results. Then I'm told that it *is* working and I just don‚Äôt realize it. Then after several months and money, its back to the old I did it wrong. It is a run around.

But the worst was the therapy that started out great, then slowly convinced me that I was a victim, everything that was happening in my life was because of a disorder that I didn‚Äôt know I had. That my identity and everything special or good about me was based on that disorder and the therapy I was doing. That I was dependent on my therapy and couldn‚Äôt think for myself because it wasn‚Äôt safe. And eventually told me that there was no cure and I would need therapy for the rest of my life. And it all felt great the whole way. I am out of therapy and ironically‚Ä¶ cured.

Not saying therapy did nothing for me, just be careful.

And as someone who has several friends and relatives who are practicing therapists, they do not know how to handle their own lives, they just know a little more than the average person and are there to listen and try to help.

"u/reddittdepression I want to remind you that there are other helping techniques beside therapy. Three times I've had to see therapists and each time I got hurt a lot. First guy told middle-school-me that my interest in sci-fi and anime was wrong. I'd be cured if I could instead like girls and cars like ""normal healthy boys"". He also used physical touch in a way that made me uncomfortable. 

Toward the end of college I had to see a counselor who was a coworker of my dad's. She told me that she told him about each of our sessions because ""he'd be so proud of [me.]"". Well, my dad is a retired mental health caseworker and I don't really have a relationship with him anymore because of what he heard. 

Latest attempt was in 2015 where my counselor, whom I was seeing for grief, went to the same church as my boss. My boss mentioned having a new employee (me) and the counselor went ""Oh I know him, here's how!"" and since this was the deep South my boss called a staff meeting the next Monday and had me choose, in front of everyone, whether I kept my job or continued with therapy. I was a marketing professional for a nonprofit and ""you need to be mentally stable to be the public face of the organization.""

The therapist from the first story later got his license revoked by one state and now lives and works in another, same line of work. I reported the therapist from the last story, but therapist oversight just isn't very strong.

I know people say that it's not a therapist's job to 'tell me what to do' but I've always felt as though I need them to offer me some direction in what changes I need to make in order to start feeling better and more in control.

They've all been nice enough, but as OP said, more of a sympathetic ear.

There has to be a connection to both the person and the therapy style. Even to the point that they get what you say and can get under it, know how to ask questions that push you and know how to get you out of your comfort zone, don't let you slide. There is always going to lulls, backsliding, but there has to be forward progress and breakthroughs. These will probably feel uncomforable and stressful and push you past your comfort zone. If this isn't happening, why are you paying someone that isn't effective? This is my take on it, I need this person be able to do more for me that I can do with my own thoughts or by talking to my friends and family. Otherwise, why are you paying a professional? Keep searching, all therapists are not equal. I usually do intake plus a few sessions and then move on if its not happening.	reddittdepression	reply	na	na	na	0.9992907047271729	weak	no	no	na	MadOver30	failed

Some of the therapists that didn't work for me might have worked for someone else. A lot of it was about finding the right person at the right time.

Long time depressive whose outlets are outdoor recreation and athletics/ working out and having some space. After so many days of this lockdown, perhaps some of you can relate to what's happening to me. I've lost all creativity for coping - such efforts have become stale.

I'm stewing in depression, my thoughts are bleak, and my days aren't even filled with menial tasks.

First I can tell you you‚Äôre not alone.

I literally just wait for the day to progress so I can finally go to bed. My husband is an essential worker so not much has changed for him. I‚Äôm on work from home orders but I went from full time to less than 15 hours per week. I have a very low bar. If I can shower, do the dishes, do maybe 1 load of laundry, and cook dinner then I call it a good day. When the weather is nice i take my son out for walks and to ride his tricycle but nice days are few and far between. This quarantine is super shitty.

"Found this sub after browsing r/depression for awhile. A lot of people hurting out there, but they're so young I have hope for their recovery. This is a little disconcerting since ""over 30"" implies there's been a barrier breached: that your depression is cemented. I'd like to ask if anyone else has deteriorated well after 30, and if depression has worsened over time. 30 seemed to be my peak even with depression, but circumstances have led me spiraling downward. I'm wondering if someone like me exists out there. I feel similar to a 19 y/o with depression. Hopeless, suicidal, mentally fogged, alone, uninterested and in a trance.

"It's a bit like alcoholism, I think.  At least, there are parallels.

My depression was much more in control (as opposed to *under* control), much more untreated and undiagnosed in my 20s (and 30s) than now.  But I was more functional, and didn't have a lot of purely logistical or physical problems (health, finances) that I have now.

Kind of like an alcoholic who used to function better when they were drinking, as far as going to work and keeping up appearances, that sort of thing.  There's still only one way to go, though.

"For me it's been chronic social anxiety and depression (it's also been diagnosed as dysthymia) for as long as I can remember. 

The anxiety has definitely always been there. The depression developed around my early 20s (I'm 45) and has varied in severity. Difficult life circumstances  have sent me spiralling down. 

My 30s are a blur of ineffective meds and deadened emotions.

The past couple of years have actually been pretty good, thanks to finding a medication that works for me.

Unfortunately, it's looking like said medication is at some point going to become unavailable. 

I'm considering what I'll do if/when that happens. The thought of going back to how I was before doesn't exactly thrill me. 

Neither does getting back on the merry-go-round of trying numerous meds that don't work.

"It's hard to say... Around when I turned 31 is around when doctors began outright refusing to treat chronic pain, and it has now been 5 years since receiving any pain prescription. This has sent me straight off the rails into no-man-recovers-from-this land. Heck if I know where I'd be if all my doctors weren't selfish trashpeople who really didn't care about the consequences of their actions on their patients, even when they kill them.

Separately, I've been making progress in digging through the roots of my issues, and figuring out why I am how I am and forming more realistic expectations for myself. Expecting to recover was an endless treadmill of disappointment. But adjusting my expectations to my actual abilities made life a lot more comfortable. Family that treats it like something that's your fault just makes it worse.

"I completely lost all control and crashed into a steel wall of depression in my early 30s (41 now). It was terrible. Nothing worked, medicine made things worse because of side effects.

"Heck yeah u/reddittdepression! For a lot of people they found comfort in ""you deserve to get help because you have so much potential! You have your entire life ahead of you."" which is a lot more difficult to say if you hit your mid-30s and have no stable job, no kids, etc. The best we can say now for these people is ""you deserve to get help because you have inherent dignity and worth"" which is a lot more confusing to understand. It's a harder sell and a much more difficult pill to swallow. 

Folks will come around here and claim that medication and therapy helps. The truth is that they only have a very small chance to help, and even then it comes into effect only after you've spent months/years of time and hundreds of dollars on copays. 

I am not mad over 30, but I do act as support for my fiancee and friends who have mental illness. And let me tell you, in ever single case I've seen there have been significant declines in your late 20s and early 30s. u/meowsock tells you that you'll get skewed replies, but I bet you'd get the same type of replies if you posted on a dozen subs, if you did an online survey, or whatever. 

Lately what has occurred to me is that all the attempts to get better are pretty much bunk. You see a person with toxic traits, a person who doesn't work on themselves, a person who doesn't try to get better or be held accountable, and they tend to be happy with their life: friends and family, a good career, no big financial stressors. 

Now you see a person working to improve their mental health, but odds are they're broke from having no job or a shitty job. What money they have goes to paying for pills that fry their emotions and to paying therapists who generally give the same advice for each client. They tend to have fewer friends, their family relationships are strained, they have significant stressors in life. 

So your choice is to do all of that work and still come up short or just adopt apathy (it's called 'apatheticism' or 'nihilism' I think!) and live your life. It's hard to walk wise in a world full of folly, and jumping through hoops and having a more difficult life in the name of ""being a good person"" or ""getting well because I owe it to myself"" just isn't worth it. 

Many therapists use their client base as their own personal Tinder anyway. You're already confessing your deepest thoughts to this person and a strong emotional bond forms, so a strong physical/sexual bond often follows. Buddy of mine just lost his GF to her therapist, he used to see them walking hand-in-hand around the neighborhood before COVID hit."	reddittdepression	reply	na	na	na	0.006011899095028639	weak	strong	no	na	MadOver30	no prediction.

I can't argue with your observations, but this is a false dilemma.

I started doing better once I did my own thing. And there's tons of things you can do.

The second day of no sleep I began panic cleaning, because my husband told me someone at his work tested positive. I was scrubbing the walls, the counters, washing all of the bedding and laundry. I was even prepared to isolate my husband in a room. I stopped and just let everything out. I realized that the biggest thing controlling me was things I can‚Äôt control. Things I have no power or choice in the matter. I decided that the only way I can survive this mentally is to logically think about the things I can actually control. I can choose to isolate as much as possible. I can choose to take preventive measures. I have a choice in what I do to best take care of me, my husband, and my patients.

"Hi all,

I'm glad this sub exists and that it is so very different from r/depression

About me: I'm early thirties. I like to read. I am pretty intelligent. I have a degree in Biochemistry. I have struggled with depression and anxiety my whole life. Started self harming at 12, stopped over a decade ago. History of alcohol abuse, however I am now 3.5 years sober and incredibly proud. I think marijuana should be legal everywhere but I can't stand it. I was assigned female at birth (have all the bits a typical human female woud have) but have never fitted in with 'womanly' women, bor 'masculine' men. I've always sorta straddled the binary and been genderly-ambiguous. I use they/them pronouns. Sexually adventurous and proud. Queer. Skinny. No childhood trauma beyond that which I strongly suspect to be usual. Recently seperated from a partner whom I cared for dearly and it still hurts.

I was diagnosed with GAD and depression maybe 6 or 7 years ago. Since then I have been medicated. At first nothing worked - celexa, remeron, wellbutrin... but fourth time lucky, and a cocktail of effexor and klonopin came along and I could handle it. I've been taking it ever since. I got a prescription for low dose (I don't want to be a dude) testosterone in November, but held off taking it because, as I told the Dr at the time, I was in the middle of a depressive episode and it didn't seem a great time to make decisions. It was one of my longest depressive episodes I can recall in recent history. In January I talked to my psyc and they put me on the highest does possible of effexor in hope of fixing me. They also suggested taking the testosterone as it is reported to give people 'energy' and can improve mood, so I did. Yey stabbing myself every week!

Fast forward to March and I am *still* in this depressive episode. I can't sleep, I'm always tired, my sex drive has taken a big old hit, I forget to eat a lot of the time. All I want to do is read comics and sleep. Work is a black hole and I hate it. They have tried two different medications to help with the nightmares, teeth grinding, jaw clenching and night sweats and nothing has helped. Energy level perpetually low. Testosterone has had no discernible effects in the 4 weeks I've been taking it.

So, today, my pysc decided to prescribe me Abilify to take alongside my Effexor. I understand it is an antipsychotic and it's mechanism of action is via 5HTP receptors (Dopamine!). Thus, I should have Serotonin and Norepinephrine covered by my Effexor (an SNRI), Dopamine by Abilify and I dunno whatever Benzos take care of by the Klonopin.

I am concerned that being on the highest dose of effexor, klonopin, low testosterone and now Abilify could be... too much? Particularity for someone with a history of substance abuse? FYI:

Effexor: 225mg/day
Klonopin: 2mg/day
Abilify: 2mg/day
Testosterone: 20mg/week

What y'all think? Also super interested if anyone else has started Abilify this late on in their treatment and how they have found it. 

Thanks! :)

"Stream of consciousness here following a negative life event, bear with me...

It just sort of hit me like a ton of bricks the chasm that exists between day-to-day ""efforts"" that we make, which are almost universally seen as positive and ""the right thing to do"". Embracing discomfort, they call it. Not staying in bed. Challenging yourself to go to the mall if you have social anxiety, etc.

What I'm seeing more and more is that these gestures are usually just symbolic and desperate in nature. While its appropriate for someone having a really bad day to try and do \*something\*, it seems like these types of activities are constantly reinforced by society as a positive lifestyle choice for anyone going through a difficult time. That you should somehow build a life and be pleased with continually balancing self-care and gradual exposure.

I think this is horseshit . Overtly ""giving up"" on going through the motions of the daily grind for 1 to 2 days a week  provides me with insights as to what my real medium and long term goals should be. it provides me with a window into what people *really* think. People act as though making some effort is virtuous, even if it's just going out to do groceries and handling daily basic maintenance tasks. All of the sudden though, if you stay in bed all day, or on the couch watching TV ""you have a real problem now"".

How blind people are. How useless their feedback is when it comes to organizing the day's tasks into a coherent medium-term strategy. You can spot these inconsistencies the more you interact with people for extended periods. People view being too tired to go to the gym as ""normal"", but too tired to go to a restaurant as ""crazy"". Leaving dishes dirty  in the sink and dirty clothes on the floor is ""irresponsible"" while spending all day looking busy while having a mountain of unresolved tasks and personal issues is ""just like everyone else, part of being human"".

I don't know what the take home message is here. Have the courage to completely abandon keeping up appearances for a couple days. Then have the courage to do ""too much"" in an area that other people think is ""fine""."	clon3man	post	28.630564077800834	female	White	0.007763418834656477	na	na	na	7	MadOver30	failed

The next thing you gotta do is get some therapy for your PTSD. This is the chink in the chain that once fixed, will make everything else much easier to deal with.

"I would rather be rich and unfeeling. I am the type of person who has compassion and empathy for people, but I really just see it as a liability at best and a weakness at worst. Caring and having compassion and empathy for others provides no benefit to the self.

Conversely, people who are unfeeling are not plagued by all the worries and insecurities that having a conscience provides, and they are so smug and narcissistic  that it seems like they spend their lives in a state of high self esteem and self satisfaction.

"It bears repeating: life is constant change mostly resulting in some form of suffering. Only with the advancements of the past barely 100 years or so has that altered the calculus where people can pursue an abstract notion of *happiness* as part of modern life.

Hello my friend. Don‚Äôt beat yourself up. It‚Äôs not your fault that the economy is down and that your degree is not paying off right now. You should not be ashamed of a bad economy. You didn‚Äôt make that. As to not being able to get to your gym, try walking outside. Just walks or even runs. Obviously not in crowds or in groups, but find somewhere quiet to get yourself out for a daily walk at least. That should help your spirits and your fitness. Best of luck to you.

"Life isn‚Äôt a race. There‚Äôs no surpassing anyone. I‚Äôm almost 35, single, with no kids. My family is my dogs and cats, and the people I choose to surround myself with. I‚Äôm content with that. 

For self love, I‚Äôm a fan of the bean method. Put a bunch of beans in your left pocket. Every time you notice something good in the world, think a pleasant or positive thought, or just see something you like, move one bean from your left pocket to your right. One of the things you‚Äôll notice is you start looking for the good. 

Along with the bean method is actively participating in positive self talk. Take the negative things you‚Äôve said about yourself and turn them into positives. Also, give yourself credit for the things you are doing well. Have a positive thought? Bean. Turn a negative into a positive? Bean.

"For me, I finally came to the understanding that if I couldn't accept my flaws... if I couldn't allow them to stay, then I would be doomed to fight them for the rest of my life.

I spent the first 36 years of my life hating so much about myself. Feeling like a failure. Trying so hard just to not fuck up.  When I wasn't hating myself for messing something up, I was in fear that I was just on the verge of messing something up.  It destroyed any hope I had of enjoying life.  When things were good, I would start to become worried I was about to fuck it all up again.  I couldn't enjoy any successes for fear of the next failure.

One day I realized that until I could look at one of my defects and freely say, ""you can stay,"" then I would never be happy.  The realization hit me all at once.   The more I fought to not make mistakes, the more frustrated I got. The more frustrated I got, the more I was guaranteed to make mistakes.   Once I became able to accept my shortcomings as I would anyone else's, I became able to continue moving forward despite any mistakes I might make along the way.

The problem was never my shortcomings, it was my inability to accept them.  I will never be rid of them, but now my life is no longer run by them.  Sure, I have my days, but I've known peace now, and that's all I **ever** wanted.

It also occurred to me that it's very similar to dating.  The more desperate a person is to find love, the more they push it away.  They turn themselves into a mess just being terrified of being alone forever.  I have done the same for years.  I'm slowly getting over that, too.

It makes me feel better to think about it that way because capitalism failing and creating openings for new systems to take root and flourish seems infinitely more believable than holding out hope that, like, America will *allow* people to have power--that's pretty much unthinkable, but there is still some hope for opportune failures!		reply	na	na	na	0.9985082745552063	weak	strong	no	na	MadOver30	no prediction.

I am skeptical that her mother will remain happy her whole life. My guess is she will have a tendency to alienate others just, like she did with her daughter.

"I am 70. Mom was the caretaker for Dad and I was the caretaker for my Mother. I had my children when I was about 40, so I had a full time job as a speech therapist and my children were 5 years old to 9 years old and I got my Mother who had early dementia. My only sibling who lived near Mom had taken a job overseas because he did not want to be the caretaker.  So I went to get her and brought her here. She needed everything. She had a serious health problem and a major operations and she lived with us for about a year. Then I found a nearby facility for her. 
I would advise to get medical doctor and medicine conveniently located.  Get a chart for the  stages of dementia so you will be proactive as his/her needs change and her situation needs to change. You have to speak up and advocate.  This is a season of life. You care for a loved one. Ask for help from family members. You may be caretaking for awhile. Take care to refresh yourself. Hard work is good but a balanced life where you take time to do some things you love helps you keep going. My mom was in the hospital 63 days one time with rehab after that.

I am in my 40s and took care of my parents until they died. It about killed me. Our society is no longer constructed for care of the elderly at home. There are only 2 options.Institutionalize them or give up your whole life to take care of them at home because no one will help you. The advances of modern medicine combined with our alienated social structure has made aging a nightmare. We end up blaming the elderly for this. The narcissism of the boomer generation sure doesn‚Äôt help. BUT overall they can‚Äôt help the situation they are in. Taking care of them is generally really difficult.

"Yep.  Going through a prolonged period of joblessness, depression, anxiety, S.A.D., agoraphobia, intense shame, all that.

Have a pair of elderly relatives that have no one else, have been surrogate-parent-like to me in the past.  They're both disabled and cared for each other, until age caught up with one of them and now both their health conditions are drastically deteriorating along with their funds due to skyrocketing cost of living.  They moved twice in 6 years, now they're in a HUD-subsidized, dingy matchbox and driving me insane.

Of course they're going through their own depression, anxiety, etc.  The record in the last 4 years for not getting a call or text for immediate assistance from them was 48 hours.  Most of the time it isn't even 4 hours.  Every tiny problem - and there are a lot of them when you're disabled and elderly and sickly - is a major meltdown-worthy catastrophe that I must solve.

"You need help. It‚Äôs not true that the only choices are institutional settings or family. 
If your father has assets look into private pay home health. If he can‚Äôt be left alone look into assisted living such as a CBRF. 
You can visit and call all you want but you have to take care of you. 
If your father does not have enough funds to privately pay for services call an ADRC (Aging & Disability Resource Center) and someone will be able to walk you through public ally funded services. If he does not qualify right now financially or by being physically or cognitively ( known as functionally) eligible the ADRC staff person can walk you through the steps on what to do and when to do it. 
This can be done at your home, at their office, or somewhere else. If your father wants to or can participate he should. Programs are voluntary so he needs to understand that these programs can help him socially, economically and have a good quality of life. 
If he does not agree to participate the ADRC will not be able to give you information specific to him but they can lay out the options available (in general) so you know what they are.
You may feel like your alone in this but there are systems in place to help.

"I'd been handling things really well for the past 3-4 months. Really proud of myself. But something about this week got to me and it's work-related i.e. I didn't get as much of it done as I would have liked.

We've had some pretty big holidays in my neck of the woods and this week was the first after all the holidays were done with. So it's no surprise that I suddenly get calls, emails and messages from clients (and potential clients) about projects. I was in a few meetings which took up time I could have spent clearing up my workload. And I have some deadlines looming.

A couple of times this week I felt a palpable sense of anxiety shoot through me from my stomach to my head. I'm not freaking out (yet) but I have noticed myself experiencing the physical sensations of anxiety a lot more often. I've also been tempted to avoid doing work altogether which I know is my go-to avoidance behaviour when I'm feeling over-whelmed. Thankfully I have been able to ""trick"" myself into doing some work.

It's been making it difficult for me to fall asleep. I've had to resort to taking cough medicine which I'd set aside especially for this purpose.

I went for a walk this evening at a place about a 20-minute drive from my home. It's where I go to just give my mind a bit of space. Here's hoping tonight sleep comes easy.

Will be working tomorrow (Sunday) but it actually works out quite nicely because I'll be staying with mum all day so it's a good chance to get some work done.

I have depression, a TBI and PTSD, but my ASD went undiagnosed for my whole life. I was always the last to assigned a team (no one wanted me), was bullied, beaten up, ridiculed and that was just my stepmother.

I played by myself as a child and grew comfortable being alone. I probably wasn't the most fun being around as I was very immature. Being ignored was a way of life for me. I chose to suffer in silence so my father could be happy. If I knew he was going to write his will with his dick I would have decided differently. I see no reason to protect someone who wasn't going to protect me. I never had children so the chain of abuse could be broken and now when I die, my family name goes with me. It is just as well. I don't have a legacy. No one will remember I ever existed.

I have nothing to offer. No money, few teeth, ill health. Living on the streets took it's toll. Moments of happiness were fleeting and elusive.

I have been given very little feedback , and allegedly (according to the written explanation) any feedback that I have been given was in the form of a passing comment. At no point was I made aware that I was on thin ice. The most feedback i got was when they fired me. I'm pissed at how thus was handeled , pissed at sone of the reasons given, and pissed that I've gotta start looking for a job again.

 I'm not terribly sad to see the job go , it wasn't a horrible place at all, but wasn't a good fit. Looking back on it , if I had been more engaged these problems that were ppointed out probably wouldn't have occured. I wasn't fully active in trying to get more engaged , but some of my early ideas and contributions were just shelved , no feedback whatsoever. 

I  don't disagree with all the feedback I was given, just felt like at no point was I given this feedback in any sort of serious manner. My boss created a paper trail that makes it look like they were more proactive me with me , but it was mostly bullshit. Im trying to take what I can from this experience and moving on.

I've been the last week just kind of relaxing and doing som thinjinh. Going to start a new passion project and go visit family and friends back in my home town next week.

"I've been though something similar.  Not knowing where you're gonna live is a major stressor, especially if you felt like you had a stable place.  

What's the situation like with your family?  If you can, I'd say suck it up and move back in with mom or dad for a while till you find a new place.  If family is out of the question, you could maybe ask friends.  I personally had a bad experience there, but your mileage may vary.  

Worst case scenario would be a shelter.  I can't give you any advice about that, I luckily managed to avoid it.  But you mentioned going inpatient, and one of the times I was in a similar situation they were going to discharge me to one.  So even if you go inpatient you might just end up there anyway.  Though there are other good reasons to go inpatient, if that's what you wanna do.  

You can get past this, and find a good place to live.  It's not over or anything.  Definitely ask family and friends, or worst case you could go to a shelter.  And then just get to the library and use their computers to find a new place that works for you.  Inpatient will try to help with that as well, and they'll give you some ideas as to where to look.

"Transitions are usually rough when you're emotionally drained, even if they're beneficial. 

Moving out of your home is perhaps the most stressful event most people purposefully undertake, but when you're forced to move, of course it's going to feel worse while it's happening.

In a wider view, try to endure a while longer, until you get to a good place in your life. It's important you learn to recognise that good place when you find it, too. Don't hold on to the fears you had before, if it means limiting your enjoyment of what you have now and don't idealise a perfect life, at the expense of not working on your real goals.

Remember to seek out help wherever you can find it. It'll be easier to do this when your depressive mood lifts, but do what you can right now to get the momentum going. It's not cheating or selfish to put yourself at the centre of your world and say ""I matter. Now, how am I going to get out of this?""

Depression will tell you the answer is you won't, but depression is a loud liar - We all ought to know that by now, but we keep needing to be reminded, because depression can be incredibly persuasive.

In a year's time, you will be somewhere new and you won't feel this kind of pain, because you'll have faced the worst and seen how you adapted to it, instead of crumbling.

You have probably already grown stronger. Think back to your younger self and how you would have reacted back then and then see how you're using all your skills to help yourself now.

Physical health is very strongly connected, so be sure you are looking after that too, or else it's like trying to bail out water when you've yet to plug the hole in your boat. You can make significantly more progress when you're well rested, well fed and setting time aside for some exercise.

"\[hi all - I'm on this group on my main account and I lurk daily. I made a throwaway for contributing\]

I want to hurt myself but I don't want to die. I want something in the sweet spot, that could get me maybe 2 or 3 weeks of short-term disability paid leave from work, without getting me a 5150.

My life has been really tough and work is an all consuming black hole and I hate hate hate it and I need some time off to gather my spoons and apply for better jobs. But first, to read books, to spend time with my chickens in the garden, to just be me and not fear the now DAILY reprimanding meetings from my work. I feel like I NEED some time, to myself, to be me, to collect myself, to help myself before I start deciding to act on suicidal thoughts.

**Any suggestions?**

Additionally, I have a few questions about a 5150. If anyone could answer them, it'd be really great:

* would my insurance cover a 5150? I have short-term disability, and the best insurance that my work offers
* would I be able to read the whole time if 5150'd? Prolly not? Have to go to meetings and stuff?
* would there be vegan food at a facility for 5150s?
* would a 5150 potentially negatively affect my resident status in the US? I am a green card holder/resident alien

Also relevant: I am seeing my psychiatrist tomorrow afternoon. I slept through the last appointment and it wasn't the first time so now I owe $100. So I am staying awake until then, and when I get to my appointment, I will have been awake 24 hours. My psyc is useless but she gives me the drugs I need, and that's more than I found in this city in the past. Also. I think I might actually be bipolar, whilst currently (since 2013) being treated for diagnosed depression and anxiety.

"I cannot speak as to other nations, but the US is pretty fucked up right now. Both the right and the left are angry and being pig-headed. Our lives are overwhelmed with uncertainty. This makes it evermore urgent to find peace, beauty and solace where we can. I have noticed that as I grow older, I find not only similarities in other races, but appeal. In reflection, I become less understanding of why we disliked each other to begin with. Maybe it's bc I am losing my mind, but then again, maybe we were all being stupid.

Not only do I have friends of virtually every race, but I can't imagine not having other races in my life. Of course, race is just one of many issues we have to address. Having a President who spews hatred with every sentence he utters just fans the flames of discontent. I lived through the civil rights movement of the 60's. Even with the racial tensions of the day, our ideologies weren't as divided as they are today. 

Some of the things I see in the comments section of the news is appalling. The right is so brainwashed into buying that what is good for corporate America is good for them that they are blinded to the concepts of compassion and equality. Sorry if I am preaching to the choir, but it literally hurts me to see our country being torn apart. For those of us with depression and/or other psychological issues, life is already hard enough. It's like the powers that be are deliberately overloading us with turmoil in hopes that we all tune out and they can do whatever they want. I am drifting, I know.

"Yeah, roll out the whataboutism. Clearly, one cannot simply decide to be another race. One cannot decide to erase a life of abuse. Having survived mental illness, trauma, and the before and after of becoming self aware and taking personal accountability for my learned victim mentality, and then getting the fuck over most of it in order to have any sort of life, I'm literally proof that you can decide to not have the shittiest attitude ever about your situation.

My comment was in response to the defeatist, irrational comment of being a loser since birth. I choose to fight that absolutist bullshit mindset every day. Comment very clearly was not about deciding to change the unchangable, but doctoring your attitude and not pretending your wounded opinions are facts. Life doesn't give a shit about labeling anyone as ""pointless"", but it's an easy copout, right? Easier than fighting, growing, relearning, I know. Be what you were MEANT to be. Nothing. Do what life MADE YOU do. Nothing. Other people's success must also be out of their control. Some people just get nothing and others get it all. I guess I'm some sort of fucked up paradox, having had both lives. Or maybe... I changed my situation through years and suffering and failing until it clicked. Probably not, though. I was just a winner from birth.

I reprogrammed a brain that was taught backwards by backwards people. My brain. I decided I wanted what I wanted and decided I could have it if I worked for it. Took years. YEARS. And nothing in life stays 100%, nothing is permanent and everyone has bad fucking days, weeks, even months.

My point is, don't decide your life from infancy? like an idiot. And don't knock any potential help and then say you can't be helped? LMAO. Literally illogical. Have you tried everything and everyone? Nope. But whatever? I'm just saying, you're not God so don't sit there and pretend you have the final say on anything, including your potential because no one knows what the fuck they're made of until its tested again and again and there's no ending to this sentence.

"This is hard for me to write as I am 31 years old and have always felt like something was a little off with me. I never quite ""fit in"" with socializing with other people, but for lack of a better term as I grew into an adult I slowly learned how to do it and can do it pretty seamlessly. Outwardly I'm a pretty normal guy - intelligent, athletic, able to have a social life and girlfriend, but I've always wondered if I was on the spectrum in some kind of way.  I obviously know none of you guys are doctors and not expecting actual medical advice, but I wanted some way to reach out and see if I'm just being dramatic.

These are the things that stick out to me:

&#x200B;

\- I avoid eye contact with strangers mostly, I have no issues maintaining eye contact with loved ones or people I'm intimate with but it's hard for me to debate people or make people uncomfortable and continue looking them in the eye. With strangers after the basic introduction song and dance are out of the way and we go ""off script"", my eyes will wander and I'll probably maintain eye contact about 30% of the time, usually in quick bursts. I have a hard time being present in the moment in a conversation if I'm thinking about forcing myself to maintain eye contact. The attention I do get from girls/strangers I tend to be embarassed and as soon as I catch them looking at me I'll look away, even if I am interested.

&#x200B;

\- I am gifted at writing but I do have a habit of concocting elaborate worlds in my head. I mean, complete storylines with different characters and such that typically come out when I listen to music and imagine scenes from the story. I'll meticulously tweak the scenes until I feel they're \*ready\* (like play with the dialogue the characters will say, the actions, etc) and then typically move onto the next scene. It's how I come up with some of my best stories filled with well realized characters and worlds (one of them actually was published!), but I'm wondering if this in and of itself is a coping mechanism.

&#x200B;

\- I have been able to hold down jobs in customer service and even sales for periods of time (1 year each), but am currently unemployed and have this incredible avoidance of shame/guilt/depression that I can't quite pinpoint that's really been hamstringing me in finding a new one. It feels like I'm trapped in a mental swamp. I just can't wrap my head around giving your life to something you're not passionate about and I realize that is such a child-like mentality that I should have grown out of by now. I think in a lot of ways I still don't feel like an adult. I'm good with kids and fine with being a fun uncle to my friends but I can't wrap my head around other adults actually raising children.

&#x200B;

\- I have struggled with anxiety based depression - a lot of it existential - and alcoholism in my twenties. Although I no longer drink, alcohol helped alleviate the anxiety/uncomfortable state I am in. Alcohol helped me with my social anxiety and just genuinely helped me relax... until ultimately it didn't after years of abuse. I think it has a lot to do with the underlying feeling that I'm just ""different"" than the average person - and this is not some kind of romanticized Charles Bukowski kind of way - it's not because I want to be. I spent years trying to fit in and be ""normal"". I still care so damn much about what people in high school (almost 10 years ago) think of me even though I pretend to not.

&#x200B;

Maybe it is something, maybe it is nothing. I am a bit of a hypochondriac sometimes but I can't shake the feeling that I feel like I have some kind of underlying social disorder and have just learned to cope with it without ever getting diagnosed."

Obligatory I am not a doctor or psychologist, I recently wondered the same thing about myself (36 years old) similar issues. I went in and got tested for it. Which if you can afford to do, I would suggest you do as well, there's no harm in finding out you don't have it and there is nothing but benefit in finding out you do. Because then you can start treating it. But what it turned out being for me is just symptoms of social anxiety that aligned with  symptoms of being on the spectrum.  Social Anxiety covers a huge swath of our personality and I think that we can forget that so when we look at ourselves and see a bunch of things wrong we want to see more than one cause, at least that's how I am. Every time I see another thing that has symptoms that align with my own I start wondering if maybe this is the magic problem that if I fix this issue it will be the one that fixes the rest.

When we called the ortho we got ""oh we are sorry we don't accept your insurance for that category""  What do you mean that category?  It's a broken fucking leg.

"It (Earth & all of its contents) all feels incredibly heavy on my brain, but at the same time, I don't care.

I get headaches. I also have a fucked brain due to a traumatic brain injury. Depression, anxiety, psychosis, *real* pain, apathy, malaise, tinnitus, HEADACHES, these are due to my childhood TBI. No one really understood how traumatic it actually was when it happened. There was a concussion. Aside from a visible scar on the forehead, it's ""invisible."" 

I cried when he said that. When he diminished those injuries, when he shrugged them off like so much dandruff on his shoulder. Knowing what these injuries can do, I cried for those injured *humans.* Before he said that, I would not have wished the injuries of my fucked brain on anyone. Now, I want him to have it. He needs to feel it. He has to feel it. Otherwise, it's not real. 

This is not a call to violence.

Currently, I have nothing else. Yes, I have a wonderful partner, amazing dogs, food, a house... I feel like there is nothing else. Today there is nothing. No, today there is my fucked brain & nothing else. 

I'm hurting without feeling. Too much with not enough at all... 

I am also in need! Someone ground me, confirm that this existence is not real. I'm hoping it's not real. Right now, I would be cured if it all was not real. I actually desire dissociation--need to leave.

"I can't begin to imagine what heaviness feels like after reading your story. I hear your pain and my heart dropped reading those words. 


I suspect you've been offered a large load of unsolicited advice from people who ""knew"" what you were living through and ""knew"" what would ease the pain. I don't know what will help, I don't know how to begin to help.

I do have a thought, though, based on some recent readings I've found and a podcast on the same topic that I actually listened to this morning on my morning commute.


A couple months ago, I stumbled upon the subreddit for Neville Goddard, whom I had never heard of before. Just one of those moments deep into a comment thread on a stupid video and someone says something off the cuff and someone else comments with a fitting sub. Anyway, I've just been reading the posts and comments there lately and I haven't done any of the work myself, yet (except the Tennis Ball excersise which you'll learn about if you decide to peruse the sub. And it worked.). It's all really interesting to me.


The basics of it is mind exscersises meant to lift the imagination and blend reality within it, with the end result being a shift in the world around you. 


Then this morning I pull up the latest episode of a podcast I listen to regularly, Hidden Brain from NPR, and it really touches on the same concepts. 


I'm hearing you say that often times your reality is only you and your injured brain, while the other reality of the world around you carries on. Maybe see if harnessing the power still in that brain, your imagination being a large part of that,  can help you shift your reality. I know, it sounds completely bonkers. I get it. I'm hesitant too. But it seems fairly effortless and hearing the same exploration take place on a science based podcast like HB, I'm more apt to think... maybe??? Maybe it is possible. Maybe so is living again.

"I spend a lot of time fantasizing. I‚Äôve concocted different scenarios in my head that I replay over and over throughout the day, and frequently fall asleep at night while thinking about them. I try to focus on details that make them more gratifying. They are so rehearsed at this point that there is little to no variation and they become somewhat dull. A few examples are winning the lottery - I imagine seeing the numbers on my ticket matching the numbers I see online, my heart rate increasing, where I would store the ticket, the meetings with lawyers before claiming it, etc - and traveling back in time to when I was young - waking up in my childhood bed, all the things I would do differently, etc.

Anyways, I had a new fantasy pop up yesterday which has proven to be quite satisfying. It was born while I looked at myself in the mirror. I thought of how much I hated myself and how I would like to punch the mirror. Then I thought, wouldn‚Äôt it be great if I had a clone of myself that I could keep in my room, but is completely defenseless and would never resist physical assault? I would punch and kick this piece of shit as hard as I could. I imagined me hitting myself until I bled and my teeth fell out, and then getting a bat and just beating my body to a bloody pulp, bones cracking, blood splattering everywhere. In my fantasy, I also yell horrible things to myself- that I am a worthless, pathetic loser, a piece of shit, hated by everyone, that everyone wants me dead, etc.

"I used to violently self-harm myself. Through lots of personal work and therapy, I now no longer physically self-harm as much, and it certainly isn't so violent as it used to be. That being said, instead of physically self-harming, I mentally self-harm. My self-talk is just as violent as it used to be, and my mental images are similar to your own.

I'm trying to put in more work into this new phase. I recognize that these behaviors of mine are linked to my past, a result of my abusive marriage. Every one of these negative thoughts have a underlying reason, a perpetuation of what my ex-wife did and how she made me feel. 

When I get these moments of fantasy, I try to imagine the submissive clone as a younger version of me, a child who was so naive and well-meaning. I try to imagine myself as my ex-wife, abusing me and hurting me. That is, to me, the accurate representation of what's actually happening.

I don't know you nor your situation. That being said, I sympathize with your struggle. I hate myself so much as well.

"Hi MadOver30,

I've been going to therapy for about 4 months now, and I've made a lot of progress. Gained confidence and resilience. Discovered that I have anxiety more than depression, which is actually good to know. Being able to ""name the demon"" gives me lots of power over it. 

My SO has noticed that I mishear her a lot, and started calling me on it. Rightly so, I was not hearing her right. Now I always had sensitive hearing, so it was a surprise to know it was sensitive but not accurate. I also started to notice that I was very sensitive to touch, a pinch or a tickle is just too much for me. Then I realized those might be connected, so I took to googling. While there is no set DSM-V criteria for Highly Sensitive People, it ties into my ADHD and Anxiety quite closely. 

I just started reading The Highly Sensitive Person by Dr. Elaine Aron. So far it is amazing to read. Anyone else an HSP? How did you find out?"	PipperDigs	post	23.11675275018246	male	White	0.0013664482394233346	na	na	na	6	MadOver30	no prediction.
"Hi OP, 

I'm ADHD and I'd say I'm highly sensitive, too. I'm emotionally sensitive, definitely have some rejection sensitivity, but I realized I'm also sensitive to touch‚ÄîI do not like to be touched unannounced and so help me god if it tickles, I react like it burns me. 

Background noise is also intolerable, I hear perfectly fine when talking to someone in a quiet space, but the moment there's background noise I can't hear for shit. I'm pretty sure it's a stimuli processing issue, my brain just can't filter out the unnecessary and focus. I've stopped trying to pretend I can make out what others say‚ÄîI just look so fucking stunned trying to decode what's said‚Äî now I just get people to talk straight into my ear if I have to make them repeat. 

I'm glad I know I have ADHD (it answered a lot of questions) but managing it is like being a dog mom to a demanding chihuahua. 

""Sorry, can we go sit somewhere quiet? My little ADHD here gets spooked by loud noises."" 

""Sorry, I gotta duck out of the office for 20 minutes, ADHD needs to take a walk.""

Sorry - what?? So your ADHD affects your hearing? I have this. I have ADHD and I feel like I can‚Äôt hear in crowded spaces or loud spaces.

I love the demanding chihuahua analogy. I have been getting better at advocating for my needs. At work I have a desk in the middle of the action, and when I'm trying to focus on one thing I get interrupted constantly, or a client comes in to talk to someone else and I can't help but hear everything about that conversation. Then if I 'm out at a bar I can't hear *anything*. 

I actually became used to white noise when I sleep. My house growing up was next to a highway, so I am used to it. These days I sleep with a white noise machine, which helps to drown out other noise from the busy street by my apartment. If you can tolerate it, I highly recommend white noise."

"Yeeeup, pretty common for ADHD people to have audio processing issues. Basically our brains are trying to take in all the stimuli as one, and then can't pinpoint and isolate the sounds we should be listening to. So basically any background noise makes it a million times more difficult to process. 

There's also some supporting evidence that kids with chronic ear infections could exacerbate ADHD symptoms. One doesn't cause the other, but rather it takes a kid already predisposed to processing issues and couples it with damage to hearing. 

My dad also has audio processing issues, to the point that his hearing is so sensitive he wears earplugs in public frequently. It got so bad the last few years that he was sent for a battery of neurological testing because loud noises and certain high pitch frequencies are very painful.

I was on the road to adulting, but some asshole triggered me as usual by violating my legal rights as it seems all shitty landlords and property managers do and it just made me not want to deal with people's shit any more and go back on meds to stop the madness.  Dealing with schizophrenia, thinking my neighbors are always talking about me, that the property managers are spying on me, and everything is too much plus people actually being dicks all the time. I just get to a dark place where I'm not interested in the world anymore and start rooting for the end of the world to happen.  It seems the end of the world is actually coming too, Australia literally on fire... Peace never coming in the middle east and global warming accelerating the weather change to the point where it will cause major upheaval. I look at the people who started families like oblivious hobbits, just stupid lower order animals that now have brought more children into a burning world and I just pity them.

"OK, I'm a guy, 40s, wife, kids, the whole deal. I have a long history of social anxiety, depression and dysthymia. After a long journey with all that stuff, I'm finally on a medication that mostly keeps me in a pretty good place.

I see a therapist, and something he's observed in me has got me thinking. He says I always seem to be seeking some kind of altered state of mind, a sensation of some kind.

I searched for high sensation seeking on here and read some threads in the hsp (""highly sensitive people"") sub. A lot of what I read fits me to a tee.

Basically, I'm always looking for the next sensation, buzz, feeling, call it what you will.

I have a fondness for substances, although not of the illicit kind these days. 

One is nicotine - I recently took up vaping again after quitting last year. But even when I quit, I'd still be chewing nic gum or using that mouth spray stuff.

When I get up in the morning, the first thing I think of is having a vape. Then I'll puff on it fairly constantly all day, chasing that initial buzz.

Caffeine - I'm always thinking about that next cup of coffee, tea, or energy drink. Preferably combined with the aforementioned nicotine lol.

Benzos - I have these for occasional insomnia, or for extra stressful stuff like job interviews. But I sometimes take one on a boring day just to feel a bit ""different"", I guess.

The threads I checked out said HSS people have a higher simulation threshold. That fits me; normal life feels humdrum, routine, tame, stupifying. I'm bored shitless with regular stuff other people seem happy with. I need there to be a buzz of some kind involved.

Apart from the substances, my main go-to coping mechanism is risk-taking behaviour, specifically graffiti. I used to do this in my younger years, before a couple of court appearances scared me straight.  But in the past few years I've returned to the habit.

I don't just do ""tags""; I like to do big, colourful shit. But it has to be in a place where it isn't allowed, a fraught situation with some risk of detection and capture involved. Only this gets the adrenaline going. 

It's like forcing myself to stay in a stressful situation and seeing it through. Overcoming the fear and the urge to abandon it and leave, and pulling off something that looks good and I'm happy with the next day.  And ""sticking it to the man"" while I'm at it, a big ""fuck you"" to the world.

When doing it, I'm totally in the moment, senses heightened, listening for any sound that could indicate someone approaching, while at the same time focusing on what I'm doing.

After a painting ""mission"" I'll feel great for a few days. But after a week or two the urge to repeat the experience returns.

Obviously this isn't the best way for a family guy in his 40s to be carrying on. I'm putting a lot on the line each time I do this ... my marriage, possibly job as well. But the risk is what makes it ... painting somewhere where it's allowed just doesn't do it for me.

My therapist says maybe studying with a view to gaining a more meaningful, interesting job might reduce these urges. But I have no drive or ambition.

I've always drifted through jobs, taking what came along, without any direction or thought. I feel it's all beyond my control. At the moment I'm doing menial, physical (and low paid) work.

That pretty much sums up my life. I've drifted along, just going with the flow. I've never known what I wanted to ""do"", so haven't really chosen anything. 

My anxiety made school a painful experience. So although I knew I was capable, I just wanted to get out of there ASAP. Maybe that's why the thought of a return to study repels me, I don't know.

When I think about life, it's usually along the lines of ""we're put here, we do what we do while we're here, then we snuff it, so what's the point?"". Like a kind of nihilism, an existential type of depression, without wanting to sound pompous about it. 

Can anyone relate? Or am I just a fucked-up middle-aged dude having a mid-life crisis who needs to grow the fuck up?"	spane_44	post	26.77259888867404	male	White	0.002390115987509489	na	na	na	21	MadOver30	'ethnicity: no prediction, age: 40s, gender: male, explanation: the author explicitly shares that they are a man in their 40s. however, there are no specific details to determine the ethnicity.'
"Man, I feel you. I'm in my early 40s, married, kid, cats & dogs, etc. I too seek an altered state of mind, even if it is barely noticeable. I get periods of intense nihilism where I enter a ""sedated"" zone and constantly psyche myself out of doing anything other than whatever pattern of activity I'm already in. Currently, I've convinced myself watching Youtube videos is a safe, stress-free way to pass time. I'll even watch stuff I'm not interested in. What else is there to do? I hate it. 

The problem itself, is time. Drudging through my free time feels like a CHORE. When I'm at work, I want to be home. When I'm at home I'd rather be at work. Pick up old hobbies and continue? No, too much time has gone by and the self-defeatist babble in my head telling me I could have been great if I wasn't a lazy loser. Get a new hobby? No, too late to start and if I did I know something will come up and I'd ditch the new hobby. Always comparing myself, both to how I was earlier in life in addition to other people.

I've been taking kratom off and on since 2012. I've quit 3 or 4 times, the longest was my most recent stretch, from 2017 to 2019. I started my habit back up in August. I add it to my coffee (I drink coffee all day) and that's it. I don't take kratom with anything else. If I'm not drinking coffee, I'm not doing kratom. I take it when I don't need it, I just take it to take it. I could quit at any point. I know the withdrawals suck, but are doable. Would life be any better though? I don't think so. 

By taking substances, I feel like I have CONTROL of making my life feel better. In some messed up way I think I'm proud of myself for having the fortitude to not accept ""life unaltered"".

"FWIW, we are of similar age and background experience. 

You should consider laying off substances for the thrill of them and lay off the risky behaviors for an extended period...at least 6 months. During that period seek out new things that interest you...dance, painting very tiny landscapes,  singing...anything that doesnt give a quick reward center rush, but a slower one from learning a new thing. 

I'm recommending this because, put very simply,  when our brains are addicted to the dopamine rush, it takes a while to build up new pathways to pleasure. You just have to be willing to give it some time.  And I'm not suggesting you quit everything cold Turkey, keep the vape, for example. 


I quit smoking a little over a year ago, and I quit alcohol a little over four months ago.

"I use to drink til I blacked out to get away from flashbacks, panic attacks, and nightmares. I didn‚Äôt sleep much so I drank soda all day to stay awake and hold a job. My guts were being torn up from the alcohol/caffeine combo. I went to a number of different therapists since I felt so awful emotionally and physically. I finally found one who helped me..but I was use to this insane levels of highs and lows. 

So I took up adventure sports, where you have to think in scary to terrifying situations. I got hooked on rock climbing..I‚Äôd never liked heights, but I was climbing (with the right training and equipment) 20, 40 foot climbs and on multi pitch climbs, I was climbing over 100 feet up rock. I had to stop drinking and cut down on the caffeine or I was too weak. Looking 100 feet down and still being able to problem solve and move up was an incredible feeling. I became a ropes course facilitator, and whitewater rafted, canoed, backpacked, and ended up guiding a few wilderness trips. Many cities now have indoor climbing walls, which was just becoming available when I was rock climbing.

It may not be the right sport, but there are plenty of activities that folks do to get the exhilaration and high from dealing with their fear that they seem to need without getting arrested or hurt or killed. I finally got on meds that calmed me down, so I could choose different adventures, some not as risky, since I didn‚Äôt need a constant level of fear and anxiety to deal with.

"I'm in Canada. 

During my last appt., my family doctor said there's ""nothing more [she] can do for me"". She made her frustration very obvious. I'm a difficult patient, I routinely miss appointments without a phone call, I'm occasionally late, I don't follow-up with any of the recommended professionals, and she thinks part of recovering from depression is the willingness to do the necessary work. So her not wanting to treat me makes perfect sense. I wouldn't want a patient like me either. 

I tried 4 different kinds of anti-depressants under her care over the span of 4 years and none of them worked. Cymbalta increased my alcohol tolerance to the power of 5 Irish ancestors but I don't think that falls under the formal definition of ""working"".

I was diagnosed with MDD over 10 years ago. 

Now, I can't hold down a job for more than a year, can't maintain interpersonal relationships, and can't muster the energy for, well, anything that isn't consuming Internet garbage. Hobbies aren't fulfilling. I even quit drinking because that stopped being fun and/or meaningful. 

I want to go home. I don't even know what that fucking means, it's just a thought that goes through my head like an animal pacing its path behind a zoo cage. 

I was committed for 72 hours in 2008... I'm thinking of trying an in-patient program but without going to an ER threatening to kill myself it seems basically impossible to go through the public system. I'm unemployed so seeing a private psychiatrist and getting counseling isn't an option.

"It can take awhile to find the correct medicine to help with your depression. Have you tried a mood stabilizer? I‚Äôve been on 16 different meds since I was 15 to help with my depression. It took till age of 31 to find the medicine for me and took another 4 years to find the correct dose.

Can she make a recommendation for a fuckin therapist and psychiatrist? Why is a GP treating your depression long enough to cycle several meds, that doesn't even make sense.

I'm not sure about where you are, but in many places you can be referred through a crisis intervention group.  If you search for crisis intervention in your area and ask to speak with a specialist (in some places they come to see you in person that day, in other places this is done over the phone), they may be able to generate the referral you would get from an ED.  A lot of this type of thing is regulated by local government in conjunction with hospitals in order to lower the traffic for EDs, but every area is different.  I hope that you can get the help that you need, and think you're on the right path if you realize that you may need to go inpatient for some time in order to get things straightened out and help going from there.

"I get what you're saying but the system in my province - maybe I don't understand it well enough but it's convoluted. I am unsure if a direct referral to a specific, named psychiatrist is possible. 

When I first talked to my doctor about my depression she referred me to a telephone-based service for getting connected with mental health resources. They told me to talk to my doctor again. I played ping-pong with the service and my doctor until I eventually got to speak with a psychiatrist for half an hour, who then recommended I see another psychiatrist, which lead directly back to square one: calling the telephone-based service. At that point I gave up trying. My GP referred to a different service separate from the mess described above. This is where I really fucked up - I ignored their phone call and stopped seeing her until I hit an especially rough patch. 

She strikes me as genuinely caring, as most of the medical professionals I've encountered do. The failure is systemic. And ultimately personal. I had a job with decent benefits so I could've gone through the private system but I didn't. All the time I took off work being depressed could have been spent getting the care I need(ed).

"TL:DR: Survive and thrive, and other bumper sticker bandaids I use to keep going...  


I am so feeling all of this right now too.  41, disabled two years ago, unable to pursue the career that brought me across the country, struggling to survive in a mundane job so I can have healthcare that might give me a clue to what the hell is wrong with me.

But I'm still here, and so are you.  We exist in a world that we were lied to most of our lives.  The ways to survive here are not the ways our parents said they would be, and the longer we tried to believe what they fed us the worse off we became.  We have survived not knowing how to overcome the gaslighting of our forefathers as well as (at least imo) the jealous pride of the younger generations who said ""fuck you"" when they were being fed the same.   


There are lots of people like us out there, and lots more who have done amazing things after 30.  I'm so sorry you feel hopeless right now but you are not alone.  To quote my therapist, feeling hopeless is one of the ways we know we are breaking out of bad patterns and freeing ourselves to become the people we actually want to be.

"I ran an ultramarathon. Maybe I'll run more some day if I have time, but I ran one, and I can be proud of that for the rest of my life.

People are impressed when they find out. They think there's no way they could ever do that, but I can tell you, from interacting with a range of runners that anyone can if they put their mind to it. Even still, I wonder how I did it and doubt I could do it again. 

The running community has a great way of looking at success and comparing yourself to others. Unless you are in the tiniest minority, you're not going to win a race. However, just running it means you're doing more than the vast majority who didn't try. Finishing, at whatever pace you run, is another huge success.

At the end of the day, when you talk with runners, they each have their own goals they want to achieve, and they are excited that other runners have different goals and happy for them when they succeed too. Life is not ""winner take all"" - its do what *you* want to do, do what *you* enjoy, do what *you* can be proud of, regardless of what others think, say, or do.

"My friend, I have a masters degree in music composition and a doctorate in education- I didn't graduate with a bachelors degree until I was 28. I didn't even realize I was behind the curve until someone joked about me finding a job (my first job out of college) with good retirement benefits because ""I'm getting up there in age""

 At 42, every day, I feel like I'm trying to claw my way up to being with others ""who are good"". My lips developed some sort of tremor that severely diminished my ability to play instruments involving the mouth... and I'm a school band and chorus teacher. It is excruciatingly embarrassing not being able to play proficiently in front of my students. I'm ""supposed"" to be head and shoulders more superior than my students because my job is a teacher and I have a degree in music- but I can't. I DWELL ON IT EVERY FUCKING DAY SINCE MY CONDITION STARTED 8 YEARS AGO. I keep experimenting with different ways of setting my embouchure on the various instruments, hoping I can circumvent my problem. I keep plowing away, everyday. Without HOPE, life isn't worth living.

My hobby is going to the gym. It takes dedication, not motivation in getting results. It doesn't matter if I'm ""psyched"" to workout or not- I just go regardless otherwise I won't improve (trust me, my default would be watching youtube videos from the time I wake up until going to work). 

Make whatever skill you want to improve upon one of the mandatory routine tasks you do everyday, like putting on clothes.

"Enjoying the process is the point. For a very, very long time, I was so depressed, I couldn't enjoy anything...literally, not a single thing on this earth. Now, as things are healing that way, I am enjoying the process of my hobbies more consistently, even though I am frequently dissatisfied with the outcome of the things I make. And that is a huge win for me. Of course, I'd prefer if the stuff I made came out the way I want it to in my head, but it's honestly a win for me to just enjoy making something. So, if you are actually say, enjoying the process of piano lessons and learning to read music or the practice of learning to make the keys behave, you are already ahead of many, many people. You are ahead of the self-described stagnant version of yourself, which is a win! 

My life improved when I started comparing me to myself. Is the soap I made today better than the soap I made 4 months ago? If I compare it to successful soaperies on YouTube or the like, I'm going to be disappointed every single time, especially if I am following a tutorial. If I am making any type of improvement when I compare things to my past self, it's a lot easier on my psyche...and I'm way more apt to enjoy the process, which is ultimately what matters. 

So keep playing that piano if you enjoy the process of reading music and playing music...and if any comparisons are to be made, compare it to yourself six months ago.

"I've had this thought tonight and I hope it makes sense. But what I've always had, up until a few years ago, was the urge to challenge myself and improve. Now, challenges seem unworthy, and self improvement seems not worth the hassle. Sure, I've been depressed, I know this is something depression causes. 

However, during my less depressed moments, I dream of doing something more - something that brings out my creative side, or something that is important or meaningful. It's not a case of lack of confidence - I think I can do something great, even if I can't do something great now, I feel I could work improve myself to achieve it. But my next thought? Why? I only have so much time, how do you know committing to this line of work, or this project, or this relationship is worth it? Are any of these things really that important given the problems in the world? Am I allowed to say, focus on building a video game knowing all the horrific things my lack of contribution may allow? (I'm not saying I'm going to save the world, I just feel I should be contributing with the best of my ability to fight something like, climate change or bushfires). Am I just looking for permission to do something that is frivolous in the grand scheme of things? Or should I be putting all my effort behind some sort of ""important"" issue? Can I do both? (Hint: probably not, I'm too easily overwhelmed). Also, I'm in my 30s now, should I think about having a family? Am I destroying any chance of this focusing on something else? But if I did that will I lose the freedom to do anything else? (etc, etc)

The last paragraph outlines my general train of thought when it comes to wanting to do something. I quickly lose energy thinking about this, and bottom out and end up doing nothing. I just feel so full thinking about this, especially after a work day, which is draining in itself.

Anyway, what brought this on was watching a video about someone succeeding in their ""thing"" that they were committed to - creating a video game. Something that when I was very young was my dream, that later turned me into a programmer (not in games, though).

I wanted to do something more than becoming a disintegrating programmer, struggling to even do that well not because lack of ability, but more a lack of.. I don't know, lack of justification in my own actions? Which probably leads to feelings of worthlessness? I can't justify what I'm doing now, what I want to do. Anything. I have no energy for this.

Sometimes I feel like perhaps I need to choose something and go in with blind, unquestionable faith and throw the dice.

"I tend to think that life is meaningless and pointless so why not do whatever you want to do? If you want to make a video game that's awesome. It won't save the world but that's okay. It's not your responsibility to save the world. But you could always incorporate themes that matter to you in a game you make too. Even if a game isn't ""solve climate change"" themed and just has little things like characters lose points if they litter or whatever. You don't have to choose 100% world saving vs. 100% ""frivolous"" activities. 
  
And FWIW, I still fondly remember playing the EcoQuest games as a kid, saving the rainforest and the ocean and all that fun stuff in the games. I think playing games like that helped me grow up to become an adult that cares about the environment. So even ""frivolous"" stuff can make the world a better place. 
  
It's easy to be paralyzed by the indecision of trying to make the ""right"" decision, but there is no right decision. It ends up being an excuse to do nothing. Personally, I feel pretty useless in life, and am not doing everything I feel I should be doing, but at the same time, I avoid total apathy by just choosing a thing to do and doing it instead of trying to choose the best possible thing. The result has been me drifting through life somewhat directionless but it beats total inaction. Keeping moving helps keep the depression monster at bay. 
  
As for having a family, that's a pretty huge and personal decision, and not one you should do just because of your age or ""it's time"" or everyone does it so you should do it too. There are lots of different ways to have a family. Personally I decided not to have kids but my dogs are my family. I don't think I could handle being a parent to human children, and frankly the world feels like it's going to shit so I don't want to bring kids into that mess.

in my own case i was able to begin to escape the grip these thoughts had on me when i started to figure out the emotional meaning that was behind them. For example, I‚Äôve realized that for me, these seemingly rational thoughts were actually rooted in guilt and fear‚Äîfear of failure (ie, if I actually tried my hardest at something for once and was still not very good at it, I‚Äôd risk exposing myself as being not nearly as smart/talented/special as I or others had thought), and guilt about success (ie, I don‚Äôt deserve to be happy, manifesting my talents is just showing off/inappropriately attention-seeking, etc).

"A seasoned therapist would want you to learn to self-soothe and reach healthy coping strategies or conclusions with as little interference on their part as possible. Therapists are there to channel our existing wants and needs into more effective pathways for our specific and best qualities of life, and usually this comes with compassion, bonding, time, and trust. But make no mistake, there are boundaries and proper/improper etiquette/behaviors because it's a slippery slope to be close to and hold up another person without becoming too needed, too close.

Like others have said, you showed you were already going to do the safest thing you could do for yourself in a crisis. In that moment, you demonstrated competence, awareness, and communication. There's little left for an ethical therapist to provide in that situation. Some therapists can handle being more hands-on, more connected and emotionally transferring with their patients, but some find it easier and less stressful to keep more walls up between their clients and themselves. Caring about people isn't easy. Investing takes two sides, and most therapists have their own therapists because carrying the weight of themselves and their clients is taxing. It makes sense that they're sometimes suddenly very clipped, short, and elusive. The end game of therapy is eventually, an end to the therapeutic relationship. For client to be able to go forward more whole, more independent. Boundaries help this ending be more peaceful for both client and therapist.

So, I would say yes and no. You are not being ""sensitive"", you are in a working therapeutic relationship and your therapist has done well to provide between you trust, safety, and the want to communicate and seek further care and effort. This is exactly what will help you keep working through your struggles! You crave emotional connection, understanding, love. Like any person alive. You are feeling and it's exactly how we are supposed to feel. Your therapist feels, too. And when there's boundaries being made, it's often hard on both sides, but necessary and crucial to keep us growing strong.

Good therapists are a mixed bag of being our most trusted ally teaching us how to live and love and be okay with the world... from behind what should be impenetrable glass barriers that kind of suck, but keep everything from turning codependent and toxic.

It's tough learning this lesson. I remember crying a lot when my therapist pulled herself away from me when I felt I needed her most. But I survived and I understand better now why it hurt and why she still did it. And I'm so grateful for the lesson.

"Began with my body. For year's I had cramps to the point of fainting and vomiting, severe pain. Had enough, went for hysterectomy. Found out I had 2 uteruses, one didn't have a cervix, so that explains the pain. No clue how dr.s missed it from the time I was 18, until 35. Wasted a *lot* of my life.

I was born with one kidney, 1 month after the surgery I had a kidney stone. With a single kidney it can get bad. Ended up okay... 

A few months after, my whole body got sick. My liver enzymes were very high, my eyes were swollen, couldn't eat. Couldn't walk. Rheumatoid arthritis now. I've tried 4 different medications, going on the 5th one. They have all made me sick in some way. 

I have been waking up with panic attacks, I guess. My heart pounds, and my mind just races, at 3-4am as soon as my eyes open, bam hits me.

I feel like I've completely lost any control over my body.

I meditate every single morning. 

I'm on Paxil, have been for a long time. Could a different med work better? 

I'm to the point of dreading going to sleep, knowing how awful the morning will be.

I've been taking prednisone for over a year now, maybe it's making it worse.

"I will warn you now, this is a rant. Today, Trump, in his never so delicate way, condemned California and New York for their homeless issues, saying he could solve it easily if they asked politely. Yes, it takes so much competence and compassion to incarcerate people for being homeless under conditions you helped create.

This is America's way. Always the stick when the carrot would be more effective. Trump's answer to immigration... build a wall, when helping correct the conditions that bring people here in the first place would be more effective. Make America, North, Central and South an economic powerhouse and we all benefit. Sure, the logistics would take effort and money, but in the end, the people prosper.

Working together, whether on a community homeless crisis or an international economic crisis as always been the way to succeed. Too many angry people like Trump want to beat the populace into submission. Their successes are short sighted and temporary at best. Sooner or later the people rise up and that has never ended well for the elite throughout history.

The problem with Trump is he doesn't know which orifice to talk out of. He is totally out of touch with Americans and their concerns (as well as reality, I'm afraid). He knows nothing about doing without and cannot comprehend the word ""no"". He needs a good spaking, but this isn't about him. It's about exchanging his stick for carrots.

How many times do I need to say it? You can't solve the homeless problem without looking at the whole person. It makes no sense to address one aspect and ignore everything else. Like it or not, no matter on the economic ladder you are, the homeless are just like you. They have the same exact needs as you. The have the same emotions and feel pain, just like you.

When you see a  homeless person acting out on the street, you see someone who needs a night in jail. I'll bet never once do you stop and question why they act out. You never had to experience the throes of people who ignore your existence, who cross the street to avoid you and your cooties. Or who are offended by the stench you emit. You scream at the top of your lungs (metaphorically speaking) for help, but no one hears.

Imagine being in the desert. Nothing but sand in every direction. Every step is a major effort. You are all alone, your parched lips bleeding, your lungs burning in the hot arid air. That is what being homeless is like. 

Don't we spend millions each year to address homelessness?  Squander is a more appropriate term. A lot of the people charged with administering the homeless programs are clueless.  If we do this we can serve more people... there is a big difference between serve and help. Serving the homeless is temporary at best. 3 hots and a cot serve the homeless, but does nothing to solve the problem. It is essentially a way to kick the can.

Addressing the needs of the whole person doesn't permit for as many to be ""served"", but homelessness is not a numbers game. These are lives and must be treated as such. When you address the whole person, you increase the odds of that person becoming successful. There is also the truth that some cannot be helped and you must accept that, but at the same time, give people the benefit of the doubt.

Another roadblock confronting the homeless is people who just don't understand what being homeless is like. For example, a social worker calls and offers resources for food. You are disabled and use a walker. When you turn down using the pantry bc you simply cannot get from A to B, you are not being difficult or unappreciative, it's just simple logistics. I am so weak I tremble when I walk sometimes. Adding weight to the walker is not part of the equation.

Back to the carrot. The best way, resources permitting, to seriously help a homeless person is to acknowledge some need more hand holding than others. Assign a single case manager to help provide everything that person needs to become successful.  Clothing, residence, food, furnishings, transportation, medical... everything. There are numerous programs that have cars for the needy... can you think of someone more needy than the homeless person trying to get back on track?

There are those who will boo hoo this approach as too involved with such large numbers of homeless. Isn't it amazing how that tends to happen when you kick the can down the road?  It increases exponentially. I suppose learning a lesson there would be too much to hope for."		post	26.71943368868614	male	White	0.9989878535270691	na	na	na	6	MadOver30	failed

"Why do you assume everyone who reads this pass the  homeless without a moment's consideration or compassion?  Many, many people feel the the way do. Some help in a tiny, micro way. Many may feel overwhelmed and understand that there isn't anything they, as an individual, can do to fix homelessness.  As you said, giving they a meal is a temporary fix.  But at least it keeps them alive while we try to figure it out.

Personally, I have someone in the family who is homeless, so I face the awfulness that is homelessness all the time. So I didn't need you to condensendly explain what it is, thank you.  (Try framing it so it doesn't come off as you assuming the reader is a thoughtless, uncompassionate person, then you might get more responses)

There has been talk about one possible solution, which is to provide cheap homes to the homeless.  With the tech we have out there now, we can easily get this done.  There may have even been a study that said doing so would help majority become contributing members of society again.  Homelessness is a self-perpetuating cycle. A lot of people dismiss the homeless as mentally ill, but it's hard to be mentally healthy living on the street.  I am all for this option.

"The unfairness starts young.

Mothers are forced (through fiscal and cultural politics) to give up nursing and drop their babies off at daycares only a week or two after birth. To be fed powder-based artificial breastmilk alternative that is obviously not as healthy as mother's milk, as well as to be supervised by low-paid strangers. Once again, NOT as good or as genuine as a parent's love and care for their child's life and safety. many babies and kids die at daycares every year. Nobody talks about this.

Daycare teaches babies very early on that they don't matter as much as money does. That it is more important for mom to spend her day ""proving herself"" to strangers instead of caring for you... like every other species of mammal mother does.

Daycare and the entire schooling system is made to indoctrinate children to get out of bed against their will in the morning and then to spend all day in a closed facility somewhere following other people's orders without arguing. Schools don't teach you how to fish or hunt or grow food. It teaches you how to be subservient to bosses and how to fulfil a very specific role for your future corporate masters. To keep you forever dependent on working a job and paying someone to do basic things for you to survive.

Schooling is basically unpaid training for a lifetime of forced servitude to the 1%.

"I grew up in an abusive household and that morphed into two once they divorced. The abuse festered into several different categories after that between friends and romantic relationships. So when I‚Äôve got this one couple I‚Äôm friends with having petty arguments over whether he can ever be right and her saying no while I‚Äôm on speaker phone, or her bitching to me in every conversation about how horrible she and he are to one another (which I‚Äôve set a boundary with), I just don‚Äôt want to be around them. I don‚Äôt want to talk to them.

They‚Äôve got a baby under 2 years old, another on the way, and he‚Äôs got a son from another marriage that his wife (my friend) constantly talks shit about both the son & his mom. They‚Äôve been married 2.5 years, together for almost 5.

"I've been married for 14 years.

I don't talk this way about my husband. I don't enjoy being around people who talk this way about their partners. At its absolute best, it's confusing. I would be friends with them but that trait would bug me. And I would be wary of getting too close to them.

I would **not** be friends with somebody who did this:

\>he‚Äôs got a son from another marriage that his wife (my friend) constantly talks shit about both the son

She chose to make the son part of her family. He had no say in whether she was part of his. This is unacceptable to me. This is simply a person who lacks empathy and compassion. If I were you, I would end this ""friendship"".

I use the quotes because I doubt this person provides any real support or enriches your life in any meaningful way. You were probably drawn to her because she felt familiar. Given your history, I would seek out people who feel unfamiliar because they are kind and encouraging and accepting. It will feel weird and fake and awkward but just barrel through that.

"Married for 5 years here. Your friends suuuuuck. 

You just don't directly involve your friends in your marital arguments, *especially* mutual friends. 

I have a couple of close friends who I can trust to sometimes rant about something my husband has done that bothered me. I have borderline personality disorder and sometimes I need a friendly reality check on whether I'm normal angry or disordered angry. I'm not always the best at receiving feedback, but I trust these folks to tell me if I'm not acting out of my core values, and I take that input to heart and try to adjust my behavior or my approach if needed.

Those friends also know that they can tell me if they're emotionally tapped out or if my ranting is unwelcome or has gone on for too long. In my case, I *know* that I have boundary issues, so I try to be super vigilant about keeping the rants brief and to the point, and trying to figure out the issue on my own before checking in with those friends. 

And all that being said, I respect the hell out of my husband. When I talk to my friends about things, it's along the lines of ""ughhh frustrating behavior is frustrating"" and not ""omg my husband is a piece of shit I can't believe I married him and don't you agree that he's a useless waste of space??"" Which sounds like what you are hearing.

You need to set some hardcore boundaries with your friends, at the very least. Everything you've said here sounds incredibly stressful!

Everyone in a long-term relationship gets mad over petty shit from time to time. But talking to your friends about it to blow off steam should be both *infrequent* and *private*. Even if you're having major marital problems, it's not cool to involve your friends to the point that they feel overwhelmed and stressed out every time they talk to you. You didn't consent to being their on-call marriage counselor.

I hope 2020 will bring you a bit more peace, and maybe some other friends who don't run roughshod over your personal boundaries."		reply	na	na	na	0.9988069534301758	no	strong	no	na	MadOver30	no prediction.

"I think people like us can be triggered by our married friends in weird ways.

So for me, it can be hard to tell when I'm being ""rational"" and when I'm not.

"Dude... here‚Äôs what you do.

Firstly, we are in luck. Christmas falls on the same day every year which is December 25th. So that gives us an opportunity to plan for it. I‚Äôm
Not sure which bank you‚Äôre with but if they have online banking or even an app on your phone, set up a savings account with them, call it your Christmas savings account, and put something in every pay cheque you get, then forget about it until the start of next December. That in itself takes you one step closer to a happier Christmas (financially at least).

Secondly, just two Christmases ago my marriage broke down (November 2nd to be exact), I was in hell. The thought of spending Christmas Day on my own fucking horrified me. I was in a house where every god damned room was nothing but memories and emptiness. Even though she took most of her stuff there was (and still are to this day) memories of either her, or something from the marriage. It was unbearable and I couldn‚Äôt even think straight. I felt cold and I was dying inside, my whole world and future had changed and I couldn‚Äôt comprehend how to move into it.

So I knew the day was coming, I knew I‚Äôd be alone and that it would hurt like hell. So you know what I did?.... I can‚Äôt cook worth a damn, but it was no problem, I bought some ready made dinners, some booze (not too much) and some desserts, I watched tv to take my mind off of things and instead of wishing I had what all the happy families on tv had, I just enjoyed what I saw on the tv, kinda shared in that happiness and forgot about my own woes. I just let my mind go where the tv brought me.

But most importantly, I went on line a few weeks before Christmas Day and bought myself some small gifts, where possible I had them gift wrapped by Amazon. I put them under the tree so that some kinda normality was resumed. Instead of a cold empty depressing house, I now had a tree up with coloured lights and presents underneath... for me. I had something to now look forward to on Christmas Day. One of the presents even had a card from myself to myself. The gift was to do with photography, and the card basically said, don‚Äôt give up, show the world what you can do with this item.

And that‚Äôs what I did man. I steered into that shit and you know what? It was one of the best christmases I ever had. I text a few buddies to say Happy Christmas during the day, had a lot of food, a few drinks and I chilled by the fire. It was awesome! 

As cheesy as it sounds, it was one of the first times in my life where I had no choice but to love myself or I‚Äôm not sure I could‚Äôve survived that day. I wanted to die. Sitting alone in my empty house, future full of fears of being alone and not knowing how my wife would be in the divorce... I had no choice but to be there for myself, spoil myself and just fucking love myself man. People are so busy looking around for someone to save them that they forget that happiness is an inside job! No one else can do it for you. Sure they can help, but it‚Äôs got to be you that fights for yourself, that finds reasons to be happy. It‚Äôs got to be you that loves yourself when it feels like the rest of the world is gone.

That Christmas stands out to me most out of all the christmases I ever had. But it could easily have been the worst, or even my last.

Also if you‚Äôre struggling financially then pick up a copy (or audiobook) of Dave Ramsey‚Äôs Total Money Makeover, it changed my life and my future, let it change yours too man. Get that as this years Christmas gift to yourself.

I hope this comment gives you some bit of Christmas cheer and you know what? Even if you have no one to talk to Christmas Day, send me a message or whatever dude, if I‚Äôm awake I promise you I‚Äôll reply,

"Is anyone else here not looking foward to Christmas?

Bit of context: I'm a guy in my mid-40s, married with two kids. I've stuggled with anxiety (mostly the social kind) and depression for the past 20 years or so.

I emigrated from Europe to Australia about 10 years ago.

Christmas is a very different deal here. It's in the middle of summer, with temperatures usually up in the 40s. 

The stark contrast with the Christmases I remember back in my homeland always seems to trigger a downward spiral into depression for me as the festive season nears.

My first Christmases here were a bit hard, to say the least.  My social anxiety was off the scale. Imagine being thrown into a load of strangers - my partner's extended family - and trying to fit in, while feeling that I very much didn't. 

My other half was obviously instantly at ease with all her relatives (big extended family) and would quickly disappear, busily catching up with everyone, leaving me floundering, struggling to hide my anxiety.

Thankfully, these past few years I've reached a place where I don't give quite so much of a fuck about it all. 

The problem is the dark cloud that always envelops me at this time of year. 

I've been feeling exhausted all the time, just wanting to sleep. As a result I haven't been doing my share of pre-Christmas tasks, which has raised tensions at home. 

My depression isn't something me and my mrs talk about. She would be happy if I could just be ""fixed"", whatever that means.

Anyway, we have children now. Fair enough, for them Christmas is something to look forward to, a magical time to revel in. I want my kids to have happy Christmases to remember.

But I can't face the inevitable stresses of the day, getting to places at particular times, all the forced socialising, ""how's it going"" while not really wating to know type of bullshit, having to pretend everything's okay.

I'm trying hard not to sound like a completely miserable bastard here. Probably I'm not succeeding too well. It's kinda hard for me to put into words how I feel.

I'm taking depression meds, but dropped the dose a bit a few weeks ago. The side-effects have been a pain in the butt.

Now I'm not sure whether to go back to my usual higher dose, or try to ride things out.

Any comments/observations/suggestions welcome ;)"	spane_44	post	34.77923116395645	male	White	0.9978410005569458	na	na	na	26	MadOver30	failed

"I read the headline and can tell you I agree completely. I hate forced displays of happiness and the burden of buying things no one needs as well as receiving.

I don't have any straightforward advice as I don't have kids. You sound trapped in a life that is not going help you succeed. Considering your wife's attitude towards it, and her behavior around family I don't think you will be able to negotiate your way to a more fulfilling situation.

What I can say is just don't feel like the way you are experiencing this is invalid, as much as anyone tries to make you feel. Families can really be a horror to outsiders, like any who assemble in large groups.

I grew up in a increasingly absent family and this always resulted in different expectations with women I dated. It was insurmountable. I found my way towards a woman who also does not have family available on the holidays. My wife and I are celebrating our first Christmas and it's the greatest thing. Just her and I.

You will have a family to manage at least until your kids are grown. I really just suggest finding something that interests you that you own, that your family has no say over and let that grow over the years. If it allows you to socialize with like minds all the better. You might be surprised at the things you never thought you'd enjoy.

Eventually you will need to prioritize your happiness without affecting your children too much. But not being present in the moment and not exemplifying fortitude will make them resent you too. I think maybe if you can build that other part of your life up enough, it will build you up enough to really be there for your kids later on. Eventually you can do Christmas however you want with who you want, and that will be some real happiness. Your wife is either onboard for this development or she isn't.

"A belated welcome to Australia, I hope you're getting at least some positive experiences here outside of the issues with Christmas.

My disinterest in Christmas comes from a place much further back in time.  I grew up in a small mining town, so we also had that heat around Christmas but also not a lot to do during the school holidays around Christmas as a kid.  My mother seemed to dislike the idea of anyone in the family having fun or being happy, so she's eventually create some sort of conflict to suck any joy out of the room.  There was also a constant narrative about us being dirt poor, so the presents were often crap.  Due to where we were living, there was none of the extended family stuff to deal with, which could be good or bad depending on your view.

Move to a point in time where I'm older and am living in a place with extended family.  I didn't really enjoy it because I either didn't like or didn't know these family members enough.  The few gifts I have gotten for Christmas (or my birthday) from these relatives make me question how much they really know about me or how they think of me.  For example, one relative got me a book on Australian serial killers.

So what am I planning this year?  I'm in my own apartment now with some good air-conditioning.  I'm going to stay cool.  I'm going to buy some nice beer to drink.

I do feel trapped in a difficult set of circumstances. Of course, I chose to emigrate, get married and have kids. But somewhere along the way I seem to have lost my voice in all of this. 

For example, my issues with depression are mostly ignored, or regarded as a nuisance when they interfere with daily life, plans etc. I find it hard to express myself and speak up.

I come from a small family, so it was indeed difficult for me being thrown to the wolves, so to speak, with my wife's big extended family. I just wanted to fit in, but in trying to do so, kind of lost who I was along the way.

Now I don't care so much and try to be more true to myself.

I feel what you're saying. Christmas your way sounds appealing. 

Unfortunately, I'm well and truly locked in to the family thing, forced merriment and all.

But I did make my bed, after all, so I guess I must lie in it.

It's true about the presents thing, and what it says about how well, or how little, people really know you.

To be honest I feel I'm regarded as something of an oddity here. I don't drink, for starters, which is almost a hanging offence in Oz. My in-laws seem to have accepted this now, though, after stubbornly trying to foist alcohol in some form upon me for several years after my arrival.

I also hate sport, especially the incessant talking about it and dissecting it. Again, my wife's family have grudgingly stopped trying to engage me in sport-related chit-chat. But there is still the occasional promise/threat to take me to an AFL game.

It's funny, the initial assumption from everyone was that because I'm from the UK, I must be crazy about football. This led to some awkward ""what soccer team do you go for?"" moments. 

In hindsight, I think I internalized their disappointment at these conversational dead-ends and felt like something of a failure, as measured by Australian standards. But I couldn't bring myself to feign interest in things that bored me to tears, just to try and fit in.

From my experience, although there is that on-the-surface ""how are you going"" friendliness, Australians are very skilled at keeping you at arm's length, or at least keeping things on a fairly superficial level. In fact, that initial friendliness seems to sometimes serve as an armour against letting you ""in"".

But maybe this is more my observation as soneone living in a country that isn't their own. Of course there's going to be a barrier of sorts, cultural or otherwise.

Anyway, I'm rambling (it's been a long day, and it's late), so will finish up for now.

"Yeah thanks for being brave enough to share into the murky interwebs. 

I think.. without being presumptuous that I understand where you are coming from from a different angle. I've never felt so denied in my life (and I survived a childhood of abuse!) up until recently despite feeling that I've taken the wheel over my depression more than I ever have. I was proud of myself. My ex and my friends weren't. Even discussing my progress was treated as a violation of standards. There was a heavy cross cultural component too. No one was as harsh as my ex.

""Why don't you perform correctly for us?"" 

This seems to be the common thread in this current time and place in this political climate. Trying to keep up with the expectations of my ex and the community really crushed my self esteem. I couldn't imagine the next level of expectations since you did not grow up here as I feel an outsider in my own home (Boston area).

My saving grace was than angel showed up right around my breakdown and even stuck around afterwards and still thinks I'm not too bad.

Anyone who isn't going to sit with you during your depression is the real nuisance. You speak like you're cognizant enough to see it and want to do something about it and I can't understand why others don't actually honor that, so for people like you and I, I think it's our duty to honor ourselves first for our efforts and progress. 

Some people just won't recognize that.

I'm starting to get my voice back slowly. I'm happy that you are being true to yourself because I know how hard that is when it doesn't satisfy other people's expectations.

"> I also hate sport, especially the incessant talking about it and dissecting it

I was previously living in a state that was obsessed with one code of football.  Like, the newspaper would figure out a way to have a story on the back page about this code even during off-season.  If you were asked what team you followed, you were considered an ""outsider"" if you said you didn't follow it.

> It's funny, the initial assumption from everyone was that because I'm from the UK, I must be crazy about football.

People here can be very clunky about opening conversations I've noticed.  I'm originally from Queensland but had lived in another state for about 15 years.  A lot of conversation openers when I was in that other state would pander to stereotypes about my home state and crap like that.  It's just people being ignorant.

> From my experience, although there is that on-the-surface ""how are you going"" friendliness, Australians are very skilled at keeping you at arm's length

Between this and stuff like the sports stuff in that other state I lived in, I had a very hard to making any sort of friends in the 15 years I was there.

"Thank you, I appreciate that.

I'm taking phenelzine/Nardil, an MAOI, the first class of antidepressants. They came out in the 60s, just before the tricyclics, I think.

It works great for my social anxiety; I'm much more confident around people and can talk easily. My general mood is also a lot better, but I still have my downs.

It's an unrefined med, broad acting on many neurotransmitters, so has a lot of side-effects. I think that's why it works for me, though. It obviously hits the parts of my brain that need it. 

I also have to avoid certain foods while taking it.

In contrast, the newer, more refined, serotonin-focused drugs never did much for me, apart from numbing my emotions.

"You and I are on the same wavelength here ;)

After keeping my struggles to myself for years, I fairly recently brought up the topic of my depression and the fact I take medication with my in-laws. The response was maybe slight awkwardness, but there was also what I took to be dome genuine concern from my mother-in-law. In saying that, the subject hasn't been mentioned since.

They seem quite a reserved lot here, where mental ilness isn't something that can really be  discussed in an open way.

With my wife, I suppose I, too, feel that I haven't measured up to her expectations. 

For most of my time here I had a pretty good office job. I got in there by being in the right place at the right time. Eventually, redundancy struck. What followed was a spiral into depression and severe anxiety, and an almost two-year period of unemployment.

My wife is a more practical person and took the ""you've got a family now - get out there and do what you need to do"" type of approach.  The pressure she heaped upon me pushed me to the brink of killing myself. 

I did eventually find employment, and I think she feels this vindicated her hard-line attitude. Like her pushing me got me moving, so to speak. I don't think she realises how close I was to suicide. 

There doesn't seem any point in revisiting it all now. But I haven't forgiven her for what she did (or didn't do) and am not sure I ever can.

But in saying all this, I can see it from her side, too. She's working full-time while I'm at home, probably in her mind having a nice, relaxing time. I guess from that standpoint, what was she expected to do? 

The problem now is that since being made redundant, I've had blue-collar, lower-paid, more menial work. I suppose I realised that to stay well, I need to keep my stress levels down. For me that means avoiding office-type environments and, for now, sticking to more physical, but less stressful, jobs. 

But the low pay is getting in the way of plans for a bigger house, and is a constant source of friction.

My previous attempts to open up about my depression have been met with comments along the lines of ""I'm sorry being married to me is so depressing"". I've tried to explain that it's about what's within me, not about her. But I find it hard getting my point across in words; somehow it's easier writing it here.

I'm saying this stuff to try to show you the gulf that exists between the two of us. I don't want it to come across as petty grievances.

I do have insight into my depression, illness, call it what you will. It's just that when I'm in the thick of an episode, it overwhelms me to the point where I lose insight and perspective.

"Sure no these are real concerns, and in my experience if they aren't released they will only fester. I just really encourage you to share because I'm pretty indignant towards these types of people who expect you to keep it under wraps. People who aren't afflicted will just never understand what life is like when our brain chemicals are out of whack. You aren't failing, you're just carrying a lot more weight with a smaller engine when neurotransmitters get low. 

My end of year resolution is promising to myself to adhere to boundaries. Even if they are well meaning, good people, if they can't be empathetic to the situation I know to take the initiative and eliminate them from my life. Funny thing is that now after my purge of acquaintances I am so much happier, and that constant feeling of dread and hopelessness is lifting. So I hope you can find a solution to create an environment more conducive to your health. It sounds very hard with the family and all. Fighting your environment every day to stay sane is so taxing.

These are unarguably tough times for working men from all angles. We're just getting slapped by the economy. There are next to no resources for both emotional and material support. Suicide rates are climbing drastically and no one seems to bat an eyelash at it. Also I think as a society we've reached a climax of self-serving, ""me first"" behavior that just didn't exist when I was growing up. I'm curious how much Australia and the U.S. have in common on these issues. My wife and I have even considered moving to Australia, hoping that it might be less drama than where we are, and close to her country (and warm!)

"Thanks for sharing that.

Phenelzine, and the other MAOIs, do seem to almost be regarded as last resorts these days when it comes to depression meds. 

It's difficult for me to come to terms with the fact that I spent almost 20 years suffering unnecessarily on ineffective medications (SSRIs and the like) when phenelzine could have helped me way back then.

But the way things are, I would never have been offered it before first trying numerous newer, safer - but for me ineffective - meds. The problem is, that process of elimination took years.

I have heard it said before that ECT can work when nothing else has. My psychiatrist played down the risk of memory loss, saying it was a myth that didn't match most people's experiences.

What put me off (apart from the nagging doubt about memory issues) was the fact that, as I understand it, the benefits of ECT can be temporary.  Continued, so-called ""top-up"", treatments can be needed, which increases the chance of damaging side-effects.

As someone who has had ECT, how would you describe the positive effects? And did you find the benefits gradually wore off?"	spane_44	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9978410005569458	weak	strong	no	na	MadOver30	failed
Reading your reply, your experience sounds pretty common in regard to a lot of peoples experience, though you have perhaps gone much longer without an effective treatment. I was lucky with meds in that some helped my more milder episodes. Some of those were worse in anxiety than depression. However as time went on, the anxiety lessened and the depression got much more severe. I was admitted to hospital in 2002 after a failed suicide attempt, and was still deeply suicidal. Just felt very bleak and hopeless, my psychiatrist in hospital did not coerce me into receiving ECT, she did say the side effects could be quite difficult initially but that the memory loss was usually a more short-term effect. I found this mostly to be true. Similar to when an antidepressant is helpful, it's usually other people that notice you starting to come upwards again. For me personally itnwas gradual but felt more physical effects getting better. I started to feel a bit more energy, and more motivation. The emotions needed to be worked on and that is a big frustration to me in the UK, psychotherapy is an afterthought. I had twelve sessions, i did as you said feel some of the effects drop off, but again this was gradually and to be fair i was having a lot of chronic stress at the time anyway. I received ECT again in 2009, after a horrendous year, and another serious suicide attempt. It helped me better i found, although i do feel looking back it may have brought me up a bit too quick. You can sometimes not have a very clear memory of some of the reasons that sent you down before. I have to go out now, but it is worth it if you have tried all else.

At this point, I think there is a good chance we will end our relationship in the near future. I think it's reasonable to say that the blame for that is mostly mine.

No infidelity, but I lie to avoid difficult conversations, and I make irresponsible decisions with money, and my time.  

I have procrastinated getting back into therapy and that hasn't helped anything. I have made half-hearted attempts but put off making a genuine effort for no good reason. I need it, I want it, and it isn't too difficult to get. It's just inconvenient and easy to procrastinate.  

I want to kill myself but that's mainly just to avoid the pain of difficult conversations and a painful breakup.  

The main thing that prevents me from killing myself is knowing how cowardly and irresponsible it would be.  

My life insurance wouldn't payout in the event of my suicide unless I'd paid at into the plan for two years. Which will be in February, so I'll at least stay alive until then.

"My apartment may not be new or particularly inviting. It doesn't have laundry connections which explains the washer in the middle of my kitchen. What it does have is priceless. My neighbors are considerate, no one makes noise or leaves a mess. Pretty much we all keep to ourselves. A few weeks ago I fell going up the stairs and my groceries thundered down. Virtually every door opened, people came out to check on me and picked up my groceries. I don't know how common it is to have caring neighbors anymore, but if only for that one thing, I will resign my lease.

It gives me comfort to know if I break a hip, my neighbors will come to my aid. In my old neighborhood, I had to worry neighbors were coming out to assault me.

Why do I have to go through the pain of losing a beloved pet when they eventually grow too old to carry on? Why can‚Äôt they accompany me my entire life? Why do I have to do this alone? Why do I have to experience death? How does everyone just deal with this inevitability? It‚Äôs all too much to handle. I wish I could stop thinking about it but I can‚Äôt.

"But you ""hate existing""?  Why then are you so worried about watching it pass by and come to its end?  I know that depression often isn't rational, but can you turn your rationality into a sledghammer to try to bust up this thought process you so dislike?  Like.... if you ""hate existing"" then the passage of time, losing relatives and friends, these are all signs that the time that your existence will stop is coming and then you can finally stop hating existing.  I guess, to me, it's hard to fathom both hating existence and also fearing the end of existence/being scared of markers of the passage of time -- like how do they go together? Maybe they just don't.

Oof I break down crying about this about once or twice a month, it'd probably be more if I didn't drink it away like I literally am right now. I'm constantly scared, knowing that the present always is always the present. So the feeling of being at any moment, is the feeling of being at my death. Every second tumbling forward at a seemingly increased rate, with nothing to show for accomplishments. Even if I were far more intelligent, and came up with some medical break through giving eternal life, the universe isn't eternal. The stars, the light, everything will slowly vanish into the void.

When I got to the house (he was at his dads), I sat and talked to the officer first. He seemed to think my son was 100% ok. Beyond low on the crisis scale. 

I deal with students in crisis every day, and the initial assessment really only addresses students who are in immediate danger of suicide.

What I saw and heard when I talked with my son brought up a memory of a convo I had with my therapist once. He said ‚Äòyou‚Äôre the one I worry about the most because you always present high-functioning and rational but you also have the most serious suicide attempt of all my clients.‚Äô 

I felt like I was witnessing that lens from the other side. I know what can be truly happening inside. 

My kid is really sensitive and thoughtful. Tonight he was aloof and had this laidback, cool-kid attitude. He gave all the ‚Äòright‚Äô answers. But it wasn‚Äôt him, I mean it was, not like I‚Äôm delusional, but the behavior was off. My gut tells me he‚Äôs not ok. I felt like he was pretending. 

Back to the officer, I tried to explain that I also work with kids in crisis. And I also know my son. And I realize the assessment came back ‚Äòlow‚Äô but the criteria doesn‚Äôt mean my kid is ok. We were not on the same page or going to agree since my kid didn‚Äôt present as one crisis, so I just excused him and thanked him for his time. 

My head is swimming. I really don‚Äôt know what to do. What I wanted to do was take him to a hospital to get evaluated by a professional that he can‚Äôt bullshit like the officer. I wanted to make sure he was somewhere safe and getting proper care and assessments. I was made to feel like I was overreacting*. 

Instead, what I did was agree with his dad that we could let him stay at his house and sort it out in the morning. And I really hate myself for it. I did email my sons therapist who he stopped seeing bc he said he didn‚Äôt want therapy anymore, to see if she has any emergency openings for today. 

I already am in a really bad headspace from being exceptionally triggered/PTSD last Friday at work. That‚Äôs a whole other story, but leading up to today, I was already not ok. 

I can‚Äôt afford to see my therapist. I don‚Äôt know if I should go to work on 3 hours. I am just - overwhelmed. 

I feel like my genetics are letting my kid down. I feel like my response to this crisis was horrible. 

I‚Äôm good at this when it isn‚Äôt my own kid. But I didn‚Äôt follow my gut and I just don‚Äôt feel confident in knowing what the best thing to do for him is going to be. 

I don‚Äôt like that I feel like I saw him faking it, and no one else did. Being bipolar muddied my confidence in a way that it doesn‚Äôt happen professionally. At work, my ideas and thoughts are backed by my team. They trust me. And we always come to agreements on how best to help kids. 

Sorry this really ended up being a crazy, unorganized rant. But it did help me organize my thoughts a bit.

"Some of your professional training can go out the window when you‚Äôre dealing with your own family‚Äî don‚Äôt beat yourself up for that.

Here‚Äôs my advice FWIW. Take a deep breath. Take a few. Look back at your history with your son. Are you prone to overreacting? Be honest with yourself. If you are, is this one of those times or not? It might not be, I just want you to check in with yourself. If you don‚Äôt tend to overreact, take your gut seriously on this. 

Your son is giving you signs that this is not an emergency to him. Or at least he doesn‚Äôt want people to react that way. Take that seriously too. He‚Äôs a teenager? It‚Äôs a fine balance between being respectful of him and stepping in over his wishes when needed.

I like what your therapist said and maybe you can say the same thing to your son. Even explain that it was said to you bc you‚Äôre like that too.

I also like that you‚Äôve always been open and honest with him about MH, esp your own. Time for another talk about that. You know the signs bc you‚Äôve been there. He has your genes. Explain that one of the toughest things is to open up about it, but that‚Äôs also the most important thing. Mental illness ‚Äî or any MH issue‚Äî is a tricky devil. It convinces you you‚Äôre at fault, you can get through it if you‚Äôre strong and ignore it, etc. It lies. Offer therapy again and maybe going to a different therapist is he didn‚Äôt like the old one. Don‚Äôt let him worry about the expense, you carry that burden for him.

Ultimately, it‚Äôs his choice to talk about it or not. You know that as a crisis counselor. Regardless of what‚Äôs going on, make it safe for him to come to you with anything that‚Äôs bothering him.

That was a lot of advice. Take your time. Mull it over. Keep breathing. You‚Äôre a good mom!"	mirrorwonderland	reply	na	na	na	0.9966321587562561	weak	no	no	na	MadOver30	failed
"You are venting more than advice... ok. 

I hear you. I‚Äôm listening. That‚Äôs a tough spot to be in as a parent... I‚Äôm sorry you are experiencing this anguish of your genetics affecting your son. You see that as a negative thing and in my interpretation of what you said it sounds like you are beating yourself up for that-and you can‚Äôt control your genetics. Perhaps consider that your son was going to be born to someone, and gratefully he was born to you who would have the experience to help him be his best self as he lived life with Mental Health issues. 

Your ability to identify and communicate your feelings and fears and then to be able to recognize your sons ‚Äúoff-ness‚Äù (to use a completely made up word) really speaks to the level of work and effort you have made both with yourself in dealing with your MH positively and also in helping your son learn to live with his. I feel you have truly set your son up for success in that regard. And yourself. Great job!!

The reason why I say that is because I work with folks in active addiction and active recovery. And those who lack vocabulary words and/or the ability to identify their feelings and place a word to their feelings-I feel struggle that much more during an acute crisis. When they have a bad mental swirl and can‚Äôt identify their triggers or how to remedy those - they really suffer and most often will then turn to those addictions they have used in the past to help them avoid so they don‚Äôt feel (whether or be drugs or alcohol). On the complete opposite, those folks who are better able to identify their feelings and how they feel and have a safe place/person they can talk these things out with-they have a much higher success rate of health and pulling themselves out of the mental swirl. They are also less likely to resort to old patterns or behaviors of addiction. 

Soo all that to say.... I can understand your concern. You have such a big big loving heart to be so concerned about your son and to value his wellbeing as much as you do. Truly attributes of an amazing parent. Keep up the fantastic work!!

I‚Äôm so glad you called your sons therapist to discuss this with them. This person also knows your sons PMH and can advise and it sounds like you trust this persons judgement also and that‚Äôs the best you can do. 

I hope things work out in this instance for you and your son. Blessings to you both!"	mirrorwonderland	reply	na	na	na	0.9966321587562561	strong	no	no	na	MadOver30	failed

"The question of letting go isn't whether to hold on or not... it's what to choose to hold on TO.  It's very difficult to really understand (and feel, viscerally) from inside depression, but loneliness, emptiness, depression, and self-loathing THEMSELVES are things that can, and in fact must, be let go.

A friend of mine used to tell me I needed a Mantra.  Her best suggestion at the time was ""Let go, or be Dragged.""  It has only become more true as I work through my own issues.

Once you let go of it, you're free to do whatever you want... and you may find that you suddenly want to do things you wouldn't have considered before.  And doing those things, outside your usual routine & comfort zone, no matter how small they are, will introduce new and (some) better people into your world to help with the loneliness bit.

It's kind of like saying the trick to avoiding starvation is to not mind being hungry so much that you can't bring yourself to go find food.  It's more complicated than that, but if there is a secret to depression recovery, that's it.  It's not an absence of something, it's the presence of something to excess, and we can, with difficulty, let it go.

It's understandable to feel the way you describe.  You certainly aren't alone there.  Felt that way for sooooo long, so many times.  The best insight I can offer you is that it really does not have to be that way, and nothing outside of you has to change in order for that to happen.  Sometimes it's hard to see our depression as manifesting in ourselves as being too harsh on our own selves.  But it is, and we can learn to stop, or at least slow down first.

Every human soul has value, if only because we have free will.  You could get up tomorrow morning and do literally anything, and that anything could benefit anywhere from 1 to 7 billion people.  That's not nothing.  Embrace your potential, reject everything but the lessons of your failures and defeats.  It's the only way to survive depression, IMO.

I look forward to the day my own life is back together enough that I can do more than just offer words on this sub to people, and you're no exception.  Warm feelings and confidence.  You are capable, for now at least, of holding down a job.  A lot of people in our circumstances are beyond even that, which makes it all that much harder.  Build something, don't spend your energy tearing yourself down.  If a complete stranger can care about you enough to write this, the people who really know you, some of them at least, must really care deeply.  That's not nothing, and it's something to build on."	hypercafspazz	reply	na	na	na	0.9978504180908203	no	no	no	na	MadOver30	failed

And then, last Wednesday, my knee dislocated. I was doing nothing, literally standing in place, and shifted my weight from one leg to another. Boom, on the ground in terrible pain. I dislocated it 7 years ago, and each time you do it it's more likely to reoccur. My anxiety is spiraling. I'm having a stroke, no it's a blood clot, no it's my circulation, no it's.....

I'm terrified. Angry at my body. I have foot issues and arthritis already limiting my activities with my children (ages 3 and 6). I'm only 36.

The power steering pump broke on my car and my seventy year old mom paid for it to be fixed and it's got me feeling bad. It just makes me feel disabled but I want to have my own money and let her spend her cash on things like the travel/vacation that she' thought that she would be doing at this point in her life. I don't know what to do about it. I already know that my limit for factory work is about three months. I had a job in a laundry feeding towels and sheets into automated equipment that ironed and folded them using precise blasts of air. Once I started hating that job, my bipolar disorder symptoms kept getting worse until my dad had to come drive me home. There's a greeting job at the gym that I go to that I think that I could do.

"Hey there.  I'm testing what I can handle alot right now.  31 and decided to college to get a degree in engineering at 29. The bipolar mania helps push me through the hardest stuff, but the inevitable flip side always threatens to undo all my hard work.  So many days I have to walk out of class because my depression and brain fog make me feel stupid, then angry, then I get suicidal.  I have a part time job waiting tables through it all, and I'm amazed i haven't walked out of that.  I actually did quit for  time and realized there was no way to survive otherwise.  I try all the things - exercise, mediatation, nootropics, eating healthy... nothing staves off the depression for long.  I pretty much constantly go from pure suicidal suffering to barely getting by when a manic swing happens.  It doesn't seem sustainable.  So many times I think of dropping out, but I've already quit everything in my life,  and Its like i have this manifesto that says if i quit this, suicide is the only option.  

Honestly, I can't handle anything, but somehow I have been.  Its alot of pain.  Alot of punching walls. Alot of crying.  Alot of feeling like a worthless idiot.

Right now I'm about to go into a circuits final exam, and my anxiety is through the fucking roof.  On less than 3 hours of sleep... listening to my favorite music and praying for a manic uptick.

"I work part time at a grocery store and also get disability benefits.  Sometimes I think I should work full time and give up my disability. But, I have had a few really busy days where I worked a little over eight hours. I was super glad at the end of that long day that I didn't have to work eight hours five days a week. 

My main job is to fill the online orders. I don't get to leave until all the orders are filled, but usually I get off pretty close to on time. Sometimes I will have a super busy day with tons of orders and no help and I work eight hours instead of four or five. 

When I don't have orders, I will cashier, carryout, stock shelves or do anything else that needs doing. Sometimes if we get busy, I will be called up to cashier or carryout while I am doing orders. Mostly it's fine, but sometimes I am busy with orders and taking time to help up front is difficult. 

Today, there were no orders when I first started. I helped put some of the truck away. Then I started getting orders. My supervisor got frustrated that I was busy doing orders. (They kept coming in one after the other. After 1pm, no more same day orders can be placed). She ""had things that she wanted me to do."" It's not my fault I got orders. They can't rely on me to do stuff that's not technically my job in case I have to actually do my job!

I work four days a week and average about 20 hours a week. I also have a set schedule, which is awesome. Only the online shoppers get a set schedule.

ETA: my mom is in her mid seventies and is super supportive of me. I make too much between my job and my disability to qualify for 'hab services'.

"Hi,  
I am new on Reddit (and to this sub). I am 26 (fast approaching 27) but hope that's not an issue. I liked the topics discussed in this sub and thought about sharing something I felt recently. 

So, I used to really like a girl in my college days. She liked me as well. But we both knew it'll never work because there were so many hurdles between us (I don't want to get into details, but coming from India for marriage caste, religion, etc. are very important stuff, especially for older people, and creates many problems - yeah it sucks!). Anyway, for this reason, we always kept a distance. We were good friends, she called me for everything, whatever help she ever needed I was the first person she ever called. Even when we were never in any kind of relationship, she'll still get jealous when I get too close to some other girls. But not in a weird possessive ay, but I'd say in a cute way. Anyway, college life ended just like that, we did keep in touch. Random messages & calls from time to time. After a few years, she got married (Arranged marriage, It's India!). She invited me to it. I got to talk to the groom and I liked him. I know it's a bit hard to get a grasp about someone with a few minutes of conversation but still, I felt they're a good match.   
After her marriage, our contact reduced so much. We rarely talked. But that was okay. I was over her and she wasn't on my mind all the time like she used to be and I moved on. But a few days ago, on their marriage anniversary, she posted her wedding pics and looking at that I felt all the feelings I had came back to me at once.  


I wonder how different my life would have been if we were of the same religion. (Please don't judge us here because it's really hard in some communities to marry someone of a different religion. It literally destroys families.)  


 I was wondering whether anyone here ever looked back in their life & felt something like this.  


Just sharing one of my favorite poems which kinda explains my feeling.

I'm nervous and have no idea what to expect so would love to hear anyone  else's experiences if you are willing to share in a comment here or  send me a DM if you'd rather keep it private.  Thanks!"

"I tried shrooms last November specifically for therapeutic purposes!

It's been VERY helpful.  It allows me to look at my trauma/anxiety from a very detached view, as if I'm watching a child.

The first time I did them I cried for hours thinking ""Oh my god... everyone's right.  I'm REALLY okay."""	MochaSmokes	reply	na	na	na	0.02741064876317978	no	strong	no	na	MadOver30	no prediction.
"For what it's worth, my research is indicating that psychedelics are the next line of possible treatments that might yield more results than ""traditional"" medicine, and there's lot of pressure to get them legalized for this purpose.

"""Traditional"" never worked for me and my limited research really gives me hope that this is something that might actually work.  Even though I've never experimented (other than weed as a teenager) I've always felt there is a lot that is missed by demonizing drugs such as marijuana, LSD, mushrooms, etc.  Sometimes people self-medicate and find success that doctors refuse to admit is possible.

I hope this works for me, of course, but I'm also interested in doing this because I believe in legalization in general.  I didn't expect to find a study so close to me so I was thrilled to find this one and to actually be pre-qualified!  Thank you for your response."

"Does anyone else share the experience of walking away from religion or a worldview change in general in their 30s? It's almost as if halfway through my 30s everything in my life seemed to fall apart and nothing really made sense anymore, my job, my relationships, creative drive, even my concept of God.

It is almost like we try to peice together all of the accumulated knowledge up to that point and nothing fits. Like the tool song ""I know the peices fit cause I watched them fall away."" 

Is this what a midlife crisis is? Existential Crisis? Is there a way back?"		post	17.751744577358544	female	White	0.9972475171089172	na	na	na	14	MadOver30	no prediction.
"I don‚Äôt think there is a way back. But there is a way forward. 

You may not even want to go back. You may just miss the time in your life when you didn‚Äôt feel so disconnected. 

It sounds like you are in the middle of it. There is another side. It‚Äôs better,  more authentic, and more in alignment with your true self. But you have to find your true self first. There is work there. It‚Äôs not easy. It is worth it.

"Yes, this happened to me, and for me, it was a ""way back"" -- way back to how I felt and what I believed when I was a sullen teenager.  Since my sullen/nihilistic teen years, when in senior year of high school I was introduced to existentialism, I had created a belief system for myself that was fairly sophisticated and, importantly, somewhat optimistic.  By my mid 30s, however, anything remotely optimistic looked so ugly and manipulative to me that the whole stack of Jenga blocks fell apart and I was back at naked nihilism.

I'm still pretty much there at uncomplicated nihilism.  I'm functioning as a very frustrated hedonist (someone who believes the point of life is to enjoy one's self).  But the struggle amidst capitalism for my own survival, matched with the catastrophically unfair wealth/resource distribution of capitalism, makes hedonism seem simultaneously pointless/frustrating and hopelessly selfish. So.  I'm not exactly embracing it, just kinda, drifting along, I guess.

My dysphoria in this modern capitalist world is almost overwhelming. I can barely stand to go on in this fucking world, and yet a world that would be extremely tolerable is so easy to imagine. It's all just such a waste."		reply	na	na	na	0.9972475171089172	no	strong	no	na	MadOver30	no prediction.

"Mid-30s and right there with you.

I was cast out of my religion, realized I don't believe it anymore anyway, and had practically no friends outside of it. Been trying to sort out my beliefs ever since.

I started a family late, so I'm learning what parenting really means and how heavy a responsibility it is.

I'm in between careers and the dreams I used to have are incompatible with reality.

"Yes.

After years of agonising over my decision, I finally left my religion/cult at 28/29. I'm 32 now. 

It's hard. Everything changes. I questioned everything. Every decision I make takes twice as long. Do I really like the things that I like? How I do I feel about X now that I need to think for myself?

What's helping me is just saying yes to things. Opening myself up to new experiences. Listening, learning, appreciating different opinions. I met my now fiance when I was 30 (so not too long after I walked away) and he has been instrumental in helping me through this. He encourages me to try new things and challenges my way of thinking. I now have a much better grasp on what my values and morals are as a person. I'm still shaping some things in my mind. And I'm not afraid to admit to where I have gaps.

"If it‚Äôs real to you, it‚Äôs real. 

I used to always say, ‚ÄúI know I shouldn‚Äôt feel this way.‚Äù And a man I was with would reply, ‚Äúyou‚Äôre allowed to feel how you feel.‚Äù 

That was a bit mind blowing to me at the time. I had never heard such a concept. I didn‚Äôt know feelings were to be felt and shared. 

So, there is a part of you that is conditioned to think ‚Äúthat‚Äôs so petty,‚Äù but that isn‚Äôt how YOU actually feel. It‚Äôs how someone else feels who conditioned you to think that. When you tell yourself ‚Äúthis is petty‚Äù - who is that coming from? Is that a parent‚Äôs voice? Someone else? 

Someone else may think your thought is petty. But you think it‚Äôs real. Therefore, it‚Äôs real. Allow yourself to feel what you feel without labeling and judging.

"Absolutely. Both sub consciously and consciously.

I never celebrated Christmas growing up. Over the last few years I‚Äôve eased myself into it. The other day my fianc√© brought home a small Christmas tree (my first). I panicked. I was so excited but I was also devastated by guilt.

When I started online dating.

The first time I had sex.

As I started watching TV shows and movies that had previously been forbidden.

I have to take the time to remind myself of the decisions I‚Äôve made, why I made them and that I‚Äôm at peace with it.

I see a psychologist fairly regularly which is expensive but worth it.

And every now and then (like two Fridays ago) I get sad and overwhelmed and I drink too much. Or I binge eat.
