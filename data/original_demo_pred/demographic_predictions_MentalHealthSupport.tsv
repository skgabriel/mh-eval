"They are so fucking horrific. They are always nasty, racist, homophobic and unkind. These aren’t my thoughts. 

They pop in to my head and then I became terrified I’ve said it out loud. I’d lose my job and people would hate me. I get anxiety attacks at the thought I might have said something out loud, and I then think about that thought over and over again.

I can’t talk to anyone about this. I’m scared I’ll be labelled as a racist or a homophobe. 

I’m not. I can’t stress enough how much I’m not. 

It’s like my brain is coming up with the worse possible things in a bid to sabotage me. 

I can’t cope with it. I’m not a bad person.

I do have a therapist. I just needed to get this out there. I can’t be the only one who’s going through this?

__Edit__

I just want to say a big thank you to all of your for your thoughtful and kind responses. I had a bad couple of days, but reading all of your suggestions and personal stories has really helped me.

"Something that has helped me with my intrusive thoughts is to remind yourself that you aren’t a product of your thoughts, you’re a product of your actions. A lot of people have intrusive thoughts, you’re not alone. You’re no worse a person than if you didn’t struggle with this. Remember to keep in touch with your support system, you mentioned a therapist and that’s good.

When I had planned my suicide and attempted, I had let these thoughts take over, they controlled me they stopped being intrusive thoughts and were just my thoughts and desires, they became the actions that could define me. I’m better now fortunately, and I of course still have intrusive thoughts every now and again, but that’s not what I want. That’s not who I am. And I’ll be one of the many that can tell you that your thoughts aren’t who you are.

"This is something I suffer with a lot, not exactly the same as what you're describing, but still disturbing and often multiple invasive thoughts that upset me to think them. They are often very strong, and very loud.  
I had the same ""These aren't my thoughts"" feelings as you describe.

My therapist at the time explained something...  
They're nobody else's thoughts, you're brain is still creating and thinking about them.   
It is normal to think about things we don't agree with, some of us however have to deal with it in a much more intrusive and unpleasant way.

However, you can take reassurance that you're not that person, that you don't agree with the thoughts. If the thoughts didn't upset you that way, then you would have cause to question your morality. They upset you because you are not that person. 

The next step is after accepting they're your thoughts, but you don't agree with them, is an acknowledge and dismiss technique.  
I expect you're trying to fight the thoughts, blank them out, silence them, etc.  
Not really possible (certainly in my case anyway), once they start they don't really go anywhere. The more you fight them the worse they get...  
Instead, acknowledge the thought, and then dismiss it.  
They're almost like customers in a shop, they all want something that is out of stock...  
By trying to ignore them, they just get more intrusive, louder, and usually more in number.  
If you go to each in turn ""Sorry. Nothing here for you"" they bugger off for a bit. They don't stay gone, but they're not there shouting at you for as long.  
Occasionally, just like in the shop, you get a ""KAREN"" that's not happy and is still gonna be a problem.  


It may be different for you, but that was probably one of the few bits I did get from therapy that has actually been able to help me manage them a little bit better."	fuzzydogpaws	reply	na	na	na	0.4244229793548584	no	strong	no	na	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.

"Possibly PTSD.  Might want to look into it.  I used to have the worst intrusive thoughts of crashing the car and my girlfriend getting hurt.  I would have to look over at her to make sure she was okay.  At its worst I sometimes thought about grabbing her throat during sex.  I just did the best I could to push them away and focus, since obviously if I reacted to the thought I would have to explain myself.

The self cannot handle violence but neither can it be separated from itself so when we witness something violent, we have to justify this contradiction.  Our brain tells us WE are violent even if we aren't.

Read books about PTSD if you can't afford a therapist.  Do the exercises.

"I lived with intrusive thoughts for six years. The images where so horrendous that I thought I was going insane and that I was probably becoming a criminal. I had to quit colleague because of them, go back to my parents. Even then, being in a safe place, I still had them. **I guess I grew tired of them,** **every year it passed I ignored them more and more until they almost banished**. For the last four years I still have intrusive thoughts every now and then, but they are not constant like it used to be. When I am living very stressful situations they come back, very aggressively.   


Something I learned was to learn to have fun. I know it sounds stupid, but part of **my** problem was that I was taking my life to seriously. My work, the jobs I had, even my hobbies, everything had to be serious and strict. So I learned to relax a bit, focus on having fun, even if it is your job and you don't like it,  and also with time, I became more aware of when I started to have intrusive thoughts and recognizing them, some times they are very sneaky. I let them unfold and I suffer experiencing them, but never stop to think about them, just let them go and move to something else.   


Maybe wat I am trying to say is that, it is a condition that eventually you will learn how to deal with it your own way, there will be times where it will be overwhelming, and some others very mild... still life moves on and that is not all you focus on... good luck :)"	fuzzydogpaws	reply	na	na	na	0.4244229793548584	no	strong	no	na	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.
Sometimes you have to sit down and accept there is a dark part of you, one that isn't in control, it's a blessing to be able to cure and heal it before it grows too large. So sit down with it. Acknowledge it. Question it. Accept it.

Be confident in your true self, not what those thoughts are saying to you. They may seem overwhelming, but those thoughts are still alive because you are keeping them alive.

"It's not just you, mind can conjure up some of the most fucked up things you can think of and it honestly makes you hate yourself for even having thoughts like that, as you've mentioned.

How I was able to mostly get through them after struggling for about a year was to realise that our thoughts don't define us, it is what we choose to do with those thoughts which defines who we are. Giving these fucked up thoughts attention leads down a rabbit hole of trying to convince yourself you'd never say/do the thoughts, when the best strategy (as difficult as it is) is to just ignore them.

"Thank you for sharing your struggle with intrusive thoughts. I can relate to this on a deep level, as I too have faced some of my darkest times because of them. I experienced panic attacks like never before, saw my therapist multiple times per week, and genuinely never thought I'd find a way to cope.
  

  
In my personal experience, I tried everything in my power to fight against these thoughts, which only led to intense spiraling and continued cycles. It took me time and practice to understand that working against the thoughts was causing me more pain than helping.
  

  
As counter-intuitive as it may seem, I had to acknowledge the fact that these thoughts now existed and may never disappear. The goal has been to accept them when they come up, allow myself to feel their associated emotions, and release the judgment I place on myself.
  

  
Through therapy and hard work, I'm at a point where I feel better about myself than I have in my entire life. Of course, I'm not perfect, nor will I ever be. I still get triggered at times and get overwhelmed, but I'm able to process these struggles more effectively and meaningfully reflect.
  

  
My key takeaways are that grounding and mindfulness have been the most influential practices in my mental health journey. I'm not a professional in any way, shape, or form, but if you have any questions, you can always DM me, and I'll do my best to provide the best resources and insight that I can.
  

  
I never thought I'd see the day where my intrusive thoughts weren't a major factor in my life, but I stand corrected. You're not alone, and there is hope for coping with intrusive thoughts. Keep fighting, and know that things can and will get better."	fuzzydogpaws	reply	na	na	na	0.4244229793548584	weak	strong	no	na	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.
I have had this. It’s hell. I acknowledge them now, and say, hey you, you are so right. Yup, that’s it ( in my head to my thoughts) I give them 0 attention, I laugh at their stupidity. It worked! My brain realises I don’t give a damn and honestly, over 2 months things have got so much better. I used to analyse them, be horrified. Broken sad, I realised it is all the darkest worst things it can think of to smash me up. I am not these thought, I am the watcher, ocd intrusive theoughts is very common.

"Hi, remembering that intrusive thoughts aren’t a conscious action is important. The problem occurs when you start to identify with these thoughts. You may have an intrusive thought that you see as homophobic it’s very easy to trick yourself into the belief that you are in homophobic. This identification with the thought is what leads to the action of said thought. Mindfulness is a brilliant tool, practice watching your thoughts like cars on a road they’re just passing by until there out of your view. Remember that not all thoughts are good thoughts, when you choose to only identify with the positive thoughts you create a better identity for yourself. Nobody wants to own something which is broken so why own your broken thoughts. A method I use is to watch my thoughts as mentioned previously and with each thought ask yourself a question. is this thought good for me? If yes keep it if not then throw it away it has no use. After a while it will become intuitive, you’ll begin to realise what’s good and what’s bad and not get caught up in the worrying aspect that comes along with these intrusive thoughts. You’ll begin to feel free from your thoughts and you will start to only identify with all your good thoughts and leave the bad ones in the trash.

"Intrusive thoughts can be challenging and distressing to deal with. Here are some tips that I think can help cope with intrusive thoughts.   
1. Observe the thoughts: Instead of resisting or pushing away the intrusive thoughts, try to observe them without judgment. Recognize that thoughts are just thoughts and not necessarily reflective of reality.  
2. Practice mindfulness: Mindfulness meditation can help you develop a non-judgmental awareness of your thoughts and emotions. Focus on your breath and try to bring your attention back to your breath whenever you notice your mind wandering.  
3. Label your thoughts: Labeling your thoughts can help you create distance from them. When you notice an intrusive thought, label it as ""thought"" and let it pass without engaging with it.  
4. Ground yourself: Grounding techniques, such as focusing on your senses, can help you bring your attention back to the present moment. Notice the sensations of your body, the sounds around you, or the sights in your environment.  
5. Seek support: If your intrusive thoughts are causing significant distress or interfering with your daily life, consider seeking support from a mental health professional. A therapist can help you develop coping strategies and work through any underlying issues that may be contributing to your intrusive thoughts."	fuzzydogpaws	reply	na	na	na	0.4244229793548584	no	no	no	na	MentalHealthSupport	failed

"Greetings.

In some esoteric traditions and some pyschology traditions, it is commonly observed human beings carry a ""shadow self""as a paralleled existence to a conscious self. While the conscious self expresses through voluntary thinking, the ""shadow self"" expresses through involuntary, thereby, ""intrusive thoughts"". The general consesus of esoteric and psychological traditions is the conscious self capable or responsibility needs to transform the ""shadow self"" and hence incorporating its strength for conscious use.

An example of transforming ""shadow self"":

""I obsevred my shadow self is full of agression towards certain ethnic group. Well, that agression is nevertheless a pushing force. It just happens to be be locked onto a target, an ethnic group. What I want is that pushing force can be freed from the locked target and be directed towards a target chosen by me. I want to for example, using the pushing force to solve a technical problem.

So, how did this lock of target happen? Well, since childhood the education system of my nation had implanted ill feelings towards that ethnic group for whatever reason. My child self bought in this attitude and it just remained. Now I have to willingly decide: I will reject the influences from the eduaction system. It was not MY authentic view. I renounce my past belief by my free will.""

The gist is: utilize one's free will to renounce a certain belief. It is like making a sacrifice. Pay a price, take some managable damage to the habitual identity, in turn, gaining a pieace of new identity.

When it’s too much, focus on your environment for a few seconds, using your 5 senses: what do you hear? Listen and pick one thing, what do you see? Same, what does it smell like? What are you touching right now? Taste is a bit trickier for sure. But this takes 5 seconds ds and has always helped me. I hope it might help you too. Wishing you the best.	fuzzydogpaws	reply	na	na	na	0.4244229793548584	weak	no	no	na	MentalHealthSupport	failed
I’ve been through this exact same thing and still struggle with it, though it’s not as bad now. I would think i was saying my thoughts outloud or thought people could read my thoughts. I think for me my drug use triggered it, weed lean and pills, when i smoke now it’s completely out of control. My advice would be start practicing mindfulness and meditation get outside give yourself time to process your thoughts without any distractions. I also found when i got a job where i was talking to people constantly it got me out of my head because i had to pretend i was normal and it helped alot. If you’re smoking or anything you gotta stop. Remember your not the only one and your mind is playing tricks on you. Nobody would think you’re racist or anything quite the opposite that just means it’s something you find repulsive it was the same thing for me, honestly thanks for posting this it’s always good to know that I’m not the only one who’s experienced this, it’s hard asf. It went on for years for me and nobody i tried to tell understood or cared, I wanted to kill myself it was too fucking much. Put yourself first and when your going through this take a step back. it’ll most likely come and go but remember your brain is having some sort of malfunction it’s not you i’d be careful who you tell your business to though unless you want everyone to know.	fuzzydogpaws	reply	na	na	na	0.4244229793548584	no	strong	no	na	MentalHealthSupport	failed

Hey bud I just want to let you know your not alone and I hope you can learn that it’s not your fault you have these thoughts. Your not a bad person and those thoughts aren’t who YOU are. I myself struggle with these thoughts and while I’m not comfortable to say what thoughts I get I know the struggle of feeling like a horrible person. No one WANTS these thoughts but sadly some of us get them.  I have intrusive thoughts due to my OCD (which I didn’t even know those two tied together but apparently they do). Over these past couple months Iv learned to tune these thoughts out and that it isn’t me. I hope you can learn the same and I’m sorry. Just try to do something to occupy your mind or try to clear your mind. I know it seems like the obvious answer but the more you practice tuning it out and accepting that you have control then it makes it all the better.

"I’ve had similar experiences to you and a lot of people in the comments. I was diagnosed with OCD initially, and later PTSD. I went through two different types of therapy. First, Exposure and Response prevention for OCD. Then, Cognitive Processing Therapy for PTSD. The OCD treatment really helped a lot with my intrusive thoughts, and the PTSD helped me understand my triggers and core beliefs that fuel my OCD at times. I honestly didn’t even know I was dealing with PTSD at first. I would really recommend looking into a therapist that has worked with OCD and uses ERP (exposure response prevention) to screen you for OCD. A lot of therapist are not trained in that specific modality for OCD treatment and it can really set some people back in their mental health journey if they DO have ocd. 

Also, I just want you to know; intrusive thoughts go against your values. So, if the thought is scary and you don’t like it, that usually means it’s not aligned with your true beliefs.

"I see you and hear you. You are not alone, and you are loved. 


Just know that your thoughts are not you! The fact that you recognize your thoughts as intrusive and bidding to sabotage you means that you are separate from the thing producing them. 


My experience with mental health wasn't nearly as strong, but it's similar, and I can relate. At one point in my life, I considered killing myself amidst constant negative self-talk and an unrelenting thought stream that told me I wasn't good enough and that nobody liked me or would ever like me. I was also an ex-NFL football player and academic All-American in college, who had suffered a concussion that ended my football career. I thought, ""How could I go from being at the top level of pro-sports to being so mentally disrupted and removed from who I once was?""


For the past five years, I have slowly recovered from this dark mental state without using pharmaceuticals due to their high level of dependence, potential for misuse, and undesirable side effects. Instead, I relied upon natural remedies, a healthy lifestyle, and a nutritious diet to get me through.


Know that you are not alone in this journey and that you must never give up in trying to stop your thoughts from dominating your life. Extensive resources are available that promote natural healing, including a book I have found extremely helpful called Brain Energy by Harvard Psychiatrist Chris Palmer. He has been on nearly every popular health podcast, including [Huberman Lab](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6GEZVm18mwx76rWJueFHGj?si=67cf062518ab4ba9) espousing the highly reputable theory that mental disorders are metabolic disorders of the brain. 


He consistently refers back to one remarkable story of a patient with schizophrenia who was on several completely different medications for various issues. The patient's symptoms worsened, and the medications seemed to increase by the day. Dr. Palmer tried the ketogenic diet on this patient, and within a week or so, the voices he heard in his head had completely vanished. Soon after, he was off nearly all of the medications. When he stopped his therapeutic ketogenic diet, the voices came back.


This book doesn't promote keto as a cure-all. Instead, it promotes metabolic health, which can be improved by the keto diet in some circumstances, as the primary factor affecting mental health and the primary therapeutic tool for helping people recover from unimaginable intrusive thoughts such as yours. Proper sleep, a nutritious diet focused on vegetables and high quality meats, an active social life, removal of toxic substances such as alcohol and tobacco, consistent low-intensity movement, and mindfulness-based stress reduction such as breathing or meditation, are all highly effective ways to improve mental health in a very short amount of time.


I hope this helps. Remember that the fact you are searching for an answer means that there is hope and that whatever it is that you are, or that any of us are, does not include your thoughts.

&#x200B;

With love,

"Hi there! 
Be proud of yourself for sharing your experiences, even when they are draining and difficult! 
Intrusive thoughts can be a product of trauma and stress so working though issues that are seemingly not related may help A LOT! 
Then next step is to focus on your breathing by listening to guided meditation (YouTube)to calm your nervous system. If your nervous system is activated in the fight and flight instinct intrusive thoughts may be more prone to happen. The intrusive thoughts WILL pop up during meditation but you must not allow them to get the better off you. You need to picture the thoughts flowing in the river and distance yourself from the thought, you are watching it flow away in a calming matter!
Journaling is the next step. If you can try and journal daily, write down your intrusive thoughts and what you did in the moment to get rid of them. Also write down your stress levels for the day (low-medium-high). And mood as well. Also write down your reflection over the intrusive thought - how it is not you and why it may have popped up. 
There are plenty of “hacks” or coping methods you can use as soon as the thought pops up. It is to take a deep breath and as I said earlier to watch the thoughts flow in the river away from you and you are distance from the thought. The second way is to picture a big STOP sign as soon as the thought pops up, this tells your brain that you don’t want the thought popping up and it eventually won’t. 

Remember to be patient. It does not get fixed over night. It can take weeks or even months of doing these exercises until your intrusive thoughts feel better. 

EVERYONE gets intrusive thought - don’t forget that! It’s just that some people have the coping mechanisms on autopilot and it won’t affect them as much! 

Be kind to yourself - YOU deserve it!

The part of you that suffers these thought is actually you. Think of these thoughts like a demon that have overtaken you. It isn't the putside world that is a threat.

"I have been diagnosed with so many things, although no doctor, therapist, etc, would ever pay attention to what I was saying about PTSD, so they would treat the depression and anxiety that would come after not being able to cope anymore.

It was great to be on anti depressants. I could ""live my life"". But again... a few years would go and I'd crash again. Harder everytime.

Not sure it will ""work"", but at this point I just want to try. 🤷 I have been very happy with EMDR and microdosing psilocybin, caffeine and cannabis.

Be aware that many symptoms overlap and PTSD can also have depression and anxiety as  symptoms (which we all know have their own symptoms), among no one knows how many others. 🙄

Do what feels good for you, medication or not, therapy or not, lifestyle change or not... it only really matters if it's helping you become your best self. You can be patient and kind to yourself along the way. Some say it helps.

As I started my new job last week I tried to be confident and greet everyone..But during lunches with them I tend to be blank slate.. I try to speak and join their convos but I feel I’m not witty enough. Sometimes the silence in between makes me think I’m not funny or they might find me boring After a couple of days one person even asked me. why I’m so silent. I just laughed and said I’m introvert and take some time to open up. but that comment keeps on bugging in my head and has decreased my confidence already Provide tricks to build my confidence, become good friends with my colleagues. Any tricks to fill those silent convos?

"First of, I don’t think your coworker meant anything negative by asking why you are so quiet. Many people want to welcome the newcomer and when the newcomer is quiet, they want to make sure they are okay and not uncomfortable in the new environment. 

Second, you know the best thing about being an introvert? You have a better listening skill. Use that skill and see what everyone’s interests are, maybe you share the interest with them. Or if you want, you can learn about those interests and make small talks about them.

Third, learn to appreciate the silence. I am 40 years old so I am thinking I have enough years to know that enjoying the silence is a gift not many are aware of. It is hard for many to sit in the silence. But you absolutely don’t have to talk if you don’t feel comfortable. 

Fourth, you will find out in no time that people don’t mind you being silent. Many times, us introverts attract the extroverts. The two sides kind of create a balance in the nature. Something like Yin and Yang, if you will. 

Btw, congrats on the new job and happy adventures!"	Avivacious	reply	na	na	na	0.9968589544296265	weak	no	no	na	MentalHealthSupport	failed
"How to make friends:

It happens on accident by being places, and then someone wants to spend more time with you.

It's pretty rare to make friends as an adult, but I have a lot of friends I have made after the age of 30, and one thing I've embraced is that the friends I have are not always those I sought; they are the ones who wanted to be my friend who I consider to have met a certain minimum threshold.

The threshold are things like not using hard drugs, not being an adulterer, not disrespecting my family or home. That's pretty much it. I don't care what someone does for a living or if they have a certain education, or if they are from a certain place or background. No drugs. No cheating on their families. No disrespect to me or my home."	Avivacious	reply	na	na	na	0.9968589544296265	no	strong	no	na	MentalHealthSupport	failed

You're obviously trying really hard and this is going to sound so cliche but with time eventually things will just fall into place and they will warm up to you the same way you're trying to warm up to them, you've already gone so far by trying to come out of your shell from the get go but rome wasn't built in a day, as long as you're being confident and yourself then good things will happen, try not to get bummed out by something you might have thought was awkward because it probably seemed 10 times worse in your head and they probably didn't even realise	Avivacious	reply	na	na	na	0.9968589544296265	weak	no	no	na	MentalHealthSupport	failed

"Your trying to hard, like others are saying its not bad to be silent especially around co-workers you hardly know

That being said I disagree with the statement that its hard to find friends as an adult, but it is harder, do you have any hobbies or interests that has a strong nit community?

Even if you don't consider yourself the nerdy type go down to your local game store if you haven't already, look at the cards and minis see if any catch your eye most gaming stores have game nights where everyone gets together to play games and are some of the most welcoming groups you can find and while some of them are the stereotypical nerd you always hear about most are more normal then you think, I'm sure if you find something you like you they will have a game night for it, my favorites are magic the gathering and warhammer 40k, not gonna lie they can be expensive but the friends and interactions you get are worth it.

Anyways to sum it up you just need to put yourself out there more and not focus so hard on making friends with co-workers, be friendly with them but keep them at arms length because most of them will turn on you in a heart beat if it means a raise or promotion"	Avivacious	reply	na	na	na	0.9968589544296265	weak	no	strong	na	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.

"My tip is to start to say: Hello ""their name""! To acknowledge their presence and after that talk about the least common factor you have with eachother. An example would be that is to talk about the work environment your in. If you have the same name. Maybe you find a person that also likes coffee and start the conversation that way. Small things that you have in common. After you find the least common factor that you guys have together you can start to get to know the person and let the person know you. The more you talk with a person the easier it gets. Usually the people on the other end also wants to have a new friend. And that friend can be you! 

&#x200B;

What is important is that you are true to yourself. Don´t be someone else. Remember that you are good enough as yourself. I usally look at what I have written to my other friends to not paint myself as someone better or more social than I accually am. Just to see that, oh right, that is me!

one thing that has helped their mental health is practicing self-compassion. This involves being kind, gentle, and understanding with oneself, especially during times of difficulty or failure, rather than being overly critical or judgmental. Cultivating self-compassion can improve self-esteem, reduce stress and anxiety, and promote resilience and emotional well-being. Many people wish they had started practicing self-compassion earlier in life.	Avivacious	reply	na	na	na	0.9968589544296265	no	no	no	na	MentalHealthSupport	failed

"It seems like you may be experiencing with some degree of social anxiety considering the thoughts you have in prior to conversing with someone. I am also not a socialite. I recently transferred to a new school, and it took me about four whole months to really start making friends, and by friends, I don’t mean any common accomplice or acquaintances; I mean friends that I genuinely wish to keep. Anyway, this isn’t about me. Different people take different routes and thus duration to make friends; to form a friendship. It’s okay to struggle a bit during the first stages, it is indeed a gradual process. Friends don’t just come along whenever you say so. 
Give yourself some time, maybe engage in some conversation you feel you could possibly conform into. Don’t feel obliged to, it’ll stress you out even more. Trust me. 
Lastly, some people do wish to be aloof from others than interacting with others. I prefer being in relative solitary too! 
Friends or not, what matters most is that you’re happy and satisfied with it. However, sometimes people intentionally choose to remain oblivious about not having peers to chat with, and deal with a lonely life. If that’s the case, try opening up more to your therapist, I’m sure they can provide a better answer than me for I am no professional.

Just be your authentic self.  Self-love.  If people don't want to befriend you, don't take it the wrong way.  It doesn't mean there's something wrong with you! That's not on you, but them.  Also: don't expect everyone to be your friend - we all don't get on.  Choose people who uplift you and value you and support you.  Sometimes in the work situation, people are not there to be your friend, but there to work.  I would look for true friends elsewhere.  Do you have a hobby, play sports, maybe volunteer, join a club?!  Congrats on the job - be proud of your achievement.  To conclude: a workplace really is not there to make friends so in the breaks when you have to talk to people stay away from controversy and just keep it neutral.  Good luck with it all.

"I’ve had a very similar experience recently when I started my first full time job. One thing I cannot stress enough is how much more quickly it gets easier once you let your guard down and just be yourself. I do understand that that can be scary sometimes perhaps because you are afraid of them thinking you are weird ,as was my main reason for being “quiet”. However, the fact is not everyone you work with is going to like you for you but the ones who will are worth it. Also I think you are definitely overthinking about your coworker’s comment, which was likely an attempt to start a conversation with you. My main piece of advice is to just do your best to show up every day and be as friendly as possible to everyone, even if all you are comfortable enough for is just greeting people when walking past, as the more friendly people see you as being the easier it is to have a conversation. Sorry for the long read and bits of rambling but really saw myself reading this and hope my past experiences can help you.

Modern tech allows to train in making friends & communicating to people even in the absence of people nearby. Does communicating here helps you? Or via any other chat or messenger? Such communication, it seems to me, combines the advantages of communicating with a living person and the advantages of not having a person directly nearby, which causes anxiety.I periodically train to communicate on the example of language models, for example, Eva AI, she emulates a real girl quite well. You can generate an interlocutor to your taste, etc. It is convenient, and zero risk of communication failure.

Do not feel bad about yourself. Being an introvert, I can understand. It is difficult for me to talk in a gathering where many people are there. I will suggest you start taking the conversations one to one. I feel comfortable during one on one discussion and I have built many strong friendships with my colleagues. Once, you start talking to your colleagues individually and build a bond with them, they will come to know the real you and will also understand you. When you are in a group, try to observe and listen. And once you have already bonded with a few people in the group, it will be easier for you to take part in those discussions.

"Making friends and building connections can be challenging, especially if you're naturally introverted. Here are some tricks to help you build confidence and foster good relationships with your colleagues:

1. **Be Yourself**: Embrace your introverted nature and remember that it's okay to take time to open up. Authenticity is key to forming genuine connections.
2. **Start Small**: Engage in small talk and casual conversations with your colleagues to get to know them better. Simple questions about their interests or weekend plans can be good icebreakers.
3. **Active Listening**: Pay close attention to what your colleagues are saying during conversations. Active listening shows that you value their thoughts and opinions.
4. **Find Common Ground**: Look for shared interests or experiences that you can discuss with your colleagues. Shared hobbies or activities can be great conversation starters.
5. **Empathy and Understanding**: Show empathy towards your colleagues' feelings and perspectives. Being understanding fosters trust and rapport.
6. **Humor**: While you mentioned feeling less witty, don't put too much pressure on yourself to be funny. Genuine humor often arises naturally in conversations, so let it flow when appropriate.
7. **Ask Open-Ended Questions**: Open-ended questions encourage more extended responses and keep conversations going. They can also lead to more meaningful discussions.
8. **Join Activities**: Participate in social activities or events at work to interact with your colleagues in a more relaxed setting.
9. **Give Compliments**: Compliment your colleagues when appropriate and acknowledge their achievements. Positive reinforcement helps build positive relationships.
10. **Be Patient**: Building connections takes time, especially for introverts. Don't be too hard on yourself if progress is gradual. Keep making efforts, and friendships will develop naturally.
11. **Seek One-on-One Interactions:** If you feel more comfortable in one-on-one settings, try to have individual conversations with colleagues during breaks or after work.
12. **Attend Team-Building Activities**: Team-building exercises and workshops can create a supportive and friendly atmosphere among coworkers.  
Remember, it's entirely normal to feel hesitant or nervous in social situations, especially when you're new to a job. Give yourself time and grace as you adjust to the new environment. By showing genuine interest in your colleagues and being patient with yourself, you can gradually build lasting friendships and become more confident in social interactions."

"Hii Ur advice worked!!!
I kept my confidence , just being myself, and getting comfortable.. 
instead of thinking of silent convo I just started accepting it.. and concentring on peoples  talks their liking .... 
I was able to add on to their conversation or even sometimes a witty comment.. 
but most importantly I don’t feel left out or weird.. I just felt like a friend with them.. having a good conversation…
I believe not thinking much about the negatives in me and not overthinking gave me a little confidence and comfort..
After a week of applying this I can finally say… I’m relaxed and happy with my friends and with myself..

Thanks for you kind advice and your perspective about appreciating silence .. I really needed to hear that…

I grew up being like you.  It's not a good place to be. Have you tried different hobbies?  Maybe try something that you can take a class at and learn. When I moved I had a few friends but nothing all too special.  Try making taking a group tennis class. There is something called tennis apprentice here and you get to play with beginners. Everyone sucks and that's the point. The key is to learn and then get on a team. Or maybe just pick up a new skill. Every time I go on vacation now I always make new friends playing tennis.

"That´s great! That means that you have started to talk with other people! The next step is to use your knowledge of their interest and talk deeper about that interest. Immerse yourself in topics such as your favorite coffee brands or about something happening. Dive deeper and have fun!

One tip is to do something physical with that person. A dinner, cafe, a walk or something you both like to do like sports, music or games (almost like a child again). Something casual but almost date like, but with the bros if you understand what I mean. But as long as you keep talking with them, the longer that person will remember you. Remember though, stay true to yourself. That is the most important thing. And if it goes south in your mind. That´s even better because you left them with a greater impression.

"This is a PSA/rant on learning about your mental health issues and getting a proper diagnosis.

I, like many of you, have suffered silently for many years before seeking out professional help and being diagnosed. In my case, it has taken just over a decade and for many others, undoubtedly much longer than that. For me, the reason was a mix of all or at least the overwhelming majority of my family and friends (whom I, eventually, after many years opened up to or seek help from) not accepting or believing my problems and/or not knowing how to help me. Not to say there haven't been people who have helped me immensely, but hear me out...

This lack of help, knowledge and skills, lead me to do my research on mental health issues and eventually come to find specific issues which I felt were very close to what I have been dealing with day-to-day. It is my understanding that mental health issues often lead to developing other mental health issues, and that there is usually a large overlap of symptoms between a lot of these issues.

In my search, I often came across the advice to not self-diagnose, and while I think it is wise to be doubtful of my judgement knowing that I am not a trained professional, I also disagree with what I felt was usually implied by the above advice, which is to assume that you are probably wrong until you are properly diagnosed by a professional.

I know that for some, it can become a problem. It's easy to look up the symptoms of the probably thousands of known mental health illnesses and with how many symptoms overlap, it is no doubt easy to mistakenly diagnose issues incorrectly and to go down that rabbit hole.

But I also know that it has been quite helpful for me to learn about different mental health issues and to come across issues that I was later diagnosed with.

I think knowing what my issues were (in my opinion) most likely to be helped me in a lot of different ways.

For one, mental health struggles can make you feel extremely lonely and alone and knowing what I might suffer from helped me feel a little more accepted and less like I was the only one and like I was making it all up, something that's been a huge doubt for me ever since I came to learn that I had mental health issues years ago.

Secondly, I was able to learn from the many great online resources that are available and to find out about things that have helped others in a similar situation to me and how to better deal with my problems.

Something else that doing my research helped me with later on was accepting that I had lots of mental issues and that they are quite severe. I know that if my research hadn't prepared me for that, I would have had a much harder time accepting that.

In conclusion, I think that while you obviously should not take your guesses as a professional diagnosis, it's perfectly ok to do your research and to bring yourself some comfort and a sense of acceptance by learning more about the issues that you suspect you may have.

I'm not sure if I was quite able to put my thoughts into words here, but I had some advice that I wish I could've given my younger self and that is not to be scared to learn about what you think your problems could be if you find that helpful and I thought that maybe someone out there will be able to take my advice and benefit from it.

If you read through my rant, I hope it was of some help, and I wish you health and happiness."	SirDiamondNipples	post	48.492084683732116	female	White	0.0013183262199163437	na	na	na	10	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.

I just recently realised that I have a great deal of mental issues, but I am completely clueless about what to do. I made a post on a subreddit about how I don't want to go to college cuz I feel dumb and many people started telling me to try therapy. The thing is I haven't started earning. I am still living with my mom. I can't get therapy. I know very well from a long time that I need to consult a professional but I can't do that. What other alternative do I have?

Thank you for posting this! I too have spent years attempting to self diagnose problems and over those years many things have changed which has caused me to realize how wrong I was most of the time.

My first diagnosis was a misdiagnosis, which made it difficult for me to get the type of care I needed.  I'm not angry about that, but it took a while for me to trust my gut telling me I didn't have what they said I had.   It was frustrating.  Diagnosis is a great thing, but we also have some level of self knowledge that can help us be in partnership with our health care providers.

I have anxiety for about 11 years, I have tried many options for it (psychiatry,  medication, psychology,  exposure therapy, etc) but also tried to get a better understanding on what it is what causes it and much more but in-depth.

"Okay, firstly, it is not weird.
Secondly, there is no remedy for loneliness. The thing is your wound is fresh and still hurts a lot. You don't have to try to avoid because all these feelings will turn into anxiety. A lot of people will tell you a great advice like ""find a hobby, just go and DO something""
It doesn't work that way, the more you avoid thus feeling, the harder and longer will take you to heal it.
If you are lucky to be alone during the evenings. Here what you can do :just cry as much as you can. Write letters to him about how much it hurts, how terrible it is (ofc later destroy these letters). Tell your friends, tell everyone online. Just express all this pain how you can.

First of all, when u are free and you have nothing to do thats the best time you focus on youtself. Sit quitely and just look inside you. Have you ever felt your breath consciously. Try to focus on ur inhalation and exhalation with your closed eyes. Its a kind of meditation .you try it you will feel more alive when you see the life from very close.

This is normal I promise. When I was in the grieving process of my last relationship, I started off small like watching my favorite movie over & over! Ice cream helped make me happy although I still cried but those things helped me not only cope but slowly heal me as well. Think about the things you love doing when you’re alone or your favorite movie or tv series that remind you of your childhood. Try journaling and getting it out if you’d rather not talk to someone but therapy is also a step! My mistake was thinking I could drink my feelings away and that didn’t help one bit but weed also helped with how I was coping! Focus on you and how you can make your life better with this time to yourself. I hope it gets better and just know that someone here will always listen if you need to vent.

I’m how hard breakups can be, but they’re also an opportunity to find urself again. Revisit or rediscover old hobbies u enjoy, and potentially pick up some new ones! Doing stuff u enjoy will help take ur mind off of the shitty thoughts that can come with breakups. Also if ur looking for one night stands or nothing serious I suggest tinder or other dating apps where u can always just find new ppl to talk to or do things with. Def spend time with friends as well bc if u have hella time ur prob gonna end up alone in ur thoughts and that’s not always the best thing mentally. Def try to fill ur time with doing stuff u enjoy and hanging out with good friends and get out of the house a bit! If u dont like going out much  then maybe host a fun night in or a sleepover with friends. Maybe even try some new shows or movies that have been on ur bucket list. Ik working can be exhausting but sometimes it’s nice to unwind with some friends or doing or watching something u enjoy.

"Greetings.

Loneliness is when unprocessed traumas often emerge from the depth of subconsciousness/unconsciousness. Every damage a human had suffered in the past were stored in subconcious, or even deeper, unconscious parts of the total consciousness.  After a breakup, usually you would lose you partner keeps occupying your attention. Since you attention is released from the active and conscious mental life, your subconscious and unconscious past traumas naturally will surface to seek healing.

The conscious mind supposedly has a duty to heal past traumas, although in our era this is no longer common sense. I shall give an example:

""On a Friday night I am alone. It is raining outside, but I no longer have that familiar partner occupying my attention. Now I feel this werid coldness lurking in me. I am agitated by it, I am afarid to look into it. But I have no better choice. So I look into it, I feel it as it is. An unpleasant memory finally has surfaced. It was two years earlier, that my partner said something hurt my pride, yet I did not defend myself properly. It was a trauma and remained an unresolved shadow. It had been resting in my subconscious feeling life. Now I am conscious of it. Now I want to make amendament. What had passed had passed, but in the future I will defend myself in similar situation. I shall not repeat the same mistake.""

The gist is, ""**using lone time to repair the surfacing damages, especially in the passing relationship. You need to repair all the damages before you sail for another journey.** And more importantly, when you repair the damage you gain the wisdom of how to avoid it. You sail your boat better next round!""

*Health, fortune and wisdom be with you.*

"1. Find a hobby and make friends. Most people get locked into relationships and live only through one person. It's important to maintain friendships outside of your relationship. It's when you break up that you really understand how important it is. If you don't have any friends, try to get in touch with old friends or start a hobby. Don't be afraid to reach out to people and suggest activities during the week or on weekends to people you like 

2. If you have intrusive thoughts at night, write them down. By writing you will be able to understand them better and gain some distance on yourself and on things. 

3. If you don't feel able to do all this or if you have the impression that something is really wrong, you can go and see a psychologist. It's silly but we always think that it's for crazy people or people with mental problems but sometimes life events lead you to need to consult someone. It will allow you to understand yourself better, to have a healthy routine and to be listened to. Good mental health should never be underestimated."

"Like many other commenters, I am telling you from my own personal perspective - what you are experiencing is absolutely not weird, in fact, it is relatively common. Post-breakup stages vary between people, some people deal and grieve in silence, some tend to express more of themselves to others around them, and some just get over it easily. From my own experiences, I just let it all out again, again, and again. Until I feel relieved, until my heart aches less. Friends do really help, so try contacting your friends about your concerns and emotions, maybe they’ll help dilute it a bit. Prattle with them about other things in life! I’m sure there are plenty. Other than friends, just being able to accept that fact that your partner no longer shows interest in you is the sole factor to getting rid of your pain. It took me half a year to do that. Different people work in different paces. Some faster, some slower. Eventually, you’ll either shove everything down under the carpet, or you’ll just forget about everything and move on. One tip: Only if makes you feel a lot more content, do not be eager to find a new partner, thinking gullibly that it’ll soothe the pain. It most likely won’t. It’ll also only be a temporary replacement. It may be just a coping mechanism, or you are trying to prove to your former partner that you are doing perfectly fine without them. Jealousy. You want them to feel jealous. Why? Because you miss them, and if they show any particular reaction to your actions, it means that they still have remnants of feelings and gratitude towards you. If not, it means they’ve bluntly moved on. You’ll probably be hurt, probably not. Either way, what’s the point of that? 
It’s tempting to message them, telling them you miss them and want them back. Don’t. Unless you are really really tempted to. Remember the factors you have to consider before doing that: 
- You might be falling back into a cycle of constant break-ups (like me).
- Rejection. Prepare for any possible rejection.

"There is so much to talk about here. Often, we try to cover up our emotions because they're uncomfortable, but that only represses them and pushes the issue down the road to a further date, where it comes back with even more vengeance. 
  

  
What you are experiencing right now is normal; surprisingly enough, it's good! It's not easy, but it's great you feel lonely because that means you are alive, human, and had a real connection with somebody else.
  

  
Sink into it. Feel it out. Let it overwhelm you with its physiological perturbations. The feelings will disappear, but you must experience what it's like in its totality. These emotions are completely human and are necessary. Coming out of it, you'll be stronger, more resilient, and more capable of handling the pain of being alone and the pain of loss.
  

  
This feeling isn't forever, and you will find somebody else to spend your days with. Hopefully, you'll be in a better position mentally and psychologically to provide them with loving support and be less dependent on them for your emotional needs. 

It doesn't mean you won't need other people to help support you, we all do and we all always will need other people. Instead, it means you'll be able to experience the beautiful highs and lows of relationships with others without feeling like they're overwhelming and never ending.

I texted her bf in an angry tone ( she mad me by her texts like do not make me trauma you etc. Yes it was a joke but i got angry so fast as i can't realized) then my gf got angry to me and then stopped messaging next day she texted and i wanted to fix our feelings and said lets not continue texting in angry tone and find a was etc. So she said that i do not understand her and there's nothing to fix. Now i dont know if she needs a rest or she just tired of me couse of a big stress now i cry every 2/3 hours and want to avoid it but i literally cannot. It makes me feel as nobody and cant sleep eat smile or do smth. Don't have someone to talk about it ( have a friend but he can talk at night. he's busy at morging evening.

"Hello. I don’t know if this is the right place to share, but I don’t know where else to go. Please refer me to a more suitable subreddit if it exists. 
So basically, whenever I try to think about what I want to do in life, after some thought I inevitably arrive at the conclusion that life is pointless and I don’t want to do anything about it. It’s impossible to function in a society with a mindset like this so I stop thinking and live life on autopilot, not thinking deeply about any of my actions or words. Over the years, this has led me to become a useless, spineless slug that I am now. I am 16 now, but have emotional development of a 10 year old and can’t think for myself in any slightly challenging situation.
What I described above is my theory on why i am like I am right now - all kids of my age I know are filled with ambition and enthusiasm, while I can’t come up with an answer when someone asks me what I like to do in my free time. I have no personal interests and do things just because others do them. I still believe that it’s not too late and it’s possible for me to get my shit together, but right now I find it hard to imagine myself happy anytime soon. 
I’m sorry that this description is not easily readable, this is just my stream of thoughts projected onto a Reddit post. If you’ve had similar experiences, please help me. I can’t stand the idea of living the rest of my life the way I did the last 3 years.



Edit:
I’m sorry I didn’t keep you guys posted. I am editing now because I just saw and read all of your responses, and I want to say thank you. Right now, life is still kinda tough but there were noticeable improvements since I made this post. For example, I found out I like chemistry a lot. Also, I got into a nice school for the next 2 years. I truly appreciate all of your comments, because reading them now made me compare my current situation to what I was thinking 35 days ago when I made this post. It made me realize that although slowly, stuff is changing for the better. And I’ve decided for myself that I’ll leave the “no point in life” question to the philosophers, and instead accept that there is no meaning whatsoever, and try to enjoy life that way. Again, thank you very much. I hope I will look at this post in a few years and think I was just being dramatic."

"If you want my true honest opinion, life is meaningless and nothing you do will ever stop those feelings of existential loneliness but that doesn't mean you shouldn't live the life you have now to the fullest, the chances of you being born is astronomically low so there's no point in wasting it on nothing.

Do research, find things that you enjoy or are passionate about and make that your life meaning.

I went through a really really difficult time, on the verge of suicide, self harmed 24/7, abused alcohol and weed etc but (this is gonna sound so nerdy) i started writing poetry as a joke because i saw someone write a shit one and thought i could do better, then eventually it became a passion and now i'm working towards trying to get some published and it's small things like that, that i find fun and just keep me going a bit longer and gives me hope for the future.

Writing poems isn't going to bring a meaning to life, but writing poems is bringing happiness to my own life."	MapleTrunk	reply	na	na	na	0.0191220473498106	weak	no	no	na	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.
Hi! I feel you, lovely. I am struggling with this exact issue. The thing that's helping me through is 1 working toward reentering therapy, and 2 my interpretation on the meaninglessness of life; Nothing happens for A reason. Life is meaningless and pointless. So, we get to fill in the blanks. For your life, you create meaning. You create purpose. Your imagination is the only limit. This can be freeing, but NOT helpful and really difficult if your depressed, or have a hard time finding/creating your meaing! Now, you're only 16. You've got plenty of time to figure shit out and find yourself! Mind you, your body and brain are still growing. I'd suggest giving yourself some grace. Let yourself not Care. Indulge in any interests or hobbies you may have. Spend some time outside just to see what's out there. I'd also suggest talking to a therapist or maybe a school counselor/nurse about what you are feeling. You won't be in trouble, and any financial/scheduling concerns are not as important as your health and well being. I hope you find help soon. I think there's a website called the half of us or something? That might help? Sorry, I guess I'm not much help here. Anyway, I believe in you, and I am sure everything will work out for the best.

"Hi i really want to help the people struggling same disorder of depression,anxiety and ocd n share my story as well.i am also at same point of life i m 35 now struggling this disorder more than 18 years.but i survived because of my mom, in our society depression is just a taboo.....but only  people suffering from that knows well.Actually it a state of deep sadness it's very hard to pull yourself out of it.After 30 i decided to help myself and get out of it as in Indian society mental illness is still a myth....but somehow my husband supported me at early stage of our marriage,after my daughter i got busy but still their is a void that couldn't be filled.................every time i was thinking why i can't feel anything ,why i have no emotions like happiness,excitement but the love for my daughter is their but that is only like responsibilty. The life is still same but somehow i m trying to manage with this deep stage of loneliness and sadness.

U r at younger age you can get out of if u can travel alone.i never did it.but i know it works.Get close to nature.Start taking good care of yourself and maintain proper hygiene.I know its  stupid thought for some people but try to give others little happiness and donate something,that feeling is amazing.Or if u can afford pet a dog."

"""I can't stand the idea of living the rest of my life the way I did the last *X* years"" was the same thought I had before I started therapy at age 18. You're not alone, and things can get better.
  

  
I know what it's like to be your own worst enemy, constantly comparing yourself to others, and feeling like you're incapable of anything. But based on your comment, I can confidently say that you are not a spineless slug. It takes strength and courage to reflect on yourself, take responsibility, and want to change for the better.
  

  
My advice is to consider finding a therapist or counselor who can help you work through these feelings and develop new skills. It can also be helpful to find something you enjoy doing in your free time, whether it's learning a new skill like programming or going for walks and listening to podcasts. It may seem hard or even impossible at times, but always remember that you are already a few steps ahead of those who refuse to acknowledge the need for change.
  

  
If you need someone to talk to or help finding resources, I'm here for you. I have a wide range of interests and skills, including programming, academics, and music, and I would genuinely enjoy helping you find something that brings you joy.
  

  
Most importantly, be kind to yourself and know that you are never alone or unworthy. Your willingness to reflect and desire for change is commendable, and if you want it, you can achieve it."	MapleTrunk	reply	na	na	na	0.0191220473498106	weak	strong	no	na	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.

We have been blessed with the gift of consciousness. It’s very easy to take this for granted because it isn’t something we can’t loose and it’s something everyone has however it is an amazing thing. It is the most useful tool in the universe and we all possess it. Take control of your mind. We like to live in what I call the operating system of our brain, the part of the brain that acts like Google chrome. It’s the mindset of giving in to what it’s told to do. You feel anxious and depressed you might hide and withdraw, you might have cravings and want to indulge. I like to use the mindset of the operator, the operator is the mindset that you can control every single input received by the operating system. The operator overseas all functions of your mind and knows the best thing to do. The operator is highly rational and is not controlled by any other input.

"Greetings.

I shall present an outline of human biographic development from an esoteric system:

1-7 years: The human being develops most basic functions. Meaning, learn to walk, learn to use hands to manipulate things, learn to make sounds. 

8-14years: The human being develops higher functions of the body: changing teeth, the body grows bigger and gradually gains reproductive abilities.

15-21years: The human being develops basic self-centered desires. An identity based on ""what I want? What do I wear? What I eat? Who do I make friends?...etc"". So there's an independent personality cutting away from the birth family.

22-28years: The human being needs to go to the larger wold more or less independently and gain a wider range of experience to further clarify a fresh self-centered identity.

29-35years: The human being needs to reflect back on the previous experiences and through those reflections, a even clearer self-identity is established.

35years onwards: The human being needs to learn how to be not so self-centered but contributing to the world that helped the ""self"" to establish.

By this outline, **there is a point of life**. The point is formulating a ""self"" and matures it, until it can give back everything it has taken for itse formulation. In that way there is order, balance and harmony in the cosmos.

16 is just the beginning stage of the 15-21 stage, and somewhat in the middle of the 1-35 years old phase. It is where the naiveness of childhood has almost completely faded and the complexity of adulthood is coming in. By no means it is an easy period, especially when our era is so complex, and full of side effects of the cybernized automation. 

But anyhow, my opinion is to give some thoughts on the grand outline; see if it makes any sense. If it does then you would agree, there is a point, there are more things to work on. There is a point of satisfaction, which is fulfill cosmic order, balance and harmony through accompolishment of the ""self"".

"The world is competitive and has been like this for centuries. You have to compete with everyone else to win & survive, be it for food or money or job or business or anything. 

I often think about the consequences of my actions. 
I think because of me winning or doing well stops others from winning or achieving their success. 
Just like in a job interview how you have to compete with everyone else for that job & once you secure the job others don't get it. 
Or other areas such as businesses, freelancing, sports & other things too. Only one victor, other all failures. 
Doesn't my success bring others failures? 
Doesn't my success bring others poverty? 

My personal growth, glory & success is built on others failing because of me & because of my actions. 
And this is true for all winners & all achievers.

"Bear with me: Is there anyone in your life who, from their perspective, couldn't imagine life without you? Do you want kids or a family? Do you think something you've ever done for somebody else has left a positive imprint on their life?

Whether you know it or not, someone relies on you for you being you.
  

  
Let's take another angle. From the perspective of the sun, what is its purpose? Does it have meaning, from its perspective, other than to shine and be itself? Probably not. But to 8 billion + humans on earth and 8.7 million **species** of plants and animals, the sun creates the conditions for survival! (and for fantastic sunny days on the lake.)
  

  
What about a tree? It may not think it has a purpose. It simply grows, consumes sunlight, withstands the wind occasionally, absorbs nutrients from the ground, produces fruits, nuts or flowers, and that's it. But to humans, it provides critical shade and something to climb; to birds, it offers shelter from prey and a place to build a nest; and to squirrels, it provides nuts to feed on and a playground to scurry away from ravenous dogs. 
  

  
You may not feel your purpose or life's meaning now, but to others who rely on or will one day rely on you for guidance, love, and support or to feel like they are making a difference in the world, you are critically important. 
  

  
You must be who you are and only that. As numerous people have described below, finding what you love to do is your purpose because that is a part of who you are that nobody can take away from you. Maybe your interest in chemistry will change the world forever, or you'll become a teacher to someone who will.
  

  
God only knows your potential here on earth. But who are you to decide that you might as well not try?
  

  
It's great to see you've progressed so quickly. I urge you to continue searching for what makes you light up and nourish your mind with nutritious foods, consistent movement, and adequate sleep, as those are critical in optimizing our brain and mental function, which correlates with meaning and purpose in the world.
  

  
May you live in peace and growth.

Everyday is just the same. I wake up, Eat, play video games, sleep and that's about it. I missed the times when gaming made me happy but now I just do it to pass time and not be bored because I don't have the motivation to do anything else. I enjoy cooking and I want to try other hobbies such as gardening, cross stitch, embroider and Many more but my parents don't support me and I don't have the money. Idk felt like just sharing. I hope that I can find a hobby that I can be happy in. The kind of hobby that makes me want to get up in the morning and appreciate life.

"You do have the ""want"" of doing the hobbies you personally like, you just lack the initial motivation to jump start you... and the money too sorta lol. I see you enjoy some similar hobbies to me, I too can't cook fully yet but I do find that sort of fun in cooking in Minecraft or playing some good cooking games like the Papa Louie series. Gardening isn't expensive if you just start off with potted plants really, you can take cherry tomatoes, peppers or just about anything (cactuses too) and see how you prefer that.

"Honestly man, I’m there with you, every day was the same for me. Be in to work at 3pm be allowed to go home at 2am Monday through Saturday. Sunday was laundry, grocery shopping, cleaning a little, trying to get some sleep to forget about work, rinse and repeat. However I dealt with a lot of shit from jealous coworkers because I was training for career advancement. Ultimately I got fired missed too many days due to mental health. At first I was freaking out but I started going on nature’s walks and touching grass, watching birds and feeling a taste of the freedom they have, my car got extremely fucked up from negligence while I was working so I’ve been giving her some much needed TLC. It’s been helping me a lot and ultimately getting fired has been the best thing for me. Unfortunately I have to go back to the grind soon because bills don’t wait. 

Point of my story, it’ll come to you at the right time, I want to actually sleep early so I can get up and listen to the birds chirping, I want to wake up early so I continue to detail my car a little at a time and slowly work on upgrading her into what I want. I want to go back into working so I can get out the city and buy a nice house on the outskirts of a small town so I have that nature I need. It took for a good 10 years of a miserable life as an addict, gamer, drug dealer, wage slave, that friend who was just a resource, etc to finally see what really brings my soul to life. Nature and my car. 

Go on a walk clear your head meditate a little, don’t touch your console for more than 2 hours a day. Get a basic job for a few months, then go to another get some skills play the field a little. I know it’s discouraging but life is a journey and this journey we all have to find our own way in this chaotic wilderness.

"Greetings.

Happiness is generally obtained when a human being has a productive lifestyle that keeps producing something progressive. When there is something progressive, there is a sense of reward and motivation to go forward.

For children, happiness is relatively easy, because their physical bodies are growing. They physically can experience growth. So even if all they do is eating, sleeping and playing, as long as they aren't abused, they are easily happy.

But once children have grown mature enough that the progress of physical body has slowed down, even stopped, the progress must come from other places. For example, achievements from learning something difficult and overcome that difficulty. The progress is more on the mental emotional side than the physical side. Of course, even mature bodies can be further perfected through physical training, and workout has been quite popular for this reason.

The general tendency of happiness is, **the younger a human being is, the more happiness is a given. The older a human being grows, the more happiness must come from some kind of choice.** ""I choose to learn this new language which is challenging to me"", something like this, would in turn give happiness whenever a milestone is made. 

The gist is, to become happy again, or even happier than before, it is crucial to choose something challenging that requires free will choices.

Health, fortune and wisdom be with you.

I've met people in my job who have done mistakes. I have never ever thought ""oh my, I hope you feel guilty and cry about this"". Never ever. It's so unnecessary. I also think guilt is a feeling you should only allow when it's a good reason to have it - if you cheated on someone, lied about something major, did something bad to someone, guilt is healthy and should be natural. If you just did a small fuck up that didn't really bother anyone and the mistake could be easily fixed, it's kinda pointless to feel guilty about it.

It is all about faith and perspective  really, ""You are what You believe in"" is actually pretty true so just try to believe that whenever you get success you deserved it and when you find yourself wondering whether my success brings other failure or poverty then remind yourself that they have a different journey that they will go one and trust that.

"Thank you for venting. Sharing your feelings it a good way to relive some of that emotional stress. It’s seems very honorable to you that your not opening up to your partner, not wanting to be more of a burden but truth be told, communication is key. Not telling them what’s up with you is probably tiring you and your partner more as they are left to wonder what’s wrong, so I’d start there. Seems like a daunting task but a good partner will support you no matter what. 

A strategy that I use, I like to call it “smallest steps” first, I’d like to found out my blessings. Do a gratitude dump for about 5 mins, then afterward write down one smal task like “do 10 reps of ___” or “do [chore here]” every day, one small talk that can’t take more than 10-15 min. Slowly I’ll build up the intensity of the task and I’ll never forget to look back at how far I’ve come.

"Last week I went to the doctor because of some heavy symptoms that I know were related to burnout or being on the verge of burnout. After a talk with her, she gave me two weeks of medical leave so I had time to work things out and decide what to do. 

I've spent this time at home, trying to rest my mind from work stress and also trying to decide whether I will quit or try to stay and get better in a different way.

My leave is finished this Sunday, and next Monday I'm going back to work. Now I just got a text from my boss, asking if we can meet this week because he wants to talk about the upcoming couple of months and to know about my situation.

I don't know how I feel about the idea of meeting with him, specifically he has been the cause of most of the stress as he's been doing a terrible job at his position.

&#x200B;

Do you guys have any advice on how to approach this situation?"	dahelljumper	post	24.69434553124002	male	White	0.9941471815109253	na	na	na	10	MentalHealthSupport	failed
"I am sorry that you have been going through this and am glad you have been able to get some time off.

On the request from your boss to meet when you are on leave, I would tell him the truth which is that you need the rest of your leave to get into a better place mentally and feel that it would be better for you to wait to speak to him until your leave is over. It's not really appropriate for him to ask you for a meeting when you are on sick leave. With that said, I think handling it delicately is probably best and for that reason I would just politely explain that you are not currently feeling up to it and can talk to him when you go back to work on Monday.

Best of luck."	dahelljumper	reply	na	na	na	0.9941471815109253	strong	no	no	na	MentalHealthSupport	failed

"I relate to your situation and I just wanted to salute you for doing the right thing and taking stress leave. I was in a similar situation a few months ago and eventually became way too burnt out and overwhelmed after multiple years of sole sucking work and pushy bosses that I ended up becoming unable to show up to work and ended up getting fired for it.

Your situation seems complicated and I wish you luck, I'm not exactly sure what the best choice is for you as I'm sure your situation is complicated and I have very little knowledge about everything that's going on. My only recommendation is to maybe speak to the doctor that you saw about this in the first place or possibly to see a psychologist about this situation if possible.

Hang in there and know that at least in my humble opinion, you're doing the right thing by giving yourself time to properly make a decision rather than completely burning out, ghosting and being fired like me.

P.S don't be afraid to ask for more time if that is an option and to let your boss know that you are overwhelmed/stressed and need more time before getting back to work.

Goodluck!"	dahelljumper	reply	na	na	na	0.9941471815109253	weak	strong	no	na	MentalHealthSupport	failed

"I'm sorry for your stress. I know asking for the meeting probably set back the stress meter you where working on depleting. I find myself spiralling with stress when my bosses ask for a meeting. 
 
If your boss the owner of the company? And is there an HR person? 

I would recommend telling your boss that at this time your not ready to meet as you are not in a good mental space however you are open to gave a meeting with him the week after you've come back. That allows you time to think and finalized your decisions. Additionally if there is a HR team you could reach out, they are there for you tell them you troubles- MR.BOSS contacted me while on sick leave sending me on a mental break while still recovering.

"Hi OP. Can you give me advice? I'm in a similar boat except I moved halfway across the country for my job and it's not easy to leave. My car is about to break down and I'm pretty estranged from my old friends. If I quit, I don't know where I'll go. I'm at the point where I've taken a week of leave and it's worse -on leave-. I've started having something like sudden panic attacks of severe depression. My boss is also bad with boundaries and was asking me 200 questions about why I was taking leave before I left.

I work through a contracting agency (but I am stuck in a contract with them I can't break) and when I told them my issues they suggested that it was /me/ and that I would have issues anywhere they placed me. I guess I'm somewhat of a people pleaser, but I've always had bosses who were aware of that fact and helped regulate my work so I didn't take on too much. This one pushes and pushes and pushes and even when I give estimates they ask if it'll be done sooner.

"My husband and I are constantly bored, but neither of us can ever make a choice or initiate an activity, and nothing ever seems interesting. 

It wasn’t always like this. In recent months we’ve gone through A LOT of issues and changes with both our families, traumatic events, and extreme levels of stress. I know that all of this is exacerbating the issues we both already struggle with. 

Being bored is obviously making us more depressed though. And even knowing that, we still just can’t get ourselves to engage in an activity. Not even watching a movie. All we seem able to do is scrolling on our phones, occasionally showing each other a video or a post.  
We have limited income so paid activities are not an option. 

If anyone else deals with this, how do you overcome it? 

Side note: this isn’t a relationship issue, it’s a mental health issue only. We have wonderful communication and an otherwise very healthy relationship. I just need advice on how we can actually make choices and try and overcome constant boredom."	captnblood217	post	44.70267158040268	female	White	0.9988904595375061	na	na	na	7	MentalHealthSupport	failed
"That's a tough one; I get the same way and don't generally cope well. If I were advising myself, I would tell me to go to nearby parks and take walks. Make it a regular thing. Nature usually makes me happy and walks are great exercise to clear up mental ick. 

Maybe take a trip to dollar tree and see what kinds of coloring or puzzle books you can find? Something very simple that doesn't take much skill or effort (unless a challenge is what gets you going).

After a while it did become interesting and pleasant again. But it was hard to pick up and do it and put the effort into it because I really had no interest in anything from depression! It's not easy by any means but know you have the strength and you can do it! 

Also remember to give yourself some slack.

"since you're already reading on your phone, maybe try reading a book? or research a post/video that interests you so you actually spend time on it and don't just skip by it after looking at it. 

you could create a ladder of activities that are gradually more engaging and try to work your way up, e.g scrolling online, reading, movie, video/board game, doodling, whatever order you think is right. keep the items needed to complete the activity in a place you'll see it a lot.

whenever you get up to use the bathroom or get food, this is the opportunity to do something like go outside or doing a chore while listening to music. your body/mind is still in the reactive and dissociative state to your traumatic events, so doing things that keep you in the present will be very uncomfortable but necessary to remind yourself you're not in the past anymore. it only needs to a be a minute, then you can build up"	captnblood217	reply	na	na	na	0.9988904595375061	no	no	no	na	MentalHealthSupport	failed

Just can’t shake off this overwhelming feeling of being super super lonely here in my flat this isn’t sustainable at all.

"Asking them to hang out might be nice. A simple thing such as a phone call to discuss something unrelated to how your mentally doing it a nice way too. You’ll probably notice that if they aren’t in a rush and aren’t the 2min caller kinda guy that they do care about you. You also have to remember that you gotta care about you too. You need to find validation in yourself before finding it in others. Remember your oldest friends. They probably would’ve drifted away by now if they truly didn’t care.

"Definitely reach out to people, but in a casual/friendly way. Just asking people to hang out, or maybe throwing a party could help! I have a friend who does movie nights at her place where we watch bad movies and make fun of them; it's never for any special occasion or anything. Maybe you could do that?

If it can be helped, try not to make a broad post about being lonely on social media. It's much more effective/genuine to personally message/call folks, because instead of them seeing a post and thinking that you're just lonely and want anybody's company, they'd see that you made an effort to contact them and want to spend time with them specifically, which would make them more inclined to see you. 

Also, don't make the contact or invitation about ""I'm lonely/sad"", because that kind of puts a subtle pressure on them to resolve said feeling, and makes them feel more like they're taking on a sort of responsibility rather than just socializing. If you approach it like a person who just wants to hang out or enjoy their company, the vibe will be more positive and fun, which I think is more beneficial to everyone involved.

One thing ive learned about mental illness is that when you overcome it and the horrible thoughts stop coming, you find yourself thanking the universe that you didnt act on those thoughts, because the thoughts are a product of illness, and they were never “you” to begin with. What I’m saying is fight overcome whatever it is youre dealing with, and try professional help. They are much more understanding than you might expect them to be. Don’t act on these thoughts, it will make things much worse and right now youre still able to save yourself.

Step 1, find a therapist ASAP. School counselor. Anyone nearby that you can get a hold of quickly. If you trust your family, ask them to help you find one.


Step 2, If the therapist doesn't ask you the usual questions (they should - specifically about suicide or homicide), be clear that you're having thoughts of hurting others and you need help.


Step 3, do what they say and answer their questions. They will help you in the right direction to figure out what's going on.

"These people on line with secret crushes are dangerous because a person can get hurt by all this crush stuff.
If someone had a crush on me and I have never met them or know them.  I would think it's weird to think they should ask me out when I don't even know them?

One guy a long time ago asked me out. I didn't want to date him.  I went out.  I am not exactly attracted to him.  But he said to me he's hearing from God.

Why would God set you up with someone you aren't even attracted to in the first place?  Would God force you to go out with someone you know, and you don't feel the chemistry is not right?

It's weird that I'm was attracted to mostly non Christian guys.  One was a real Hottie, but he was a jerk and wasn't too smart.  That made me realize I wanted someone with something upstairs

I like guys from BC because my cousins were nice guys and my favorite.   I haven't met my cousins from the USA.  They are spread out, but my dad's oldest brother married an American woman.  I want to meet my cousin Micheal.

I love that name, and I wanted to have a child by that name, but some things get screwed up.  That's that life, right?

"Well that's wrong.  There's lots of guys I liked and I got turned down by them.  I didn't hate them because there was no chemistry.

I think people can have an attachment to someone and it could be a demon.  There was a guy I had a crush on and I discovered two things.

But this was in person not the internet.

1. After I found out he was involved with someone.  I thought was he best suited for her.  Yes he was.

He did some weird things that put me off like going into empty haunted homes.  I thought that's creepy.

2. It definitely had to be a spirit because it certainly wasn't something I wanted to walk into.  

I think people can think they are attracted or the want someone but they have to look at why?

Why do they like that person so much?  Do they even know or have met that person in person.

Then you have to look at who are your friends and what do they want?

Well I had a whole bunch of so called friends who accused me of being codependent.

The truth is I was trying to make close friends but since that was not possible. The can go fly a kite.
I wouldn't invite them back if they were the the last people on earth 

For the most part they interfered and secondly I had to find out on my own that he was not my type to begin with.  He was a creepy guy.

Lots of those types in the church.  This guy can do the creepiest looks.  I would never been attracted to that.  Especially if he looked like a serial killer.

So I said to him.  She is going to date other guys and she may get married.  How long will it take you to realize she's not interested in you. You could spend a lifetime still obsessed and other women you have never met or dated they have been passed by.

"I have been blessed with the ability to freak myself right the F\*$& out whenever i think about a host of different topics... anxiety. Now most of these topics ive been able to find categories for, and address in that way, by learning about those things, bettering my understanding of them, and really evaluating exactly what it is that im afraid of. For example, i am a hypochondriac, i  have lived with health anxiety for as long as i can remember, but its very easy to find out what health anxiety is, you can easily find other peoples experiences, common coping mechanisms, potential causes for this anxiety, etc. This is the case with almost anything i find myself consistently anxious about.

Now,

One of the darkest corners in my mind that i try to stay out of as much as possible, is one that i cant get a lot of information on, and because of this, i don't know how to move forward in addressing this.

This anxiety / fear is triggered by thoughts of existence, reality, the thought of consciousness... trying to wrap my mind around what it is that I'm experiencing just by being alive in the first place. A good example thought of this would be this: 

Whether you are reading this on a computer or phone or tablet... stop and take a second to think about what is between your eyes reading this, and the screen Infront of you, now i don't mean the air, pollen, dust, particles etc. that occupies that space, but the f#$%ing space itself. How? why is that there? what is that occupying? how did it get there?

I experience symptoms of derealization / depersonalization disorder that I've observed are closely related to my thoughts like this, Hell I believed when I was 17 until 20 I was falling into psychosis due to my relentless obsessing over the unanswerable. Its not even one specific mind-F#$\* that does this to me, it's the combination of all of them that represent what we call ""reality"" or ""existence"" that i cant tune out, and the more i try to research these things in my life, the more questions that are left unanswered. i can barely hold conversations with people because of how often i just go blank, returning to being consumed with mulling these things over, IN THE MIDDLE OF CONVERSATIONS.

I feel like most people are able to just curb these thoughts as ""unimportant"" or just set them aside because there's no way to answer things like that at the moment. Boy do i wish i could do just that. Thoughts like this are 25/8 on my mind, I mean I DREAM about inexplicable things that could never be answered, and i wake up, open my eyes and wonder what is this plane of existence that I'm experiencing? how do i retain my persona, my memories, my trains of thought, all of my experiences after so many years? How do i face any interaction, any experience, any leaf that lands Infront of me on a walk without my mind jumping to the probability of these things happening? And then wondering how I'm even able to question that in the first place?

This has not been a mid-life crisis, rather it has been a whole-life drain. I have never been afraid of the 18 wheeler next to me on the freeway, yet i have always been afraid of the inevitable heat death of the universe.

Please take this into consideration!

While no one can diagnose you, what you're describing absolutely sounds like OCD. OCD *is not* the ""hand washing disorder,"" and you don't have to be clean or want things to be symmetrical to have OCD. That's not what it's about.

OCD can take on *many* different forms, and a very common example of that is obsessing over existence itself.

According to the [International OCD Foundation,](https://iocdf.org/expert-opinions/to-be-or-not-to-be-that-is-the-obsession-existential-and-philosophical-ocd/#:~:text=Existential%20OCD%20involves%20intrusive%2C%20repetitive,or%20even%20one's%20own%20existence.)

>**Existential OCD involves intrusive, repetitive thinking about questions which cannot possibly be answered**, and which may be philosophical or frightening in nature, or both. The questions usually revolve around the meaning, purpose, or reality of life, or the existence of the universe or even one’s own existence. These same questions might come up in a university philosophy or physics class.  However, *most people can leave such classes or read about these topics and move on to other thoughts afterwards*. Similar to other forms of OCD, **individuals with Existential OCD can’t just drop these questions**.

I suggest checking out the website I linked you too, as well as [NOCD](https://www.treatmyocd.com/what-is-ocd). If you want to view things here on Reddit, I suggest r/OCDRecovery.

"OCD and Generalised Anxiety sound like the most likely candidates from what you've written. I have mild OCD (it's not as bad as it used to be, as I used to have to check that I'd locked my door exactly 3 times) and at best mild generalised anxiety disorder and experience periods of disassociation. I also have ADHD and CPTSD.

I'm taking Prozac, Klonopin (as needed for acute anxiety), and Vyvanse for the ADHD. Taking these meds helps me (chemically) take a step back and examine my world and then figure out how to deal with the situations that are making me uncomfortable and feel unhealthy. You really need to put together a care team to support you, surround yourself with people who make you feel safe, and work with a therapist (talk therapy and/or a psychiatrist for meds, or a nurse - I have a psychiatric nurse I see every 3 mos or so to prescribe my meds) who deals with OCD and Anxiety."	4-8-15-16_23-42	reply	na	na	na	0.9898114204406738	no	strong	no	na	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.
"I understand this.  it seems to me you obsessively go down rabbit holes.  I also suffered with this and there is no answer to any of it.  When you do this, it gets darker and darker, and more hopeless so that you question the very existence of reality.  First and hardest to accept, is 1. everything is as it is and then 2. practice mindfulness (all you have is this moment - what can you taste, feel, smell etc.).  Learn just to accept.  When you swim against the tide, you are more likely to drown.  Watch something funny when you go ""dark"", allow yourself to cry.  This type of anxiety can be found in grief and loss, PTSD, depression, being isolated, and much more.  Please try to cherish every moment, and just 'be'.  Gratitude helps.  Self-care does too.  Thank-you for sharing and know you are not alone.  This also may help: the past is history and the future a mystery.  Try avoid what I call 'looping'.  I hear you!  Take care of you.

Hey I really sympathize with you. I go thru some of the exact things your going thru. It's gotten worse with time.im not the same person I was in highschool. That person is lost or just gone. I have agoraphobia Wich is pretty much being afraid to leave my house, afraid to leave my room and terrible anxiety. I over think the smallest things things that the old me would have given no thought to. I find myself being a people pleaser just so I can get out of the conversation. When I run into someone I know unexpectedly I absolutely panic. I can hear them talking to me but I can't comprehend or hold a normal conversation bc my mind is going all over the place. I absolutely hate it bc these are ppl I went to school with and was good friends with. How can I not just function normally in a quick conversation with someone I haven't seen in years. I immediately feel the need to flee. Then when I actually calm down and get my barrings together, all of the things I wanted to say to that person come flooding in. How can I not know what to say after not seeing a friend for a decade? There's so much to say and talk about. I feel that everyone must think I'm a weirdo. I feel like I'm not important enough for them to care about what I have to say..I realize that it's all In my mind and they do want to hear from me. I just can't bare the way I feel and act when I'm stuck in those situations so I just pretend like I didn't see them even though they were coming up to say hello. I must come off like a selfish asshole. But it's the total opposite, I want to reminisce with the ppl from my past and be normal in everyday situations but it's just too much to bare. I also get panic attacks when my phone rings so I end up never answering my phone bc I'm so shook from my phone just ringing. All the sudden I'm 38  years old and Im afraid to go out in public. I go to a doctor for medicine and I get terrible anxiety and racing thoughts while I'm seeing my doctor. I wish I could explain how I feel but it never comes out the right way..I have to write down everything before hand then read it to him..I start reading it to him and within 10 seconds he  just shuts it down. I also have terrible sleep paralysis and demonic dreams..so I can't even relax when I sleep. I'm just a shell of my former self. I feel like I'm cursed or something. I really think it's possible bc I see crazy things in pictures on my phone. Im just waiting to be taken by whatever these things are when it's my time to go... all I can do is pray to my God for comfort and protection and clarity to my crazy life..it's hard to feel better when nothing makes me happy.its just constant despair and guilt..I have to keep fighting and take it one minute at a time. I want to tell anyone that is suffering with mental health issues to never give up.keep fighting. We can't let our overactive minds take us over. Let go of the guilt and despair.

I have been going through this experience for the past two weeks where i am questioning why i am alive now. Why me and not someone else, somewhere else, and why at this point in time and not before or later. I cry myself to sleep, i tune out during conversations and dread being alone because I’m scared that these thoughts will pop up and ruin my day as I cant seem to let them go. I understand that I needed to experience life at some point, in some way or another. And that I can only be me and my life could end at any moment. I try to position myself in others peoples eyes and their very being, and try to imagine what they’re seeing and feeling. It eats me up. And it is constant dread, and fear of the inevitable, my end. I guess in a way, its the fear of death itself and what comes after, where life goes on without you.	4-8-15-16_23-42	reply	na	na	na	0.9898114204406738	no	strong	no	na	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.

"Hi all, never posted on this app before so please bear with me. I am a 25 year old (F) married with two kids. Large amount of bills, expenses and debt. 
My mental health has not been great. Anxiety seems to be the worst and diagnosed with mixed anxiety and depressive disorder. At work my anxiety translates to stress. I am in a senior trainee position. I got pulled up a few times by my manager just setting procedures straight. No disciplinary actions at first but then I had one. It broke me, I had possibly done something wrong. I haven’t seen the paper work but essentially it was pinned on me and I had to get on with it. Wether it was my fault or not I have no idea. No I feel stressed, nervous for my next interaction. We have a work group chat of all staff and all day it’s pinging telling people what needs to be done and threatening actions. I work in healthcare so we are just striving for best care here… but it’s a lot. No one does any right they feel (as I’m not the only one), we get absolute zero praise. So all I’m judged is for my failures. No one notices the good. The hours and time I put into providing above and beyond care. I struggle at home, I cry a lot. I’m doing my nursing in September and worried  this is the toxic industry. 
Any way, I told my GP my feelings specifically that I don’t feel like I want to be here any more (also said I don’t have a plan I’m not at that stage, but I don’t enjoy life anymore) so I got signed off for three weeks. 

Now I’m dreading going back. This is my third job in 6 months. All because I can’t handle the stress.

I used to take Lexapro, but I ended up getting about every side effect possible. I felt better (not suicidal), but I was at a 3 or 4 put of 10 most days. I felt numb. I didn't get excited about anything. My libido basically died.

Then I switched to a few others. Trazodone, which I take at night to help with sleeplessness/depression, and Wellbutrin/buproprion and buspirone.

I hate to say it, but weed does make me feel better. I get out of my head, relax and laugh more, but it kills my motivation to do mostly anything.

Medication is unique for everyone. Something that works great for me, might not be your best option. However, for me personally, antidepressants tend to cause me a lot of weight gain.. especially Latuda. - I gained 50 pounds on that shit in just 3 months!

"First off I’m so sorry to hear that :( depression is hard on everyone involved and I can’t imagine being on the other side and watching my lover struggle

Part of the problem that goes unrecognized is people have to WANT to be better. As strange as it might sound, people sometimes find comfort in their depression and get used to that lifestyle and it can be hard to pull yourself out if it if you have no motivation. Just be as supportive as you can and try to steer him in the right direction to hobbies, activities, vacations etc to give him something to look forward to every day. I personally really struggled because I fell victim to this problem and it took me months to find the right coping mechanisms, but just taking it day by day and thinking “well tomorrow I get to go to a concert” or “tomorrow I can go on a 15 minute walk” slowly helped

Another thing is it can unfortunately take YEARS to find the right medicinal cocktail that works for someone. I was lucky enough that we got it right the second try, but my sister on the other hand was not. It took her a good 7 years to find what worked for her (ketamine treatments) and it was quite the battle, but what matters most is she’s happy now and she’s in a good place so that war was worth it

Just try to be as supportive and empathetic as possible. I truly hope you both find a way to get better together❤️"	Western-Bed7620	reply	na	na	na	0.9354169964790344	strong	strong	no	na	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.

I dont want to think about it anymore but it just keeps getting to me. I got out of a relationship but there is this one thing that really got to me during that relationship. My ex was always on the computer. Wanting to play video games and chat with online friends that they made. I could always tell that their mind was always on the computer. I was only convenient when their friends where too busy to be online to talk and play. It really broke my heart. Even if we had free time and didn’t plan anything, they would just play video games by themselves if their friends weren’t online. Even though we aren’t together, just remembering and thinking about it gives me so much anxiety and stress that I can’t move on. I feel disregarded.	ohsawa	post	28.726944462800713	male	White	0.998660683631897	na	na	na	3	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.
i know the feeling as my ex was like this. always infront of that computer talking to his mates online or to his self. even after breaking up i know all he was doing was playing on his computer. but as time has gotten on, i look back and see it wasnt right because if that person cared as much they wouldnt be glued to it 24/7. you havent done anything wrong and you have to tell your self and remind your self it wasnt you or your fault. it does take time but you will find someone better and you'll back and think you feel sorry for him because he his wasting life behind a screen. you want to surround yourself with people who care and adore you and want to live your life. life is too short and someone better will come along. takes time but you will see in time that it was for the best and that you deserve better because you are human. you did the right thing as i did in my relationship. hope this helps in any way.	ohsawa	reply	na	na	na	0.998660683631897	weak	strong	no	na	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.

"The world is competitive and has been like this for centuries. You have to compete with everyone else to win & survive, be it for food or money or job or business or anything. 

I often think about the consequences of my actions. 
I think because of me winning or doing well stops others from winning or achieving their success. 
Just like in a job interview how you have to compete with everyone else for that job & once you secure the job others don't get it.

Doesn't my success bring others failures?

My personal growth, glory & success is built on others failing because of me & because of my actions.

I (20M) have for the past 2 months been seeing a CBT therapists after struggling with mental health and depression for the last 3 years. A point that irked me was that I never could pinpoint the cause of my mental deterioration, so I assumed that my condition was just a result of an accumalation of bad experiences and circumstances in my later life. I have one week of therapy left until i am given the choice to end/contine/intensify therapy, and Ive lately been disheartened by how little they have helped. Something I never discussed with my therapist was that I believe I was sexually assaulted at age 6 by my cousin (11F) back in my home country. As far as I know, no one knows beside me and her, and she seperated from the family a while back as her mother divorced. If they did know, they may have chosen to never tell me in the hope I was too young to remember the event. The memory is so hazy that at times I question if it ever occured. Even then, I like to think of it of had having no effect on my life, but recently the memory has been surfacing more. Ive never looked back on this memory and thought of it as trauma, I have no feelings for the memory at all. But can something that I regarded as so insignificant result in symptoms many years later, or am I merely grasping at any clue to the cause for my depression. I feel sick when thinking of bringing it up to my therapist, Ive never told anyone but a very close friend of it. How vital would this piece of info be to my therapist?	bvgfnab	post	45.2112161000055	female	White	0.9978731870651245	na	na	na	3	MentalHealthSupport	ethnicity: no prediction, age: 20, gender: male, explanation: the author mentions identifying as a 20-year-old male (20m) in the post, but does not provide any clear indicators of ethnicity.

CBT is more present focused and short term.  It explores how changing thoughts and behavior can impact emotions and techniques you can use.  If you have deeper rooted trauma such as abuse it is important to mention it as you may need a different treatment to further address it as it sounds like it is causing significant distress.	bvgfnab	reply	na	na	na	0.9978731870651245	no	no	no	na	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.

"I'm currently doing all my assignments so naturally I'm a little stressed. I feel like this is normal so I shrug it off and continue with life. I'm always hiding my emotions and just doing what I'm told without speaking out. However recently I keep crying my self to sleep.

During these nights I think about who cares about me, I do so much for people but don't feel recognised and if I were to die who would cry for me.
I don't think I'm suicidal but I don't know much about mental health. I never want to kill my self but I always think what it would be like and how people would react.

"Ok so probably everyone in this subreddit has Ben where you are right now, I'm guessing your in middle or high school and just starting to feel the stress of the real world, take a deep breath and go talk to a therapist if they are easily accessible where ever you are because hiding these feelings that you don't quite understand what to do with will only make them worse, I'm 33 and I still dont understand why I have some of the emotions I do or how to handle them so like I said age is not a factor but hiding these feelings and trying to ignore them will only make it worse.

I feel like killing myself all the time, and honestly that's ok as long as you don't dwell on those thoughts for long, its a warning sign that you need to seek out help but its not the end of the world most therapists wont be concerned until you start planning how to kill yourself because its a thought that comes across mentally healthy peoples mind all the time, they just dont dwell on those feelings for long because they have developed tools to keep themselves uplifted instead of putting themselves down for feeling like that.

talk to close friends for support, seek a therapist to help learn tools and tactics to help control your thought process and you will be right as rain in no time =)"	soda-Doc	reply	na	na	na	0.99394291639328	weak	no	no	na	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.

"I find that when I do exercise, I tend to feel better emotionally/mentally the next day. 

The issue I run into is having the motivation and willpower to actually get myself to exercise. While knowing that I will feel better, some days it still seems impossible to do. Other days it’s easier. If you can, an exercise partner helps a lot as well so you don’t have to do it alone and they can give you that extra push. 

I definitely feel like more people should try to incorporate exercise into their treatment and management plan. It helps because of the chemicals it releases while actively exercising, and for a bit after. Regular exercise would be ideal, but it’s just as good to only exercise when you can get yourself to do it. 

I feel like a lot of people think you have to go to a gym to exercise, but you don’t. There’s more equipment available there yes, but you don’t need it. YouTube has plenty of at-home exercise routine videos. You could also just go for a walk in a pretty area.

"Yes, it helps everything. Scientifically, your body releases more happy chemicals into your body/brain when you regularly work out. It makes a difference with your mental health since you're accomplishing something every time you work out and you'll start to look better (in time).

You'll have the distraction of researching new exercises and workout routines. There will be less time sitting and thinking and being sad because you'll be out of the house. Your mind will shift from mental anguish to physcial aches, which is so much better.

Once you start seeing results, you'll feel pride in yourself for doing all this consistent, hard work.

If you have no clue where to start, join a group fitness class with an instructor, like pilates (core strength/abs), yoga, spin classes, HIIT classes/gyms, and stuff like that.

I generally avoid people that seem obsessive or addicted to exercising.

"So I have sever anxiety and I try to manage it as possible as I can. Few years ago, I heard an ambulance and i got so anxious that I felt the sound stuck in my head. It was very scary but eventually I moved on. Now, a few days ago, I moved to a new place in the center and I hear a lot of sirens. Since its a trigger for me, yesterday night I had a huge panic attack because I thought I heard the sirens when I knew there was nothing.

"I can somewhat relate as I have auditory hallucinations pretty regularly. Mine are usually an alarm going off (for my meds or perhaps a car alarm outside) but sometimes I hear genuine voices or animal sounds. In times of intense anxiety I also have visual hallucinations. These are usually in the form of some small animal under my feet or in my peripheral vision (I've worked very closely with animals most of my life). 

The thing I have to keep in mind is that I am aware these things happen, I know it's part of abnormal neural activity, and I know I am atypical mentally. I know it'll go away and I just have to find a way to calm myself down (like breathing, finding a hands-on task, or eating/drinking something sweet).

Go to the emergency room and tell them everything and I'll tell you whats going to happen given that you are in the USA.

If they cant find anything wrong with you they will send you to a mental health facility where you will be able to check out WHENEVER you desire, dont worry about all the horror stories you have herd about them there arw different levels of mental health care in the US and they will put you with people that are facing simaler issues as you are facing.

I also switched to smoothies mostly. I’ve dropped like 25 lbs and am trying to maintain now, but it’s really messed up my strength, balance, etc. 

I saw my doctor and she ran lab, and found me to be vitamin D deficient which I guess some research shows has more pronounced mental and physical side effects in post COVID/long COVID patients. She also suggested I try something called scent training to try to build up my brain/body connection for scents to restart my appetite. I haven’t lost my sense of taste or smell, I just don’t like anything as much so I don’t know if it’ll work for me but there’s no down side to spending some time smelling pleasing scented oils for 2 minutes once or twice a day.

I'm so sorry you are going through all of this.  Calling people names and cussing is abuse.  Why did your mum get kicked out?  How was this your fault?  I don't know you or your mental health issues, but I'm assuming you lack self-worth.  You are not to blame.  Sometimes things happen that are out of our control.  If the house does get bought, I hope you find somewhere else to live, but look at it as a new opportunity, a new beginning.  And know this - you are enough, and you deserve love, and to be treated with respect and dignity.  All the best, sweetheart and love.

"Okay so there's a lot for me to go through here, and I have to apologise as it is hard for me to explain things as it's hard for me to even understand what's going on in my brain!

I've been with my partner now coming up to 2 years in May, wonderful healthy relationship where there are no issues whatsoever, I'll preface this by saying I have struggled with mental health on and off throughout my life, mainly being anxiety so I have been on Fluoxetine (anti depressants) for the last 2 years, this has been great for me and has helped me to regulate my emotions and feelings quite well and to what I believe has helped my relationship with my partner to flourish and I have felt genuinely happy.

Anyway, cutting to now... Since the very (very) start of the year, just after new years... (obviously) I noticed a lot of anxiety... although it may of been creeping in a few weeks before, It was as though now I felt it full blast, and my inner voice kept telling me that my boyfriend was interested in someone else, and I was then getting strong feelings of them cheating although there was no indication of this, I think on new years eve I had noticed my boyfriend getting on well with his mates and watching one of his friends who is a girl sing (he's a musician and i know the following sounds daft, believe me) so the next day I kept getting intrusive thoughts of that moment and feeling very sensitive around it, as I'm quite insecure and never sing and I know my boyfriend would love it if I came out my shell more in that way (although he's always telling me how perfect I am) It kept going through my mind that he should be with someone like that...

fast forward a few days, I'm still feeling VERY on edge and feel incredibly anxious when my boyfriend isn't really showing me that much affection, or is in his room for long periods of time... I get very panicky and can't seem to calm myself until I go upstairs to see what he's up to, if he's just sat there on his phone with his door shut I assume that he's not wanting to be with me (even though I think having our own space is healthy and have never had an issue with it before) after seeing him just sat there I'll get incredibly upset and more anxious and feel very emotional, may even start crying and it's difficult to stop, I suddenly view my boyfriend very differently?

I'll also mention now that I was never like this at any other point of our relationship, I just started feeling this intense anxiety since new years, also I'll mention that I'm a very sensitive person and feel as though I pick up on other peoples emotions very easily and that I do that a lot with my boyfriend if he is feeling down about himself etc, I also feel these emotions.

As the days went on I stopped getting these anxious feelings when he wasn't always around, but still felt bad anxiety and feeling depression creeping in, as the days progressed I noticed myself becoming more sensitive to things and even hyperaware? (think that's the word) which would cause more anxiety for me, my boyfriend may say something and I would take it in a negative way and feel offended by it and it would cause a lot of hurt and then anxiety is even worse... I would have a lot of moments of just emotional outbursts of crying and finding it difficult to stop just feeling very overwhelmed and so uncomfortable in how i'm feeling, even gagging from what felt like stress and not being able to eat (I'm feeling this pretty much everyday)

the past month and a bit I've been having internal thoughts such as ""I don't love you"" and other horrible things directed at my boyfriend which cause me so much anxiety and even more stress as I try to convince myself they are just thoughts and not real, having suddenly no feelings towards him? getting irritated at little things but still feeling intensely sad over the thought of him with someone else, this person is perfect in my eyes and I love all the things about them that are considered imperfections, where have my feelings gone? It's been over a month and I'm scared they won't return because I know this relationship when I'm not feeling this way, is so good for me and has been the best thing for my life.

I'll quickly mention that I'm 23 now and had a relationship when I was 14 that brought a lot of the very same feelings up but this happened very early on in the relationship (a month or so) with much breaking up and getting back together due to my anxiety and depression.

I'm sorry for the essay but it's really hard to fit everything in, but this is just the summary of it...

Please can I get real responses with this, I really want to make this relationship work and stop this anxiety and emotional stress and be able to feel these feelings again for my partner... I'd hate to think that it's over now."	Jealous_Demand	post	23.441411027231982	female	White	0.010696632787585258	na	na	na	1	MentalHealthSupport	failed
"hi there,
i can kinda relate to this because i felt like this with my ex. before xmas we broke up and then got back together but it wasnt the same. over xmas and new years i started to feel like he lost intersts in me and i started to feel more insecure in myself and having dreams he was cheating on me which is a sign of insecurity in yourself. i would get very emotional and if he was on the phone i would want to know who hes talking to or if we wasnt in the same room i would check to see if hes ok or what hes upto cause i was worried he was going behind my back or if i wasnt with him i would be constantly worried he was with someone else or talking to someone else. even tried talking to him and he wouldnt like it so it would get worse and worse and creeping up more and more. we're not together now because of me being too intense but looking back now, it was him in the relationship and how he would treat me. i would suggest everything to fix it but he wasnt willing to and i realised looking back i didnt love him as much because he wasnt supportive with my insecurity or help it. there's different ways to work on this. you could bring up the conversation on how your feeling with everything and ask how to both resolve it as a couple, could suggest couples therapy because they can help as well. i know it can be exspensive but if you maybe google ways to reconnect and try them it might help? maybe a little trip away for you both and not have any contact but with eachother which might bring you both close together. maybe therapy just for yourself so you can talk to someone who doesnt know you and your partner. if hes right and perfect in your eyes i would try everything and having the conversation with him. if he feels the same about you, he would be understanding and will help you. i hope some of this info has helped in anyway. i hope all the best!!"

"Melatonin supplements for sleep, its a natural hormone our bodies produce to help us get into rem sleep and stay there longer, you will be amazed how much a good nights rest will do for your mental fortitude.

so what if your cloths pile up for a few days it takes just as much time to do them every day then it dose in picking one day to do it all for the week.

Going out for take out is just as cheap as cooking now days and in some cases can be healthier then the food your already eating so stop cooking a few nights a week.

How often do you clean your house? Try picking one day to do all the cleaning a month, dishes and counters are the only thing you probably need to worry about daily but if your getting take out your dishes are going to be disposable.

when they say you need to take it easy they mean you need to rethink the way you do things so you can relax more often they arent telling you to put off things indefenatly, humans don't do well with constant pressure and will eventually snap if they try to keep it up.

"Sorry for not replying sooner, thank you for the advice it really is appreciated <3 
I have tried melatonin previously and it definitely did help relax me and help me sleep, I will order some more actually and make sure I take it! 

I do have a partner but they work very long days so I take on most of the home stuff that needs to be done. They do help me where they can and when I ask for extra assistance with things though.

Unfortunately I dont have many healthy options where I live in the way of take out however we did buy an air fryer recently so I am now able to cook a lot of things that are quick, somewhat healthy and less messy for me which has been really good!

"Hello everyone, I just want to be able to breath a little and talk about something I wasn't able to talk about for quite some time now.

I've been struggling with my mental health ever since I can remember, but things took a bad turn the moment I turned 14. I won't get into too many details, but I was having some real self image issues and an unhealthy obssession with being ""beautiful"", along with an unhealthy food relationship.

Fastforward to 16, I fell into the deep dark hole that is called deppression, and gave up on myself entirely-- anxiety became a huge part of my everyday life.

Somehow I managed to pull myself out of there without any help, I couldn't afford therapy due to stigmatization and the misogyny present in my family. However, it all came back after the pandemic-- if it truly left at all, and now at 22 years I could finally get therapy because I got a job! (Not for too long)

I was diagnosed with chronic anxiety (shocking, wow) and depression, but there are so many things I couldn't discuss with my therapist due to the time limit and my venting. 
And I lost that priviledge because I lost my job.

I'm struggling to keep my head up, I went to an interview yesterday, but I'm so scared I won't make it and I have no idea what's going to happen with me from now on, since I'm still in University and I don't have my bachelor diploma which is super important for a graphic designer.

At this point all I do is stare at my phone waiting for a call from my job application, I want to be able to pay my bills and continue living. I'm beyond panicked."	Gatto_19	post	27.009961088538724	female	White	0.9888611435890198	na	na	na	2	MentalHealthSupport	failed
have you try writing down things you do like about yourself? even 3 things what made you smile or what you done that day that you felt proud. its all taken your time and baby steps. if you write down each day whtat made you feel good or what you were proud of that day, it will take the pressure of a bit. even reading it out loud can help as well. also, if you can push yourself to even go on a 10 minute walk, it will helo to calm you down and feel more relax a bit. your putting too much pressure on yourself and you shouldnt have to. you should do what makes you feel calm. if you wanted to write things down what you want to do, even if its small, if you write it down, you can look at it at a later time or when your alot calmer (after your walk maybe?)  and that might help and if you cant do 1 on that list, then leave it and come back to it at another time but atleast if its written down, it might help to clear your mind and put your mind at easy. i hope this helps.

Hey thank you so much for the kind comment! I unfortunately find it very hard to walk alone especially in the city, thus I often retreat back at home in a more rural area or take walks with my partener. The problem with chronic deppression and anxiety is that it deprives you of a normal functioning life so even the simplest task seem like a burden. But yes!

well for starters, for wanting to get help is a good step in the right direction. the best thing you can do to help yourself is to reach out to a therapist who will help you get to the bottom of it and want to help you resolve it. i know its easy said then done but they dont judge and they just want to help but you should be proud of yourself that your doing the right thing and wanting to reach out.

I’ve been mentally abused by my mother in law for years. I live with her. She was watching my youngest about a month ago and thought iMessage  on my iPad, she read my messages of me venting to my mom and friends and her daughter. Now her mistreatment is even worse and she’s victimized herself. The other day I was breastfeeding my son, he’s almost 2. She came in yelling at me and calling me lazy and saying why haven’t I gotten up. I told her because I gave a kid on my boob. Then she started going crazy asking why I’m a smart ass then continued on talking shit about me and my family. I’m at rock bottom right now and her son (my partner) could care less. He says “What did you do” and they both just blame me for everything. I’m hurting so bad. I have no where to go. My family lives 2 hours away from me. I’m lonely and stuck here. I just want to leave. I need help, but I’m having a hard time finding it. I live in Los Angeles, and everything is too expensive. On top of it all, I’m expecting another baby.

"Leave and don't look back unless he moves out of her house, its hard to say but its her house and he was brought up like that, he is NEVER going to see what's wrong with her behavior.

Go to your parents and file for custody QUICKLY that's the key word, establishing what county the custody is going to be in will make matters a lot easier for you, oh and be thankful your a woman because unless your batshit crazy they are gonna let you keep the child, Fathers literally have like no chance of keeping custody when the mother is stable 

I have had put up with the abuse from my girlfriends mother for years because the courts sided with her and it only gets worse because she doesn't view you as good enough for her son just be thankful you have the right genitalia to take the child/children in the eyes of the court.

Sorry if this sounds harsh but after dealing with courts for years just to see my little girls its hard to give that advice knowing what their father will go threw if he loves his kids like I do.

Just keep in mind that if you do this, your child is young enough to forget him and will completely destroy any chance he has to have a real father/child relationship so please if he's good to the kid don't make them suffer, the courts can force the father to not have the mil in the childs life if you request it 

This all happened in CA and laws do differ from state to state but the fact your breast feeding makes it even hard for them to take the child away.

Sorry I know I'm all over the place with this message and I do really mean well so I hope you made it this far, its just hard because of the abuse I went threw and I don't want to be the reason it happens to another father that doesn't deserve it, but if your being abused mentally or physically its not good for the kid as well as yourself and he needs a wake up call

Edit: after reading your previous posts it sounds like he is fucking up a lot more then just letting his mother abuse you and you need to give up on the ""but hes the father of my children"" he can still be the father while you live in separate houses just don't deny him visitation and time he wants to spend with the kids (with in reason) again you NEED to get the courts involved asap and they can restrict access mil has to your kids or father will lose all visitation"	Miss_Mouse13	reply	na	na	na	0.9992526173591614	no	no	no	na	MentalHealthSupport	"ethnicity: no prediction, age: 30-50, gender: male, explanation: the author talks about his personal experiences with regard to custody battles and courts in the context of relationships and children. he mentions ""my girlfriends"" and ""my little girls"", indicating that he is a father himself, which usually implies an adult age. the exact age is hard to determine from this post, but his experiences imply he's at least middle-aged. the post doesn't provide any clear evidence to determine the ethnicity of the author."
I suggest just don't give her much of your energy because whatever she is blaming people for is relevant but she shouldn't call you what you are after having your first baby. I see that you did say some stuff. Just say less that's all and explain to her that you felt bad about it, but didn't want to be involved in too much of her drama. Drama isn't easy to get out of or being accused . Just deal with your children and the next one :) hopefully another son. Would be cute again. You must love your kids. That kind of living environment is toxic and I know it isn't for you but dealing with that woman will stress you out everyday make you depressed to stress to crying again. You care about your guy too.

Ok so take a deep breath, by walking away and still giving him the chance to be in there lives is you being the bigger person, staying in a toxic relationship is a horrible idea because even if you can handle it, your kids are going to grow up thinking that is how a relationship is supposed to be and are going to allow their SO walk all over then too or become the abuser themselves.

The fact that he just changed her name to a males name and tried to play it off means he's still doing it you just haven't been able to catch him again, that's a HUGE reason to leave, I know I'm combing posts but I was worried I was giving advice to someone I shouldn't, but I do think this is what you need to do and unlike my SO you really are a victim that wants the best for her kids

Your worried the courts are gonna take the kids from you don't be, CA is extremely one sided when it comes to custody and that is they gove the children to the mother, the father is the one always fighting a uphill battle so when when I say bat shit crazy I mean just that, how many times have you been committed or had the eyes of the law focused on you? If its been a lot then you MIGHT have a reason to worry but if its few and not recent its nothing to worry about. (I don't need to know this question or any its just something to ask yourself)

When you say your mother can only be someone to hear you out do you mean shes not willing to do more or you don't want to put that burden on her?

Because if you sign up for hud wic and welfare that will cover all yours and the childs cost of living in a apartment, like I said CA favors the mother they will do everything they can to put you up on your feet as a mother fleeing with her kids, the longest you will be a burden on your mother (if she even considers it that) will be 90 days, hud normally has a waiting list but its normally around 3 months

I live in CA and this is what I had to fight against, you don't even need to go to your mothers house go to one safe place and they will put you on the path to doing all this, they used to have a program where they paid for the apt for you and the kids for a full year before making you take over the payments, reach out to welfare for help its there"	Miss_Mouse13	reply	na	na	na	0.9992526173591614	weak	no	no	na	MentalHealthSupport	failed
"I’ve been using this mental health app where you can post entries about your thoughts, moods, and emotions and it’s social so you get to interact with others. I’ve been using it several times a day for years and now it just suddenly stopped working without any warning. 

I feel very panicked and sick from anxiety. 

I also feel very triggered and abandoned and afraid that I will not get to interact with anybody or get any support.

Thank you. I tried searching last night and couldn’t find one. The one I had was a diary where you could post whatever you wanted and it was social so others could respond and you could see what they posted. It was called Moodtrack. I had difficulty finding another one like that. Vent didn’t work. I couldn’t register. It kept giving me an error code. And another one required me to put my id in or a photo of myself. It was too difficult to get registered. I didn’t see any others with a social feature. So far reddit is pretty good. I think I can post on it like the mood app. And it’s social.

Hi, Starry. It's me, dryingpaint. We haven't spoken in a while, but I remembered your reddit username. I figured you'd want to know that another moodtrack user created a subreddit called r/Moodtrack. Maybe some of your old friends will find their way there. Sadly, the app hadn't been maintained or updated for years. I'm pretty sure it's been abandoned. It sucks losing your support network like that. Just know the issue isn't on your end, and we're all stranded now.

Hi, we don’t tend to talk about ages that much but it’s definitely mostly adults as people are discussing their lives with kids, jobs, mortgages etc. There are a few kids at school using the app that I know of but it’s generally a pretty mature space I think. The younger people seem quite sensible anyway, just dealing with many of the same issues as the rest of us. You can follow and unfollow who you like though rather than viewing the ‘everyone’ feed and that’s what a lot of us do I think. I got to know people through the everyone  tab but mostly just chat to people I know now. It’s really as social as you want to make it. I think there are still two versions of the app, one which allows you to keep some posts private and one which doesn’t.	starry_eve2	reply	na	na	na	0.9991445541381836	no	no	no	na	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.

I can understand your feelings. I may have gotten to that point myself but I guess my own mental health has caused my wife to leave me. I always tried to put her mental health first because I want her to have a happy life. But the constant back and forth cycles and sacrificing my own ability to have therapy or be on medication so that she could, ran a toll. My undiagnosed depression started causing issues and it ultimately lead to her leaving. Im trying to move past and let her have her life but it's hard. I always imagined us having a happy life together and when I finally got the treatment I needed and therapy, she decided everything was to much. After I had stayed with her for years thru some awfully terrible times...so I can understand where you are coming from. It might just be best for you to leave, as hard as that may be.

This is just my opinion who was in a similar relationship once upon a time. She would use stuff like that to get her way or to control situations. She has learned that a lot of people will cater to someone that threatens them selves with bodily harm. Especially if we love that person.

"Sounds like you're maybe depressed. I've lost my ""zest for life"" for lack of a better phrasing, too. Its been about 8 months since i left my job to take a mental health break and i encountered the problem that... even now, with all the time in the world on my hands, I'm still sad, depressed, exhausted... then I realized it was mostly my depression talking. MAYBE it's not this way for you but just in case it is...


I learned from my old powerlifting coach a really basic saying but I kinda get it now... the saying that when one door closes another opens? Yeah it kinda works, at least for me. I can't paint anymore, and I'm sad about it. I used to power lift, I physically can't but mentally struggle getting in the gym anymore.


 So I started looking for alternatives. Other ""open doors"" that I could do, that felt easier. Currently, I take myself on 2 walks a day. Make sure I feel air on my skin. And in the afternoons I follow along with a yoga video, usually for whatever body area feels most painful or tightest (usually my back or neck area). In between I do ""necessary"" things with the help of a cleaning app (Tody is the name if you're curious) and take care of that until I become bored or my back hurts or I get sad. I play podcasts while I do things to fill the silence. I go to therapy weekly and I dogsit for 2 low maintenance dogs via Rover for extra cash. If I feel good, I may end up in the gym but do easy stuff like sit on the bike. I use an app on my phone to track my food (Cronometer) and make sure I hit all my macros. If I feel anxious or sad or anything other than baseline emotions, I drink a big glass of water. Or hot tea if water feels boring. Or Sparkling water to ""wake my mouth up.""

I often think about the consequences of my actions.

You are absolutely ok my friend. You mind is overthinking. So here is the problem .MIND. you have to work on it. Dont let ur mind dominate your body. Practice every moment is inevitable and this is totally upto you how and in which direction you want to take this very life which you have fortunately got as a human being .dont let this mind bring nasty thoughts in you. I advise you to close your eyes and just consciously focus on your breath. Feel the life in you. How incredible it is. Lets not waste it and try to live it consciously. Practice some meditation . I did the same for me . It didt work initialy but gradually i felt joyful more cheerful. Feel positive around you. Stay away from things which bother you. For an instance when we sit in on a earthy ground and we get up we clean ourselve , we shake our pants and clean the mud n grass stick on our clothes same like that if ny thought bothers you jus shake ur self at that moment and jus remove the thought and clean ur mind and go ahead 🙂.it will definately work .only thing is you have to practice .

"I don't fit in; people are unkind to me. I'm tired of being fake for people who do not respect me. People make fun of my deformity, awkwardness. My job is a dead end. I Lost all my close friends. I can't get a girlfriend. I don't move have enough to move.

I talked to a county crisis line and they send the police to my job for saying I was suicidally ashamed of myself, which as resulted in even more bullying. I have never been so lost, alone, or and hopeless. I am starting to wonder if I could be insane. I am having a lot of trouble socializing.

I am going to tell my therapist. If he tries to have me taken to a facility I guess I will leave town for a while. It feels really horrible that I am afraid to even talk about it. He told me he would have to have me committed if I said I was suicidal. I really do think that would help me; I think it would make everything much, much worse. So I will leave town if that happens.

"It’s difficult people can be cruel.  Easier said than done try to improve yourself as much as possible.  Exercise, get sunlight, eat healthier, try to not concern yourself with other people thoughts.  You can’t control other people’s perceptions.  You can however learn to love yourself faults and all.  The reality is do you want the respect or admiration of hateful people? What I’ve learned is lots of people are actually descent.  It’s the group think caveman mentality makes people single another out.  You have to rise above this as impossible as it seems it is possible.  Conquer yourself first and the world will follow.

"For the past couple of days, seemingly out of nowhere, this terrible, absolutely horrible goddamn feeling of anxiety has been taking me over, making me have breakdowns, crying, tricking me into thinking that I can’t breathe, etc. 

I do not wish this feeling upon even my most despised enemy, and while my SO has been helping me and guiding me on the path to getting better(and I truly do feel like I’m getting better) that gnawing, hellish and overwhelming anxiety feeling still comes back from time to time, and I just don’t know what to do anymore, short of seeing my doctor here soon and getting on a medication routine. 

If someone on here can give me any advice on how to conquer this…god I can’t even put into words how fucking awful this feeling of anxiety is, I will forever be in your debt, you will be my hero and I will be proud to call you my friend.

"Hi, Due-Fun:

I want to say that I think I know how you feel. A few months back, I was diagnosed with severe generalized anxiety disorder, and a lot of the words you used in your post, like ""episodes"" and ""breakdowns,"" sound all too familiar to me. I completely agree — anxiety is hell, and I wouldn't wish it on any enemy, either. You're not alone in this. 

My advice to you is to see your doctor immediately. If you have generalized anxiety disorder, then you are dealing with a real and serious illness that needs to be treated with medication. Calming exercises can only do so much for anxiety — medicine is needed for mental illness just as it is needed for physical pains. 

Finding the right balance with medication isn't easy. When you first begin taking the prescription, you'll probably feel no different. Then, once the medicine takes effect, you might feel a little better, but not healed. There will be some unsavory side effects. You'll need to meet with your doctor regularly to discuss the effectiveness of the medication and maybe increase your dosage if needed. It may take a while to find the medicine and dosage that works for you, but stick with it — eventually, you'll feel the relief you're looking for.

My last piece of advice is just to relax and be kind to yourself. When you realize you're about to have an anxiety episode, get yourself somewhere you feel safe and comfortable. If possible, put on some fuzzy socks, wrap up in a blanket, make a snack, and watch a funny show or listen to some soothing music. Remind yourself that it's okay to feel bad and that someday you'll feel better (you will, I promise!) and just 'ride the wave' until the anxiety recedes."		reply	na	na	na	0.9962446093559265	weak	strong	no	na	MentalHealthSupport	failed

"It sounds like you are being too hard on yourself, alright. So I have some questions to ask you.

1. When you were a kid, did you have anyone in your life who was constantly very critical all the time? Especially critical of you? Especially an older someone who may have been influential in your early childhood development?

2. Do you think you may have learned this pattern of being over critical of yourself from how you were treated? Do you think it's possible that you were in an environment where this pattern of behavior was normalized to the point that it was considered socially acceptable behavior in that environment?

3. Did you hate being treated that way by those people? 

4. Do you consider it morally wrong to emotionally tear down another human being and make them feel worthless? Especially over minor mistakes that every human makes? Do you consider it mean spirited, maybe even emotionally abusive?

5. If you think it's wrong to emotionally abuse other people, then why are you still doing it to yourself? 

Maybe it's time to treat yourself like someone who is genuinely worthwhile and deserving of self-love. Learn to unlearn these patterns of behavior by focusing more on all of the positive things that you still do? Pat yourself on the back and know that you are worthy."	bruhgrimm	reply	na	na	na	0.9988269209861755	weak	no	strong	na	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.

"Life is definitely hard. I'm in a similar place myself, but I know that if I do end it, I will never have a chance to get better. I know it will hurt those I love the most and leave my pets alone. It's really hard to want to keep going when it feels like the weight of the world is on your shoulders from all the pain you've experienced, so try a few little things. Try to make or buy your favorite food and invite a person you love and trust to eat with you and do your favorite hobby together. Life is a collection of little moments and it's so easy to only remember the painful ones, but try to remember the little joys from each day. Notice every time you smile, even if it's barely there. Remember what made you smile and seek more of that. There's also a good chance there's a reason you feel this way and that getting help would be a good idea. Therapy, guided journaling, mental health workbooks, medication, diet change, exercise, etc. are possibilities. The main thing that has stopped me from unaliving myself is this one phrase I heard somewhere, ""Unaliving yourself is a permanent solution to a temporary problem."" Meaning that whatever you're dealing with right now has a solution, it may not be easy, but it will lead you to a life you can be proud of, but you'll never have the chance to find it if you end it now. Life will always have pain, but we can balance the scales or even tip them in our favor by healing and finding the people/places/things that bring us the most joy, fulfillment, and meaning.

"My dog saved my life when I was at my lowest and lost all motivation to live. Over the years we developed an extraordinary bond and I knew losing her someday would destroy me. I was in law school when it happened, halfway across the country doing a summer internship, living alone, away from all of my family and friends, just my dog and I.

It was extremely difficult. I was completely lost in my grief for about a week. My mom came out to stay with me for awhile so I want all alone. But the thing was, I spent so much time preparing for the absolute worst, and it didn't end up being as bad as I'd prepared myself for. I managed to mostly keep myself together with the help of family. The heartbreak was real, and a piece of my heart will always belong to that dog. I still mourn her loss and tear up over her many years later, including as I write this now.

I adopted another dog a couple weeks later. I know this isn't what works for everyone, but I find so much happiness around animals and I'm just happier having them in my life. My new dog helped me deal with my grief, provided me with a distraction, and ensured I didn't deviate too much from my typical schedule.

It will be hard and it will be painful, but I think you'll find you are stronger than you think. Find comfort where you can and don't feel guilty finding that comfort in another animal if that's what works for you. Loving another pet does not mean loving one that has passed on less."

"For starters so you understand why I may need to be left alone
I have BPD, PTSD, bipolar 1/with psychosis, anxiety NOS.. and a few others.

The other day he hurt my feelings/upset me/made me mad.
He just doesn't care about me and never does anything to show me he does care except necessities like food water etc..
Anyways.
I told him I needed to be left alone. I didn't want to talk. Asked him multiple times. Told him multiple times. He said that he didn't understand why I was upset it wasn't a big deal blah blah


So finally I said did you know that it's abuse when you refuse to leave me alone after I ask for it?


My mom traded me for drug$ at 7-8, my older sister killed my son when I was 16. I grew up in and out of foster care... I ended up leaving home at 17 to get away from my mom and sister and ended up stuck in a 6 year relationship with a man who abused me.

His response to me saying it was abuse: if that's abuse then you don't know what abuse actually is.


I can give way more back story if needed but...
I just didn't want to talk. I didn't want to say or do something I would regret.
I literally wait on this man hand and foot. He says his butt is itchy I jump up undress him and put cream on his booty hole. Like.... He's like a newborn and I'm his mom. I love taking care of him, so hurting him is the last thing I'd ever want to do. I couldn't live with myself if I hurt him physically or mentally.
With my mental problems there's def a chance I could and not mean to so I just needed space.

Short version I asked husband to leave me alone because I didn't want to talk while upset and he refused. Is it abuse?"	ShaniaBunch	post	19.94366926715376	female	White	0.998948872089386	na	na	na	2	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.
It appears you often find yourself being submissive in relationships due to unresolved baggage from your past. There's nothing wrong with being submissive in a relationship as long as it is a healthy relationship. This relationship however appears to be a very unhealthy relationship. You will find yourself caught in a cycle of abuse and that part of your brain that is messed up from the trauma you've experienced makes you run towards it instead of away. My advice is to get away from the situation, take care of yourself, and get your mind better so that when you can discern a healthy relationship, you can live that loving healthy relationship. Until then, you need to be guarded while you heal yourself. Best of luck to you whatever choices you make.	ShaniaBunch	reply	na	na	na	0.998948872089386	no	no	no	na	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.
"hello! 
i am diagnosed with adhd, but nothing else as far as i'm aware. i think cptsd was also mentioned in my chart when i had a therapist a while back, which makes sense because i do have adverse childhood experiences as pertaining to an abusive parental figure.

i'd like to know why i have these very specific and strange symptoms that happen quite consistently with only breaks of about a few weeks in between, sometimes lasting months. it usually starts with some sort of lack of motivation to leave my room or do any of my work- often questioning the importance of living a life outside of my confines. sometimes this just feels like general depression but also it can be sparked by having an obsession with a certain media. for example: there was a period of two months where i came home everyday and neglected my responsibilities and instead watched encanto (the animated disney movie) as many times as possible before going to bed. it actually got so bad that i genuinely believed that i was bruno madrigal, and that i was taken away from my universe. 

this has happened countless other times, often times it's accompanied with pushing my friends away, avoiding general daily responsibilities, and even to a point of self harm and suicidal ideation. i become incredibly territorial about my interests too, and tear apart friendships if they claim to enjoy my media.

also- i should mention that i have long bouts of dissociation as well, forgetting what i've done over long periods of time.

any idea what this might be? i know i should seek help from a professional, i'm working on it, but it's hard in my area to get one.

Hello, I’m 17y/o and this isn’t the first time I’ve felt this way before. My life has been pretty dysfunctional since the beginning, my parents were both smokers and drinkers and got into violent fights ever since I could remember, back to back bullying , pressure from my parents to be “academically gifted”, having unstable back and forth living conditions etc.. I don’t have any friends at school, I’m not that good looking so people either ignore me or they use me just for answers but don’t want an actual friendship with me. I’m not particularly good at anything or talented in any way ether.  Also I can’t hold down a job. Why is this happening to me? I’m well behaved,quiet and usually a good sport so why can’t anything go great for me? Why am I alone all the time? Why am I a background character to everyone else?

I'm usually very overburdened with work on a daily basis, with 15 things to do at a time (figuratively speaking), but recently some of my responsibilities have ended and I had some free time. Ever since, I feel too lazy to actually do anything. I'm either binging shows or scrolling on Instagram, not even enjoying it much, and all the while feeling guilty about not doing any actual work. I do normally procrastinate until the very last minute to do things, except when I get a sudden surge of energy and do things early, but lately, since my work doesn't have a fixed deadline yet, I can't work up the will to work. Anyone else going through something similar? Any tips on how to get out of this rut?	MunchNoodle	post	18.33653385099093	female	White	0.9994043111801147	na	na	na	7	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.

"I’ve gone through this exact feeling, which has increased exponentially in the years following the pandemic. At first, I felt like I had so much time to finally do all of the hobbies and things I wanted to do. As time went on though, I started feeling like my days were getting shorter and shorter, like I couldn’t accomplish any of the things I wanted to do in the time I had, and so I too fell into the scrolling/mindless entertainment spiral. It started to impact my work too. If I couldn’t finish a project I wanted to do in a day, why start it? This kept me pushing back things and procrastinating when historically I was not one to do that. 

While I’m by no means “healed” of this now, some strategies that have helped motivate me include:

- Promising someone else that I would get a part (not whole) of a project done by a certain day. This kept me more on track professionally by setting smaller concrete milestones. If you have a good relationship with your work supervisor, it may be worth being vulnerable about your need for more structure right now. 

- For getting “life” things done, I dramatically reduced my expectations for myself. I set one goal per day/# goals per week of things I knew I needed to do to get myself back in the habit of doing things and checking them off regularly. I also did a “door walk” at least once a day. This meant walking from my kitchen/bedroom to the apartment door and doing at least one chore or task on my way. It was a good way for me to feel more accomplished. 

- For hobbies and interests, I found that if I had at least one thing I enjoyed doing that required effort I would try to prioritize that. Enjoyable things like social media and TV can still be enjoyable, but hobbies that prioritize mastery are equally important. Try to strive for leisure time that is 50/50 pleasure vs. mastery type activities and you’ll find yourself more energized by it. 

Overall, my biggest motivator was the guilt I had for not doing things in work, life, and play - the more I did, the more it went away, and the more happy I became. I’ve kept it up because I don’t want it to come back."	MunchNoodle	reply	na	na	na	0.9994043111801147	no	strong	no	na	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.
I'm going thought the same feeling. Unfortunately I also get called worthless occasionally, which doesn't really motivate me to do much more than the basics. But I find myself more and more just sitting or laying down and looking at the wall or something because I don't even feel like scolling through fb or watching TV. I feel like I'm drowning more and more daily.. and the one person who's supposed to help me float, I'm pretty sure is bipolar.

Normally just accept that its not important. If you believe that it's important then think about it. Think hard. Most importantly, make a decision; but be sure why you made this decision. That way when youre worried about it later, you can brush the stress off knowing that you made this decision for a good reason.

She suffers from anxiety and the last 2 intimate relations she had were catastrophic. She suffers from a very bad image of herself, she has really big trust issue and blames herself often for things that are not her fault. School is also difficult for her and she lacks motivation. I try to help her as much as I can but I am not good with that kind of stuff. I fell like I help a bit online because we talk a lot and it looks like it helps her a bit but I fail to help her irl and I don't do anything concreate for her. If you could please tell me how to help her out I would really appreciate it.

For the last 20 years I have had anxiety. Growing up in a very religious and somewhat sheltered home I was always told that these feeling were actually guilt for something I had done wrong. So from the time I was 8 until around my late 20s I spent an incredible amount of time wondering “what I had done wrong to feel this way” each time I had anxiety. Around that same time a couple years ago is when I started having panic attacks. Chest pains, numb fingers, tunnel vision, kaleidoscope vision, and feeling like I am high even though I don’t get high. Almost like a dream state where it becomes impossible to function, think, or focus. I have terrible paranoia and get stuck in intrusive thought loops and spiral. It’s like the worst parts of being too high on weed except again. I don’t smoke. It’s cause me to lose multiple jobs because employers don’t understand needing an hour break almost daily to bring myself back to zero. Im a single father and I find myself spending time I should be giving to my son locked away in my own mind trying to overcome a panic attack. And I have spent every day for the last 9 months either on the verge of a panic attack or in the midst of one. My question is. Is there any tips or tricks I can use to bring myself back once im in the thick of it? Or something I can do to bring my anxiety from a 7/10 to at least a 3/10? Im trying very hard to learn how to walk around and function during these so that I can go back to work and give my son more	versace-cowboy-	post	36.856137564305506	female	White	0.9920799136161804	na	na	na	0	MentalHealthSupport	failed
"(sorry if my english isn't that good, i'm not native.)  
I had these feelings years ago for the first time, around maybe 5 years ago.  
My friend got bullied, and that bully said something to me while showing me a butter knife they had.  
they threatened me with it, i wasn't scared but i was angry. I thought about taking the 'knife' and shoving it in her eyes. I didn't ofcourse, it would've gotten me in trouble. But i know if nobody would've known it was me, i would've done it.  


I get these urges sometimes randomly, and sometimes for a reason or two.   
To name an example, about a year and a half ago:  
I had a boyfriend, and i despised him. He was overly sexual, unfunny, unattractive, awkward, didn't know what no meant... i could go on. It was an online relationship aswell, so i couldn't have murdered him.. Wich made me wanna do it more. This is an example of reason.  
And example of no reason would be:  
I got angry for no real reason, atleast no obvious one.  
I first felt the urge to destroy something, then it got worse and worse;  
First i just wanted to kill a dog, i hate dogs. No, i despise dogs.  
They're loud, submissive, annoying, hard to care for.... (sorry not sorry)  
Then i wanted to kill a person. nobody in particular, wich is the biggest difference between reason and no reason. i just wanted to kill, torture... stab..  
It was getting bad to the point i couldn't stop shaking, or fidgeting.  
Don't get me wrong: i fidget and shake all the time, i've gotten used to it. but when this happens its more than usual.  
I've been dealing with these thoughts for a while, but not like theyre on my mind 24/7,  
but they just come back to me with such intensity every like 1-3 months, hold on for 10 minutes until i distract myself, and then go away. Not completely, and the physical effects take a while to return to normal aswell. And usually, it will come again in either the same day, or next day. It can come multiple times a day or two, then go for 1-3 months, and repeat.   


I found out the most common cause of this is relationships, rather it'd be friends or partner.  
As i said, i've dealt with this for a few years now, but it got worse around 2019 and continued getting worse and worse. i think the worst it got was 2022 until now, and i got 2 or 3 of these this year, so maybe 2023 will become the next worst year.  


What do i want from posting this? Multiple things.  
1. I just wanna get these thoughts out of my mind. i never really told anyone about this, due to fear of judgement.  
2. I wanna know whats going on with me, this doesn't feel normal.  
3. Support, i know if i wanna get better, i need support.  
4. Maybe similar stories to help myself understand why i feel this way, and that im not alone.  


What do i absolutely NOT want?  
Telling me i'm a horrible human being, i know that already. I did a lot of fucked up shit because of my mental health and im not excusing myself or distancing myself from all bad actions i've done, but just understand that im torturing myself with my own thoughts already.  


Now , i wanna end this with saying a few things. If there will be any questions - I'll answer them to the best of my ability. If anyone needs support and advice with similar things - I'll do my best to help.  
I  know others and myself included need a space where they can say every bad thing about themselfs,  
Otherwise nobody will become a better human being. It doesn't matter if you're a psychopath, sociopath, if you're neurodivergent, or neurotypical; you should be able to get a space to get better in."

"This is probably really horrible advice, I know this is gonna get down voted to the floor, but have you thought about a career path that accommodates this desire. A legal one, of course, like some kind of special forces soldier/sniper 

I say that because I have the same thing, only a little different from yours. Less impulsive. Every few months, there'll be a few days where whenever I see someone, I can't help but imagine all the ways I could kill them. Nearest sharp object, warm blood flowing down my arm, etc. The thought of it never really bothered me, nor was it so intense that it got in the way of my day to day life, so I have little interest in getting rid of this urge even if I thought I could.

It was very negative break up. I even sent him a plant to say sorry for any pain i coursed him and wrote a letter (4 pages) on how it wasn't all negative and there was positive and to say thank you for the time we shared and try to make it to a positive end and not hold on to all this negative energy. 

Well, after getting my plant and letter, he gave my plant to someone else and after my letter he was so nasty with these horrible words and horrible name calling me to the put its been put into my head and given me suidal thoughts.

"I haven't been in a similar situation as you, i.e a breakup, but I do get negative voices and suicidal thoughts too.

It's good that you're getting help, that's always the first step. Idk what type of therapy you are getting but your therapist should help you to try and feel better in yourself over time. You should try to be honest with your therapist about your feelings to get the most out of it, though it may take some time to build your trust with them which is understandable. 

Whilst your self-image is building, you are still going to experience these voices. What I do is try to distract myself from them by doing things I enjoy or generally find distracting like listening to music or watching videos, etc.

If your feelings of suicide get strong you should try to contact someone. This can be a friend, family member or a helpline. If you are contacting a friend or family member you don't have to tell them that you're having suicidal thoughts if you don't want to but I find that just talking to someone I care about and trust helps me because it distracts me and also in a way makes me not do it because there is someone there to talk to me.

I'm so sorry you had to experience what you did and I think you definitely didn't deserve to be treated the way he treated you. I believe in you and wish you the best in the future!

"It gets easier. His voice will get quite and less frequent and eventually fade away.

You don't need to worry about relying on your mum. Whenever people come to me with their problems I'm always so happy it shows that they trust me. Your mum must care a lot about you and so I'm sure she's happy to hear you rant and be there for you.

You shouldn't feel bad about being suicidal. Your feelings are valid. It may not look like you can go on but please trust me when I say ts easier. Ik lots of people always say this but it is true. Just keep trying and getting help and when you look back you will see the progress you've made which will motivate you and help you move forwards.

I really do believe in you. Do you use any helplines? Perhaps you could talk to them about some of your problems and also talk to them when you start hearing his voice. You're going through a really tough time but you're really strong. You've already sought help which shows how brave and strong you are.

I had a nervous breakdown last night over a disagreement with my sibling and as result, mentally broke down. I don’t know if it’s a combination of many events the last few months that’s caused me incredible stress, but last night pushed me over the edge. I took a kitchen knife and started gently hitting my pants until it ended up stabbing me. I don’t recall if it was intentional that I would pierce my skin, but I mellowed out shortly after.

 What's the best way to treat poor mental health at home? I'm interested in journals or workbooks. I have a whole slew of issues (depression (possibly depressive bipolar), anxiety, cptsd, adhd, and possibly autism (I at least present symptoms). I have been to more therapists than I can count and they've never had any long lasting effect. I've tried quite a few different workbooks including dbt and cbt but I can never seem to finish them and what I read I already know. I've taken a dozen psychology classes at college and while there are plenty of definitions, there's very little clear treatment. I'm just tired of feeling broken all the time and want some advice on something I can do or buy that's legitimately helpful because I've tried so many things.

I've gone through some messed up things. My highschool was a nightmare with at least 2-3 fights daily. Middle school was worse and I couldn't defend myself then. I've been beaten up, jumped and alone for a long time. Once I learned how to fight, I was able to defend my closest friends though from a post I made in true off my chest, that didn't end well. Now after so long of being in constant hostility. I'm in college. I got much needed therapy and am working on trusting people again. I've made some good friends here now and I've been getting used to lowering my guard for once. Gotta be honest. It feels great being able to help out people rather than just be ready to fight. Still. I can't help but look back and just think that many people have died where I haven't. How on earth am I alive after all of this? People say I'm a good man and that I'm an extremely tough person but I don't feel that way at all. Honestly I didn't even think I'd make it through highschool and get here. Does anyone else get this feeling sometimes?	Trollerthegreat	post	14.315068084414762	male	White	0.00511923898011446	na	na	na	1	MentalHealthSupport	failed

"I have been in anti-depressants for about 4 weeks now. 

1. Side effects

I personally have not experienced any side-effects from them but Ik that there are some that you may experience. Most people will not experience any side effects. If you take them on an empty-stomach, i.e. if you haven't eaten then you may experience a stomach ache so this may not be the best option if you have something like an eating disorder. There are different types of anti-depressants so if you experience any side-effects you can switch to a different type to hopefully not experience it. 

That being said, the ones that I take increase serotonin levels. This means that you won't feel ""high"" or anything like that but instead it regulates your mood, so your mood won't dip as low. 

2. Alternatives

As I mentioned before there are different types of anti-depressants. 

You can also seek therapy or counselling, which you can also do alongside taking the medication. I find it to actually be a lot more helpful than it sounds, especially if you're honest. You may not feel or notice much difference but looking back I can definitely see big improvements and how much it has helped me. It is also personal so they can help you through your personal problems and tailor it to you. 

3. What happens if you stop taking it

Since I've only been taking them for 4 weeks, I don't have any experience with not taking them so unfortunately I can't comment on this.

"It wouldn’t make sense to ask someone else “Who am I?” Unless you have amnesia one would assume you know who you are right?

I feel as though I’ve been watching my life through my eyes as a passenger. How can I know others if I can’t comprehend myself?

Edit: To explain a little more about how I’ve been feeling, sometimes it feels as though the emotions I display aren’t my own, I feel like even though I can experience emotions that they aren’t really there. I fear that one day I won’t even have the chance to experience them at all, I fear that if I were to hurt someone that I wouldn’t feel anything, if I were to kill someone that it wouldn’t effect me.

"
14M. As a bit of background, I am currently in therapy for anxiety , depression OCD and for the last six weeks i have been on 50mg of sertraline a day and 2 lots of 20mg promethazine a day. 

since yesterday morning, i haven’t felt great but i atleast thought that the medication was working . was feeling depressed a bit the night before but something was drastically different.

I woke up and felt like i was incoherent but i wasn’t and began to feel very depressed. i put it down to just a bad day and i read online sertraline can cause depressive feelings . i continued on with my day not worrying until the nighttime . 

just before i was going to get into bed ,something didn’t feel right. i started to feel strange in ways i can’t describe and I had these 1 second headaches in the same spot every 5-10 minutes . my memory then began to feel weird and i checked my blood pressure which was normal. 

I then grabbed my playstation controller and headset and put it by my bedside which i never do . i always leave it on my desk. this freaked me out , but then again that could just be down to tiredness .

I got into bed and checked by blood pressure again. all normal. but something didn’t feel right at all. it felt like i was living in yesterday and then i suddenly got this strange feeling and this is the best way of describing it: it felt like I wasn’t conscious but i was at the same time . like to recall my memory it feels like none of that happened except it did . the world felt deaf and it felt like time was no longer linear . i felt as if i couldn’t process things properly, if at all. and thought brain bleed.

I then went to the bathroom and felt panicked but didn’t show it . I checked my pupils and they were fine . i then went back to my bedroom and began to text people ok reddit for advice and said it all sounds like anxiety. 

at this point my brain was telling me that I was forgetting something but i don’t know what, because that’s the whole point of forgetting something . I began to feel like I was in a delirious state and i felt as if i couldn’t hang on to a thought process.

 I was worried as this was not normal for me so i woke up my dad and told him what was happening . at this point when I was trying to read something i searched up on google , the words looked jumbled and i had to read it again. this has never been an issue before and i certainly don’t have dyslexia , so this made me worry .

I explained to my dad that the way I was feeling was not normal, so i asked him if I could call 111 (urgent care number) . I explained to them my situation and i was put on call later to a man who literally asked my father what he thought he should do if i was feeling delirious . at this point i realised it was pointless . he basically said it sounds like nothing physically but i disagreed. 

Exhausted of all my options , i decided to go to sleep. I got around 7 hours and slept straight through and had vivid detailed dreams .

I woke up around 11am after going to bed around 4am. I still had memory troubles but not nearly as bad as the night before . I tried to convince myself I was fine and realised i still felt strange and the letters looked a bit jumbled still. I’ve tried to brush it off all day but still feeling weird. a recent feeling in the past 6-7 hours i’ve attained is the feeling like i’m waking up and suddenly realising i’m doing something while i’m doing it subconsciously . but if i backtrack and i try to remember it all feels fine. just not in the moment. this is the thing that is freaking me out . 

any advice please ? any at all? does this sound like a brain bleed /mental confusion/delirium? or could this be explained by anxiety / derealization /tiredness? so scared honestly don’t know what to do."

Honestly, you're probably fine. Getting on many medications for the first time might mess with your head a bit, they are altering your brain chemistry as they are designed to. If you're still feeling weird or the condition worsens, then I would look at speaking to your doctor that prescribed the sertraline. Promethazine only has dangerous interactions with depressants, not SSRIs.	Turbulent_Battle3926	reply	na	na	na	0.9975402355194092	weak	no	no	na	MentalHealthSupport	failed
That’s what I was screaming when I broke down crying this morning. I was way overly tired, since my body clock is way off and I hadn’t slept all night. And it turned out my chronic pain meds patch had run low, so I wasn’t getting good pain coverage and I may have been going through some withdrawal. Still, it was a very real and painful sentiment, as I have photosensitivity, meaning my skin and body react poorly to sun exposure (skin pain, abdominal pain, worsening of systemic symptoms, etc.) and the warm beauty of the morning coming through my window just reminded me of the hot and humid days that will have me trapped in my house because dysautonomia keeps my body from properly adjusting to either and my connective tissue disorders make my joints into weather stations that only broadcast horror movies every time the barometer shifts. I’m physically in terrible pain much of the time, and it’s weighing on my emotional as well.  I know that therapy could help, but I can’t have it on my record. Literally, it would be one more reason for doctors to not give me the pain medicine I need, instead of realizing the pain is making me lose it, not the other way. I wouldn’t wish this on anyone, but sometimes I wish they had a clue. Anyway. I just wanted to be able to say it to someone other than the dust bunnies in my room. Thanks.

It is “normal” unfortunately yes. Due to multiple factors such as darkness, tiredness and lack of distraction your Brain is more likely to feel depressed. Unfortunately the darkness can’t really be solved however attempting to get yourself into a better sleeping pattern really can help. Also try to find a nice nighttime hobby such as reading to occupy your mind. Alternatively find a friend that’s willing to chat each night to let you clear your feelings. If you don’t feel comfortable talking to your friends yet my Messages are open and I have no judgement and even if I can’t reply straight away feel free to vent as just writing your thoughts down can help a lot.

"(Posting from my phone, also first post ever and first time visiting this group, so my apologies for anything that is off).

I recently started a new job after being in a two-person department at my previous job for 13 years. My partner-in-crime at my old job was around my age (approaching 40) and we had similar mindsets and experiences growing up. You don't miss work, you struggle through stress, etc. 

My new job has me working with a larger team including younger members who have different takes on a number of issues, including mental health, so I'm running into a number of different experiences. 

One member of my team recently took a short leave for mental health reasons - I don't want to provide many details as it was abrupt so I don't know exactly what happened.

How should I handle this person's return? Should I just treat it as if the time didn't happen and let them address it when they're comfortable? Should I welcome them back (and doing so,  reference the fact they were gone)?

I don't want to cause any kind of stress for my coworker, or any kind of backslide. What's the best way to handle the situation?"	FaenixDawn	post	28.151027811923495	female	White	0.0053575909696519375	na	na	na	1	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.
Just being polite and kind, maybe saying if you need to talk I just want to reach out and say I’m here if you need someone to talk to. And say glad you’re back and leave it there. But being around 40 myself it’s a new generation and I don’t know how they would take that. But being genuine is always good. Maybe ask an HR person for advice.

"I tend to be very hard on myself when it comes to dating and talking to women. I have had anxiety and social anxiety my whole life and have had some insecurities about myself growing up and still do. 

Back story: I was very shy in high school and only spoke to my close friends. I never approached any girls. The girl I lost my virginity to my junior year in high school I only spoke to when I took her home from school. I was afraid to talk to her in school. Then, my senior year of high school, I entered into a relationship with a girl that went to a different high school. That lasted 4.5 years until my last semester of college. 

When I got out of college, I was so excited to get out to bars with friends. Little did I know how hard it would be to talk to women being a shy guy. Time went on with no luck from the bars and seeing a few of my friends have luck and taking women home from the bars. Tinder and bumble were also very hard for me. Then Covid hit which made it hard for everyone. 

The last couple years starting in 2021, I have gotten a lot better at talking to women and have been on many dates. Hinge dating app has been better than tinder and bumble. I’ve been with a few more women too. No relationships though. I just still get very down on myself. I feel it really messes with my head when I go on a date or two with a woman I find really attractive and then she friend-zones me. Or when I’m texting them and they just ignore me. Women have so many options and can get a guy whenever they want. Since my last girlfriend, only two of the girls I’ve had sex with I was really attracted to, but they both just didn’t work out for a relationship. The other women I had sex with I was kind of attracted to but more just me wanting to have sex. I’d like to attract girls that I’m really attracted to. And I’d like to say I’m a decent looking guy too. I workout and take care of myself.

I feel like I compare myself to other guys and how many women they have gotten or how attractive of a girl they can get. It’s really bad if me to do this and I need to get out of this bad thinking. A lot of the dating advice on YouTube can be helpful, but some of it is just toxic as it says you have to be this kind of guy with this amount of muscle, money, or blah blah blah. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated on how to not be so self sabotaging when it comes to dating and talking to women.

Thank you for your comment. In response to 4, yes I know obviously women are people. I would like to someday have someone I connect with in a deeper level. What I mean is I know how guys are. They judge each other on who is good with the ladies. And I feel like I suck at talking to them. Other guys are just good at it. With women it’s like you have to use a pickup line or say something witty to win them over. It feels like a competition.

"1) Dating is difficult for everyone. Your difficulties and my difficulties may be different, but they both exist and are valid. Reminding yourself of this fact might help you remember it's not so personal or that there's something wrong with you when you struggle with it.

2) Rejection is part of dating. Humans are complex. What one person finds unappealing about you, another may love. Sometimes rejection is really personal, but other times it's less about you and more about where that other person is at in their life. If someone is rude or just ghosts you, that's a reflection on them. 

3) It's not a competition about who has the ""best"" partner or hottest date. Quit comparing yourself to others. People take different path. What works for your friend may not be what works for you. That's okay.

4) I don't think this is exclusive to men, but some of what you've written sounds like you see women as objects to be ""won"". Women are people too. Just treat them with the same respect you would anyone else. 

5) Dating and finding a partner should be an enhancement to your life. If you knew for certain you'd never find a life partner, would you live your life differently? What steps would or could you take now to make sure you live a fulfilling life without a romantic relationship? I'm not suggesting this is the case for you, but a lot of people think a relationship will fix their problems or they spend so much time focusing on a romantic relationship that they don't nurture other relationships like family, friends, community, church, etc. As those relationships weaken, they become more unhappy."

Recently broke up with my ex. They were avoidant and I am anxious. But I had been going to therapy for about a year now to heal my inner child and become a secured person. My ex after 4 years wanted to see other people. Told me that they didn’t care if I was with other people, had another relationship, and didn’t care if we were exclusive. Which is why I broke up with them since they didn’t care. I keep telling myself that I did what I had to do for myself. That we have different values. I have been reading self healing books. Hanging out with family and friends. Trying to move on. But I keep thinking about them. I loved them so much. I wanted us to share our worlds together. The only thing I looked forward to growing up was spending it with someone I loved. I wanted to grow old with someone. I wanted to have funny moments together. Enjoy the mundane things in life. Travel and take goofy pictures. I saw all that with this person. Then one day they just decided that it wasn’t for them. They didn’t want to push me away but they did. I’m in my early thirties and now I’m back to square one. I guess lessened learned but I really did want them to feel loved. I just wasn’t what they wanted.	ohsawa	post	41.34424284821813	female	White	0.9943916201591492	na	na	na	1	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.
I’m sorry you’re hurting. It can take years to get over being crushed like that I have been there! Try online dating. Or join a gym or a new hobby, keep yourself busy. You’ll meet someone again, who reciprocates love.	ohsawa	reply	na	na	na	0.9943916201591492	strong	strong	no	na	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.
"Hello, I am here because i desperatly need help.  
My boyfriend and I have been together for a bit more than a year now, and it became a distance relationship for about 5 mounths now because he had to move out for his studies. Now the thing is is that he is (probably because he hasn't seen any professional) depressive (sry for bad english). He is encountering a lot of different problems and never had any luck in life (trust me he really hasn't, like sometimes it's unbelievable how much bad luck he had). Now, he his going through a lot of stress because of money and job problems, his motivation is going down a lot too. And the thing is that I don't know how to support him through the distance. I'm trying to show as much love as I can, but I'm afraid of giving too much and to overwhelm him, but I'm also afraid of not giving enough. Also, I'm not feeling well too because of the fact that I will soon graduate and go in superior and I'm freeked out about having responsabilitie, not being enough etc. And because of my mental state, I'm not being able to show as much love as usual, and I'm feeling guilty for that. I'm trying my best to show him love, to show him that I will always be at his side no matter what, and I feel like it's not enough. I don't know what to do more that could at least a little bit cheer him up. I'm trying to play games with him, we're having at least 2 phone calls a week... The thing is that for both of us, our love language is physical touch, but I'm not able to give him that because of the distance (he is 700km away from my home). I'm trying to come see him as much as I can, which means about every month and a half (so during each school vacations), but it is not enough for both of us. I just don't know what to do, I don't know how to deal with the fact that he's not feeling well. I feel lost, and not enough because I don't know what to do to cheer him up. I feel like I'm doing the best I can but it also feels like it's not enough and I feel ashamed of that. So, I'm asking for your help, maybe you have some advices of how I could give reassurance to my boyfriend ? How I could at least a tiny bit boost his mental state ?"

"Heyy, it's been a while since this post, so it kinda needs an update now. First thank you for your comment. At that time if he was so feeling down it was because the company in which he had his job went down. After i went to see him on hollydays and it made him feel much better and he got indemnities so he thought it wasn't necessary for him to get therapy.  
Now things are a lot better. It is summer vacation now (which lasts like 2 months and a half in my country) so we got to spend a lot of time together. We visited his dad (who lives like 6 hours away in train), got at his mom's house and spent time with his friends, and it was awesome tbh. He spent 5 days at my house for my birthday and it was awesome as well. He also got a new job which is in a really good society. He is like so happy right now and it makes me so happy as well to see him like this. It's probably weird but I feel like this bad episode kinda made us grow even closer. It's been now a year and a half since we're together, and I feel like our relationship is perfect. We love each other so much like it's just magic. We love to take care of each other, to recieve that care, to just hand out and do nothing, to cuddle, to go out and so much more. It's hard to describe but the gift he made me for my birthday was just wow (i cried when i recieved it). Now I will see him again in 3 weeks and I can't wait to be able to be in his arms again.  
Again, thank you for your concern and thanks for reading this because you didn't have to :))"	Mundane-Ad-532	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9936476349830627	weak	strong	no	na	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.
"This started back around dec 2022, I (14 m) was tryin to get a girlfriend since most of my friends at the time had one and I wanted to fit in. I’ve been going to the gym regularly for a while now so I thought I had a head start on getting a girl. I used to dm girls to try and talk to them and they’d just leave me on open on or delivered. After the first 5 girls I really didn’t think much of it, I kinda just brushed them off. I would be on call with my friends while asking the girls and if they didn’t respond my friend would just tell me “ it’s alright bro, she just ain’t the one” or “it’s just a girl bro”. Stuff along those lines. As I texted more girls and them ignoring me It started getting to my head. Originally I wanted a girl to be around with so I could just talk to, then I went to wanting a girlfriend to be happy. Now i don’t even think getting a girlfriend would even make me happy. I don’t have any thoughts of hurting my self or any bad intentions towards my self, but if I’m in my room by my self at night I just randomly start crying just think that my friends can do it so easily but I can’t. I’m not jealous about my friends or anything like that. I don’t really know what to do at this point anymore. 

My bad on this post being so scatted around, this is my first time posting anything to reddit."	That1mfLeo831	post	14.956843210180278	male	White	0.9980812072753906	na	na	na	1	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.

I suffer from severe amnesia due to childhood trauma. However, I don’t remember this man at all, despite him having lots of evidence that we have been together for years. I also don’t quite recognize my body, or my name. It feels slightly off to me. I’m supposed to have an appointment with my therapist today, and I’m worried I’ll get put into a psych ward over this. I might cancel. I just honestly don’t know what to do about this.	amnesiabound	post	19.87115177435889	male	White	0.9994605183601379	na	na	na	12	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.

Don’t cancel your appointment it’s probably exactly what you need. I don’t think they will put you in to the Psych if you have an amnesia diagnosis, because what you are experiencing is “normal” for someone with amnesia. I had a client once you had amnesia, and the one thing that did assist her in the long run was learning to trust “the evidence” it allowed her to trust the people around her and what they were telling her about her life and relationships. I’m not saying it was easy for her to learn to do that, but we worked on it for a long time. We made up picture boards with peoples names and photos so she got used to seeing them everyday. Lots of vision type boards with memory prompts. I’m really sorry you’re going through this it’s a very very scary confusing diagnosis to deal with. It sounds like you have a loving partner who is doing all the right things. Trust the evidence my friend.

"This is gonna be a long post about the things that are possibly or possibly not wrong with me, so bear with me. I’m 16 years old and a while back I was diagnosed with depression. I’m medicated now but I still have a lot of issues that could be unrelated or related. I don’t know.

A quick content and trigger warning for a myriad of issues. Nothing majorly heavy, just a bunch of small issues adding up. (I wasn’t sure if I should tag this but I’m doing it just in case-)

I’m gonna copy paste a list I’ve compiled at the bottom of this post that names all of the things I’ve found wrong with me over time. I have no idea if some of them have been there since childhood (I say childhood, but I’m still just 16. You know what I mean), because for some reason I don’t remember a large portion of my childhood, but I think some of it may have been present since that time?

I do not feel normal whatsoever. All of the neurotypical people I’ve met are nothing like this. I know this is Reddit so I’m gonna take any comments I get with a grain of salt, but I need help. I do have a counselor, but she has told me that I’m completely normal. She said this was on track for kids my age but I don’t really meet people like this, and when I do, they’re neurodivergent. Please help. I’m desperate. I need to know what’s wrong with me. Is this really all normal? It doesn’t feel like it at all.

Also, I’m well aware some of these things could be completely normal, but I feel as if a lot of these are definitely not.

Please help me. If you think I’m normal, tell me. And if you don’t think I am, can you point me in a direction of what it could be? I used to think I had autism but now I think I have bipolar. Ive got a friend who calls me bipolar as a joke and now I worry he’s right. Maybe I’m just a hypochondriac and this is all in my head. I hope not, because I really feel like something is wrong with me.

I want to say that I don’t think there’s anything inherently “wrong” with neurodivergent people. It’s just the word choice I made because I wasn’t sure what other word I could use to get my point across.

I hope this post was at least somewhat clear and concise, as I’m very scatterbrained at the moment and it’s 1AM as I write this. I apologize if there are any mistakes in my grammar or punctuation.

-
The list:

1. Talking too much 
2. The opposite, talking a minimal amount. It fluctuates
3. Talking about (and thinking about) things I’m hyperfixated on repetitively 
4. Forgetting about what things I talked about with what people so I repeat it
5. Interrupting. I think this is more just a me problem than a brain problem, but I’m so bad with interrupting and sometimes I don’t even realize it 
6. Fidgety. I feel the need to move a lot 
7. Sensory overload. Everything becomes too loud and too much. Goes hand in hand with breakdowns. Sound is too much, I’m I taking too much info, I’m angry and wanna hurt myself, touch is too much. This is like, detrimental to me and it affects me the most out of anything else on this list.
8. Breakdowns. I freak out over the smallest things. The urge to scream and hurt myself are strong, I panic. This goes hand in hand with the sensory overload sometimes.
9. Hyperfixating on certain things for days to weeks to even years until I find no more interest in it. I never get burnout, just keep thinking about said thing until something else piques my interest.
10. Terrible outbursts of anger. I’ve gotten much better at controlling these, though. I think it was just a puberty thing.
11. I talk before I think of what I’ll say. I’m very impulsive.
12. Fluctuating moods. I can be incredibly outgoing and bubbly one second and then quiet and upset the next and vice versa. Sometimes I’ll have a week or so of pure extroverted-ness and then I’ll have a major depressive crash
13. I change the subject multiple times in a few seconds. It’s mostly over text, but a lot of it is irl, too.
14. Intrusive thoughts (ie: I’m gonna hurt this person, I’m gonna hurt myself, what if someone came in here and shot me, someone is in the house, what if we crashed the car and died right now)
15. I absolutely cannot focus on work while people talk. I’ll start getting anxious and frustrated if this happens. (Also goes hand in hand with overstimulation)
16. Overthinking things I didn’t used to overthink (this has drastically increased and has heavily affected my life) (Ex. I hear a noise that’s weird, I think someone has come in and killed my family. I hear weird sounds outside, I think there is an intruder or I think a bomb is being dropped. Not even fucking joking. I fear nuclear attacks way more than I should.)
17. Horrible panic when left alone in public or when I’m asked to do something out of my comfort zone. I can’t ask strangers questions, I can’t ask for help, I can’t DRIVE. It’s just a crippling anxiety.
18. I either eat too much or way too much or way too little. My appetite fluctuates greatly. I switch between overeating and then limiting myself to a meal a day.
19. Constantly changing sleep schedule. I can sleep just fine for a period of time one night and wake up refreshed, and then the next night I’ll go to bed at the same time and be exhausted. Things like that. 
20. I can’t tell what other people think of me. I can’t read their emotions so I assume they hate me. I’m so terrible at reading emotions-
21. Constant zoning out, and if I don’t get to zone out when I want, I feel really weird and upset
22. Derealization episodes(?) Not very common, but it sucks anyway.
23. I have a hard time communicating how I feel
24. Sometimes I talk way too fast or way too slow
25. I often find myself slurring and tripping over my words
26. Weird coping mechanisms (rocking body, moving my head in rotations, repetitive motions such as popping bones, tapping, or tearing my nails off)
27. I violently hate the texture of certain things. I can’t stop myself from thinking of rubbing my teeth against them and it makes me sick. (Fuzzy things, clothes, seatbelts)
28. I’m so terrible with dates and numbers and such. I also just have a bad memory in general 
29. I don’t understand when a certain thing I’ve said is rude. By the time I realize, its  usually too late. 
30. I have what I can only describe as manic episodes. It’s like a week of pure euphoria where I’m insanely productive and then a depressive crash. I know I already talked about that but I wanted to go more in depth with it.
31. Huge fluctuations of sexual or romantic attraction"	neileatsraccoons	post	22.106063977156467	male	White	0.025946907699108124	na	na	na	1	MentalHealthSupport	failed

"TW; su!c¡dal thoughts

Recently, my dad told us his thoughts of su ¡c¡de have returned. He revealed to us a few of the ‘reasons’ he uses to talk himself down when feeling this way. Reasons to live, basically. some examples being myself and my siblings, my mom, their dogs etc. 
I’d like to start a journal for my dad. Letters to him along with a list of more ’Reasons’. Some ideas I have include:
Sunrises & sunsets
Future grandchildren
Bella’s (their chocolate lab) goofy grin when her lip gets caught on her teeth. 

I was wondering if you all could contribute some more. What are your reasons? What should I add to the list.

Hi I (17f) am kind of having a hard and complicated time period in my life rn.. so I dropped a ex best friend not to long ago 2 months I believe, anyways my friend group I was in with them was a group of 4 and my other two friends were devastated once they found out what happened between me and them..They felt horrible that the group was breaking up, but I didn’t care. Let me explain what this “best friend” of 2/half years was treating me like. She started being rude to me and i know that she has a fat ego I’ve told her about and I told her that it doesn’t make me feel good when she puts me and the friend group down to lift her self up. When I said things or tried to talk about things that meant something to me she’d put the conversation on herself again. She’d brag about the same shit every day. I felt like I was dumb and useless and that I always told myself she was smarter than me. And she would tell me about all her exes and how they still like her and stuff…especially when a new guy came to school she claimed that he was her ex..which is a lie..he’s never even been to our town and dude was a whole 19 year old. ANYWAY fat ego like i said but her treatment towards me got to me really bad it started causing me pain it got so bad to the point were I started to get into these really dark places mentally and I just felt like shit. And I just could not fucking do it anymore so cut her off. Buttt this comes with some uh idk how to say it. But my nephew went into some depression over the whole thing he didn’t want our group to split. But I just said drop me too, to cause him less stress of trying to be friends with the both of us. But now since then I’ve been kindof distancing myself from everyone and he’s been hanging with her at lunch in school while I’m up in the library. (I have no classes with him I only get to see him at lunch or in passing periods) And i told him I didn’t care that he talks or hangs with her. But I have to admit it hurts me. even the three of us complained about her together and she treated us all like shit. But I tried to be a reallly good friend yknow like I was there when they needed to vent or cry I gave advice on there life stuff. and now that he hangs with her at lunch then still tries to talk to me but protect her at the same time is insane to me. so now I just dont wanna talk to him either. ON TOP OF THIS BULLSHIT I broke up with my manipulative bf. also I don’t talk or even hang out with anyone anymore I feel like shit…I cried over this dumb shit and I feel bad for being pissed about this.-	good_hearted15	post	19.48130071851489	female	White	0.9988401532173157	na	na	na	4	MentalHealthSupport	failed

"I (32yo male) have been suffering from depression for most of my adult life. The past few years I haven noticed it getting progressively worse. A couple years ago I was diagnosed with anxiety and Major depressive disorder. I am an introverted person with social anxiety which makes it hard to make friends. I can count my friend circle on one hand and a few of them I don't even socialize with often.  Two days ago while reading I came across Avoidant Personality Disorder and it describes my brains functioning to a tee and everything seems to make more sense now. I don't have a license due to anxiety, why be anxious? because I don't want to make a mistake and or be embarrassed or cause an accident. I am anxious when shopping because I feel like I am always in somebody's way. I have trouble forming and maintaining relationships because I tend to be distant or cold. I don't go to social gatherings because I am quiet and never have anything to say. I have been labeled ""weird"" because of that on multiple occasions. I also dislike them because I hate to interject or feel like I am interrupting when I do try to speak. I had a coworker once who said when she first saw me she was actually afraid of me because she thought I was going to be mean and followed it up by telling me I was really nice. Everything about me is just isolating. I also think this is the reason for my depression. I am always lonely, even on the off chance I am with friends. The meaningful romantic relationships I have had ended due to a perceived lack of interest. Others because I got bored or tired of them after a couple weeks to a couple months tops? Is there even any hope for an individual such as myself or should I just resign my self to being lonely for the rest of my time?"	imppie249	post	29.131548390440045	female	White	0.9935599565505981	na	na	na	1	MentalHealthSupport	failed

I have been struggling with the same issue. Though you will often not have a substantial amount free time that allows for this, distancing yourself from your homework for as long as you can while practicing a hobby / doing something that is productive that you find to be easy can be beneficial. Academic burnout is tricky, so, if you can, try to talk with a counselor in order to find a proper path to recovery.	unconfirmedunicorn	reply	na	na	na	0.9994671940803528	weak	strong	no	na	MentalHealthSupport	failed

"I am a college student , I get great marks, I got a wealthy family, everything seems perfect. But somehow I feel really sad. From past some time I don’t feel any emotions it’s like I am watching a movie. The only emotion I feel is anger. I hate my mother she’s never emotionally available, today morning she told me I should be more stable, when she’s the one who screams and cries one moment and laughs the next. 

I don’t want to come back home, I come back after two weeks, in hostel in my room I cry every night. I really want to be at home but because of her I don’t want to. 

I don’t want to live it’s really hard, nobody seems to understand. I feel absolutely numb but since this morning I’ve been crying. My eyes hurt.

Do not bother wats happening around you.wake up with a big smile on ur face . Sit for some time time with closed eyes , as long as u can sit with no thoughts. 
Why dont you try meditation. Focus on urself consciously , Every moment is inevitable.live ur life moment to moment not like today n tomorrow. 
Start prcticing this consciously , try to meditate.focus on ur breath . See the nature consiously.

" Hi, this might seem like a rant. But recently (this whole semester has been feeling like a fever dream). I gained like 20ish lbs and have been feeling quite depressed even in happy moments of my life. Every morning I wake up, I am frustrated that I have to start another day.

I have been doing pretty well in my first year at uni grade-wise (my mental health in first year was shit and I was struggling with sleep and got diagnosed with anxiety disorder). I was receiving small scholarships, getting lab opportunities and feeling proud of myself for getting ahead. I am in my second year now, my first-semester grade had been great (4.0 GPA and the averages for those classes are all low 70 ish with over 200 people). But the second semester, I am not feeling myself (depressed, skin breaking out, not working out enough, also got a little kitten whos a lot of work) and I am doing below my expectations for quite a few exams. I feel like I am being too hard on myself because I constantly feel disgusted by my unmotivated self, but I am TERRIFIED of taking exams now because I have been doing really terrible on exams (self-sabotaging during exams) and I am overplaying everything in my head. I am extremely self-aware of my issues and know I need to stop but I just can't.

I have dreams that NEED at least a PhD degree and I am already tired during my undergrad? I will be starting a summer job working in an amazing lab but I am scared I will be incompetent and I totally lack confidence in myself (the other hired summer student is super amazing at what he does).

I am just so sick and tired of myself. Sometimes I can't help but slap myself when I am studying and have self-harm thoughts. I am constantly complaining about my marks to the point where my friends are a little bit upset by them. Yes, school is a major issue because of the exam confidence I've lost, but I am more disgusted with my current state rn (overweight, greasy hair, total lack of confidence, complaining all the time and shitty exam performance).

Yes, I do base my identity on my grade because it has A LOT OF impact on my chosen career. Also, it is an amazing confidence booster when u do better than everyone else.

I have 2 midterms tmr after bombing another important midterm last week. I am judging myself constantly, how do I stop?"	mindaduck	post	15.525045837647536	female	White	0.9990836381912231	na	na	na	2	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.

"For the past 8-ish months, I've felt consistently down and almost hopeless. These feelings seem to waver in their intensity, and seem to back off when I distract myself with something pressing. However, as soon as whatever situation I was in clears up or I have time alone, the sadness and the hopelessness comes right back. About two months ago, I started to wonder if what I've been feeling is normal. I began to look into different types of depression—specifically high functioning—and noticed I share a few symptoms.

1. Very little interest or pleasure in my hobbies
2. Feeling sad and hopeless
3. Inconsistent sleep schedule
4. Feeling incompetent/without meaning

With all of these things in mind, I decided it would be best to ask other people for advice. First, I talked to my mom (who has depression). She said that medication had helped her but therapy was also an option, and that we should probably get a doctor's opinion. Ultimately, she was pretty indecisive about what I should do, and seems to have forgotten about our conversation entirely. I spoke with another friend who experienced clinical depression, and they essentially told me to suck it up because other people have it worse. This puts me where I am today. I feel pretty invalidated by what a few people have said to me, and I'm left wondering about my mental health as a whole. I know the sadness I'm feeling isn't normal, but on the other hand, I feel like I shouldn't be complaining when other people have it so much worse. Does anyone have any thoughts on what I could be going through or suggestions of some kind? Feeling pretty lost right now."

"The fact that you think other people are worse is totally putting your own feelings on the side and you kind of tell yourself that you have no right in the sadness. That’s not true ! Everyone feel differently things but you have to take the matter in your hands because if you want too long, the hope will be gone and suicide thoughts can occur. 
I did 3 depressions and i past the “worse” of the last one few weeks ago so it’s still fresh and fragile but the best advice I can give you is to go see a therapist, just to speak, to complain, having someone who doesn’t judge and just want to help. After that, do some blood test because you could also see low anemia, magnesium or white cells which can cause your body to shutdown and take you in depression but if you get meds to get eveything back to normal it’s pretty amazing (I had anemia and that caused my first depression) .
Also get follow by a psychiatrist because they have the good antidepressant and sometimes depression can be the meaning of something else. Don’t be scared to try different meds, I had 6 before finding the one (I tough I was not gonna make it honestly) and she gave me some sleep meds too.

Also the line to call for suicide and crisis is awesome, I had amazing people who saved me few times when I didn’t had my meds yet.

I got to really dark places and I know you feel alone, nobody can understand how hopeless, disgusted by life, uninterested by everything you feel. BUT WE R HERE, we are survivors, we work on ourselves and know the bad signs. If you want to pm me to speak and exchange about anything go for it !"

"I’m sorry about your situation. Personally, I don’t think that any success is worth the cost of a life, especially when it’s not a success you’d even attribute to your life. 
You have a passion, I’d infer. Getting into art school is proof of that in itself, most artists don’t even head that direction. But, a lot of people do end up piped into lives they don’t necessarily want. 
From one perspective: you could argue that dreams don’t necessarily die, they simply adapt. If you were to persevere into a life of business, your knack for art may stick around- maybe as a side-hobby or a part-time job. 
But from another, you could end up nothing but a spectator to the slow muting of what you once dreamed to do.
In my advice, do what makes you happy. It’s a simple, often over-iterated term. Short and snappy, which all the more adds to the realism of how often- in this type of capitalistic society- doing what makes you happy isn’t always feasable. Especially as an artist. But, in the end, happiness is what powers near-everything. 
People often attribute lots of different emotions, causes and abstract nouns to what makes people tick- what makes people do what they do, makes the workd go around. But, often, you’d find that so fucking much of what people do. What people put to their entire lives. It’s all for happiness, in one complex way or another. 
People often tell the downsides to dreams like being an artist. But ultimately, it’s likely their dreams were subjugated also. I will not deny that doing what you want, in your position, will be a hard decision to make. It will likely change a lot. But, it will mean so much. 
You could have what so many business taking, back-bending, urban crawlers really want. 
Happiness, yknow? 
I don’t know who you are, what system you’re in, nor it’s individual corruptions. But, as most degrees go, you’ll likely be conveyored to an extended version of your current business course if you continue. But, it’s also good to remember your options. Conversion courses exist for some art schools, and you could always proceed with business and then go on to art school- maybe even combining the two.

"Idk I’ve just been feeling like I don’t get as much joy out of a couple of things that I used to enjoy.

Some of the feelings that I used to get when I would do certain things aren’t there anymore. It's mostly just small things like watching a show that I like or playing games that I once enjoyed. I just don’t get as much enjoyment from them as before, I just feel empty, and I’m kinda scared that I will never enjoy them again or that it will just get worse for other things as well.

It’s like I have a bad habit of not enjoying the moment. Like I don’t really notice how happy I was until I no longer feel that way, and then I just end up feeling empty and a little painfully nostalgic, like I want to go back to finding joy in things like I once did.

I try to force myself to enjoy things the same way I once did but for some reason it just feels wrong now, like I'm trying to pretend to feel in a way that I no longer do.

Does it go away on its own and will I be able to enjoy things like I once did or am I supposed to just find new things to enjoy? I don't want to let go of the things I once liked but I'm scared that I'll never be able to enjoy them the same way again, and that I'll just have to keep finding new things to enjoy just for the sake of not feeling empty anymore."

"As the other comment stated your having a bout of burnout or depression, but I disagree with the fake it till you make it statement, especially when it comes to games or things that involve other people it can lead to you resenting it so id take a break go out and touch grass as everybody says nowadays XD

In all seriousness tho I have been where you are I stopped enjoying the games I played mostly because of the new mentality when it comes to PvP for farming tears instead of just bettering yourself, cheating is also running rampant too that doesn't help matter when it comes to burnout and depression.

So go out explore new things find new interests and maybe come back to gaming in a few weeks or months to see if its enjoyable then, if your a big pvper maybe even find a solo game with a good backstory to come back to (personally I love the final fantasy and god of war games)  that way you can decide if its just gaming in general that you don't like anymore or if its just the current mentality going around in online games right now. Ff14 is also a great mmorpg to try if you haven't already, it has an amazing and welcoming community, anyways hope this helps you can get through this weather you fake it till you make it or go try new things for a while, just do what ever makes you happy =)"	Akirex5000	reply	na	na	na	0.9974820017814636	no	no	no	na	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.
Yeah it’s weird. The rational part of me knows that I obviously still enjoy these things. But part of me is still scared into thinking that I won’t enjoy these things anymore. The episodes seem to be getting shorter and shorter and what seems to be working so far is to distract myself. The more I overthink it the more I feel like I don’t enjoy these things anymore, but I think the best way is to just let myself enjoy these things naturally instead of forcing it.

I've been here for over a week now, and until two or three days ago the room next to mine was empty. Now there's this girl who just bangs her head to the wall between us. It's causing me anxiety because its so loud and honestly its also just so fucking annoying. I've told the nurses, they either go nicely ask her to stop, which she obviously doesnt or they take her away for a while but after a few hours she's back and continues. I've also asked to get a new room but there arent any free. Even listening to music doesn't drown the noise, it's so loud. It wakes me up in the morning and I'm so tired.

Its rough dealing with other peoples mental problems that's why I dont really believe in wards like that, just try to remember shes going through her own shit and while a bad one is probably her coping mechanism.

Another reason is she could be doing it to is making you miserable to give herself a little bit of enjoyment and distraction from her own mental issues, try ignoring her or maybe even reach out to her and try to help her, more support is probably what you both need, hell everyone can probably do with a little more support in there lives, sometimes the best friendships start off rocky...

" Idk if this belongs here but I wanted to ask for suggestions/help, I (14m) was diagnosed with cptsd about 6 months ago, had an abusive step dad and a inattentive mother, we lived on a hobby farm and as a coping mechanism I would kill an animal, it started off with chickens and escalated to cattle and horses, after about 4 years of that I was moved into my fathers care and am looked after very well and see two psychologists every week but idk what is wrong with me, I hear voices that won’t go away until I kill but this relief only lasts 1-2 days and now that I no longer live on a farm I have to kill stray cats, birds and mice, my dad found this very disturbing and got a psychologist to help me find a healthy coping mechanism. The psychologists have not worked yet but I dont want my dad to worry anymore so I stopped killing but the voices were getting overwhelming so I tried sh, this made the voices stop but only for about a day, I have so far continued this but I am afraid of my dad finding out and my shoulders and thighs are covered in scars. 

Sorry if this is very messy and unorganised, idk what to do, I’m sick of sh but the voices get so overwhelming especially at school, it makes me feel like shit killing and having an urge to.

I am 90% sure I have ADHD as these are my symptoms: A) I can't concentrate on anything, I have to tie myself up to even read my favorite books. I can't even do things I like for an hour straight. Since childhood, I have procrastinated until the last minute. Nothing, nothing has helped me be productive. I HAVE TRIED EVERYTHING. B) When I get these periods of hyper-fixation, I just cannot think about anything else, and I only wish to do those things I'm currently hyper-fixated on. C) I tend to forget things all the time and there are many more symptoms but I'm getting too tired to list them all. So I cannot access therapy thanks to my parents and live in a country where mental health is taboo so what can I do to get out of this dilemma?


I have to do something because I have a test in two days and I haven't even touched my books and can't get myself to touch them. I just can't get myself to do anything, except pace around the room.

Self-medication and self-diagnosis are difficult. It could be something entirely different, but at least the symptoms match up.

1. Try this channel on YouTube: https://youtube.com/@HowtoADHD

She's been an ENORMOUS help to me!

2. Try some ""natural' stimulants, such as caffeine. I have several cups of tea in the morning and, even on days when I don't take my meds (weekends), that stuff has me super efficient for a few hours!

All the symptoms you listed are all symptoms of depression too, self medication is the worst thing you can do....

I hate to do this because I'm not a therapist or anyone close to it I have just been through some shit in my life and have been at rock bottom, that being said because of the situation you say your in I'm going to give you advice I don't normally give people

Are melatonin and herbs such as marijuana easily obtained? Both will help you sleep and the herbs will help take the edge off, you need to start by getting your sleep back on track, that will help a lot with your mental fortitude 

Some tools that might help are:

Deep breathing focus only on the breathing for about 10 minutes, after you need to think about things you like about yourself.

Prayer/meditation its weird to group them together but they achieve the same thing, mental calmness once you have achieved that you need to remember what that feels like so when your anxiety or your hyper fixation as you call it start to sneak up on you you can catch it before it gets to bad

There are many other tools that you can look up online that will help you control your mental state I suggest looking up tools to help with depression and anxiety, as well as ADHD

If you do have ADHD its not actually much of a mental disorder to be honest (not saying its not difficult to deal with so don't get me wrong) but its your natural fight or flight reflex, not so long ago humans were terrified of everything and didn't have the confidence and safety we do now because we evolved faster then our bodies and our natural instincts haven't been able to catch up yet. A hundred or so years ago you probably would have made a great hunter or protector but in our day and age its called ADHD don't know if that tidbit of information is gonna be useful but when I looked at my disorder more like that it helped with my depression and anxiety

Lastly all three of the disorders I have talked about go hand and hand with each other and its a good bet that you have one if not all of then. I spoke of self diagnoses earlier is a horrible idea, the melatonin and herbs are natural and wont have any adverse effects that prescription grade medication can so please consider those before considering prescription meds without a consultation from someone that can proscribe those medications"	Foolish_Drunkard	reply	na	na	na	0.9980656504631042	no	strong	no	na	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.

When it comes to me feeling hateful or spiteful of myself, i usually just let it happen until it passes. But, i really don't want to hate myself or resent myself for past choices. It also opens up the door to feeling spiteful of others.

I think we both need more self care. And that can take multiple forms. It could be as simple as thinking one genuine nice thing about ones' self. But it also won't fix our thinking overnight. Maybe we're both stuck in one gear when we need to be shifting gears if you know what i mean. If you need more time for yourself, take it. But also im gonna say the things here that any human being needs.

You're absolutely worth the effort. You as a person, there is enough good in us, we are worth the effort to empower each other. Im not religious. I do however believe in our ability to better ourselves through each other.

"Two things before I start: 
1. This is reposted but is my own post
2. I apologize if I mislabel this post

I understand the title is a bit confusing, so let me explain. I have a friend (whom I won't describe for privacy reasons) whom I recently met about two months ago. We both got it off quite well as friends and soon, started sharing traumatic experiences during late-night conversations. For context, I was SA'd twice during 2022 and still haven't gotten therapy for it. All this, along with a nasty rumor being spread about me and getting cheated on, led me to be desperate for friends and social interactions. What I'm scared about, is I think I'm becoming too desperate for attention. I have terrible nights sometimes and will text them about how I'm hurting myself, effectively manipulating them into giving me attention. I feel horrible for this and I believe this greed is seeping into our day conversations as well. They mentioned to me after a moment we had (I'm not sure what to call it, but I was taking everything they said out of context and using it to put myself in the negative light I thought I deserved, and they were responding with how those feelings were nothing special to them) and said that during the entire thing I was guilt tripping them. I seem to do this without even noticing and it needs to stop. 

Is there anything I can do? I have more friends outside of just them, but they're the only ones who have mentioned it.

It's an unhealthy relationship if you seek their attentions by trying to hurt yourself. Your friends must care about you, and they want to maintain this relationship with you. That's why they mentioned this. Try to get their attention with positive things. Or activities that you know your friends will also enjoy.	throwaway758363	reply	na	na	na	0.018693340942263603	no	no	no	na	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.
"My (28 F) sister (26 F) has had a history of mental health issues that has gotten worse over the years. She threatens to end it often when things are not going well and this past incident was probably the worst. Every week she is facing a hardship. It really seems the world is out to get her but in it all I try to remain positive, but she doesn’t want to hear it. 

Back when she was still in high school she had tried oding & I found her. When she was coming in and out she’d voice how my mom (mid 40s F) and I were to blame for how she turned out. My mom for bring her into a world without financial stability and me, well I still don’t exactly know what she blames me for. 

After this since she was still a minor she was admitted and treated. Then, diagnosed with bpd and medicated with a low dosage. Over a few months docs saw improvements and actually took back their diagnosis and said she was just lashing out. 

In the later year we still saw reoccurring issues, low motivation, paranoia, remained pessimistic, lost interest in things. Very high highs and low lows. 

Fast forward over a decade she is unstable in every aspect. During the pandi she did not use her stimulus money wisely and got way too comfortable receiving those checks. Then the bad habits caught up to her. Lost her apartment and moved in with a roommate off line(mom and I decided we could no longer live with her). Could no longer afford a car she started paying for with stimulus money. 

She recently had been sharing her dark thoughts of harming herself and others with me. It’s scary thoughts that I tell her to try to stay away from and that they are not healthy. I repeatedly tell her to seek help but she just sees it as a waste of money and does not look for resources. 

She has not been in contact with my mom since my mom felt it would be best to block her since she has not only drained her mentally but also financially and spiritually. I let my mom know what is going on and she has a welfare check done on my sister. Once the officer arrives they say she seems fine but the contact me to ask why I thought she needed the welfare check so I go through what has been happening and the officer asks for screenshots. From there he decided to go back and I guess do an even more thorough check and deciders she needs to be admitted. She taken forcefully and sedated at the hospital and we don’t know about her for a few hours. Maybe 4 hours later we’re updated that she is just asleep and that she’ll talk to a doctor once she wakes up. 

Once she woke up she talked to a doctor and he was ready to release her until he spoke with me on the phone. Apparently, she was not being honest in their talk. 

She’s later able to make a phone call to me and immediately asks me “what did you say to the doctor?” That after talking to me he did not feel well releasing her. 
Then starts blaming me for losing a week of work/productivity. 
Tells me there’s nothing they’re doing but putting people to sleep there. And that where she was is not a magical place for her to get help but just a setback, that she has things to get done.

No I feel like I did a bad thing. She told me to find a way to get her out and to contact the doctor to tell them to release her. I told her I wouldn’t do that and that if they called me again I would be honest and not do what she’s telling me to do . She told me that she was not going to harm herself like those messages said and that I read them out of context. I didn’t. They’re graphic messages that cannot be misinterpreted.

Did I do the wrong thing? I’m the only person she has left and she is pushing me away. She doesn’t see the work i put in by trying to see her once a week an calls it pitiful. Says I only talk to her when things are bad but I think it’s the other way around. she’s the one that contacts me when things are bad but will never ask for help and is still willing to receive help. She had actually accused my mom of only being there for her when she was in need but all by mom was trying to do was help her daughter. Idk what is wrong or right and I feel guilty that she’s not seeing that she can get help."

"You did not do the wrong thing. It’s very common for people to be dishonest or downplay their situation upon being admitted involuntarily. I’ve seen patients blame anyone and everyone but themselves, sometimes saying “I only said that while I was drunk/upset” or “I didn’t mean it” but if they said it in the first place this is not to be taken lightly. 

She will probably be upset for a little while but don’t let her make you feel guilty. She seems to have some deep issues that she is not receiving adequate care for and maybe this will be the time that she takes it seriously. 

You absolutely did the right thing. It is very hard to have family or friends in this situation especially when they don’t have the insight to see what they are doing that might be causing others distress. If I had to fathom a guess without extending outside my realm of practice, she is likely the kind of person who faces very extreme emotions and in those moments may feel, do, and say things that are very concerning, but when those emotions pass, she may seem to forget that anything had even happened at all and has moved on. 

The truth is that you read nothing out of context, she just doesn’t maybe feel the same way right now as she did in that moment. This does not at all mean that she shouldn’t be there. If she made threats of harm to herself or others, you should absolutely be concerned. The issue with people who have these kind of emotions is that they can be impulsive, so removing her from whatever situation was causing that kind of stress was a good call. 

Keep in contact with that doctor and any other staff that you can. Be honest with them (perhaps even mentioning that she is trying to manipulate your feelings about the situation) and do not let her convince you to help her leave. You are not providing her care so you have no ability to properly assess her safety. Just hang in there. She is safe and that is what matters. 

I would suggest also taking care of yourself if you need it. Carers like yourself may take on a lot of stress without realizing it. If you need to talk to someone yourself, do take the opportunity to do so."	Primary_Language_444	reply	na	na	na	0.9842458367347717	weak	strong	no	na	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.

"I'm not sure how to really articulate this, so if this doesn't make sense I'm sorry in advance.

I was diagnosed with anxiety and OCD a few years ago, and ADHD last year. I deal with distressing ruminating thoughts about things that I care about, making me unable to enjoy them. It's almost like anything that I don't really have to concentrate too hard on my brain makes me ruminate about, like it's a machine constantly working on overdrive. I'm now on zoloft which I've been on for two years, and ritalin which I started this year.

The medication has helped to an extent, the anxiety symptoms are less prominent, the rumination isn't quite as strong and I'm functioning better in terms of ADHD stuff. But what hasn't gone away is my inability to relax.

I'll try to explain it:

I can't fully enjoy anything. Whenever I do something I love, my brain works too hard. I don't know how to explain it, maybe it's agitation? Some kind of energy in my brain. I'll give some examples:

1. I went to a concert and saw one of my all time favourite bands. They were absolutely INCREDIBLE, and I had a great night. However, even though I had a great night and everything was perfect, I had this energy in my brain that stopped me from being able to relax. I tried anchoring my thoughts to stay present, breathing etc. but I realise now that I was present, and I wasn't anxious, so this didn't really work. This meant I wasn't really able to have fun to a full extent, like I did, but couldn't relax? It's hard to explain.
2. My passion is music. Whenever I make music, I enjoy it, but this 'agitation' stops me from having fun. Like, I enjoy it, and I can feel myself enjoying it but I can't have fun, because the other half of me is feeling like this.

Sometimes there's thoughts attached to this energy in my brain, for example at the concert I was worried about the fact that I messed up a few lyrics, I know how silly that is and it didn't even bother me, but it was something that my brain could attach itself to to ruminate. Other times though, there's no thoughts attached, also like the concert where I used my strategies to work through that worry, but the feeling was still there, also when I'm making music I feel it even without thinking something.

It's like my brain NEEDS to churn over something. It needs to take relaxation away, meaning everything I love is rendered not very fun, even if it's something I'm enjoying. It's so hard to explain, like there's this feeling on one side and enjoyment on the other. It's like there's energy inside my brain, not anxiety because I don't feel it physically. UGH I can't explain it.

I feel like I'm running out of hope. I can't take this anymore and I just want to relax and have fun without this torment. I've tried mindfulness which has helped to calm anxiety and keep me present, I've tried breathing which has done the same, I've tried exposure therapy which has made OCD lose it's effect a bit, but whatever this is can't seem to be beaten. It's not that I'm anxious, it's not that I'm not present. Maybe it's that I'm on high alert? Under pressure? My brain feels like it's on overdrive and it won't stop.

I guess the best way to describe it is my brain feels uncomfortable all of the time.

Pressures from school feed it too, I get a similar feeling from that where I want to relax but I'm worried about what I need to do. That's not the only cause like I said, it's just something else I thought I should mention. Like all Sunday I'm frustrated and thinking about how I need to go to school the next day. I know that sounds like anxiety and probably is though. I think it's just another thing that my brain attaches itself to like I was saying earlier. It's like it wants to think about something so that I can't relax.

Sorry if this doesn't make sense. Please comment if you have anything that should be clarified.

Can anyone give me some insight on what I'm experiencing, or does anyone relate and can maybe help me to articulate it better? I'm seeing a psychologist regularly but it's more focused on anxiety and ADHD.

I used to experience similar symptoms where my brain would ruminate on certain things that I really liked, and it would happen so often that I wouldn't like the thing anymore. Like, I'd start thinking about some of my favorite hobbies, and I'd be afraid that by overruminating, i wouldn't like/enjoy it anymore. Medication fixed it for the most part.

"I am currently 24 years old. I am holding a good,  quite high paying job. A good supporting family, friends. On paper, my life should be good. Even I feel like my problems aren't really that big of a deal or I am just being over dramatic.

But last 1/1.5 year I am just kinda lost motivation for everything. I stopped going out much. I broke up with my girlfriend of 2 years with some lame excuses. I am pushing my friends and family away. Just spending my weekends watching Netflix. I guess I am an ambivert ? I like partying. But I like sitting by myself just as much, playing video games, watching movies etc. Few months back I went for a regular health check up and turns out I am well on my way to have liver fat, cholesterol basically all those trashy health situations you get from drinking too much and eating junk food always. 
But I am starting to think may be I'm using this as an excuse to isolate myself more and more. The more I do this the more I am ashamed and the more I hate myself.
I feel like I should be doing so much more. I feel like I am letting everyone down. I was thinking about going back to college to get my master's degree but I don't even feel like doing that anymore. I even make excuses to office and do work from home to avoid people sometimes. I don't really know why I am doing these. 

Next weekend is my 25th birthday. But I just told my friends I am going home and told my family I can't go back home due to work. The plan was to chill and stay at home doing f-ing nothing. But today this just struck me. What the hell am I doing. After a deep self reflection today I realized I need to stop going downhill any further. 

Does everyone feel that way at some point ? Is this just a phase that'll go away ? Is this supposed to be normal ?

"I have been dating my boyfriend for about eight months now and up until fairly recently I would say we have a healthy relationship. He expressed to me a few months in the he's experienced depression before and was diagnosed with it in middle school. However he was not experiencing any depressive episodes when we first met or throughout the majority of our relationship so far. 

I too have experience with depression and was diagnosed with mild depression and anxiety a few years ago. I spent about two years in cognitive behavioral therapy to improve my mental health. Recently I noticed a change in my boyfriend's mood and how he seemed not really excited about doing things together as much as he used to or going on dates and suspected he was starting to get into a depressive state. He would say things like how he just wishes he could go away somewhere where no one could find him on multiple occasions and just overall seemed a lot less happy.

He's been having a more stressful time recently due to being six months away from graduating university and worrying about the future. Which I suspect may have triggered this. I have been doing my best to support him and listen to his worries and give him advice, but recently I started to feel like when he spoke about the future he wasn't involving me in his plans which honestly triggered anxiety about the relationship for me.

I called him one night and told him about how I was feeling a lot less emotionally supported and that something was off in the relationship and basically felt he wasn't thinking about his future with me. He told me that wasn't his intention but then asked how I felt about our relationship now.I told him I was still happy being with him but felt we had things we need to work on. He admitted he wasn't 100% happy in the relationship right now and was struggling to feel his emotions and attraction and has been for about a month or so. He said he feels his depression has never felt like this before and at times it feels overwhelming and scary. However, he does not feel ready to seek help right now such as therapy and wants to try to handle it by himself. 

I of course want to support him during this time and help him however I can but felt like he was pushing me away which he admitted he was. Basically he said he doesn't think we can continue the relationship normally because he would feel like he was pretending if we were to go on dates right now. I've been trying to be as understanding as possible and not take what he's saying too personally as I do want to be in this relationship. We ultimately decided to take a break for two weeks to evaluate our feelings and the  relationship. I want to give him the time and space he needs, but worry if by suggesting the break I made the right decision as I didn't want to pressure him too much. 
I still want to show him I love  and support him as I chose to be in a committed relationship with him, through good and bad. But I'm also aware that he's very stubborn about actually doing anything to address what's happening right now even down to not wanting to do research about depression and how it may be affecting him.

I think I'm just looking for some advice from anyone who's been in a similar situation as this is all very recent and I'm wanting to approach things in the right way and still be there for him, but worry that he may already be emotionally checked out from the relationship as he can't feel his feelings/ feel enjoyment or like he's getting anything from the relationship right now."	dear-seoul	post	25.510632049839927	female	White	0.9917911291122437	na	na	na	2	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.

And I’m sure this can be triggering for where you guys will stand considering it sounds you have put in valuable work into you mental health and made the effort to address the gap in the relationship.. 

I would prepare yourself for worse and hope for the best. I hope he can come around and put effort in but you cannot sacrifice your mental health either. 

Have you discovered attachment styles? I’d practice your own mindfulness and feel this worry but working to rise above it. Easier said than done and hard to explain, but through some self awareness and growth, stay strong in this. For whichever way it turns. 

Communication is very important in relationships and also dating is a learning experience. So remember if this doesn’t work out, it is an experience that you can learn from. And it’s okay to feel sad about this and in the meantime, just give the time and practice the mindfulness and knowing you’re going to be okay either way, believe that, and address it at the 2 week mark. 

I hope the best for you, I do, I just know from my experience, it’s better to let someone go if it’s not compatible, practice coping skills, grounding techniques to navigate. Don’t worry too hard right now, as it’s out of your control, 2 week mark, like I mention would be a time to see what the next phase holds for you two."	dear-seoul	reply	na	na	na	0.9917911291122437	weak	no	no	na	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.
"I've been where you are, one thing that I learnt from my experience is that you both have to walk through the lessons together. For me, it made me view, such periods as learning lessons for a couple. ""What are you learning from this?"" Approach basically.

I learnt that taking learning lessons and being more informed on the problem at hand helps in managing situations. On my end, I was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder and my goodness, I was soo shocked and saddened by how my distortion of reality made my partner feel after I finally recovered but all the same, learning myself more and doing more work on being aware of myself helps in being able to lead my partner through it all, so it made me learn that you have to take it like an exercise in learning. Imagine you both in a class learning about a topic or subject and how you'd revise on it to better learn. That's what I learnt. You both learn on the road.

Depression does suck but being more informed to be able to understand you can somewhat have more patience and know how to work through the periods."	dear-seoul	reply	na	na	na	0.9917911291122437	weak	strong	no	na	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.
Hi, Recently my depression has gotten really bad, and i attempted to overdose but it failed. I told my bf about it because i feel like he should know, but ever since i told him he's behaving cold to me, notmessaging me and saying he has nothing to say to me. We have been in a relationship for 1 year and 3 months. I'm not sure what to do or say.  i was hoping someone could help me understand why my bf has distanced himself from me.	dynastey01	post	20.371369485841278	female	White	0.9992716908454895	na	na	na	3	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.

When a depressed person’s partner has to experience these things, it can be difficult to know that the person they’re trying to support is still depressed anyway. My bf has issues understanding this too. He feels personally slighted when my depression gets the better of me, and it usually leads to him feeling anxious and sometimes angry over it because he (probably) feels like all of his efforts aren’t being appreciated or noticed by me. Unfortunately that’s not how depression operates; people who are living their best life right now can still suffer from depression.	dynastey01	reply	na	na	na	0.9992716908454895	no	strong	no	na	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.
"My ex had a few mental health issues. She attempted suicide once during our relationship, and self-harmed a handful of times. Regrettably my first reaction was often one of anger and frigidity. I felt as if she was throwing away everything, ignoring the good, and most of all I felt like I had failed in keeping her happy. 

Not everyone is ready to handle these sorts of issues, we aren't trained professionals, and even as someone who has dealt with mental health problems as well, in the moment it still felt hard to relate. It isn't your fault of course, but it doesn't stop people from reacting how they will.

Over time I learned how to understand and respond much better to these events, and my ex got much better as well.

Melatonin its a over the counter supplement that you can take at any age, first thing you need to do after signing up for a therapist is get your sleep schedule back on track and the melatonin will help, sleep dose a lot more for the mind then people think it dose

Second thing to start doing is breathing deep, corny to be told that I know but when your focusing on breathing deep your focusing on that not the mental assault your putting yourself through, do this for about 10 minutes and then start thinking of your positive aspects and things you like about yourself 

3rd thing you can try is prayer/meditation kinda weird to group them together but they fall in the same category when it comes to mental health its a way to focus and control your mind, once you have achieved a calm mind you need to remember what that feels like, then when you notice your emotions sneaking up on you you can focus on your breathing again  

These are just the tricks that worked for me, the sleep one is a given but a therapist will tell you these these tools and more so go talk to one or a school consoler"	kawaiiiii_potato	reply	na	na	na	0.9991447925567627	no	no	no	na	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.

I don't know what happened to me, but I was taking an exam for a language class. I was doing the work, and I had to answer the questions in said language. I felt like I had the answers, but I couldn't process them. I felt all weird. I kinda remember gasping a little? And I was trying to snap out of it, so I started digging the pencil into my hand but that didn't work either. I couldn't think. I spent like a good forty minutes just…off. I kept trying to scratch at myself and pull my hair to get back to normal. I couldn't write down the answers, and I was getting more and more stressed because everyone else was finishing. The teacher came over to me to see what was taking me so long, but I couldn't explain, I could barely even speak. She just ended up pointing out what was already wrong on my sheet and leaving. And then five minutes before the class ended I managed to snap out of it some and didi the entire worksheet, I turned it in just as the bell rang. And it took me like a half hour to get fully back to normal, I was all shaky and I felt like I couldn't speak properly. Everything was too loud and too bright.

"Sometimes, when put in certain situations where I cry, I tend to forget to break and go into almost like a panic state. I start to hyperventilate in a way, I used to smack myself in the head as a kid to make it stop as it would also make hiccups happen.

I couldn’t explain in words, I just knew I had to be alone in that moment to recoup and make it so I could talk. I ended up locking myself into a closet to end my crying and found something to fidget with to not focus on not being able to breathe.

I’m having the same problem. My anxiety has been so bad and constant lately that I’ll often work myself into such a state where I break down and start crying and hyperventilating. The worst part is that it’s nothing in particular that sets it off, it’s like a semi-constant thing now. I guess if I had to pinpoint a set off, it’s whenever I even think about getting that “feeling” that like a self-fulfilling prophecy I get anxiety and get worked up into a panic attack. What’s helping for me right now(until I get on medication and start going to therapy sessions) is actively trying to talk to my subconscious and have a civil conversation on what the causes of the anxiety are and if there is anything I need to say out loud or talk about with them. Sounds goofy but it’s helped me.	uknownnwaffle	reply	na	na	na	0.9852281808853149	no	strong	no	na	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.
"I am 19 and I cleared my class 12th in 2021. After completing the school, very few students (so called friends) contacted me. I was always the first person to message them and I even planned an outing which was very difficult because many of them were not ready initially. For this I created a group also but now only 1 member is present in that group, all others have left the group. Now, I am in second year of my college, but here also I tried to make new friends and have a group also but they never include me in their plans, it might be because I go less to college because of my competitive exam preparation but even when I say them to inform me whenever they go, they don't tell me and upload pictures of their visit and when I ask the reason, they either say I was already planned that's why we didn't invited or it was a sudden plan that's why we didn't ask you.
Now, I just talk to people as a normal and not as a friend. I want to make college memories, go on college trips but these friends always cancels the plans and then make their separate ones.

"i know the title isnt very eye-catching. so i hope at least one person can read this. i dont know how to explain it to you, but im a very “pattern-oriented” person. almost all the things i assume, observe, and recognize is because i constantly arrange it into a pattern. 

ex: (this person) acts like (this) because (this) and ive recognize (this and this etc)

i understand this (topic) because I’ve recognized (this) and (this) and therefore (this) may happened because of (all of those observations) 

the problem with this pattern thing is that it makes me assume my life is a pattern as well. 

ex: if i had a bad month last year january, then i’ll likely have it bad again this year. 

if i did amazing for last year’s 1st school term but did bad at the 2nd term, then it’ll probably happen again. 

if a relationship failed at august last year, then another will bound to fail again this year’s august.

because of this, i start assuming something bad will happen. and i guess thats normal to assume. everyone uses experiences to learn and try to avoid things. the problem is im really trying to just be more positive. these “negative” things wreck me and make me assume something bad will happen and because of my anxiety with that, i end up spiraling and maybe even leading myself back again to that “pattern” that i “assume would happen”. 

another is a make myself do certain “things/actions” in order to avoid “an event” i completely assumed in my head and i think that if i dont do it, something bad will happen. 

ex: if i dont put my snake ring facing upwards then im going it have a bad day because the last time i didnt i had a bad day.

does anyone get what i mean? 

is this normal?

any advice would be amazing.

The only part of that I can think of a potential solution to is the relationship part.

It’s not a one-and-done thing.   Even if you get a diagnosis and prescription, you still need therapy, too.  They work together.  It’s like having surgery for a physical injury.

You may get a prescription to help with the injury, but you have to go to physical therapy to strengthen that part of your body again.  The same with mental health.  You can go to a psychiatrist and get some medicine to help, but you need therapy to help unlearn bad habits the mental illness may have caused, and gain tools to help you function better with your mental illness, as well as dealing with any stress or trauma that may be exacerbating your symptoms."

I feel so lonely, its not that I don't have people in my life it's just I feel so alone except from when I am with people. I got a girlfriend a few months ago because I thought it would help but I didn't really like her so I dumped her and the whole thing made me feel even worse. The friends of the girl I like told me that she likes me but she never messages me back and the girl my friend likes likes me so it just messes up my friendships. It feels like my life is on the verge of falling to pieces. I forgot to do one of my maths tests which was 25% of my grade, I scraped it back and got 100% on the most recent one but I just feel like a failure because I never even tried to get into university all my exams were cancelled and the tests they gave us were easy as shit so it feels like I don't deserve to be here. I was at the club with a girl and then the girl I liked came up to me and then she left and I was just alone and it feels like I never stopped feeling alone since then. I know it sounds so stupid and I know I shouldn't feel sad because I was an idiot and forgot a test and one girl doesn't like me when a lot of others do but I can't help thinking why? Like just asking myself what is wrong with me and it messes me up inside because I start poking at all my other flaws. It's not that I don't have anything good that I am happy about it's just that I feel like it's all on the verge of collapsing, even since last weekend I've lost something that made me happy and it's like this weekend is even worse than last and it's just gonna go on forever. The rational person inside of me knows that it isn't true and a bad week doesn't mean a bad life but my emotions don't listen. It's like I go through periods in life where I am either super happy or super sad and I can't have any consistency. My health is degrading as well.

I would love to tell her therapist to tell her to knock it off, but I know that's totally out of line. This is not an ""ignorance is bliss"" post. I'm educated and aware. I don't need to know every dirty detail of corruption and fascism. I'm mostly concerned that if she doesn't scale back the doom scrolling, she will unravel emotionally and it will have a negative impact on our kids and our marriage. Does anyone have an insight on how I can approach this without offending her or making it seem like I don’t care about her concerns?"

"A couple of points I want to make:

1.  The way you’re approaching the situation is making it worse.  You said she struggles with depression and anxiety, which can cause lack of motivation.  Depression and anxiety can also turn out to be undiagnosed ADHD in some cases.  

I just started seeing a psychiatrist myself, and will be starting therapy soon to address depression and possible ADHD.  I also struggle with the doom scrolling (though not typically on the same topics as your wife) because my brain keeps telling me “Let’s go do this thing we need or want to do!”  And I physically cannot bring myself to get up and do it.  My brain is full of chaos, but on the outside, people just see me doom scrolling on my phone.  I can’t even get myself to do things I like doing, which is incredibly frustrating and upsetting.

Imagine your wife broke her leg, and you come in and tell her to just put the crutches down and walk like a normal person.  That’s what you’re doing right now.  It doesn’t work that way, and your approach is insensitive and unhelpful.

2.  THAT SAID.  You seem very willing to help, which is great!  I’m hoping she’s still seeing that therapist.  I’m not too familiar with how all this therapy stuff works exactly, but I would suggest asking her if she’d mind if you went to an upcoming appointment with her because you’re worried about her, but you need the therapist’s help communicating this in an appropriate way.

If she or the therapist don’t allow this, then I’d look into couples therapy to help you communicate with each other."	MegaCookie811	reply	na	na	na	0.9989578723907471	no	no	no	na	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.
Thank you for your reply. You are 100% correct. I reacted to one of her moments yesterday without even thinking. I had just had enough of mood swings brought on by the doom scrolling that I went into “manager” mode and just made things worse. Now it’s damage control time and it’s hard for me to find the right words. I love that she feels compassionate enough to want to help everyone around the world. In fact, it’s one of the most endearing things about her. I don’t know. I just think she would be happier and healthier if she scaled back. I know that she’ll bring this up with her therapist and hopefully have a fruitful discussion. I’ve never looked for outside advice like this before. I just want her to be happy and enjoy the time that we have together with our kids and each other as much as possible	MegaCookie811	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9989578723907471	weak	strong	no	na	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.

"Hey folks, I am looking to pursue some kind of treatment for a binge eating and cannabis problem which I have been dealing with for a long time. I am 28, and have had a terrible relationship with food from as young as I can remember. As young as 6 or 7 I would eat multiple candy bars in a single sitting. I realize now that I always looked for comfort in sugary foods, and my parents unfortunately weren’t really proactive with restricting the amount I could eat. 

At this point I try to eat healthy, but whenever I get stressed I will compulsively binge eat sugary snacks to the point of physical discomfort. I also do this at any occasion or event where there is a lot of food. 

I have also been a daily cannabis user for around ten years, and find it incredibly hard to stop for any significant amount of time. I definitely use it to nurse my mental health, but it has gotten to the point where the cannabis and eating is starting to really harm my health, particularly my gut and dental health.

I have reached out to the eating recover center based in Chicago, and have been offered to join a virtual outpatient program. The problem is, there will be an expectation that I would not smoke cannabis for the duration of the program. The issue here is that the program will not offer me specialized help for managing the sobriety from weed. Also the fact that it is virtual will mean there is nothing to stop me from smoking which I think would be counterproductive to the treatment. 

I am looking for a treatment plan that can cover both my issues with eating and with cannabis. I have undergone a year of cognitive behavioral therapy in the past which was aimed at anxiety, depression, jealousy and insecurity. I found it helpful but my therapist was very green and I felt we became too familiar for me to be as open as I should have been at times.

Other problems I experience include neuroticism, poor anger management, poor impulse control, low self esteem, social anxiety, low motivation, lack of focus, difficulty maintaining friendships, periods of lowered mood, excess guilt and shame and poor organization skills.

I am not hoping for a miracle, but just want to find healthier ways of coping. I strongly believe that making healthier choices for ourselves is one of the keys to a happy life, and want to focus on implementing positive changes to treat myself and others better. 

I live in Los Angeles,  and am open to all forms of treatment.

TLDR; I am eating and smoking myself to ill health and want help beating my addictions and mood problems.

First, pick one simple addiction and get good at controlling it fully, assuming you are the average guy, things, social media, porn, video games, etc should do the trick

After getting good at controlling one of them, completely cut it out for a while

Than, after a couple months or so of being in the clear, completely stop using cannabis, and if you get significant withdrawals, instead of taking cannabis again endorse in the the simpler addiction you learned to control a few months ago

if everything goes to plan, you will have replaced the cannabis addiction with one you have more control over"	Jumpy-Candy3683	reply	na	na	na	0.10210921615362167	no	strong	no	na	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.

"Most problems started in 2020. In March, the start of covid. I was sick (and i don't know the reason why) and my dad came, from the most southern province of the country back to discuss with me. He announced that the divorce i did not know about was gonna happen, and kinda after that day he just left to my step family. That's part one: the divorce. 
After a few months when we were all emotionally unstable i went to visit to their house and also sleep there. From 2020-2021 most of those events happened. There are a few key moments. There were moments where my step brother (2 then) and step sister (7), were pretty annoying. I hate them both. At some point in 2021 there was conflict and i got so mad i pointed a knife towards my step mother that i still hate. Since then was i not allowed to there anymore. That's the divorce part. 

Now for the school and crush part. So since 2020 I've had a crush on someone (gender unconfirmed) and we were friends, lifelong. Together with my childhood friend, we were the 3 Musketeers. But my crush began to hate on my friend, causing me to have to choose for 1. I chose my crush, not to realize she was already internet dating with people scattered across the world. So i changed my mind and chose my friend. After this change my crush began being extremely toxic and is now my enemy, also causing some bad traumas. 

The basic school: i was never a group's child. I'm not bullied, neither accepted. I didn't really have much friends, except 2 till now (IRL). Most others betrayed me. 

My mom: i live alone with my mom, and some conflicts made. Maybe this is just puberty, or Asian parenting. But i don't quite believe she really does love love me. 

The interneg saga: since fall 2022, I've been playing a lot of hypixel. I met someone (a girl) and she invited me to her SMP. I met a lot of friends and we had fun. Around september the SMP kinda died and nobody really joined anymore. I downloaded discord again, and begon chat with 2 of friends. The girl was really unactive on both discord and minecraft (she's only active at breaks apparently). The other friend was a 16 year old Austrian boy. He was the first internet friend. We were great friends. After that success, i began gaining more internet friends. I decided to recall my old youtube series SMP, and invited him, along with 3 other friends. After that success i opened a discord server for the friends too. More friends were coming. When at a rare moment, i realized i had feelings for the girl that invited me to the SMP (as she really knew me and accepted me, even helping me with my murder habit). Sadly she's still only online around school breaks. At some point at January, one of my internet friends invited a guy named Oz. He played on my creative server along with other friends. At one point he decided to be bad and destroy my steakhouse in game (almost). I banned him from both servers. Others disagreed, so a month later he re-appears. He then tried to grief. So he was banned again. Then a weird glitch happened to the server, and for no reason he was re-invited. A hacker was controlling him (unsure, great chance he lied). We ""solved"" the hacker, but then some conflict came. I said not so nice things to him, as nuking his country or that the hacker may come back to hack him and his family. The Austrian boy, was really scared out by this and left in neutrality. He thought i was going insane so unfriended me. He said i needed mental health help. 

What should i do. I don't think i have a bad life, but that's because i compare it to African starving children. Am i going through depression, puberty or is this normal?"

Are you in the UK? My hair started to fall out, and it was due to physical illness. It grew back once I had some meds to sort the issue. Get your bloods tested at your GP's. They can do a physical health check-up. That is a starting point. You can also self refer to primary care services for therapists to help with your self-esteem. Your gp will be able to refer you. Please don't let this go unchecked, as it can make you spiral down.  But also, remember, a lot of girls aren't bothered about men's hair. They want to be treated right.

Making videos has made me realize and value how sad I am. Even the slightest amount gives me a small tiny speck of creativity or value. And despite these videos mainly being just logs documenting my process of mental health , I think it also helps encapsulates a better judgement of which other people can relate to on a certain degree. I’ve been trying to be more I guess open with my emotions per say since I’ve been put on suicide watch and my school counsler wants me to alleviate my pain. Making videos has helped but it also feels unfortunately pathetic. I hope at least to an extent you guys can relate as I’ve had a heavy breakup , but I do make different videos on different prompts/subjects.

"The title really speaks for itself. Do you believe someone completely sound of mind be simultaneously suicidal? Perhaps the question in itself is quite unnerving but the question bothers me. 
I, personally have been struggling with the urges to my own demise for many years now. Despite various recent mental health appointments, I realise that I’m not mentally unwell. Perhaps there is such thing as overly self aware? 
The state of the world we are living in, maybe it’s the media is to blame? I just do not feel able to continue living. I just do not have the desire to work, earn a living to feed myself, wash myself and for what? Death is inevitable for all of us at some point in time. Is it such a bad thing I’d like to fast forward that without the pointless rituals in between? Some may argue that my cynical point of view could be considered proof of depression or is it? If someone who is terminally unwell feels the same way to end their suffering, we wouldn’t dare to call them ‘not sound of mind’. It’s a very interesting discussion to have and perhaps it would benefit me greatly to understand why I feel the way I do."

I'm telling you this because I made it out of that living hell, and I'm happier than I've ever been. And it was surprisingly easy to fix, I was just looking in all the wrong places.

The fix I found is to get help! Visit a doctor and therapist. With the right medication and therapy, it can be life changing. If money is a concern, look into Cerebral, it's an online service that does medication and therapy for a reasonably low price. I use it.

I’m not trying to push any religion on you, but it seems you have a belief in God since you keep mentioning Him and blaming Him instead of just accepting “that’s how the world is, no one is in control.” My advice would be to get connected to a church community that will aid you through this time. I used to be really involved in church in my late high school years and remember those as very happy times. I have not been doing so lately and feel depressed and cry all the time (22F). I think you’re feeling alone from not only people, but God too. See if your church offers free counseling (mine does).

I'm sorry you feel this way. I wish I could help. I think depression works like a glitch. It's a glitch in your brain making it lie to you. There are people who can help you fix it.

Recently my mothers dad passed away and I didn’t feel anything about it, not a drop of sadness. Didn’t shed a single tear, although I still comforted my mother because she is my favorite person in the world (although I try to stay unbiased between my parents it’s pretty obvious I love her more) but recently I haven’t been feeling and it’s scary, I can’t remember the last time I cried or even felt sad or happy, any advise?	sidnfus	post	3.002788091342918	female	White	0.998072624206543	na	na	na	1	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.
Everyone grieves differently and for me when my dog died it took me 5 years to really break down and cry about him. And when my grandpa died I actually laughed about it because it was an awkward situation to hear about after I jinxed his death. And when I was at my grandpa's funeral I didn't feel sad at all I just remember that night I felt like something was missing and I realized it was my grandpa after all. Btw it's weird because after he died I started having dreams of all of my grandparents dying every night until I stopped. and my grandpa showed up in one of my recent dreams where he was alive and walking around our house.	sidnfus	reply	na	na	na	0.998072624206543	no	strong	no	na	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.
I (20f) have moved out almost a year ago. While I got much better mentally I noticed my parents are missing me a lot. They even asked me to spend the whole holidays with them and every time they can they want to spend time with me. All of this is wonderful if it wasn’t that one of my main triggers is them. You might tell me that I’m an ungrateful daughter, but I struggle to stare into the loving eyes of people that emotionally and verbally abused for the longest time without feeling a lump in my throat. Also every time I spend time with them I feel worst. I tried to talk to them about my mental health in the past but they reacted badly by denying the problem and belittling my feelings. I’m not sure on what to do. Should I avoid seeing them so maybe they wonder what they did wrong or is it going to make them even more hostile towards me?	tequila72g8	post	28.546948198177187	male	White	0.9987812638282776	na	na	na	10	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.
It’s a parents job to mentally abuse you to get you ready for the real world.

I don’t totally agree. I know they have been abused more than me but it doesn’t matter because it was their responsibility to heal themselves before having kids. Giving life to someone knowing you aren’t able to handle your role as a parent but still doing it just because you want to have kids is selfish. I’m doing all I can to heal and take care of myself and I know I may never heal and in that case I simply won’t have kids even if I’d really want to. I agree on the fact that I have to tell them because both parts are adults. But if they don’t get the hint now then I’m done, I refuse to hurt myself any further because they refuse to accept reality. I’ll do my best to find a good time and place to tell them and make sure they aren’t blinded by their emotions but what happens next is none of my business	tequila72g8	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9987812638282776	weak	strong	no	na	MentalHealthSupport	failed

Honestly I think I’m a couple steps ahead of them in terms of awareness. I asked my parents for bonding time 5 years ago and I recognized that they did love me despite everything they said 2-3 years ago. The only thing that bothers me a little of myself is that I’m not a forgiver. I stay mad for long periods of time and I remember vividly all sort of things I’ve been told. I guess that it’s a normal response in order to keep my guard up but it’s gonna make it harder for me to really love them.

Focus on the good stuff that happened during the day, tell yourself what you like about yourself, that can be anything like, I'm pretty good at art, I like how I'm good at drawing owls. So you can give yourself a compliment and be specific about what it is you like about yourself.

"I have noticed this for some time now, I get deep into imagining very negative scenarios where I am getting very angry and fighting with someone. They seem to happen every time I am eating alone and not watching TV or doing something alongside eating. I get so deep into these fantasies that I can feel my heart beating faster and I get anxious along with it. I am quite certain that this has been the case for many years now.

A common theme of these imaginative scenarios is that something or someone is disrupting my lunch and then I would lose my shit. A very common imagination is a real one (I think, but I am not sure) where my mom commented how expensive it is getting to feed us now. That happened (supposedly) years ago and I was upset on my mom about this. Now in my fantasies I am sometimes throwing the plate at the wall or simply yelling at her.

Any insights as to why this happens and what can I do to prevent it ?

"Let’s set the scene, i’m a 19 year old male (born male) and i have never physically felt. 

It sounds so strange but the physical feeling that is experienced when an emotion is experienced simply does not occur in my body, the “butterflies” or a feeling of sunken heart i have never once experienced. 

For the longest time people assumed i was autistic and after ADHD and autism tests it proved that was simply not the case, I never had any sort of trauma as a child and my life is average for people my age. often i come across as cold and even therapists have had struggles trying to figure me out. 

However i will admit that i am a chronic manipulator, it’s almost 2nd nature to remember every detail about people and to figure out what makes people “tick” this was i can exploit them for my own gain. i feel no remorse or guilt for this and don’t care what people think of me. i will always be the 1st to admit that i am not a nice person and have made it clear with partners and friends that this is just me, i see a therapist for it but all i take away is different ways to get into peoples heads.

I have no issues using or hurting people close to me as long as i gain, and it’s beginning to raise questions.

i’m not looking for validation or an excuse but simply any idea as to what could be wrong with me.

I've told friends how awful I feel but they always play it off as a joke due to the nonchalant attitude I have towards my issues.

My friend and I were both crying all lesson one time, two hours straight. My teacher was constantly checking on them, but even as j was right beside them crying, I was completely ignored. I've told that teacher about my insecurities and issues before, but they didn't really take notice, maybe because I wasn't crying?

Another friend and I went to see the school counsellor together due to our similar issues. He focused on her the entire time. She was crying, I wasn't. 

I don't know what it is, but no matter how hard I call for help, from flaunting my issues to straight asking, no one takes me seriously.

"This is going to be a long response, so I'll apologize now for that haha!

First off, if you think you've been depressed for the past three years: you probably have been. The past three years have been a complete 180 from what anyone thought we would be living in right now. You have so many things that have happened in the past three years that caused a huge rise in people feeling depressed, anxious, etc. That's not abnormal.

However, let me start with this: being depressed does not define you.

I'm 22 now, and I grew up with similarly controlling grandparents who didn't get it. They thought I was flighty, a drama queen, immature, etc. When I was 16 I attempted to take my own life, and I thank the universe (or God, or whatever you use) that I failed. I only bring this up because I went to the hospital due to a terrible case of bulimia (which is an eating disorder where you essentially purge whatever you eat). My normal weight is about 150lbs/160lbs as an adult. At 16 I was 90lbs.

However, that didn't start from wanting to be skinny. It started because I wasn't able to stomach anything. At least, I convinced myself that I couldn't. I kept changing my diet... pescatarian, vegetarian, vegan... Limiting myself more and more until I was eating spinach leaves for my lunch. It was terrible! I can remember arguing with my grandfather about what to make for lunch because everything that they had in their house was ""bad"" and I couldn't eat it. I realized a lot of this was because my brain did not allow me to eat. My brain wanted control of things in my life because most things around me (school, my job, relationships, friendships, my emotions, even my family) were not in my control. I felt like I was living in a simulation. I think a similar type of thing (on a much smaller scale) could be happening with you and your depression.

Depression can do a lot to a person, but it's important that you do not give it that power. I struggle with this a lot, honestly. And it's not easy. However, it helps when you find safe things in your life that make you feel alive. Pick up a hobby, listen to music that lights up your soul, and develop a support system where you're around people that care about you and want you to thrive. Your support system won't be able to cure your depression, but they should be there to encourage you and listen. It helps to have something to fall back on like a passion or hobby (mine is writing poetry, renovating my house, and making art).

In terms of eating specifically, try small things. For a period of my life I was drinking a lot of my calories through smoothies, iced coffees, teas, sodas, juices, etc. It does help a bit. If you have any negative relationship with food, take the time to remind yourself that no food is ""bad"" in moderation. It's all meant to make you the awesome person you're going to grow up to be!

And my final recommendation, as hard as it may be: try to explain to your mom that mental health is real. Try your best to get a therapist. It saved my life, and even though I'm not currently going, it definitely helps. Even if you can talk to a school counselor (which I did until I could get a therapist) that may help. See if they have any resources. I know I even saw an ad the other day for an online gaming therapy service!

I hope this helps. Please always remember that you are loved, you are special, you are talented, and you are worthy of feeling happiness. I know things may suck, but they will get better over time. Now that I'm 22 I own my own home, have a full time 9-5 job, and I'm planning on going back to school in the next year or so. Things will look up, but remember to take the time for yourself to love yourself and build the foundation you'll need for a happy life. I'm not on Reddit much, but if you do need someone to just vent to, feel free to message me!

I’ve always loved to eat but when I went through my depressive episodes or whatever this is, I always lose my appetite even if my body says I’m hungry I can’t eat. I’ve never been an overly picky eater but I don’t have a particularly big sweet tooth. For example, my dad was going to drop me off with my mom today and we stopped and got donuts, I could only eat half of it before wanting to puke. I’ve also noticed my sleeping schedule has been out of wack. It used to be struggling to sleep at all and now I’m tired all the time and sleeping in as much as possible.

"Hey, sorry just saw this!

Avoidant appetite is totally a side effect of depression. I would honestly see if you can get into a doctor and let them know what's going on. I wouldn't even flat out tell your mom you're ""depressed"" per say but maybe try telling her that you just feel physically sick and that you want to go to the doctor? Would something like that work? 

When you get to the doctors, if you're able to have a one on one session with them, you can have a conversation with them and let them know what you think is really going on. If not, I would just explain everything you're stating now. They may be able to give you something to help with the avoidant appetite and may be able to recommend some things for the sleeping issues too. Once you describe it to the doctors, they'll probably kinda know what's going on, especially because these are all very common things for depression."

Depression makes it very hard or impossible to imagine and plan for the future. So if you’re in a bad place in life, depression will lie to you and tell you that this suffering is all that there is, but its not. There is hope for a better day, and if you cant get yourself to hope for that better day, have hope that you can eventually have hope for that better day. Also like chocolate? Soft blankets? No one said the reason to live has to be reasonable, maybe you really like plants or stars or shoes or music or a tv show, pick a few things, and you’ll find it is worth it being here.

If you're depressed and don't know why seek help from friends/family/doctor/therapist. Try and exercise even if it's just to walk to the corner and back.

If someone has died know that although you will always miss them that you learn to live with your grief and fill the hole they left with other things.

If you feel lonely take up some hobbies. There are lots of free groups you can join.

If you hate your job look for a new one.

Etc etc. Make those changes. At some point how you feel will change too."	Teacup_Nebula	reply	na	na	na	0.002746391575783491	no	strong	no	na	MentalHealthSupport	failed

"Last night I was leaving my flat to go meet with my sister and our friends. I noticed my neighbours mail had pilled up more than normal and his light had been on for a while. He lived alone was very shy to the point he would hide if i was in the hall at the same time. I looked through his front window and found him collapsed. He had died alone which is something i struggle with regularly. Just fearing that ill never meet anyone who i can fall in love with or someone i can enjoy my life with. Am i scared of living or am i scared of reaching the end and realising i didn’t live to my full potential. 

Ive made decent progress with depression and anxiety over the last couple of years since i told my family. It kind of comes and goes and ill have dark days possibly weeks. Im scared this is gonna set me back years of trying to build some sort of self confidence and acceptance that i have this life and its fleeting so make the most. I feel guilty every time i dont shower or brush my teeth. I never have the energy or motivation and i’m just feeding my demons.

I don’t even know why I’m posting here, i hope at least one person reads it i just needed ti put my emotions into words.
Im angry professional help is locked away. The NHS is overwhelmed and you only end up going to very generic sessions that only last until you can be drugged up enough to function as a part of society. I don’t earn enough to spend money on a private therapist either.

"You feel guilty when you don’t brush or shower, then do it. Do the necessities and treat your body with care, and it will care for you too (as it already does).

What is causing you depression? What is causing you anxiety? These are conversations you must have with yourself - write down your fears because step 1 to tackling a problem is to know and understand what it is. FOMO (fear of missing out) is a valid fear but you shouldn’t be worried about dying alone as the end of life isn’t something anyone can control. Build up your self worth and confidence and be open to opportunities. If something is preventing you from doing that, find out what it is and try work on it. The fact that you say you’ve made decent progress makes me believe you are capable. Good luck. 

Also, about your neighbour who died alone (R.I.P) for me things like that don’t bother me too much because I believe in reincarnation. Does that thought maybe help?

Last semester, during my second year of college, I started falling into depression, mixed with anxiety. I couldn't even eat because my anxiety would take control of my stomach and basically everything would give me stomach aches. I had started to go to therapy and it kinda helped. Starting this new semester, I was feeling way better. I could eat normal stuff again and my overthinking was way less. I was starting to feel in control of myself and of my life. Now we are in March and I feel totally hopeless again. I barely have any strength to get up in the mornings, I lost my motivation and excitement for most things I loved and for my major( which I know I love but I just feel numb about it). Apart from all of that, my overthinking is getting the best of me and I can't control it anymore. I'm crying myself to sleep half of the week and I assume that the person that cares the most about me really doesn't and that everything he says about being my best friend and caring for me is all bullshit and I end up spiraling and getting mad at him really easily. I just wanna take control of my life again and not hurt my best friend with my overthinking. I went to therapy again but it didn't help. I also tried working out but it doesn't seem to help much either.

Have you tried smoothies or Carnation Instant Breakfast? at all? They are both really helpful for me when my depression gets really bad. Similar to you, I want to eat but I can't chew, it makes me gag or I can't get the motivation to get it.

"I feel questions like these are from people who haven't been honest with their therapist, there are key words and phrases that they listen for before making that call, 

I tell my therapist constantly I wish I was dead or I wish I would just fall over dead, I even tell him I feel like throwing my newborn out the window sometimes because she crys to much I have even told my therapist sometimes I want to strangle my SO because she makes situations worse with our older kids 

Its how you say things, the tone you use while saying it and if you have a plan or thought out how you would commit the act you have just told them about, the more detailed you are with them about the plan will determine if they report it or not

the problem with most school shooters is they don't go to therapy unless they are forced and normally when someone is forced to do something they don't get any actual benefit to it and pretty much do just need to be locked up"	AshSlingingSlash3r	reply	na	na	na	0.9988394379615784	no	strong	no	na	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.
"It's about how it's phrased. I don't know about acts of violence towards others but I have had to learn to balance tone and wording when discussing violence toward myself with my therapist. Even if I have a specific plan, I wouldn't tell him because that gets you locked up. I tell him that I feel suicidal. That I have been thinking about hurting myself. He asks if I am in danger or have a plan, and even if it's a lie I say no because that is how you get locked up. But I tell him it's severe. I tell him I need help. I tell him I don't want to have to go somewhere. Often (nearly always) you have to be In A Program at that point but at least you still get to go home at the end of the day if you play your cards right. 

The first problem is that they have to ask for help. And asking for help is hard. And when you do get up the courage to ask for help, the response is often not helpful- the first thing my therapist says when I ask him for help is ""What do you want me to do"" and that is the least helpful thing imaginable- I don't know what I need, if I knew I would have gotten it for myself. Or worse, sometimes when you tell people hou need help, they tell you ""no you don't."" It's hard. It sucks. And it puts you directly in the position of deciding whether to give up your autonomy or continue fighting your demons on your own. 

The second problem is that the right help... Doesn't exist. At least not in this country. The help that mentally ill people who are at risk of violence to themselves or others need is just not available. I know I need a third option besides 'struggling alone' and 'being institutionalized' and that third option is having a support system. However, there is no inorganic way to build a support system, and it is damn near impossible to do whole suffering with sevre mental illness. How can I make friends when I can't shower or leave my house? How can I make friends when I feel like everyone hates me? How can I find people who want to take care of me when I feel like I hate everyone, can't trust anyone, like everyone wants to hurt me? In an ideal system, people could be removed from their situations and given a support system or a care team without losing their autonomy, and could use that distance and support to recover and learn coping skills and learn how to become okay on their own."

"May I suggest viewing it a bit differently?  

Being ""locked up"" is actually a short hold in a psych hospital.    It's not punishment or prison.    A hospital is a place people go to get better.   It is help - a very intensive type of help reserved for someone in crisis.   The advantage: it eliminates outside stressors, distractions, and addiction vices to provide the patient with a much more clear & through assessment.  

If you're in the US, as stupid as our health care system is, sometimes a patient *needs* a short hospitalization before the insurance company takes his/her condition seriously.

Nevermind the fact that yesterday I was sent home by a teacher because ot was visible how sick I was. I cant even remember how I got from the bus stop to home, all that I remember is that Iwas woken up by the sound of the driver saying my stop was next. When I got home, I took some medication that did nothing. I had some analyses done that showed I had some severe vitamyn deficiency intakes. That was also somehow my fault because I ""should have tried to not get sick"" because ""then you would be healthier"".

"Is there any other adult in your life which could take you to a GP? I don't know how health care works in your country, but I'm sure in case this severe somebody will see that and take you to the doctors for a check-up at least. You can be severely ill at any age (I don't wish that's your case, maybe it's 'just' the vitamins).
I don't know your relationship with mother but if she insists that you are simulating the sickness for some kind of benefit you can sort of 'play her game'. I'm no psychologist, just a random from the internet: here's what I'd do:
Make an ultimatum:
If you think that I'm simulating and I think I'm actually sick then these are two contradicting views and the truth is to be found. Let's see a doctor and somebody will be proven that they're wrong: either you or me. If you're confident that I'm lying then prove that to me. I'm confident that something is wrong with my body.

"So I’m currently 14 M living with my mom and brother at home. My father divorced my mom when I was 11 - 12 and when I thought that no more fighting would happen at home, my brother started acting like a real **** at home and is constantly fighting with my mom. At one point their fight almost turned physical and ever since then I’m always on edge when hearing them scream at each other. I hate going to school or leaving the house in general when my mom and brother are home alone and I’m not there to protect my mom who by the way is the most important person in my life. My brother never actually hit or beat up my mom but that one time where it almost escalated into violence was enough to leave a mark on me forever. 
I noticed I became more hyper vigilant and anxious but when I’m at home and their fight just ended I just feel numb for days sometimes. When I don’t feel numb I’m filled with hatred towards my brother and I can’t think of anything else but how much I despise him.

"For starters what your feeling is your fight or flight mode activated and its not good for that to happen constantly....

Now that we got that out of the way there are some questions you need to ask yourself.

Is your mother scared of him?

did your father ever hit your mother?

And why doesn't your brother go live with your father?

People emulate their parents behavior especially the one they are closest too so if he spent more time around your father he probably should have left with your father, sucks to break up the family but lets be real that's what divorce dose.

Lastly there is probably nothing you can do unless you can convince your mother to turn him in because no amount of calling the cops will matter unless she is willing to press charges, so focus on yourself try to calm yourself down and assure your mom your there for her but you cant take this anymore, if you have to go spend a few days at a friends house, tell their parents what's going on and ask to stay a few days, offer to do some chores while your there and most decent parents will be willing if they can afford it, let it sink in to your mother and brother that their behavior is pushing you away, your brother probably wont care, but your mother might"		reply	na	na	na	0.9970166683197021	no	no	strong	na	MentalHealthSupport	failed
"So, this is not me but someone I love very much, he had a crush and decided to confess, she said she used to feel the same but not anymore and that they could continue to be friends, she continued to go to his house and ask him to go to hers to get him to help her on homework and they played videogames, she usually said her back hurt from sitting too much and he would offer to give her a back massage multiple times with her agreeing, I have to add he has autism, high functioning, but I've noticed many times he doesn't understand social boundaries too well, usually just doing what he has seen others do in similar situations but doesn't always work because of other variables, i know he is used to give his mom the same back massage since she works long hours and when he does he normally unbuckles her bra and it's fine, because they're family, the thing is he did the same with this girl and a year later after she started therapy one day she went to tell him she felt assaulted because of that and to never talk to her again, understandably so.
He was devastated, I saw him cry for the first time and he couldn't understand why she felt like that, I explained to him that he took her underwear off without asking and it's different from his mom, I kid you not he was so ashamed, scared, and blames himself SO BAD he is also scared he will forever be cast out if she ever tells people close to him, I will never say she shouldn't but I've tried convincing him his life is not over and he thinks it should and he is just constantly blaming himself and torturing himself over it, cutting contact with any female friend or getting so much distance from them, he needs therapy but also thinks he deserves to suffer, he fluctuates between being scared he will not even be able to finish his studies if he gets publicly shamed and saying he deserves it.

"Im 20 yo when this happened 8 months ago one day I woke up looking and sounding completely different the day before. My neck was stiff I was extremely irritable my vison blurry and static and colors look greyed and lifeless my perception of depth and reality are completely off. Peoples faces for some reason look aggresive to me like there judging me. Going out in public is really difficult for me I get paranoid thoughts. It's extremely difficult to read it's like i just see letters but can't make sense of it and comprehend what I'm reading. I slurr and have difficulty recalling my words. My emotions and sense of empathy have been completely numbed the only thing i feel strongly is anger. My voice is extremely monotone. 

I feel like I had a stroke but I got an mri scan of my brain and everything came back completely normal. All the mri showed is a sinus infection and nasal polyp.

This all happened to me in the span of one night. Each morning I wake up and my vision and control over my emotions is better than the day before. Each day I wake up people look less and less threatening and I feel as if I'm maturing physically and mentally. Each day I'm more human and less robot.

That stiffness and physical stuff you described is you just getting older I started feeling more pains in my body around your age because I didn't take care of myself the way I should have, how well do you take care of your body? the worse you do the worse it will be as you get older as for the mental stuff did you have some sort of trauma or breakup recently? Or ever really because the mind has a way of fucking with you long after the event happened for example I was 16 when my father died and I acted normal for about 10 years and then suddenly I woke up and it was as if he had just died the day before.

Anyways these are things to think about while you wait to see a therapist, they are the ones you should be talking to not reddit, just find one you like and be honest with them they are there to help you not incarcerate you"	Itz_Valkyrie	reply	na	na	na	0.01078816968947649	weak	strong	strong	na	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.

"I (17y m) have had depression ever since i can remember and has only ever gotten more worse than before and more and more unbearable. 

I come from a very stringent and harsh household that doesn't believe in therapy and only in talking it out however when i do talk out they yell at me barading at me with a ton of slurs and insults and often even go psychical and therefore I've largely kept my mouth shut towards them and suppress my feelings but i can only suppress it for so much that eventually the bubble pops and i plead for help but only get the same response i always get ""your a idiot"" ""after everything this is how you repay us"" ""this hurts me more than it does on you"" ""your ruining my life"" although they work hard it's already gotten to their head and they've largely dismissed my request to take therapy.

The environment doesn't help either, incredibly toxic and dangerous and due to that I've always been the social outcast and weirdo, i dont feel accepted anywhere and i don't even want to be a part of the environment due to how badly it can affect me since it's a ghetto area i reside in currently and trying to get help from them have also largely ostracised me from society that i can't bring myself to talk my feelings out and just make up a completely different personality that thinks speaks and acts differently and not the way i like it. 

I've desperately tried to find someone to talk my feelings out especially on my school which had a school Councillor to help me through my pain but instead of giving me useful advice and support they only listened to me like i was a mental pacient and it didn't help that i also talked with teachers about it and asked them to keep it private from my family which they didn't do and thus creating more problems for me, and not only that but also reviewing me as unfit for higher education because of this ""behavioural problems"" even though all i wanted was help, and now I'm two years behind because of that. 

Talking to ""friends"" did not help either as after any conversation regarding this issue and my problems they've all basically turned their backs away from me and left me on my own. The only place that reached its hand for me was the online world that tried to help me but with the amount of trauma I've had to go through for years without any form of treatment made it harder. 

As a result I've been fighting depression, anxiety, paranoia, low self esteem, indecisiveness and much more. All without any useful or helpful advice or help for 17 years, and I'm slowly giving up even sometimes considering my existence in this world and thoughts of just ending it all together to atleast be free from all this pain I'm dealing with daily sometimes crying sometimes vomiting of it and it's become much more frequent that all this is happening. 

And after all these episodes, I've largely lost all trust and respect to grown-ups whom i see as ""untrustworthy betraying scumbags"" and therefore refused any conversation with any of them especially therapists at all and stopped talking about my issues with ""friends"" ultimately stopped talking to them in general and isolating myself. 

Although I've had moments of joy and happiness it's really only short lived and most of the time I'm sad and miserable, i basically go through the same daily routine over and over and over again non stop. I try to cope with it by playing games, eating, drawing, training, masturbation and just beating myself up mentally everytime. 

Hope this brief oversimplified story is enough to help me out"	Ship_wrecked_man	post	23.605241252656356	male	White	0.9983604550361633	na	na	na	0	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.

Not sure if this belongs here, but anyways, I have a problem with porn addiction, making me masturbate, but I also get a feeling of not shame, but emptiness afterwards. It all feels so hollow and emotionless, I feel bad for the actors, but not shame. The feelings usually lasts a couple hours and I don’t know what to do about it. Any thoughts on this? It almost feels like a void opens in my stomach filling me with thoughts of suicide and self harm, and draining the happiness. After a few hours and some calming techniques I can stop the feeling."

"If you masterbate at as a way to cope with stress a d loneliness, you can wear out your ability to feel good from an orgasm. 

When you orgasm, you can experience a drop from the high of the fantasy back to the reality of loneliness. This is true masterbating and it's true for couples in some cases too. 

You have to do what is called aftercare sometimes. Take a warm shower, cuddle with a blanket, whatever makes you feel warm, safe, and secure.

There is no right or wrong amount of times to JO a day. What's important is you feel okay with it and you aren't engaging in inappropriate behavior to JO. 

I think about masterbating like having dinner. Sometimes I want to have a really healthy, home-cooked meal, and sometimes I want to go to fancy restaurant, and sometimes I just want fast food because it's quick and im hungry.If I eat fast food everyday, I'm going to hurt my body.

I have the constant feeling that others will hate me, or abandon me. I just want to be liked, I don't want anybody to leave me. I think they won't, but I find my mind looping back to this mindset.

I haven't been able to talk with any of my best friends without this constant worry. It's slowly turned into a stream of self-hate, and I can't go anywhere without awful urges to hurt myself. If I wasn't on this Earth, maybe people wouldn't hate me. But I'm just too much of a coward to even do that.

"Less me asking for support, more me needing a place for a cathartic outpouring.   


I'm a broken person. So many of us are, and while we strive to be better we accept the state we exist in currently. I won't apologize for being broken, because it's beyond my control and not something I sought, desired, nor intended. It's a condition I live through.   


That said, I am sorry for how my issues impact the people I care about. I've had problems going back as far as I can remember understanding how to relate to others, and how to be a - a person. I can't think of any other way to really put that. I don't understand how to be a normal person. I don't mean the old ""no one is normal"" or ""normal people are the weird ones"" type of meaning - I mean, I don't know how to be a healthy normal person in the world around other normal people.   


I spend so much time pretending - acting - portraying what I think is a good person, and what I think people expect and want to see of me. I think this has a lot to do with how I was reared, in a chaotic environment with an Alcoholic Mother, a Step Dad who was amazing but overworked, overstressed, and overwhelmed dealing with my alcoholic mother. The rest of my family put on that they cared about me, loved me - they would let me visit and stay with them on occasion, but I developed a massive codependency issue with my Mom both because I felt that she was the only one who would always be there for me if I needed someone, and because I felt if I weren't there for her she'd commit suicide.   


In my adult years a lot changed for me. Early on I realized I was gay (thanks Nick News W 5 when I was 9) and immediately withdrew from people. Which is to say... I withdrew more. Even back then, other kids were... scary to me. I didn't understand how to relate to them - the only time I ever made friends, they sought me out - an that basically stopped in Middle School. But College - college was when I thought I finally figured out the whole social skills thing - at least to a degree.   


It took me years to realize that I was just playacting - and that it took a long time for me to feel like I could truly open up to people. But even then - I had to pretend so much,  just to be the friend I thought they wanted me to be for them. I had to continuously prove my value, to show why I deserved their time. It was exhausting - and required alcohol. I never let myself get like my Mom, but I needed alcohol to be social - and that made me the drunk party guy. A functional alcoholic.   


To skip forward quite a bit - let's get to COVID Era. COVID pushed my brain over some sort of threshold - one I still don't understand. I think the added anxiety of the pandemic just... was too much and something snapped. I completely withdrew, and caved into the depression and anxiety. I even withdrew from my roommates, who are arguably the people I'm closest to in the world. I knew I'd reached rock bottom, and was too scared to burden them with my issues - that they would make me the annoying sad pathetic lump, and I'd lose them.   


When Lockdown finally ended and the world tried to get back to normal, I was left behind. I felt so broken, so disconnected, so alone - and I felt no way to find my way back. At this point my Mom is gone for over a decade, I have a really great job but other than my roomies, and my old social circles still connected on Social Media... but I still felt utterly alone. I opened up more to my roommates, but they have their own issues and I knew that I couldn't put ""rebuild my social life"" onto their shoulders.   


So comes my 39th birthday. As the crazy drunk party guy, I always tried to throw big parties - show as many people in my life that I love them, that I celebrate them, and that I want them in my life as possible - prove that I'm worthy of another year of friendship. But I'm not that guy anymore. I don't really drink. When I realized that I literally couldn't exist in the world socially without drinking I basically gave up drinking - I now have maybe 1 drink a month. So - I selected a very small group of friends along with my Step Dad to have a lunch get together with. Only...2 people said they'd only go if I changed venue to a bar (I wanted to go someplace that HAD a bar, but lots of food stalls as well) and made it a nighttime get together (my job adjusted over COVID, and I now go to bed by 7 or 8PM at the latest.) Another had to decline due to other plans. I knew I'd have a couple need to bail, but I had my roomies and a person who I counted closer than blood, and I had my Dad. Then my Dad needed to cancel (not going into why, but I understood) - and I broke again. I felt too alone, too ashamed, too pathetic - so I canceled my get together.   


The person I was most excited to see was the person who I felt was - soulmate isn't the right word, but soul-kin? He also had mental health struggles, social anxiety issues, trouble relating to others, similar interests to me, and a troubled history with alcohol. I thought if anyone could understand it would be him.   


So after my birthday had passed, I reached out and apologized for canceling. Before COVID we didn't hang as often as I wanted, because most of my social activities had to do with drinking and I knew he was sober - so I didn't want to put him into a situation where there was temptation. On the flipside he didn't often reach out to me. And the 2 years leading up to COVID my anxiety started to grow worse, owing to a really emotionally destructive period living with other roommates that was very damaging to my mental health - so I stopped reaching out as much.  


When I text him after my birthday I... he told me to not worry about canceling, and that we all have things in our lives that come up. I responded yeah, or anxiety gets in our way. His response was:  


""Things only get better when you fix them bud. I have gotten the impression that your anxiety and repression mean more to you than any friendships you've had at this point. I haven't seen you in nearly 4 years now.""  


Timeline note: This was August 2022, and includes the 3 years or so of COVID and the year or two leading up when my Anxiety had started nosediving - and I did attempt to remain connected via Social and Text, and while I never tried to schedule things with him he rarely if ever did the same with me - we would actually talk about how hard our Social Anxiety made it to reach out to one another - I thought we were in tune, if not always talking and seeing one another...  


I then responded ""Take care."" Because I was instantly shattered. To say that I cared more about my mental health problems than I cared about the people in my life? I recognized he was saying that I would allow my mental health to get in the way but... I did because I couldn't fight past it, no matter how much I wanted to - and I'd already done years of therapy and at the time I felt there was no use trying therapy for the thousandth time...  


He then said ""Look I'm not attacking you. I'm telling you something I think you need to hear. I have given you my schedule several times in the past few years and it hasn't changed. I've been waiting for that call to hang out but it never came. So I mean you can't expect to be a priority when all you do is hide. But on that note. I'll respect your take care. Hope you have the 40 you dream of. Have a good one.""  


I responded, ""I appreciate your honesty."" I typed it while sobbing.   


Him: ""I am hoping it doesn't come as a discouragement. I am hoping to encourage you to rejoin the world a bit more, go to therapy, try new medications if the old ones aren't working. I want you to be happy.""  


Me: ""My birthday was my attempt to do just that. But I must admit this has broken me really badly. So I'm just going to go recollect myself for a while.""  


Him: ""Take all the time you need, the world will keep chugging along while you do.""  


That was the last thing he's said to me to this day. He removed me on Social Media... and as much as I want to talk to him, and tell him how much his words had the opposite effect that he seemed to express... I was too heartbroken. That he'd think that I didn't care about him, or the other people in my life enough to try and work past my issues. And if the person who I thought would understand better than anyone else couldn't... then what possible hope did I have to rebuild any of the other relationships I'd pulled together. Add that I knew how very different I'd grown in the interim...  


At this point I feel like I died. I really do. I feel like the person I used to be died when COVID hit. I've deleted most of my social media at this point, but kept one open with all of my old connections - instagram. I don't want to just... cut the people who I still love so much, that I care about more than words can express - go live their lives and not know that they're happy, that they're thriving. And I wanted them to see I'm surviving. Sure, surviving just means I'm not dead... but that I'm still here, still trying to... fix myself. But at the same time I don't feel like I HAVE them as part of my life. More than anytime in my almost 40 years... I've never once felt as if... I'm truly on the outside looking in.   


I don't really know why I wrote this. Maybe because so much of it I wish I could tell my former friend - but at the same time he's completely justified to have his own feelings over what happened with our relationship, and those feelings are completely valid. From his perspective every word he said is 100% accurate, and I have no right to overrule them. His removing me on social media and never again texting to even ask if I'm doing ok makes it clear he doesn't want communication. And I feel as if I need to respect that. He doesn't owe me anything - I'm not his burden.   


Maybe I'm hoping that putting all of this on paper (well, on pixels? On HTML code? Whatever.) will help me find a perspective that I haven't found up to this point. Maybe I'm hoping that someone will see this post and comment the perfect comment that will make me feel good again. Maybe I'm just... tired of repeating the story alone... in my head... never changing... always ending the same way. With me. Alone.   


It's soul crushing to watch your life crumbling, to watch the people you love walk away, to know that if you could just be better that things would be different, and to... not know how to... be not broken.

I'm a guy from Lithuania. I'm 12 years old and I tried suicide and sh. Everything I do I'm just so shit at. I feel empty and drained. I overthink so much I feel like painting the walls red would be good.  But well. 1 month ago I got a girlfriend now she's the only thing I have left. Her name is Rusne. It's a Lithuanian name. If I lose her I'm either gonna kxms or go really insane. I feel like as I'm not good enough. Im trying to show as much love as I can. I can't lose her. I really can't. Middle school love might seem cringe but I swear, she's the only thing I have. She's the best person I've ever met. Let me tell you about my backstory or whatever you'd call it. From last year everything went downhill. I felt like I was gonna end it all. It's been almost a year and I still haven't done it. I'm still trying, but I'm really close. I now see the changes in myself. Behaviour, looks, basically my whole personality changed. I mean I like it but some things are bad. Like I don't even give a shit now. My grades are getting worse and shit. But I finnaly couldnt hold it in. Recently I opened up to my parents. At the start it looked like they're acctually helping me and I'm getting better, until... They used it against me. I couldnt believe it. Shit. Next Time you guys wanna open up do it with a person you REALLY REALLY trust.

Please don’t think like this. The number one best reason to not kill yourself right now is that your only 12 in the next few years your mind and perspective will change in unimaginable ways.

I don’t want to be one of those people who claim they have OCD without truly knowing what it is but at this point I cannot tell. I (22F) have been an extreme germaphobe for as long as I can remember. Even as a teen, I would not let myself sit on my bed unless I had a shower. I do this even still—only sitting on my bed if I’ve had a shower (unless it was a quick grocery run or food run). Additionally, my roommate has a dog. I used to love dogs so much I wanted to be a vet, but for some reason I cannot bring myself to pet her dog without washing my hands and I will freak it out if it even steps foot in my room. I feel like my germaphobe-ness is ruining my life. I won’t even let my fiancée come over to my place for fear of the dog touching him. If it does, I would want him to take a shower. I understand how extreme this sounds and it makes me go crazy but I cannot change my mindset. Do I have some sort of mental problem???

So I’m not qualified to diagnose you, but from my experience and my life it’s both. I have severe ocd and have to do certain things, I clean repetitively, any minor exposure to even the suggestion of illness sets me into a panic, I’m obsessed with clean and what I view as clean.

I (24F) have been single for the past 3 years and its really taking a toll on my mental health. I see more and more people around me getting into relationships and every time it makes me feel sick and depressed. I have been online dating for around 2 years now and have had no luck. I don’t feel a spark with about 90% of the men I meet ( and I have met a LOT) and the few that I do feel something for end up breaking my heart. For example, since last November I have been talking to/seeing a guy who I really really like but it’s obvious that he does not want anything serious with me. Since i’ve started talking to him I have also been on around 10 other first dates and didn’t like any of them! I don’t get what I’m doing wrong and why it is working out for everyone but me. It genuinely effects my mental health and I struggle to do much with my life because I’m so sad about a guy who doesn’t feel the same as I do and that friends seem to easily find someone that they like and that like them back. I really don’t know how to cope with this. I’m not one of those people who can’t deal with being alone. I’ve been single for 3 years and until the past year was happy with it. It just feels like time is moving by so quickly and I’ll end up alone. All I ever wanted is love and to be a mother and I feel like it’s never going to happen and its really effecting my daily life. My younger sister is in a relationship, my housemates have no trouble finding someone and everyone around me seem to be finding love but me. I am not unattractive, men tend to be attracted to me and i have no trouble finding matches on dating apps or people who want to go on dates with me. Its always after that that it goes wrong. Most of them do want to see me again but I don’t like them, but when I do like them they end up wanting nothing but a bit of fun. What am I doing wrong? How can I get over this?	emmylux12	post	26.258282184336267	female	White	0.9984207153320312	na	na	na	4	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.
Maybe you should try going on a date with a female? You’re both the same gender, and have a bigger understanding of each other. Perhaps you’ll find true love with a woman instead? It’s just a suggestion. I’m not saying it’ll work, but I think it’s worth a shot. If you don’t like this idea, maybe try reaching out to a therapist and talking about it? That might make you feel a bit better about it. :)	emmylux12	reply	na	na	na	0.9984207153320312	no	no	no	na	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.
"I’m really sorry you’re going through this. Dating sucks and can be mentally exhausting for both genders. 

I’m 23 M and I know especially in your mid 20s there’s expectations that you should be in a relationship. For girls, they can often hear “you’re still single?! What’s wrong with you?”. For guys we can just complain that dating us just a system that’s against us. My theory is that it’s because women are over sexualized, and men (who can be horny af) who are under sexualized. 

My only suggestions are focus on finding new hobbies or start volunteering for causes that are near and dear to your heart, and form connections that way?
When you do that, at least you’re meeting guys in a non romantic context and you can start developing/building genuine relationships with other similar minded people.

I understand where you’re coming from, but you’re only 24. My mom didn’t even have her first child  until she was 30 and then had her last (me) at 32. There’s no timeline for these things and everyone progresses at different rates. For example, I’m married at 23. I somehow met the most amazing man on tinder after being single for 2 years. He was single 4 years before me. I wasn’t looking for anything but a chat or friendship with anyone.

After recent losses in my family, my symptoms are coming back. I take medication for them, but they've always been heavily influenced by my emotions. The paranoia, the hallucinations (all types), and altered spirituality. I tried telling my sister, but she dismissed me and acted like I was faking. I just don't know how to feel about it, it mortifies me, worse than they did when it first began. I've ceased contact with my therapist and I am unsure of my next talk with the pharmacy.

First of all, I am so sorry about your losses and your sister dismissing them. It’s okay to not know what you’re feeling about certain things. If you really can’t find anyone to talk to, you can always try journaling your feelings if you’re not comfortable to share them publicly. I know journaling helps me a lot, and if that doesn’t really help sometimes I talk to myself about it. I know that sounds weird, but it rly helps me sort through my feelings and understand myself better. I obviously don’t suggest doing it in public, in front of people either, but if you feel upset and you need to do it immediately I pretend like I’m on a phone call with someone in public😂	bingus2man	reply	na	na	na	0.9971923232078552	strong	no	no	na	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.
"Ever since covid and isolation, I (17F) haven’t had any motivation to do anything at all. Before schools shut, I was able to just sit down and get things done when I needed to, but I can’t do it anymore. I’ll just sit around and stare at the ceiling or scroll on my phone thinking about how the deadline is getting closer and I really need to start that homework thats due first lesson tomorrow that I had TWO WEEKS to do, but in the end I’ll just go to sleep instead. Even things I enjoy like writing and art just seem like so much effort recently and I can’t seem to find the energy to do them. Every few months I’ll completely freak out and break down about how my life is in shambles and I’m just so stupid I can’t even write that one paragraph that got set for homework, and nothing I’ve tried fixes anything. I’ve tried timing myself when tidying my room to see if I could make a challenge out of it, but I either get distracted or don’t care and stop the timer. I’ve tried listening to all kinds of music and media in the background while I attempt to complete homework, but I either cant find the “right” music or I just stare at the thing I’m meant to be doing. I had to drop a subject in school because I got so distracted and zoned out so much that I couldn’t keep up with the workload, and it was affecting my other subjects because I’d be in other classes thinking about how I don’t know how to do that homework because I wasn’t listening or how I have homework due next period that I haven’t done because I was busy freaking out about the fact that I haven’t done it yet. I spend my weekends wasting away in bed even when I had plans to catch up on all the homework I haven’t done, and either don’t get up at all or stay in bed until dinner time. I have so little energy that I’m chronically late for school in the mornings, and even when I try to hype myself up and tell myself I need to get up NOW or I’ll be late I just can’t make my body move. I’ll go full days without eating because getting up to get something sounds like too much effort or I don’t want to get up and face my parents “she’s alive” comments, so I just don’t, even when I’m starving. I find it difficult to start tasks and then even more difficult to stick to them until they’re finished instead of just stopping and giving up halfway, which is a major problem as I take art as one of my alevel subjects. Working to meet the deadlines is difficult enough without feeling absolutely drained and ready to give up at every stage. I’m more sensitive than I used to be and I feel like a goddamn idiot most of the time, silly things like my teachers feedback makes me upset enough to cry sometimes. November was the peak of my feeling miserable and useless and I actually turned to some questionable coping mechanisms (that I have since stopped) for a while, but it hasn’t really improved since then. I feel like a burden towards my own family and friends and I just want it to stop. I’ve always had trouble with procrastination but it’s just getting worse and worse and worse for the last few years, it’s growing unmanageable and I don’t know how to fix it. I feel stuck and overwhelmed and it’s eating me from the inside out. If anyone knows what’s happening and why or how to help me than please please feel free to respond . Thanks.

"My (F17) life has lost all meaning. All I have any desire to do is get high. I feel like im just waiting around to die. I've been doing a shit ton of drugs and often when I'm high I become really suicidal, but this isn't deterring me from using. I'm shoplifting several times a week to get my drugs. I feel there is pretty much no hope for my future, and I dont see the point in making any effort to change things.

My therapist said to me in session yesterday that it's getting to the point where he feels he may have to break confidentiality and talk to my parents. Also, he didn't say this directly, but he sort of suggested that maybe I would benefit from being admitted.

Even a friend has now told me ""i dont think this is a bad idea. it could really help and it would get you away from your parents/house.""

If you read the post I put up today. It outlines 50 years of my life. While still being young you can initiate change. Sometimes the hardest thing is to accept help, because we are all flawed, one way or another. Some people handle it fine, others like me do not do well. I would say read my post. Then you can see a lot of similarities, you will also see what happened to me, and where I am now. I would admit myself in a heartbeat if I could. I'm awaiting legal recourse right now though.

"I don't know where you're located and if money is a problem, but you do need some serious help. Everyone seems to think being admitted is a good idea, and I kind of believe so too.

It is maybe hard to get admitted and that can be pretty demoralizing. But you can still advocate for yourself, so if you can convince them, bring your friend so you have a little backup.

Hi, I could do with some advice on a quite serious matter, my question stemmed from watching an interview with a schizophrenic man, his mannerisms and the way he dealt with the interview under social pressure was very similar to my girlfriend of 6 years? She has always struggled with Mental Health and has always had a problem I don’t fully understand, she has extreme social anxiety and whilst she isn’t always bad, she is sometimes very quiet and difficult to communicate with, she sometimes comes home from work and will just lay in bed and stare at her phone in silence or in the dark for literal hours and almost completely you ignore the things I ask her until I relentlessly request she doesn’t ignore me, when she’s happy or in a good mood she’s great, but she gets in moods and goes very quiet and odd, she also neglects showering sometimes for a few days on end and has mentioned in the past she sometimes sees shadows ect or figures in the dark. She refuses to go to counselling or get any form of help or medication as she insists in makes her worse and it makes it hard for me to fully understand her issues, I must stress, this is not a constant state, she is often sociable and happy, but these symptoms do happen often although I wonder if there can be mild forms of it.	crist0fer7	post	34.94566365402309	male	White	0.9968745708465576	na	na	na	5	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.

For starters stop trying to diagnose your SO, your not a therapist.

what your describing sounds like simple depression (its not so simple but its more common) and she obviously has a coping mechanism that works for her so as long as she isn't hurting anybody let it run its course until she comes to you for help

I had this constant need to fix things when my SO was feeling down in the dumps, little did I know by trying to help I was pushing her away to the point she left me and never looked back so I had to learn the hard way hope you learn from my experience and don't have to suffer as I did.

"Hey, first of all it's totally okay if you don't have the energy to talk or interact or to do anything really. Unfortunately we can't just stop overthinking but what you can try is little by little learning to accept that it's useless to worry about the things that are not in your control. It's difficult but little by little, step by step you can do this. You may not see it right now but i promise you, there's a reason for absolutely everything and you just have to hold on a little longer, and it gets better. Try practicing deep breaths, and exhaling through your mouth everytime you feel any sort of discomfort physically or mentally, and then close your eyes and just clear your head, breathe, give yourself a break even if it's just a few seconds, then try telling yourself, try to understand that there's no point worrying about things you can't control, i know it's not easy to just accept it, but trust me you can do this. And you are NOT worthless, the world needs you and it will not be the same without you, you're not stupid either. 
You're beautiful, you're worthy and you have a purpose. Just you being here alive at this moment shows that you have a reason. Please feel free to dm me here or anywhere you feel comfortable if you ever need to just talk, vent, rant or need someone who listens.

I have to let it out. I have been an addict of some kind since I was 16 years old. Now I'm 50 years old. This has been numerous drugs. From Amphetamines when I was in my 20s, after my 20s, it was Alcohol and opiates, I lost a job due to stealing, to support a habit. By my 40s they put me on Methadone, from then until now. The first criminal charge was a class C felony, theft over 10k. That was deferred, then I continued to use of course and simply get another job. I will leave out childhood. For reference addiction runs heavy in my family, always has. Childhood consisted of basically mental, physical abuse, sexual abuse. I don't think that really was an issue, I was able to lock that Away. Later in life, I was cheated on by my wife of 15 years. That was a blow to my mental health, led to more addiction and more drugs, but no changes in life. Then at 48 I was hit with a DUI in my driveway, it was a welfare check because I was hammered drunk at work. I was in my car and that's that. I now was fired for theft again at 50 years of age, I currently see a psychiatrist and two counselors. I stole to buy wax which is expensive in Iowa, dispensary is 75 a gram. So becoming a habitual user becomes a $300 dollar a week habit, now that it happened I have Court today at 1:30pm. I reckon I will plead not guilty and indignant and request a court appointed attorney. They have me taking 7k worth of merchandise, pretty much a low life thief. The sentences can be 6 months to 5 years. I can tell you that when I was doing all the wrong things, I knew it. I knew it would come to a head, or an ending. In my mind I had already envisioned it, they would find out and I would just simply kill myself at that point because it is what it is. So the mindset was way wrong, obviously I was caught, I admitted to the theft to Loss Prevention so I just gave myself up. I was arrested at work, then they let me go with a summons to appear today (2 weeks later). At this point in life I don't know what to do. I am gonna lose my place to live, which puts my wife in a bad spot, my son is 25 and he is still at home, I'm about 16 days from that last rent payment. Then it is what it is. I have talked to my psychiatrist and know I'm waiting to go to Court to see what happens there. First summons to appear is today. I am hoping to take this and get into rehab and change an entire life of addiction, then at times it's like fuck it, it's too far lost, gone. I go back and forth. Sometimes I wish I wasn't such a shit bag with no brains that literally does all the wrong things, even though I know I'm doing all the wrong things. I was wanting to get caught, and now I don't know what will happen. My anxiety is off the charts, depression is bad, can't beat myself up enough, can't find a way to get any motivation to do shit now. I only hope I can make a change and move on, I really don't want to go to jail. I know you can get two deffered sentences in your life, but that's no guarantee and I don't see that happening. Oh well. If you made it this far, I guess I will see what happens today. I wish I would have helped myself a long time ago, then this wouldn't be. However everything happens for a reason, and now it is time to see what happens. You can be the best person in the world , but hiding behind the facade is an ugly thieving, lying, piece of garbage. I have never taken from my family or people, always stole from work, that just makes it worse. I guess looking at it now, I have no idea how it works out. I always think that it's gonna be alright, that doesn't help right now. I don't know if anything will be alright, maybe it can help someone to read this and maybe you will make a change bass on what you read here. It may also help to know that someone always has it worse, I know people have it worse than me. Get help early, wax is a little stronger than weed. It's a lose lose right now in my life. Let everyone down, my mom has dementia too, she doesn't understand what's going on. It's hard. I put myself here though so it is what it is. I don't know why I even put this up.

"Background info: 22yo female, parents got divorced when I was young and I had a very rocky, at times physically abusive (only two occasions), relationship with step mum. Dad also had rocky relationship with step mum (his new wife). Moved out, or rather got kicked out by step mum, at 17.
Have been diagnosed with OCD about a year ago.

I have NEVER disclosed this info to anyone because I find it disturbing and they would too, hence the throwaway account. Basically, when I was a kid there were a few occasions where I deliberately harmed animals. We had a pond, and once I caught a newt and cut the tip of its tail and some of its toes off with a stone. My grandparents also had a pond, I once took the frogs from the pond (four or five I think) and shoved them down the side of a bed. I think I was around 6-8 years old for those occasions, parents weren't divorced yet I don't think. Then, at around 14 maybe, I would hold one of the cats we have by the scruff and lightly tap them against a wall or other furniture. I'd also hold them by the scruff and slide/throw them across the floor too.

I have my own pets now, and I still get that urge sometimes but in a different way. If one of my pets needs oral medication, the more I have to restrain them the more enjoy it. If one of my pets annoys me then I don't mind pushing them around.

I honestly don't know where the urge to do that comes from within me. I've always loved animals and I love the cats and the pets I have now. When a pet of mine passes away, I get extremely upset because I care about them so much. I don't think I'd ever be capable of fatally hurting any of them. honestly hate that I have this darkness inside of me. 

So what the heck is wrong with me? How do I get rid of it? I did a little research and found that animal abuse is seen in people with obsessive compulsive personality disorder, so maybe I don't just have OCD."	iamathrowaway634	post	15.769091406771595	female	White	0.9916205406188965	na	na	na	8	MentalHealthSupport	'ethnicity: no prediction, age: 22, gender: female, explanation: the author self-identifies as a 22-year-old female. there is no information available to predict her ethnicity.'
"My best advice is to find specialized help. And I know how hard it can be to open up and act regard finding help, because I'm in big trouble as well and I'm yet to seek help until this day.

What do you feel when you want to hurt them, or how do you feel when you have images of yourself harming an animal? Do you find yourself regretting when feeling this way, hurting inside even more than you normally feel hurt? If that's the case, maybe you actually want to hurt yourself and throw yourself away in that dark pit of misery? 

I don't want you to start hurting yourself instead of an animal or something like that. But we need to realise that when we do bad things, many times we want to hurt our very self. There quite a few interesting I noticed when doing my ""misery dance"". I'm thinking straight about how much it's going to hurt me a while from now if I do this and that (usually I destroy expensive objects from my possession knowing how much I worked to afford them), and all this under a crushing anger that's rushing through my head. What I'm happy about is that, over the years, I managed to stop fighting and be angry at my parents, alltho unfortunately and I'm not happy to say it, they are part of the source when it comes to my mental illness or whatever the heck is wrong with me. 

But we need to be realistic and stop blaming our parents and act accordingly. One thing is to hurt ourselves, one thing is to hurt other living beings. And by hurting yourself you're going to hurt other people too.

Our Universe is an interesting place to live in and our mind is a big black sh*thole, this is why I can't and nobody else here can't answer your question straight away. We both need time and a specialist, and a god damn good one. 

One last thing, the fact that you opened up makes you an amazing person and you unintentionally showed to yourself that you truly want to stop hurting animals.

Thank you for replying. When I think about how I’ve harmed animals in the past, I feel very guilty and upset about it. I hate myself for it. When I want to hurt them, it usually comes from a place of anger or frustration, but when I hurt them a little I feel like I want to hurt them even more.

I’ve always been interested in going hunting, I do feel like I have this primal urge to do that and I’ve never had the opportunity before, maybe I should look into it. I obviously wouldn’t want to waste the animal afterwards though, so I’m not sure what I’d do about that, I’m sure I could give them to someone or something though. Yes of course, if I ever thought I was a serious threat to my animals I wouldn’t hesitate to rehome them.

"Good to hear you're mindful about it. It kinda sounds like it is a defense mechanism you taught yourself. It protects you against the abuse and neglect you experienced by your parents by projecting the abuse onto something else. In this case animals.   
The way you describe it, it kind of sounds like invasive thoughts which is a common OCD thing. It doesn't mean you have to act on them, but they live in your head like you've already done them. Therapy targeting invasive thoughts specifically can probably help you with this."	iamathrowaway634	reply	na	na	na	0.9916205406188965	weak	no	no	na	MentalHealthSupport	failed

"Called a hotline crying because I had an argument about covid with a friend, they said it wasn't real, nothing happened, conspiracy stuff. Was questioning why I keeping going when people are so unempathetic and nasty. 

Hotline worker told had an angry opinion about it, told me I was a bad person and I lair. They hung up on me.

The next day police came to my job asking about me because they said someone on the hotlime reported me. The traced my call, pulled all my information, including my name, address, employer. I was working from home at the time so the cops didn't find me. 

My job emailed me about why they were looking for me. I had to explain the situation to my job which wasn't ideal. 

When I called the county to find out what was going on, they refused to tell me anything and have me a bureaucratic run around, saying I would need to submitted a lot of paper work just for them to tell me why the police were dispatched to my job. 

I demanded to get more information and eventually they told me the hotline worker reported me to the police as a danger, and that ever time you call a hotline they took notes on what I said, which were kept in county office. 

The county would not tell me.if the police were still trying to find me, or what was going on. I was very scared because I just wanted tonvent to someone, I didn't know the cops would come to my job. 


I feel disturbed and betrayed that the county keeps notes on everything you say when you call a hotline, and can later use those notes to call the police on you. 


Do not call a hotline. I even tried to hide my number and it didn't work. Do not trust the hotlines. They are potentially keeping records of everything you tell them in your county office. In my county they told me they retain the records forever, so from now on I have a file with the county and police that's I am not even able to request access to, about things I told an hotline worker believing it to be in confidence. 

There is no help available. I won't ever talk about these things again."	717sadthrowaway	post	29.63485159361814	male	White	0.9994805455207825	na	na	na	6	MentalHealthSupport	failed

"I am a 16 year old. For the past few months I have been feeling, well.. I don't know the word.
Back in 2020, my mental health got terrible (possibly depressed) and everyday was horrible, and this phase lasted till 2022. I hated every bit of it, trust me. I was on antidepressants for a month but i knew I'd get too dependant so I stopped taking them (they were prescribed for only one month too) .But for the last few months, I've been feeling so empty. There's this constant feeling and i don't know what that is but whatever it is, it's not good. I'm not depressed, but I'm not happy or okay either. I have good days occasionally but other than everything in my life is just so dull. And I don't look forward to anything, everything feels meaningless. It's taking so much effort to just exist. This sounds weird but having horrible days was much better than this. But that's because, back in 2020 when my mental health begun to get worse, I knew the reason, i had a problem and eventually, in the time of 2 years (2022) i was able to solve it and that problem no longer affects me. But now I'm not aware what the problem is, i don't know why I don't feel okay when everything is going okay. I mean yeah there are still tiny problems but that's normal. I don't know what I'm trying to say, i just feel....weird. Does anyone know what's going on or how i can get out of this? Apart from seeking professional help, please don't ask me to. I have my reasons and its not possible for me to see a psychiatrist or therapist yet. Help me out if you can please. I don't feel like doing anything at all. Also, I care so much about what people say i keep having bad days just because of what people say/think about me, is there any way to not care about that?

"Have you tried journaling? When I started counseling for my depression with my psychologist he asked me if I want to try medicine or other counseling. I definitely choose counseling instead of taking medicines. 
As the counseling started my psychologist asked me to track my thoughts and asked me start journaling, basically at that time didn't share anything with anyone, not even my closest friends, and also I didn't like to share some things with my psychologist therefore I found it easy to track my own thoughts through journaling. Somehow it helped. Also another advice I received from that same counselor is to take a walk or to run to boost the dopamine. I don't like running so I started with walking, most of the time I felt like not wanting to leave the bad but still went out for a walk in the early morning, sometimes I just walked and in between I just feel like crying and cried my heart in a place where no one can see or hear me. I don't know about dopamine but those regular morning walks helped me to lose some weight and I felt really good about it. 
These are the two things that I did and still doing and somehow I think this helped me to keep me sane. Of course after journaling (writing down your thoughts) try to read them out again.

"Also about the caring about ""others opinion"" is supposed to be like a normal teenage behavior, and most of the time this leads to major mental health issues, therefore just try to work on your self esteem, and try to create a healthy mental health with meditations and journaling. 

You might think that, I am only blabbering about this journaling and meditation but trust me, this really helps. And let me tell you, realizing something is wrong and seeking help in any way out is really being very brave of you. I didn't had this courage till I was 23. I suffered silently for almost 7 years and finally when I saw nothing is feeling good, I decided to go and talk to someone whom I trust. But this thought of they being busy, having no time to listen to me was always on my mind. 

So as someone who has been through such phase, all I want to say is try to talk to someone whom you trust, then start meditation/yoga/ or anything which helps you out with understanding the inner self, try journaling to navigate your thoughts and then find a hobby through which you can let out your emotions. Never keep emotions inside, once it gets piled up it bursts someday. 
And as you mentioned you once felt like depression but now you think it's not depression, but some unknown sadness, then let me tell you depression never goes away, it's always on ""on n off"" Mode, so you never know how it'll came back to you.

I need to know if I’m alone in this. I feel like I’m going crazy. I (19f) still live with my parents in our house. I have a small room that I try to keep organized, but it does get messy a lot of the time. I have a day to deep clean it on weekends when I’m off work. She has this habit where she likes to come into my room and “reorganize” (take everything from it’s spot and put it somewhere else). Every time she does this and I come home to it, I start having major anxiety; breathing fast, chest tightening, I start crying, and I feel like my skin is crawling because of how different my room is. No matter how many times I try and explain this to her and how it affects me, she tells me “well, should’ve kept it cleaner” and laughs. She and my father think I’m being ridiculous, and that I’m over-dramatic. This has happened more times than I can count, and it seems to be getting worse over time. I have to decline to go out to dinner or events with friends because I start thinking about how I’m going to come back to my room being a completely different space. There’s nothing in my room I’m afraid of her finding or discovering, so I’m not sure why I feel this way. There’s nothing online I can find about this, I’ve tried to do research about what’s wrong with me but to no avail. Could it be some type of undiagnosed OCD? I do indeed have ADHD, which could be somehow contributing, but I’m starting to feel helpless right now because she gets home before I do and doesn’t even give me a chance to clean. Thoughts??

Definitely agree about getting your own place, I see you’re working and saving and I wish you the best of luck! In the meantime what helped me was getting organized myself.

Let me start by saying I will never agree with “their house their rules”. There’s no justification for not providing and respecting the privacy of your child no matter the age of said child. Your room is your space and she shouldn’t be doing what she is doing. I think your first step is to try and get to the root of why it upsets you so much. For me, I would get upset because I always have a “method to my madness”. Yes my room was disorganized to outsiders, and messy, but I knew where everything was and whenever my mom cleaned for me I couldn’t find anything and would have explosive episodes of frustration and anger. I also have ADHD which contributes. Have you sat down and had a serious talk to explain how it makes you feel? Maybe you could compromise with each other somehow.

Serious discussions with my mother usually end up with her deciding I am dramatic and her laughing at me, and now she won’t even sit down with me to have talks because she knows where the topic will end up. She’s a very difficult and stubborn person to be around. But I think the ‘method to my madness’ bit is true- that’s definitely how I feel about my own room. But hopefully will have my own place with a lock soon, so there’s that. Thanks!!	SecretaryGloomy6092	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9991614818572998	no	strong	no	na	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.

It took my mom a while to understand. And she didn’t understand until I was near 20 years old. Im 24 and married now so I don’t live with her anymore, but she got better about it before I left. I know it’s not the case for many parents though, some will never understand and only view it as lazy, dirty, and irresponsible.

Btw, I’d ignore people that say “you’re an adult, get your own place”. That statement ignores the fact that the economy is terrible, jobs don’t pay fair wages, location-based prices, inflation, unnecessarily high rent, and other factors. I live in a coastal state, it’s expensive. I only moved out because we have 2 incomes. Also, you’re barely an adult. I personally don’t know a single person that moved out before the age of 21. And it’s not a bad thing to live with your parents, it’s only bad when your parents don’t see you as an adult and when they don’t respect you and your privacy. Living with parents as an adult doesn’t mean you forfeit your privacy, and it’s a total invasion of privacy for her to be entering your room when you aren’t around.

Living with anxiety and depression can be really hard. Im (22F) and I’ve been struggling with it since elementary. I’ve barely got any friends and never had a serious parter. What can I do to put myself out there ? I want to share things and rely on someone and love them as much as I hope they would me. I lack the confidence and because of trauma I’ve locked myself away, i would send days in my house only going out to do the necessary things.

"I’m from Ireland but am studying in England. I have 2 contact hours a day, 3 days a week. The rest of the week I spend at work. If I’m not in Uni or at work, I’m in bed. Not doing course work, not tidying the flat or going for walks or hanging out with friends nor doing any of the things I like. Just in bed.

I can’t find the motivation to do anything, the only reason I get up for work is because I will literally be homeless if I don’t. I can’t even enjoy a few pints with friends or have a nice date with my girlfriend or else I feel an enormous amount of shame and dread that I won’t be able to cover my rent and bills. I have no financial support other than asking my parents to help me out every so often. But that just makes me feel worse, they shouldn’t need to bail me out. Even when I spend money on necessary things like groceries or travel fair I feel shame.

And with uni work… we’ll I’m a procrastinator. And not in the fun relatable way. I’m pretty sure what is the equivalent of my dissertation is going to be done in its entirety the night before it is due as well as all of my other assignments. If I fail this course I honestly have no clue what I am going to do with my life. I don’t think I have any applicable skills at all. I wouldn’t be too ashamed to move back in with my parents in Ireland for a little while but I’m getting too old now to not be able to earn any skills that’ll get me a decent job.

That’s another thing. I’m 24, most people in my year are about 20. I know this is just an “age is just a number” thing and I don’t want to make any mature students feel discouraged. But I can’t help but let it get to me. I feel like that time of my life where I am meant to develop is finished. Now my brain is done absorbing information and it didn’t even manage to absorb anything fucking useful. There are people who I know, who I went to school with with small businesses and children. I had my chance, and I chose to sleep in.

It’s not like I haven’t tried anything. I’m just bad at keeping up with anything. I tried cognitive behavioural therapy, to get me more in a productive routine so that when leisure time would come around I wouldn’t feel so bad. Tried that for months to no avail. The only thing to come out of it was my therapist telling me I was depressed. Well at least I know for sure now.

Can’t afford 1 to 1 therapy so I’m just living with it right now, and deadlines are charging me down like a parade of bulls. And bills and rent are sucking me dry. The only thing that doesn’t seem to cost me money or energy is sleeping. It’s a vicious cycle and I want out but I don’t know how."

No one cares and the genuine reaction will come out when you really feel it. If you don't feel then it'll not come out, it is simple as it is. 
But of course I have faced traumas therefore the switch of my feeling is off, this might be same for you too. Sometimes it's hard for human to turn on the switch again, if they once shut it down.

"So, I actually asked this a few days ago, but didn’t get a reply. So I want to ask again. Please help me, this is very important to me.

For context, I am a high school student (16F) who is involved in band. We were recently trying on our uniforms in the change-rooms, when I saw some scars on one of my classmates (16/17F) thighs. From what I could see, they weren’t new, but a part of me was worried that somewhere there could be fresh cuts. Of course, I didn’t want to make my classmate uncomfortable by asking about it, so I just let it go. But the more I thought about it, the more it bothered me. 

So, how should I go about this? I’m worried that if I let it be, I might regret it for the rest of my life. But I’m also worried that she’ll think I’m pitying her, or it’ll make her uncomfortable. I’m also worried that me bringing this up might make her relapse. 

Please help me figure out what to do. I can’t think of what to do alone. I want to help, but I don’t want to harm. 

Should I speak to her about it, or should I maybe leave it alone? Or perhaps I should wait and see if she shows any signs of something wrong? What’s the right course of action?

Please please help me. I am so worried and concerned about it, because as someone who has been there, I want to reach out and help if she needs it. 

I just really need some more opinions before deciding. Thank you.

UPDATE: 

I messaged her, to not create any pressure, or overwhelm her, etc. She said that she had been struggling last year, but is getting help and is slowly getting better, which is amazing. I’m so happy to know that she’s getting the help she deserves and needs.

"I think speaking with a school counselor is your best option. You can remain anonymous and voice your concerns. She can receive the help she needs.

If you do decide to try to speak with her, do so privately. Be honest, be vulnerable, be emotionally safe. Just fyi, they may feel like theyve been put on the spot, be embarrassed, be defensive or even lash out. That's okay - don't react negatively, just be aware of it. Meet defensiveness with vulnerability.

The key to effective communication is to negotiate from a position of vulnerability. Use 'I feel....' statements. Like, 'I feel sad and I want to help'. 'I noticed this the other day and I felt concerned, are you okay? if you ever want to talk about anything I'm here for you.' Maybe write them a note?

You could also just spark up a conversation with them and get to know them. Introduce yourself, start small talk, go from there. Begin a friendship. Approach the topic at a later time. Be cautious not to be dishonest, however. If that individual is having emotional/mental issues your friendship and support may be invaluable.

If youre not comfortable with any of this that's completely understandable and okay. Speaking to a school counselor is a good option. I'm just trying to list out some options as I see them.

I've gotta mention...if this person mentions suicide, is a threat to themselves or others, etc, you must report it immediately. However, from what you're describing this doesn't seem to be the case. If this self harm behavior continues, you need to report it, like with a school counselor.

That individual will benefit from therapy with a Licensed Mental Health Professional, to learn tools and healthy coping mechanisms. That person is directing their frustration inward, onto themselves. They need to learn tools to deal with emotions in a healthy manner, they need to heal from trauma, they need to learn how to balance and shift their perspective.

Im depressed, I feel lazy and I feel ashamed. I have not been working because I can’t leave the house. I desperately want to work because my family have been supporting me financially. (they think I’ve been going through a dry spell for work) and it makes me feel even worse about myself that I can’t help myself. I’m also going into debt and it doesn’t help my health either.
I’ve been like this for about 8 months now. I’m 38 male from Canada. Has anybody else experienced this or something similar. Does anyone have any positive advice on how to get through this?

I have had a very similar experience to you recently although it’s nothing new for me. Here’s my advice go to the doctors first then worry about the job then come clean to your family it sounds like you are self aware of the depression but it also sounds like you have near crippling agoraphobia and anxiety no ones money or words will help you long term if you won’t fight for it with them and in this fight knowledge is power find out what going on inside you then you will most likely find the way to best treat it I hope you find the right medication or therapist because these issues don’t come out of nowhere they stem from something or are a mountain of stress to which you add a little more each day you think about what you should do instead of doing it. This will be one of the most time consuming mentally exhausting vulnerable thing you will ever have to do and I’m here to help if you don’t think my advice is terrible you are the first person I’ve seen post on here	coryjunior01	reply	na	na	na	0.9983445405960083	weak	strong	no	na	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.

"So when I was watching some therapy videos on YT I saw them address this. Not sure if it would work for you yet, but they suggested to go outside, go to the store. Find somewhere to just sit and chill. If you start to feel overwhelmed, let it flow. Eventually it stops, and your brain will realise that theres nothing to be afraid of.

Not sure if it works in accute cases like it seems you've got, or if maybe you have some underlying trauma that needs to be addressed first. 

Definitely do try to see a doctor. Even just make a phone appointment if going out is too much and explain it to them. They should be able to work with you."	coryjunior01	reply	na	na	na	0.9983445405960083	no	strong	no	na	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.
I've known my girlfriend for more than 2 years and we got a couple 5 months ago. I love her more than anything. She's suicidal since about 3 years and she says I'm helping her through a hard time. She says she hasn't got anymore reasons to stay alive . Her grades are bad , she doesn't has a good releationship to her parents( it's really bad tbh) and she doesn't have many friends. She's trying to make it easier for her to kill herself by getting me to hate her. I cannot hate her , i love her more than anything else. I've spoken to her but she doesn't want any help. She just says she wants to end her life and it doesn't make sense to help her anymore. I give her all my love. We're messaging each other every day , i see her every day, give her compliments , cuddle with her, trying to help her... .If someone can help us, please contact me . I don't think i've got much time.	Shuffylo	post	26.69652706178216	male	White	0.0029784399084746838	na	na	na	2	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.

What I recommend you do is get her to go to therapy, and make sure to support her every step of the way. She is suffering and needs to get all the help she can. As someone who suffers from depression, therapy can really help. It may take a while for her to feel better about everything, but I promise you that one day she will be so much better than she is now. She just needs to see a therapist and get everything off her chest.	Shuffylo	reply	na	na	na	0.0029784399084746838	weak	no	no	na	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.

"I don’t know if this is the right sub, but I really do need help.

I had to give my dog up because surgery was too expensive. Today, we had no other option than to do the surgery. I’m out of state, and won’t be able to go back home till Spring Break. 

Since we have to give him up, Safe Heaven is paying for the surgery and he is no longer my dog. The surgery is risky, so we are playing a waiting game on whether he makes it or not. 

If he doesn’t make it, I don’t know what I will do. I already lost five friends, and I can’t lose my dog too. I won’t be able to take this. I can’t take; I won’t be able to handle it. This is the worst year of my life. It hasn’t even been a year and I lost five friends. They can’t take my dog too.

If he does make it, what are the chances of us being able to adopt him again?

Edit: We have him up at our vet and then they took him to the Humane Society. The surgery is an emergency… I’m going to call them again and see if I raise enough money to pay for the surgery if they will allow us to adopt him back if they won’t do so already…"	No-Friendship-7250	post	49.37434241341663	female	White	0.9948881268501282	na	na	na	1	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.
"I have no idea how to answer your question. I don't know anything about safe haven.

I wanted to inform you that depending on where you live, community resources may be available to help you cover medical costs for your doggo. My previous dog had a form of cancer, and I know that one of his tumor removal surgeries was mostly covered by a fund set up by my local humane society. You could also try crowdfunding, asking friends, family, etc. as well. I hope there is something like this available for you. I'd start by calling local humane societies, rescues, etc. I don't know how common this is.

Big feels. <3 Loss is so hard. Our dogs give us everything, they deserve everything. Even if you do have to surrender your dog, hopefully they'll at least be able to save his life. If anything, you helped with that. You loved him while you could and did your best. It's not much, but i hope you can find some solace in that.

"This is a topic that is near and dear to my heart. It pains me to see men behave in a way that makes all men appear self-absorbed, aggressive, and dangerous. For a long time I denied that toxic masculinity existed, I thought it was just another word used to put people in boxes. It is easy to be blind to something that you don’t want to see, but through experience my eyes have been opened. During my years of working with men, women, and children I have been inundated with accounts of bad men. Countless times I have sat with victims and heard their stories of abuse and more often than not the abuser is a man. 

I write this post not to attack, defile, or label men. Rather to support men and bring awareness to the issues.  I have sympathy for men who act in a deplorable way. Not because I approve of their actions but because I understand that they are a product of their environment. Men like any other group learn from their parents and far too often boys grow into men without fathers in their lives.  A boy without a father is like an explorer without a map, lost and tired trying to find their way through life. It is not impossible for a fatherless man to be a good man but it is harder to get there. This problem is not exclusive to the fatherless individual. Many men were raised with fathers in their lives, but were never taught what it means to be a “good man”. 

What is a good man? The answer to this question may differ based on your culture, values, and experience. However I have identified three key components that good men have in common

1) First is emotional connectedness, not to be mistake for being “an, emotional man”. Emotionally connectedness is having awareness of your emotions and understanding how they affect your behavior. A man who is emotionally disconnected when confronted with difficult feelings will be quick to anger, slow to forgive, and swift to blame. However a man who is aware of his emotions has patience with those he loves and knows how to process his thoughts before he acts. This trait takes practice and is difficult to master. 

2) Second is emotional resilience. Webster’s dictionary defines resilience as, “the capability of a strained body to recover its size and shape after deformation caused especially by compressive stress”. I understand this component as a mans ability to absorb the stress around him and regain his mental composure. I find that often times the violent and aggressive men you hear about were under compounding stress. Rather than processing the stressors and returning to a safe mental baseline they gave into the urge to react without forethought.  A truly resilient man understands how to comprehend a difficult situation and calculate his actions instead of prematurely acting on his initial impulses. 

3) Lastly is effective communication. It has been difficult seeing men who can not express their wants and needs in a way that is conducive for a healthy relationships. Men who can not accurately describe how they feel and effectively seek feedback are a recipe for disaster. When men who lack emotional resilience and connectedness do not feel heard or understood it can often lead to aggressive outbursts.  I don’t believe that most men want to be aggressive or violent, but I do believe that the men who commonly have these traits lack the basic communication skills needed to be happy and healthy in todays society.

In summary I believe that men are falling short in their responsibilities as husbands, fathers, and role models for the next generation. It has become to common for men who lack emotional strength and communication skills to exercise force and coercion to get what they want. I have faith that men can rise to the occasion and with the appropriate support can exceed expectations.

It's okay to be male and be emotional. 99% of men's issues stem from internalized emotional or physical abuse, which is justified as being acceptable to punish a male showing emotional.

My partner, 36, has suffered from mental illness for a long time. He is currently in therapy but not on any medication. Out of nowhere 2 weeks ago, he moved out of our shared apartment, saying he needed time to figure out how to be on his own. Since then, he has gotten worse. He's suffering from horrible burn out from his job. He's struggling financially. He's isolated himself stating that he needs to learn to not depend on anyone. I believe he adds unnecessary hardship to himself as a form of self punishment (i.e. moving out of our shared apartment, causing extra financial strain). He is a good man. He has nothing to punish himself for.  I'm not a professional, but I believe he as a severe anxiety disorder and ADHD. He's mistrusting of doctors due to being overmedicated in the past and ignoring him when he said something was not working. He was hospitalized for a week a few months ago and he was doing much better for a while. He's just been spiraling for the last few months, and I don't know how to help him.  I don't know how to make him believe that he deserves good things and that he is a good man. He deserves to be loved and supported. Any advice would be helpful.

I struggle with the same thing I was diagnosed with adhd as a child and was put on 30mg Adderall until I was about 16 when my guardians caught me spitting them in the toilet (I had done so for years) once I was off I swore off medication in general because I had to go through withdrawal as a preteen and younger and addiction ran in my family so that may have been a factor but I digress I have found out in more recent years that those pills numbed me for so long I never processed my horrific childhood and teenage years because I was on the medication for most of them but I’ve also recently been diagnosed with anxiety agoraphobia depression and let me tell you medication can be a wonderful thing that is exactly what he needs but he has to be ready to make a decision on which is worse for his mental health the medication or his mental disorders going as they are. On the other hand he could need a different therapist if they haven’t atleast sought to deal with him shutting down and him cutting of his support system to do it alone is a death sentence. Yes it’s true one person should never be anyone whole support system but one of the biggest things people need in times of stress is just another person I think you should see if you could do a joint therapy session since it sounds like his mental health is now seriously effecting the relationship as a whole I have a lot more but I prob said to much also maybe see if he’d like to post on here anonymously ofc but just so he could be specific yk	isitbrieurlooking4	reply	na	na	na	0.9981112480163574	no	strong	no	na	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.
Thank you. He has been doing this as long as I've known him. Cutting himself off when the anxiety gets so bad. He just recently started with a new therapist and he's been micro dosing mushrooms. I think he's stopped micro dosing bc I've noticed he's not the same. There's a lot of trauma he has to process as well. He had also been diagnosed bipolar in the past, but he's not sure he got the correct diagnosis (hence the meds not really working). There's a lot of moving parts here. He had pushed me away a long time ago and then he realized what he had done & tried to come back into my life. I wasn't ready at the time for that. Now I'm seeing the same pattern of behavior. It just breaks my heart. I love him so much.	isitbrieurlooking4	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9981112480163574	weak	strong	no	na	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.
No no no no mushrooms are only for those mentally stable and the cutting of definitely is self destruction I think he saw through the clouds long enough to reach back out but ultimately if he keeps shutting down it won’t go well. I ruined the best relationship of my life while I was figuring things out we had reconnected in the middle of it and do to my own issues I ended things heh ig I’m self destructive sometimes too but what caused me to end things/cutoff people was because I felt I didn’t deserve her or the support of the people around me I still don’t really but I need to put my best foot forward always and hope to love who I see in the mirror each morning I think that’s the end goal for most of us anyway.

I suffer from an eating disorder and body issues as well. There are days when I cry because I feel so ugly. Others when I don't feel worthy of food or even love. Thought it would be better for everyone if I were dead. I'm not going to promise you that getting well is easy. It's not. I still have my good days and bad days. I still slip back in to disordered eating behaviors. I can tell you that it is worth it. I'm doing much better than I was a few years ago.

Personally, what I like to do is reward myself by doing the things I love after I finish. If I tell myself I can play a game after I do it, I’ll want to do it faster, and thus I will be more productive! However, there are many other ways to motivate yourself, like thinking about how much better you’ll feel after you do it! Or perhaps what you need is some positive reinforcement from a friend, etc!

Executive dysfunction. Something that can help (it wont solve it) but something that can help is the moment you think of what you need to do stop thinking and get up. If you let your brain process it for more than a few seconds it stops and you end up at the desk. So practice just getting up and doing the task immediately after you think about it.

Nothing annoys me more than this.. I have seen people I know pass away and the amount of comments and posts about them on Facebook is quite shocking really when you consider where was these people when they was alive? One example of this is a 21 year old woman I knew who committed suicide, after she died she was praised “oh she was the nicest girl ever” “she would do anything for anyone” “such a friendly person” yeah so much so you didn’t bother her when she was here.. she had commented depressing posts on her Facebook many times and none of those people bothered then.. even her own boyfriend didn’t seem to care much when she was alive but wasn’t long making it more about him when she died… I wonder if these people use their former friends death for a few likes or they realise it is too late now for them to bother to check in or care for these people, just because we aren’t kids anymore doesn’t mean we don’t need friends or support we need them more than ever.. our families or people we are forced to work with shouldn’t be the only people we talk to. How many strangers will talk of me when I die saying how much they liked me.. yeah I’m sure you did…	My-name-for-ever	post	25.630381267477617	female	White	0.9987163543701172	na	na	na	7	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.
Yeah . Thats an unfortunate reality. People dont really care about this stuff  when youre alive . Ive seen people getting mocked . Bullied and 100s of memes made on them . Their life used as a joke and a meme . But when they died . Everyone sympathized . He was a good man blah blah . .

"I sort of get where you're coming from. But the way I see it, there's nothing wrong with people mourning. I lost a lot of people. Friends I made in school, relatives, neighbors, etc. People will say things to acknowledge someone died. To acknowledge that someone was someone. The last person in my life who died died two weeks ago. I talked about how I used to not like him, but then we bonded over common interests. Although through time we didn't see each other, there was Facebook. I was sad. I said something. I talked about my regrets and things I should've said to him even though we seemed cool after the fact. As for my other friends and relatives and people I knew, I had contact with them before death. It's sad. Suicides, murder, accidents, sicknesses, etc. I say things about them that I have even said to them. I have a list of them in my phone. My opinion is this, as annoying as it can be, let people express themselves. People mourn and talk about gun violence victims that they've never met. It's just sympathy. One of my friends who committed suicide in 2016, I told her when she started college too talk to me if she needed anything. I understood that being a college student, and college athlete would probably hinder her communication. She then died in December. The one thing that pissed her sister off was because the people that were harassing her were writimg condolences. 

In my honest opinion, let people who are sad about a death express it. People do that for celebrities and they don't personally know them. Whether it's regret or sadness or anything. The way I see it, at least they're getting acknowledged. My point may not resonate with you, and I get that, but because I put such a high emphasis on acknowledging people I befriend while they're alive, even in the smallest way like commenting on things they post on Facebook and Twitter to start a conversation, death hurts me a lot. I never really see the ""they were my best friend"" posts. I just see acknowledgement and sadness. Only one time I got upset was as I mentioned earlier when the friend who killed herself in December was receiving condolences by the people who bullied her."

Exactly I guarantee they didn’t even see the people or spoke to them much when they was alive, the biggest sign of respect is to mourn in silence not blast it all over social media for a few likes especially putting in on the dead persons Facebook instead of their own because they know more people will see it that way, I remember I got attacked for saying this about a girl on tiktok who did this “why are you mentioning their death all over tiktok to strangers who never knew them” & it was their only viral video as well using pictures of a dead guy they knew… if I died and someone put me all over tiktok for strangers to see I would hate it	My-name-for-ever	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9987163543701172	no	no	no	na	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.

Short answer No. long answer you should try to find hobbies that either make you happy or have a purpose to de stress like jogs working out videos games woodworking art reading stuff like that this is also a great way to not feel lonely. As for losing friends do you feel it was something you did or because of the anxiety either way you should focus on your mental health first and be open with friends about what’s going on if they aren’t supportive chances are it’d be better without them. I suggest talking to your pediatrician or personal doctor about therapy and or medication I strongly suggest just the therapy unless they insist on medication	ConfidentTailor5491	reply	na	na	na	0.998988926410675	no	no	strong	na	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.
"Tl;dr
When unpleasant things happen, I feel numb, anxious and/or repulsed by my partner whom I love and treasure very much, and have a very strong healthy relationship with. I cannot find anything about this phenomenon. Any help would be very much appreciated<3


I [25F] love my partner[23F] to death, they are the light of my life, my sunshine and guiding moonlight, my best friend, my everything, and the best possible thing I could’ve ever asked for or dreamt of. We are in a very happy, stable, healthy relationship. 

Before we get into the problem, there are a couple factors to take note of.
Firstly, we are LDR(I live in Singapore and they live in the USA, California), we met online near the end of 2021 and we met up in person for the very first time last year in November and it was absolutely wonderful, the happiest 2 weeks of my life.
Secondly, I live in a pretty awful household. I’ve been severely emotionally abused and neglected my entire life and my family is the bane of my existence. I was also severely bullied growing up. I think I’d just sort of gone numb as a coping mechanism, at some point in my life I even experienced a couple months of depersonalisation/ derealisation during highschool. Right before I met my partner, I had just broken out of a 4 year depression period and was finally getting treated for adhd in hopes that I could get my life together. I was… extremely numb at that point, and I could almost feel my brain melting. Despite being numb, it scared me so much it’s what prompted me to see a psychiatrist. It was only last year where I’ve been able to realise the extent of my mental illness. Later on I started getting treated for anxiety and depression as well.

So! Around two months in of being with my partner, some family issues flared up and I was on the receiving end of one of my sister’s worst emotional outbursts. I didn’t think much of it, in the moment I reacted calmly. But I remember feeling extremely nauseous and anxious that night. The next day when I video called my partner, as we do, I noticed I was a little repulsed by them? Which was weird but my initial reaction was to brush it off however the feeling just kept growing stronger. They didn’t do anything different or anything, just looking at them filled me with what I can only describe as pure utter repulsion. Which is a complete utter 180 of the usual warmth and love I feel for them.
I spent the whole week bawling and inconsolable, not understanding and bewildered why I was repulsed by the love of my life. In the end I stayed at my friends place for 3 days to get away from my family and limited time with my partner to reduce the feeling of repulsion. I had very clearly communicated the situation to my partner who was extremely understanding, concerned and sympathetic but was unable to do anything, especially being the subject of my repulsion. After 2 weeks the the feeling slowly started to subside and I was able to feel my whole feelings of warmth and love for them again.

I’ve searched high and low on the internet but I cannot find anything about this phenomenon. Why is it directed at my partner, my favourite person in the world? Why not literally anyone else?🥲

Of course I knew there was always a possibility this might happen again but yet I was kinda caught off guard. A week ago my partner and I had a serious discussion after 2 weeks of them being away on a work trip and unable to call. It was over something we have discussed before and it’s something that can’t really be helped due to the distance and time difference of 16 hours, but nonetheless we both end up tearful and just… sad due to the circumstances.

Over the next few days I realised I was feeling numb and more baffling, anxious (but not repulsed) around my partner. Which has never happened before. They have always been my biggest comfort. The anxiety especially flares up when they mention things like our future visits or our hypothetical wedding and future house together. Usually I love discussing these things, and it makes me very happy knowing our future together is something we both think about. But currently they just fill me with anxiety and dread. I have since communicated all this to my partner and we have decided not to touch on those topics until further notice. They have been extremely sweet and supportive, and despite me being scared and confused I can’t feel my love for them, they have been extremely optimistic and confidant about my feelings for them. Which helps a little. At least someone knows how I really feel I suppose :’)) Since this isn’t their first rodeo they’re not scared and confused like last time, just sweet and supportive.

I don’t understand what happened, it’s not like we’ve never discussed serious before. We have very open and radical communication and honesty. So I fail to understand what triggered this bout of… whatever this is.:(

I’m panicking, I don’t know what to do. My partner is an amazing, wonderful person and aside from the inner daily inner turmoil and frustration, I also hate to put them through this. I miss them too, and I just… don’t understand why I feel this way or why this is happening. I’m scared. I don’t want to feel this way, I don’t want to lose them, I can’t help but feel they deserve someone who won’t go through this bouts of not even knowing how or why they feel a certain way. Is this normal? Am I doomed to periods like this for the rest of my life? Is this abnormal? Should I continue this relationship? If my brain self sabotaging?? Why is it targeting the best thing in my life?? Does it think it’s too good to be true?? I don’t want to hurt my partner😭😭 

If you’ve reached the end, thank you. This is certainly quite the long read😅 I appreciate you getting this far and if you have any advice or similar experiences, please enlighten me I’d be ever so grateful to learn from them.<3"	Traditional-Stock-71	post	22.858898721440745	female	White	0.003418516833335161	na	na	na	1	MentalHealthSupport	'ethnicity: asian, age: 25, gender: female, explanation: the author specifically identifies her age (25) and gender (female). given that she mentions living in singapore, it is reasonable to predict that she is of asian ethnicity.'
Is it bad that i’m 24, still living at home and have been struggling and not having any direction? The last few months have been so hard on me. My depression has gotten worse, I’m on meds. I’ve stopped trying to connect with friends and now I feel lonelier than ever. I feel completely worthless. I keep hoping and praying that things will change and one day it will be better.

"You’re very young, don’t be too hard on yourself. I was still at home when I was your age. I had severe insecurity issues and the worst days of my OCD troubles were on the horizon. It’s not necessarily bad that you’re still at home: it may be what’s best for you at this time. 

Based on things I’ve read, heard, and most importantly directly experienced, here are some recommendations: 

1. Find a therapist you feel comfortable sharing ANYTHING with and who understands you. I left therapy for years, I should have never done that. 

2. Focus on improving yourself without comparing your life to others. This is huge: no two people are living with the same exact challenges. Compete only with your past self; this keeps harmful emotions like jealousy and shame away. 

3. Incremental progress is absolutely necessary and helpful. Start small, no matter how small, and go from there. 

4. Do not isolate yourself. This can be very difficult, but it’s crucial. Communicating with others naturally gives us a better perspective on ourselves and life in general. The mind can do horrible things if we’re alone too often. 

5. Make a list of what’s most valuable to you in life, and never forget those things and individuals. This can keep you from drifting uncontrollably in life. I did it with the guidance of a past therapist. Seeing what’s most valuable to you on paper or a screen will help you make more productive decisions. 

6. Never ignore encouragement from reliable people. One of the reasons I’m in a better place is because of sincere encouragement from wise and caring people. They most likely see something you don’t at the time, and the encouragement can lead to life changing results. 

Best wishes, don’t lose faith in the future."	ConfidentTailor5491	reply	na	na	na	0.9980385899543762	weak	strong	no	na	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.
"(Before begining i want to say english isnt my frist language so im sorry for the misspells and stuff)

Im 16 and im really afraid of death, so much that is becoming a real problem, i get these panic attacks in which i cant stop thinking about my unstoppable death, it feels terrible and im so scared, no matter the way i look at it, i just cant calm down, i frightens me so much, the fact that im going to die and i cant do anything about it, no matter if i live a happy or a sad life, no matter if i dont or do think about death, no matter if i even care about it, i cant stop it, i cant do anything, no one can, ill inevitably die and it just scares me so much, the fact that death is eternal, no life never again, ill never see nice people again, ill never do things i enjoy again, ill never be able to eat delicious food again, ill never experience any kind of feelings, ill never suffer, ill never feel Joy, just nothingness for all eternity, it scares me so bad, i really dont want to die i really dont but begging wont change anything, ill die, and no one can help me, everytime i talk about it with someone they say ""but you got a whole life to live before happens"" and i know, but as i said it doesnt matter if i live a long or short life my destiny is dying, i really dont want to leave this world, living is so beautiful, i wish i believed in religion then i could live a believeing a lie thinking theres some kind of afterlife, i wouldnt care if i was sent to hell to suffer for all eternity because at least i would feel something, i just dont want to die i really dont and i said this already but i know begging wont save but it gives a fake sense of hope.
My elders say i will get tired of living when i grow up and that i will want to die, it sounds good but im scared that ill still want to live, even happiness has a down side and its the worst of all, this fear, this pain, this feeling its so terrible its so bad i really dont want to leave this world i want to do things i like for all eternity, i want to play games, talk with my loved ones, try bew stuff, and feel forever.
Ive always said that theres always another way to solve problems, the fact that this is the only problem i cant solve is so frustrating. 
I cant live like this, ive tried therapy in the past but it didnt do anything, im still afraid. 
Please im begging you, can someone tell me something i can do to at least leave this fear behind for good?"	PeppermintTeaBoy	post	9.948867054966113	male	Hispanic	0.9957348704338074	na	na	na	7	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.
"Oh honey, welcome to your first existential crisis! Ill let you in on a little secret. You are not alone! Everyone is terrified of dying, its the biggest uncertainty we have being self aware creatures. Everyone handles it differently. Some people turn to religion and find piece in believeing in an afterlife, others turn to drugs and superficial gains, others turn their fesr into motivation in order to acheive status or to make a mark on the world so as not to be forgotten, others procreate liie bunnies in order to try and prolong their lives, but what everyone has in common is that they are running awsy from their inevitable fate. The point is, you are right, you will die someday, but if that uncertainty bothers you, just know that you arent completely powerless. You have some control over when and how that could be. If you take care of yourself, yes you could still have an accident, but at least you know you didnt purposefully go out of your way to make it happen. Someone who is an alcoholic will drink everyday and die from liver failure, but theu could have lived longer and simply died from a heart attack. Sure, death is death, but you cant run or hide from it, you can really only do your best to make sure that the life you live right now, in this moment means something to you, personally. 

If youre someone who likes to think and asks a lot of questions, you should definitely look into philosophy. It can be a bit dry sometimes, but if you look into what different cuktures and historians have to say on the matter you may feel comfort knowing that its a fear as old as time. Kings and Emperors dedicated their whole lives to building vast empires so as to not be forgotten. They did horrible things to push their eventual end. We all die one day, but that doesnt mean the journey we have along the way is worthless. It just means that every moment is its own beauty because it may only be experienced once. 

When i was younger, I was terrified of sleeping because i thought id just never wake up. I would put on some music that i enjoy and i would tell myself that if i dont wake up, at least i enjoyed the last thing I heard. Its not a cure for the anxiety, but i eventually came to terms with it and while it still creeps back sometimes, i just have to accept it for what it is. It will be what it will be. 

I hope this gives you some comfort. 

As for philosophy, I rather enjoyed Emmanual Kant and Nietzche, but there are tons out there. Good luck."	PeppermintTeaBoy	reply	na	na	na	0.9957348704338074	weak	strong	no	na	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.

"What made me feel better was finding peace in spirituality. Not just Christianity, or other organized religion, but true spiritual practices and beliefs. Religions or spirituality might sound weird or like make believe sometimes, but the truth is we will never know what happens when we die. I have forced myself to believe that good, lovely things will happen and I’ll be shot back into the stream of love that time doesn’t exist within. 
I used to have panic attacks too, but I was younger than you and was so terrified of death. I still kind of am, as I think maybe that never goes away for all of us. I turned to some pretty dark times, smoking weed a lot and drinking heavily since I was like 14 I also started smoking cigarettes because I thought I might as well die sooner lol. But I was able to change once I found some spiritual guidance and basically understood that I was in charge of my life, not my death. 
I think self care and the idea that I could be in charge of who I am and how I impact people really helped me.  I’m sorry you’re going through this, I hope you can find some peace and comfort."	PeppermintTeaBoy	reply	na	na	na	0.9957348704338074	no	strong	no	na	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.
"The fact everyone is born with an expiry date should mean that everyone should live life to the fullest, be the best person you can be and experience all this planet&life has to offer.

The reality is, death isn't really about the person who dies it's about those that are left behind.

Unless you have a long term illness which in reality if you do and are suffering you'll welcome the end to come quickly to ease your pain.

"The way I interpret fear of death is that nothing in our control. It's a scary thought but if you think about it rationally and logically you begin to realise that there's freedom within that. Don't let your fear be the reason to hold you back in life. 

Easy said than done. I have had traumatic experiences and experienced death take many people at 11-25 years old. I know that one day in the future the death of more people will soon die, natural or incidental. Mentally preparing and acceptance is important, gaining independence as well.

Nothing and nobody last forever. If we were mortals/immune to death then we would be bored of our lives and passing away in life when you've found/gained your own purpose is how it should be. That in itself is beautiful. To conclude your own story. 

Two quotes I found reassurance with:

“Worrying is like walking around with an umbrella waiting for it to rain.” ―

""I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing.

"I’m afraid of dying.  I’ve also recently started praying.  I’ve asked various sources about the fear of death and was told while most people have it those with underlying depression or anxiety fixate on it much more.

I’m going to say please look into some therapy to help you learn to cope and dig deeper into your fears.  They absolutely are justified however at your age they should be on the back burner.

" Many years ago, I watched the Robin Williams movie ""What dreams may come"", and I always thought that in part, it was saying heaven will be whatever you want it to be - that each person's heaven is a manifestation of their own imagination. At least this is what I think.

I think about that often. My idea of heaven is a small cottage in the countryside, near a lake with no other houses around. I have my cats and dogs. There are no mosquitos, spiders or moths (the things I don't like). It rains every night from 6pm to 6am.

There is no stress, no noise. Just peace. Silence. Stillness. I am not being pulled in multiple directions as a mother, wife, friend, pet owner and employee.

Sometimes, when my heart and soul ache I feel like I could walk away from it all. Not death, just walk away and become an anonymous nobody..

Sometimes I wish someone could just wipe away part of my brain / memories, so I am not tortured anymore by my past, so that everything I do is not because of the abuse I suffered as the adopted child of a woman with untreated mental health issues..

"Hello. I'm a 53 year old single male. I don't have any friends and my family is quite small. My mother died in August and im still helping take care of my father. My brother lives in Southeast Asia, and my sister has her own family. She and I get along fine, but she never comes to see me. I have to go to her house a handful of times each year in order to be around my family. My nephew and I were best friends, but he constantly ghosts me and the only thing I can count on him for is disappointment. Nobody wants to hang out with an older single dude since all of the people I used to be friends with are all married and have their own lives. I find it hard to establish and maintain relationships with other humans. Is there a support group I can go to talk with others that have similar situations in the Houston area?

"This will be a bit disorganized, so sorry about that. Also be warned for talking about suicide/depression.   


I just feel like I've finally made progress mentally. I used to have a lot of issues, I've attempted suicide 4 times in my life, I used to have panic attacks all the time, and would stay up for days at a time. In short I was depressed, hopeless, and just straight up miserable. And now it feels like everything's different. It's not like I'm happy all the time, or even most of the time, but I finally feel like I'm seeing the world like everyone else does. I get sad but I don't get hopeless. It's been years since I've self harmed or had a panic attack. I honestly feel like I can say I'm no longer depressed. I still have to get my life together, but I feel like it's finally an option and like I can do it.   


And it's not like everything's totally fine now. I still get almost too anxious to function when I leave the house, and during the years and years of being depressed all my relationships got either ended or wierd, so there's still a lot to work on. Honestly, objectively speaking my life isn't that great, but relatively speaking it's literally more than I could ever hope for. It's a bit rough but I feel like I'm actually living and like I'm able to deal and cope.  


I'm posting this because I don't really have anyone to share with, and I'm just really emotional. Kinda feels like having a good life is just doing mundane things and not wanting to kill yourself.  I'm also kinda worried that all this might just be some form of bipolar, and like it could all be undone, and I'm still sad a lot, but right now I'm doing well and it's just shocking.

I cant say im happy with any aspect of my life. Im 21 years old. I haven’t had a girlfriend for roughly 5 years, im not good looking in fact im overweight, i dont have money, i have a job from 8am to 8pm and im average at best at everything.

I genuinely cant find a reason to be happy in life. I feel like my childhood is over and now the rest of my life will be working miserable jobs with fleeting moments of happiness between. 

My childhood consisted of my mum dating asshole men who would mistreat us during or after the relationship. I moved house roughly 13 times between the ages if 4 and 15.

Well let me stop you right there. Happiness is fleeting. Why? Because its an emotion, just like sadness and anger and everything in between. It is also partially a choice. Meaning you can choose to not let the negative emotions ruin your whole day. You have to feel what you feel, but you dont have to feel it forever. It all comes down to that stupid ideology of having a positive attitude. If you go in thinking everything is pointless then you miss the opportunities that could have given it meaning. It doesnt mean that bad things wont happen, just that you choose to not let those bad things encompass you.

My mental health (depression & anxiety) are effecting my work, my relationships and even my physical health. I do therapy and take my medication. I’ve been trying so hard for so long and it can seem unsustainable. Everything, even the smallest tasks, seems so daunting and difficult. I’m worried I’m going to get fired for missing work or permanently damage precious relationships. I would never hurt myself, as I’ve seen first-hand the ripple effects of suicide.

How can we as a community raise awareness about the harmful impact of negative stigma on mental health, and what steps can we take to reduce and ultimately eliminate the stigma surrounding mental health issues in order to promote a culture of acceptance, understanding, and support?	research_project_e	post	71.64631433724435	female	White	0.0017680882010608912	na	na	na	1	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.
"People dont take mental health seriously and when they do, they take it too seriously. Then the people who are mentally ill have to comfort the people around them in order to make them not feel awkward about it. I think if we normalized it and just said, ""ok, youre having a bad day, tmrw will be better"" and just treat people like they didnt do anything crazy, it would make all the difference. I dont mean ignore the behaviour per se, but basically just let them have their ""outbursts"", calm them down and move on with the day. The hardest part for me is the attention because then you feel bad for going crazy because you know people think you just want attention and then they start to treat you differently after, either being too gentle or writing you off completely. So you feel embarrassed and ashamed for being crazy and spend the time you should be using for self care taking care of others and trying to downplay the whole thing so that things can go back to ""normal"", even though the ""normal"" is what made you sick in the first place. Usually its a communication problem and us mentally ill people dont know how to properly communicate our needs for x reasons, usually related to trauma, which leads to us spiralling out of control and ending up ""going crazy"". The best help for the mentally ill is teaching us the tools we need that everyone else takes for granted. I didnt even know boundaries existed until i was like 26 years old. So when it comes to boundaries im basically a toddler still."	research_project_e	reply	na	na	na	0.0017680882010608912	no	strong	no	na	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.

this is a stupid suggestion maybe but have you ever taken magnesium for sleep? i've started taking magnesium glycinate before bed and it has helped me SO MUCH. i'm by no means a supplement person, never taken anything but iron for my anemia but goddamn that stuff works way better than melatonin ever has. i got my dad to start taking it at night too and he sleeps way better now. they're not terribly expensive, i can get a bottle of 60 so about a 2 month supply from my grocery store for $12, and for some reason they're always buy one get one free so that's a 4 month supply for $12 which is even better."	ellieellie7199	follow-up	na	na	na	0.0012006325414404273	no	strong	strong	na	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.

"Basically I taught myself to program in late 2012.
I put all my work into my microsd card. I would program almost if not every single day.
It got corrupted around May 2015.
Immensely devastating.
I held onto hope for repair as my coping mechanism.
In Early 2018 my idiot brother destroyed my side of our room when he got mad.
Left it for weeks. I left it hoping my parents would properly discipline and to not let him just get away with this.
My mom eventually cleaned the room. She took the opportunity to throw out stuff that she thought was trash.
Once it was sad and done my microsd card is missing and I have absolutely no clue where it is. Probably in the garbage system somewhere.
The room after cleaning had a bag of paper (I did game design on paper as well as other things I would write over my high school experience. I graduated HS in 2017)
A couple months ago I realized that my bag of papers was gone.
At some point my other brother and/or my mom must of threw it out cleaning MY side of the room without my permission, consent or even notifying me.

I think about my card daily and the loss is immensely painful. lol my indie games , apps and such I made. It feels like I lost myself. I tried so hard to set myself up for starting adulthood to right and lost it all.

Now I'm 24, broke, no girlfriend, struggling, and very upset and angry. This was not supposed to happen.

I am still very angry and I am in absolute disbelief. Disbelief I trusted my family to discipline my brother. Disappointed I wasn't able to fight the pain enough at the time to clean the room myself so my mother wouldn't throw stuff out (I deliberately told her NOT to), and that my dad completely failed in discipline as well. Also how my other brother would get in the way when it was time for me too deliver some accountability.

If I'm not thinking about the microsd card, then I am thinking about my papers. If not that then my first laptop I got around like 2010 (I had filled with videos and such I made in Windows Movie Maker and filmed with the webcam) that I told my parents to make sure it was NOT WIPED. Instead they trusted the idiot ""repair"" man on the phone who subsequently wiped my pcs hard drive. If not that I'm thinking about my flash drive I lost on the last day of school that had important life videos and such on it and backups of my website projects.

I am just devastated and even though this isn't like a person died it still feels super painful for me.

I just don't know what to do. I feel so miserable."	NiceLambo	post	13.91203142111289	male	White	0.9981570839881897	na	na	na	1	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.

"have anxiety that flares up under certain circumstances. I was diagnosed with PTSD years back but have felt pretty good for many years UNTIL I was asked to do a live scan for a job working at a school. I was not expecting this as it was not in the job description nor was I told over the initial phone conversation or emails.

I had legal problems about 20 yrs ago when I was really young, nothing bad some misdemeanors and 1 felony. I was super young and it got blown out if proportion because my parents are nuts and i had an informant EX who tried to put me in jail after I left him...long story but I went through about 10yrs of hell due to these stupid cased which I could've pled out to probation and been done but my family is nuts...did some stupid crap long story

I haven't had any legal problems since and it's been almost 15years since cases were settled. I thought I had worked through my anxiety now its back full force. Anything related to court, police etc, sets me off but this time it's like back to square 1.

My live scan should be clear. I don't Think those cases will show up. I read 10yrs maximum. I've done normal background checks didn't have anxiety and passed but this love scan has me full of anxiety

Like I feel like it's some way for then to track me or idk just a bad feeling .

I've had this a couple times, once I had to go to court for a traffic ticket and after I was like ok I got worked up over nothing but I can't seem to bring myself to do this.

Am I making a big deal out of nothing or should I just let this job go for the sake of my mental health?"	Unstable5150	post	36.692795654298436	female	White	0.9991276860237122	na	na	na	3	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.
Well you know and can identify that its a trigger for your  PTSD. Thats a good thing! Have you tried to figure out what about it exactly makes you anxious tho? I mean you could try and take control by just outing yourself and this way even if they do know about it, at least theyll appreciate your honesty. You can exolain that its been 15 years and you dont think itll show up, but that you wanted to be honest in case it does. You highlight all the good and growth youve done since then and worst comes to worst maybe you dont get the job, but if youre planning on leaving anyways, whats the real harm? At least you tried.

Like what if I need to lay low again they can always  find me...I got like this because  I eventually  stopped going  to court for my cases and I always  had warrants that I eventually  got picked up on so I  got more anxiety and I really  didn't  want to go back to court so I got more warrants and I'm and out of jail  for 10 yrs because  I never cleared  up a case that could've been  nothing but probation.  

It wasn't until  a friend  of friend  who was quite a bit older than me at the time amd had mebtal health issues  as well suggested  I get a therapist  to intervene  with the court  to explain  why I wasnt going  and after i got an evaluation  report submitted  I didn't  have to go to court anymore and it finally  got resolved."

I quit my job almost 3 weeks ago. I was emotionally and mentally invested in my job. I didn't even realize when i crossed that line of just working and becoming attached to my work. Every job i left in the past, it had no affect on me. I left this job because i was so attached and knew nothing i did would change that as long as i worked there. I believe it started out with having excessive workload and i adjusted to doing everything i could to maintain it. But i don't understand how it got this bad. It feels like i lost a child or like i went through a bad breakup. I am single with no kids and don't have too many hobbies. Just trying to understand why and how my brain developed such an unhealthy attachment. Now i feel empty and void.

"i've always been a worrying and neurotic type of person but recently i've been experiencing physical symptoms. i'm starting to doubt some of my long term thoughts/feelings as well as i think that they might not be as normal as i think they are.

context is i'm a high school senior (f, 18) who broke up with a boyfriend 2 months ago that goes to the same school and keeps coming back to me. he's very angry at me behind my back (he rants about me w my friends) but asked me to be friends and basically begged me to be there for emotional support when he needs it. recently he said he's been having violent thoughts whenever he sees me, and has been telling my friends to block me. anyway that's a whole other story, but essentially i feel really stressed and on-edge near him. 

every time he dms me, basically confronting me abt the relationship that ended, i instantly feel a rise in heart rate and start to feel really really cold (esp hands). i also have full body tremors that go on for a solid while (15-30 mins or until i feel less stressed). i also feel really worried and anxious and i would love to ignore him but my mind can't focus on anything else.  i also have been having sleep paralysis and i've always suffered from insomnia tbh. when i try too hard to sleep my mind is racing and i see bursts of colors and i feel really active

it's not just his messages that trigger it but i also feel this stressful response before going on stage for performing or before exams, but to a lesser extent. i'm also wondering if it might be social anxiety, as i've always been a shy person but realized that recently it's been preventing me from doing normal things. i've been performing my instrument for most of my life but recently developed stage fright. i also physically cannot use my voice in certain situations like when i want to participate in class. idk i just find it impossible to raise my hand even tho i rly want to. i also find it extremely tiring to hang out with friends so i've been avoiding that. even the idea of going on vacation is not as fun as it should be. when i go on walks outside i feel stressed when a car drives by or if another person walks by. i'm scared for college because i feel like i won't be able to make friends and i'll hate it there. 

other potential symptoms that i've had for basically my entire life is picking at my lips until they bleed and also feeling like something bad will happen soon(esp when i'm happy). 

any help would be appreciated! feel free to ask me for elaboration bc i know i did a bad job at explaining this..."	froggiecakes10	post	12.814684752635548	male	White	0.9976449608802795	na	na	na	1	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.
"This sounds  like anxiety.  Stop talking  to ymyour ex b.f. if it's stressing  you out. Your not together. He can talk to other Friends

   I'm worried  that your ex b f.  Said he has violent  thoughts  about  you. Not good especially  if he's having  mental  health  issues . Tell your  friends  and parents  about  this.

I would  try to make some excuse like your phone  is broke or you got your account  hacked so you can stop talking  to him without  passing him off because I don't  like  how he's acting and he might lose it.

For other stuff sounds  like anxiety and it you have to try and push through  it best  you can.

"you're in a really rough spot right now, i can tell. i'm lucky that i've never been homeless but i feel the hopelessness so much. it's the worst thing in the world.

i know me saying ""it'll get better"" isn't helpful, but hopefully ""you can make it better"" does. i'm sure you're doing things to survive, trying to save up money etc, but how you feel is important too.

is there something you love to do? reading, writing, making things? you can get all kinds of craft supplies from the dollar store. i got $3 worth of supplies to make bracelets when i was at my worst and it helped me so much. the bracelets weren't magically fixing my problems, but it was *something*. i could make bracelets for 10 minutes and i would be in a good mood for 10 minutes. knowing that i could give myself that mood boost for 10 minutes helped me realize i'm not helpless, and maybe i can make things better in the long run.

i'm glad you have the willpower to keep going. not having the motivation is hard, too, but you have the willpower. that's step one. just go as small as you can from there. my family always says ""how do you eat an elephant? one bite at a time"". maybe you can take a bite in the morning by tidying your car up a bit- just wiping down surfaces. maybe you can take a bite by doing something fun with your hair. i think we don't realize how many tiny things we can actually do. doing those tiny things has helped me with the helplessness, even if the big problem is still there. 

if you're in the united states, there might be helplines you can call too, that have better advice. it'll suck having to do this alone until may. a lot of people will just sit and talk to you. they might have advice on how to get real treatment sooner, too. if you're not a phone call person, there are chat websites too. the only one i know off of the top of my head is 7cupsoftea but i've had mixed experiences with them- it's all volunteers and some of them have been really helpful for me, and some of them haven't been worth talking to.

i get the money habits thing, too. you deserve little treats even if you don't have a ton of extra cash. don't deprive yourself entirely of coffee and lip balm, but if you can try to start thinking of it like a reward that could be helpful :)

Hello

I am conducting a study on ""Orthorexic tendencies, Social Media and Body Image"" The results of this study will be used to fulfill the requirements of my dissertation. So, if you are an Instagram user and have about 10 minutes (at the most) to spare, I would request you to fill in this form. Here’s the link: [https://forms.gle/bkqpEpbHj8aK3v5b6](https://forms.gle/bkqpEpbHj8aK3v5b6)

Thank you so much in advance

Feel free to reach out to me"		post	19.23084529097195	female	White	0.002141991164535284	na	na	na	1	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.
"hi, i did the survey. i think it would be worth asking not only if your ""defect"" has affected your life but whether or not your perception of it has. i know my perception of my physical appearance has caused problems, but my appearance itself really hasn't.

also, i don't struggle much with orthorexia but i do struggle with body dismorphia and anorexia, and i almost entirely blame it on my use of instagram at a young age, so i'm happy to see this being talked about. if you want any more information from me, you can send me a message and i'll give you my email address :)"		reply	na	na	na	0.002141991164535284	weak	strong	strong	na	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.
"female, 31 here

in the past i have had moments of despair but usually i was able to lift myself up by travelling and adopting new habits. all i wanted was some comfort and i got it - and life felt a little more meaningful again. now i see that they were only distractions from the absolute terror of living. 

I've become very dissilusioned with life. I can't help but ""see through"" people and things - but what i see is deterministic, nihilistic, fatalistic. It seems like my life is over. i look at my parents, friends, siblings and i feel so bad. they also exist in this strange realm, making it up as they go or relying on the programs they know - culture, religion, rules, expectations. but none of these programs has any answers. i see sadness underneath the facades. 

when i see people who devote their life to an idea, who promote things they believe in, i cannot fathom how they have the energy and will to organize any such thing. i cannot believe people bring children to this world. i just cannot understand. 

i don't feel truly close to anybody. my connections with friends and family are tenuous - i can see how none of us really sees each other, we interact with the avatars we ourselves created of others, based on what we assume them to be. 

it started with a visceral realization that i am going to age and deteriorate before i die. now i can barely feed myself. i have deep convictions about diet and fitness so these habits are ingrained - i make sure to eat at least once a day and i exercise albeit lethargically to fill the empty hours. i have very little pleasure from humor, music, books - things i normally enjoyed. thinking about my garden, which usually worked as an antidepressant makes me depressed - because in a year another winter will obliterate it once again. riding my bike and looking at the sky doesn't bring me much comfort either - because the world they exist in is so cold and uncaring. 

i am living off of my savings and an idea to get a job or even a ""project"" seems laughable. selling my time to keep on existing on a comfortably numb level. i fantasize about joining some kind of monastery or even army, just so i don't have to think or decide for myself and maybe be useful to others. 

today i accidentally dipped my braid in my tea and minutes later i shaved off all my hair. why would i need nice long hair anyway. 

i never had any professional help but i already see they won't be able to refute my argument - this world is chaotic and unfathomable and we will die soon. people are like machines running on their programs. all love, friendship, warmth can only distract us for some time. 

i can't even imagine any future"		post	31.90975946676849	male	White	0.9988734126091003	na	na	na	9	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.
"You sound like me on my low days. I agree with everything and personally think you're absolutely right. It's sad. We're all here, stuck in this ""whatever this is"" and for what? I personally am atheist, so when someone dies, the thought of afterlife isn't comforting. The idea of law is weird - who decided the rules? Why? All the way down to the very neighborhood you live in. Why do I have expectations there, too?


I don't know if this will help, but with therapy (I know I know) I'm learning to just... enjoy my time here. I want to exist peacefully, as happily as I can, and that means accepting those sad things as reality. Before therapy, I couldn't think this way, EVER. Now that I've had someone (therapist) to help me practice (I use grounding techniques) I feel more connected to the earth, myself, my feet, and my loved ones. I've decided what matters to ME, (for me its the people I'm around, as well as myself) and I care for it. 


But you can't get there or find it without help. Trust, I used to paint beautiful things. I used to do powerlifting. I used to play fun video games. I cannot do any of it anymore... but I found other things, that are easier for me. I'm still clawing my way out of the hole, in hopes that I get back to my hobbies, but I'm not giving myself a time limit. For now, my focus is on being present, and finding internal contentedness. Perhaps give it a try with a therapist. Perhaps your brain needs help, a la medication. Who knows. Use it as your next ""thing"". You go to therapy. Cool. Maybe you can add other healing items to it, like eat some veggies for the day. Brush your teeth. Drink some water.


Oh, and I did do the army thing. I joined the armed forces because of not having a direction or purpose. I wanted someone to tell me what to do. Tbh, it worked. It sucked. But it got me going again. It isn't the worst thing you can do for yourself. 🤷‍♀️ 


Find yourself a good therapist. You guys probably won't argue much. Ideally they'd help you organize your thoughts and figure out what is going on in that brain of yours. 


And don't worry about the hair, bald is always beautiful imo. And if you miss it, it'll come back. Take it as a wake up call to yourself that you feel you're lacking control in your life, is my best advice. And seek a professional to help your brain get back on track.

"I really like what Vincent and perfect mentioned. 

I think I want to add in on the mindset bit. 

I’m wavering too and my savings are about at the end and did bring a child into the world.. not the planned, happy go lucky- let’s have kids. 

Like oh shit.. couldn’t bring myself to terminate with lack of support, now I live to try and enrich and be able to teach him how to make it in this world. He has restart button essentially. Learn how to make money young and why and don’t believe in the “you’re young once don’t care until you’re 25” and government and life kicks you in the ass and that degree you get is ten times what congress paid essentially 😂 sorry ramble talk- but I’ve been trying to niche out of this rat race. Gain more freedom with funds, and do it in a way that allows me time in home life and try our best to be prepared by healthy foods, healthy exercise, healthy mind- and that’s the hard one. 

I grew up attached to “Mind over Matter” that got me through physical pain endured whether discipline, medical, or life accidents on a bike. I feel that could add to dissociation, but that with “If you can change the way you think, you can change your behavior” 

I’ve sought out therapists for 10 years so I know the wall feeling too.. but it’s also why I’ve gotten as far as I have. 

I’ve just been introduced to the idea of ART therapy? I still must look into it, I’m not sure if actual art is involved- but it’s suppose to be an accelerated version of EMDR (for traumas and deeper work) and feeling the faster pace with it would be better than long dragged out emotions over 8 months or more. Etc. 

So pay attention to therapy types too. Doing an interaction therapy with my child too (never knew such a thing) and is helping with reframing positive communications and interactions. 

There’s DBT and CBT - most common, more talk therapy and work to challenge thoughts or behavior- but I find 45 minutes not long enough because it feels like “this is my life the entire week.. “ 5 minutes what are ideas to practice yada yada.

"Not gonna lie it feels like a wall to me too. I started my mental health journey in 2019, and I've had 6 therapists (I moved a LOT in that time... thank you military). 2/6 were bad. One made me regress she was so bad. But I got one I like now, and she's helping. It's gonna be a constant thing for me in my life, going to therapy. But alls that to say, if you can get over that wall and find the right fit, only good things can come of it. It's better to find a couple bad ones and keep trying, than giving up cuz nobody has helped yet.

I think the way to change is to be willing to change. Be open to it and have patience. Further and further try to get out of the mental state you have created. Your mind is killing your spirit. If you open your mind then your spirits will come back to you. I would try to get outside in nature if you can. But have patience, give yourself time and give yourself some space. Focus on yourself you deserve to find your own happiness. :)		reply	na	na	na	0.9988734126091003	no	no	no	na	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.
i dont know why but i feel like i m mentally too weak. This is related to my examination. Even i prepare study hard for my whole semester, i cant ready anything just before exam day. There is 3 day gap in before each of my examination. I have noticed that i cant just study in those days. I feel too feared. I started to cry in those days. I am living far away from my home and i dont even have any friends. I feel so fucked up becaude of this . even i know so much thing about the subject i cant deliver in examintion. My body starts to shiver in exam hall, especially my leg. And these thing happening with me for so long time. but i cant resist now. it is keeping me into depression for my poor performance in exam despite all my hard work. I become too anxious during exam, Does anyone have the same case? is this happening because there is deficiency of some sort of nutrients in my body? Help me out please. Its killing me inside.

"Im really starting to hit that wall. I have been in therapy for almost 2 years and was seen by the psychologist once to confirm PTSD with depression and anxiety. Was put on hydroxyzine that literally just makes me sleep. Having an almost 3 year old, full-time college, and full-time job as a care giver isnt safe to take. She never scheduled a follow-up appointment, and therapy isn't helping at this point because nothing can be done about the situation that's causing the PTSD. 

Homework and classes are becoming a struggle, having the mental to split my time so my kid has her activities during the week. I'm literally just wanting to scream.

"Tomorrow (3/14) is my birthday, and I’ve struggled with body image issues most of my life. I told myself today after work that I would take it easy and have a rest day. Afterall, it’s my special day tomorrow. I’m usually spinning away on an indoor bike trainer or running outside each and every night. At one point I was 5’8, 210lbs. I’m now 5’10, 142lbs and in the best shape of my life. But none of that accomplishment bears any weight, because a once healthy habit has turned into a nightmare. I don’t allow myself to eat without “earning” my meals by burning calories, and if I don’t “earn” it, feel an insane amount of guilt that’s nearly led me to voluntarily purging the contents of my stomach. Also, all the foods/snacks I once enjoyed when I was younger, I now shun and avoid completely, aka “impure” foods (in my mind). 

It’s definitely getting worse, and the constant obsession is spiralling outwards each day. It’s all I think about, and has impacted my quality of life immensely. I could really use any advice on the initial baby steps to repairing my relationship with food and/or athleticisim, and removing the idea that taking one easy day is going to reverse all of my progress.

(TW - depression, anxiety, hallucinations, etc.)

Im 18 yo f. 
So I started getting professional mental health help last year when (I think I have been suffering with mental health problems since middle school basically very long time ago) I was also diagnosed with crohn's disease (IBD). At first the mental help was a psychologist? Basically I only got to talk but never got any pills. It took almost a year for me to get an appointment at and actual therapist (that could prescribe me pills) this was highly and I mean highly recommended by my psychologist. But from where I am from these things take actual ages... I was at the therapist once and she ""diagnosed"" me with depression and anxiety disorder so far. I am waiting to get more appointments where I can actually be prescribed and further diagnosed. I was getting better at some point I'd like to belive but it's just all coming back it's too overwhelming. Besides I am off school because of my chronic disease (school from home only this year because I am at the worse stages still and taking hard medication every few hours) I am expected to make it this year and I've only just started getting grades (whooping 3 grades) and there is only  3 months left. Lately I've been getting more and more anxious and had a severe panic attack last night which included delusions hallucinations and just anything bad you can think off. It lasted about 3+ hours before I contacted a friend. They were able to somewhat calm me down but I'm not ok at all. I get smaller panic attacks throughout the day and paranoia and am scared to try and sleep since that happened last night so I am having anxiety about having anxiety. If you are thinking ""get professional help"" I am litterary trying but it takes ages when I do look for it...thank you for reading <3"	Mountain-Ad2580	post	29.774550264438986	female	White	0.9982858300209045	na	na	na	2	MentalHealthSupport	failed
As someone who has lived a long side mental health issues for years, I know the feeling of it feeling like it's crashing back down. I have to say, that unfortunately, this is normal. There will always be up and down periods but the key is learning to cope with those periods. I don't have IBS personally, but it sounds like your physical health might be triggering some of your mental health. And that's normal, too. We are, after all, only mortal. It is normal to panic about health. Focus on staying on this earth, making yourself happy, and getting your gut to calm down a little first. I think once you're settled in with your IBS and learning to cope with that, I think you'll find the mental health might lessen as well. Or at least, it will be easier to manage. I hope you feel better 🥰	Mountain-Ad2580	reply	na	na	na	0.9982858300209045	weak	strong	no	na	MentalHealthSupport	failed
"Idk if this really goes here but I'm hoping someone can relate. 

I get depressed to the point that I hate everything and everyone and I just want to like punch a wall (kinda like a highschool boy who's angry , 😅). But during my depression days it's out of anger at myself and to make me feel something. And I get mad at myself cause I'm aware of how I'm feeling and can't snap out of it so I'd rather cause myself some sort of pain than feeling just empty and zombie like. And when those days come I know I'm just going to get worse.

But what's worse for me is the good days where I know it's a good day and I know it's going to snap and go bad. But I get so much energy but I have no love for anything and I have nothing to do so I'm bored which pisses me off and I just want to hit something to ruin my mood cause If I'm in pain I'm no longer happy so it's easier to deal with. 

Idk if anyone can relate but like any advise or anything? My therapist said I should try kick boxing or something in those lines but it's just not the same feeling I'm after. Idk."	Raerae126	post	14.563384711676397	male	White	0.9940474033355713	na	na	na	1	MentalHealthSupport	failed

Kissed my friend while he was on a break from his gf. He got back together with her. He flirted twice more with me when we were drunk and tbh I didn’t stop him. I laughed along and was drunk leaning on him etc. then I woke up and realized what a shitty human being I was and stopped it all. I apologized to him and asked that he apologize to his gf as well. For the past three months I’ve had horrible anxiety and ocd over this. I know I disrespected her and her relationship. The guilt is literally killing me. I can’t sleep. I can’t eat. I always cry over how horribly I acted. I’ve blocked the guy. But I cannot stop feeling so horrible about the way I acted. I’m 25 not a child. I’ve been cheated on so why did I let this happen?? I feel so bad that I’m giving myself stress migraines. All I wanna do is hurt myself. I want to end this pain. All day every day it’s the same. I can’t stop thinking about how much I’ve hurt her. I can’t move on. I’m stuck in that place where I’m disgusted by myself and I hate myself. I am so horrible and I deserve every second of this. There is no sympathy for me. But I just wish I could feel a second of relief. I am so regretful and so remorseful and I just want to stop.

Your post exemplifies this to the letter.

Ironically yours truly did something similar a long time ago and it came to mind today.  I was lead by passion not sense, hormones, nor morals, etc.

I apologized to god and to myself and after beating myself up realized that was a different man than I am today and I cannot go back, only move ahead.

You will have to weigh it out if telling her is the right thing or not and whether it is habitual for him but you did say they were on a break - still crappy though.

I have to wait for her mom to be gone because I can't handle another abusive situation, or even being around it. The issue is, my best friend has a lot of memory problems. She said she's tried a lot of things to help but nothing's worked. She doesn't even care that she can't remember stuff because it's only a problem for me. I'm supposed to be moving in with her, 6 hours away from all of my family and other friends, and I don't even know if she's going to be mentally there. What am I supposed to do?

What I am curious about is that is it physical memory loss or mental? The difference here being: is her brain actually degenerating (if she is young it is highly unlikely) or it is mental barricades. You see, the brain is like an ever changing organ and it is powerful. It will be able to use certain coping mechanisms if it thinks that that is necessary at the moment. It will so to speak block the conscious you fro accessing that information but mind you, it is still there you are just not allowed access. This can be due to childhood trauma, lack of confidence in yourself and go on. It is your body's way of ensuring 'evolutionairy survival' The good thing is that the memory loss it totally fixable, the bad news is, it is not just a pill you can take, it is hard work and really wanting it to change and making the 100% conscious effort to improve. Not many can do this but everyone is actually able to do it however it requires tremendous discipline and many just give up along the way. The mind is ming boggling powerful. Maybe ask her, when she 'suffers memory loss' does she have a sensation that the information is actually there and that she knows she knows, but she just cannot recall it might a frustration sensation? I cannot judge the situation of course if I do not have context so maybe if you guys are down write an extensive explanation, what is the process, the situation etc. in which the memory loss is happening	GeminiLemon	reply	na	na	na	0.9981867671012878	no	no	strong	na	MentalHealthSupport	failed

Hey! I'm not sure if this will help, but you could try writing down your thoughts and understanding what triggers you. Also, deep breathing exercises (during attacks) could help so you can try that as well. If anxiety is really making your everyday life difficult, try to talk to a professional if you can. I hope you can ease your anxiety, even if not from my suggestions but from something else. Anxiety isn't fun and you of all people probably know that really well.

I have been trying to settle with a telehealth psychiatrist for months and finally when I found one I liked, he left the practice 🤨 so now I have to find another one and likely go through everything all over again. And I have to do telehealth due to my husband having our car for work during typical work hours and lack of childcare.	jlk1207	post	20.01072313421438	female	White	0.9988117218017578	na	na	na	1	MentalHealthSupport	failed
It sucks having to get a new person you like learn your thoughts, feelings, emotions, etc. I’ve been through 4 counselors in almost 2 years. First one I had for 6 months then they quit randomly. The 2nd one really helped and she was extremely nice. Then the place I went to closed down. Then the 3rd and 4th ones were just unhelpful and seemed like they were there for a paycheck instead of helping people. (I understand wanting money but in that profession you need to make people feel like you care.) So I basically gave up on the whole counseling scene. The professionals we have now seem a bit under qualified for the job.	jlk1207	reply	na	na	na	0.9988117218017578	no	strong	no	na	MentalHealthSupport	failed

You have to accept yourself and realize all the good qualities about you. Sure, everyone has some bad qualities, but that doesn't mean that's all you are. If people praise you, they mean it and you shouldn't bring yourself down just because you don't believe them. Everyone is wonderful in their own way.

"(Idk if this matters but I am 17 almost out of highschool)

So let me give you all a short summary of what happened before I tell you the issue. So basically about a year ago me and girlfriend of almost three years broke up with me totally out of the blue. Then she came out as lesbian, then dated a girl. After that she came out as bisexual and dated 2 more guys. (This is all within a 5 month timespan) Then I found out that she actually got pregnant while we were together and she had an abortion with another guy.

While she’s out trying to find someone knew I am completely lost. It’s a constant mental battle in my head. I’m fighting suicidal thoughts, which is whatever because I’ve struggled with those for a while. 
But it’s come to a point where I feel like  I have no control over my life. I feel like I’m out of my own head. Like I’m just a zombie where I go to work and come back home. I’ve tried hanging out with friends more to see if that’ll help but that’s just a temporary fix.

I’ve tried anti depressants (Fluoxetine) and they work for a while but after about 4 months it stops working. So now I just use my CBD pen (which is completely legal in my state) and that kinda helps I guess.

I’m just so exhausted mentally all the time. A lot of days I can’t even get up to just go fix food for the day. 

The only way I can shake the feeling of “outside my own head” is basically by doing the next things as following

1. I do my homeschool work (there’s a lot more that happened why I quit public school)

2. I go to work 1-9

3. Then I come home and edit videos and record videos. (I do YouTube in the side because it’s a dream career)

4. Get high and repeat.

The only way I can shake this feeling is drowning myself in work. If you have any ideas on how to shake this feeling please let me know."	AnnualAlternative637	post	15.774489578796342	male	White	0.9980210065841675	na	na	na	5	MentalHealthSupport	failed
"Hey man, I usually do not respond in this sub, but somehow I opened your post and I feel the need to answer you. I do not know what I am going to write but let me just start and see what comes up. First let me state that you are indeed in a horrendous situation and you have much to deal with, and I really see your struggle playout. I am in no position to diagnose you but in simple terms, you have gotten depressed, numbness of feeling (nothing really matters anymore so why keep living?, could be a form of reasoning that might sound familiar) .

Accepting the state that you have gotten yourself into is the first thing you should try to completely comprehend. Yes you read it right I said ""gotten yourself into"" but let me first explain what exactly I mean with this. It might seem a really direct way to hit you right where it hurts but you see probably you have desensitized yourself and what I am saying is not wrong. The situation with your ex is of course not your fault, and you should never have even a hair of doubt within you that tries to find fault in who you are or how you have behaved.

Having said that, it is your doing to remain in the mental cycle (using your brain like a casette player, pressing rewind and play everyday, all day) You might not be aware that this is what is happening in the background of your mind, so you might not recognize what I am saying right now. But you ultimately have control over that casette player, you could at any time press stop, get the tape and put it on a shelf. Maybe even putting it in the ""experiences that helped me self develop"" box after a while. But until the moment you do not even realise that you are not the listener to the tape, but actually the one pressing the buttons all the time.

This is easier said than done so let me also give you some insight into what might be causing you to do that. You see, the human mind is addicted to misery, it feels predictable safe (ironically enough) because lets face it, when we have misery we press rewind and repeat thus it is predictable, we at least KNOW. The moment we decide to press the stop button, ""who knows what will happen"" is what the body might think. The body has more control than you might even realise.

Now zooming in on what happened, you have attached yourself mentally to your ex and that attachment served you (in someway, talk for another time) when things went well, it helped you feel connected and safe with her, but now she is no longer there that attachment became an anchor that weighs every aspect of your life. You say that you do not want that feeling but in fact, you are deep down aware that you are carrying that anchor with you everywhere you go. The only time that that anchor is floating (less weight) is when you get high, but as you see the moment you get sober that anchor is still there.

Now, talk talk, talk ""how do I get rid of the anchor"" well it's simple yet so difficult. You need to think, think deeply. You need to get into your subconscious because that is where the anchor has attached itself and I will give you some guidelines on how to do it. However, I can push you so you can learn to cycle, but you have to move your own legs to move the peddle and keep going.

Okay lets go, there are of course several ways in doing this but I will try to give you the one that is in closes reach (a psychiatrist can also do this if you allow him) but lets say you want to try it yourself first. Okay, at a moment in the day that you are feeling not sleepy try to make a mindset that you are in control and that everything you are going to do after that moment is done by the one actually in charge, YOU. It is good to note that your body will in the first place not agree with this power shift and will do everything it can (everyone responds differently) to prevent you from reaching the realization that you are in control but here is where will power is important. KEEP ON GOING do not let anything stop you, not even yourself. Maybe it helps to write it down on your hand or a paper to have the intention 'set in stone'. clean your room (in case it is not clean, clean room clean mind) and afterwards lay on bed with headphones or ear buds in so that nothing disturbs you.

Next put on nice music for example ""meditation music for focus"" and choose the music that speaks to you. Now you are ready to delve deeper in yourself and go to the mainframe. Listen intently to the music  (if you choose well there is no speech in the song) try to listen to the music and ask yourself ""what does it make me feel?"", ""what is the pattern that I hear repeat"" this ensures that your can catch your focus (little bit trying to tame a bull). You can also try to describe everything that you feel in the moment ""How soft is the bed that I am laying on?"" How heavy does the blanket feel?"", keep doing this and you WILL feel a quieting of the mind, it can take 5 min but it can also take an hour or longer it depends on how well you are able to remove the intrustive thoughts and how well you are able to recognize 'focus'.

Well once you have established that focus you have the power (and believe me you have) to direct that focus inwards by telling yourself ""okay now I am here and I want to remove that anchor lets find out where it is and why it is there"" You will need to keep focusing on that intention and try to follow the route that your thoughts take (kind of like mind surfing in your own mind). You will notice that you go deeper, deeper, deeper.

You see if I can make another example you also mention that you tried anti depressants, meeting up with friends but that is a temporary solution and let me tell you why. If you can imagine that the anchor that we are talking about are like tree roots in the ground, not visible on first sight but believe me they are rooted deep. What the pills and friends do is saw the tree to a stump, but the stump still has its roots attached. So it is a matter of time until the tree is grown again and the whole rodeo starts anew. That is why you need to find the roots.  I hope this is clear.

Well you will need to WANT to find the roots and it can and most likely will be painful with realization that you might not like, part of the problem the roots are there might actually BE YOU. but instead of getting devasted you should celebrate that you found it because they WERE there all along it doesn't matter if you would have realised or not. You see the problem with many people is that they never realise the roots and thus when years go by the roots go deeper and deeper and more sand will cover the stump, the tree and suddenly the whole tree is hidden (people stop feeling the pain or depression) yet the tree is still there. This can lead to various mental illnesses including alzheimer. But that is not the point now. You need to realise the great power you have in facing any fear you have and realise that you CAN do it and you have the power to do it.

Once you realise the roots you can make a decision, do I go back to being ignorant, knowing the full truth, or do I actually change myself based on the newly acquired information. I give you my blessings may you decide to walk this path because let me tell you it is not a easy one, it is one meant for warriors so to say. But I think you reaching out to reddit and talk about what you are going through is evidence enough that you wont let that corruption get the better of you. As I mentioned in the beginning I wouldn't know how I would respond I just felt I needed to, you might call it divine intervention. Do not let yourself get dulled out and become a mere shell of what you are supposed to be because you are as me, Do not walk the long path but choose the narrow short one, it is more difficult painful, but it is worth it believe me. I give you my blessing! You can always reach out

EDIT: if you decide to get high regardless, and I do not condone doing it this way but if you are going to do it that way at least let me try to put some guidance down. So weed can actually help you go really deep within yourself and make the meditation practice so much faster. However, you might notice that you ""don't want to do shit when you are high"" so you first need to get rid of that thought and actually change it into I am going to smoke this time not for pleasure or to forget, but to heal (it can do miracles). do the steps that I stated above, however, this time after cleaning your room you get high, and afterwards lay down listen to the music for focus and make sure to do again as ascribed, be creative in coming up with ways to find and capture focus. Let me also tell you that sticking to your intentions will be so much more difficult high because your mind will want to do something else instead but everytime you feel that bring your attention/focus back by saying to yourself ""No I am stronger than this and I will find those roots, lets continuous"" it is important that you will not get frustrated everytime your mind wanders off because that defeats the purpose just accept it as it comes.

"Hello! I think this fits the category. I don’t have a lot of friends. In fact most of the people I consider friends are online friends. But there’s some issues I find that I have and I wanted some peer advice or to see if I’m alone in this.

First, when I “befriend” someone online and talk to them a lot (particularly in VR Gaming chat apps as an example) after a while I consider them friends. Just as any real world friend would be made. I will trust them mostly and seek out their company when I go online if I like them enough. But I feel like it’s never reciprocated. I never feel like any friends want me. Maybe to fill space or something but that’s it. Or like spend weeks playing and messaging me on discord and then just stop and I’m always super insecure wondering wtf I did wrong. I’m not claiming to be a bundle of joy all the time but I am kind and honest and intelligent. 

Second, as example, I have had people that I’ve played games with every day for like four years. Literally. (I had an addiction). I know their lives and they know mine. Then one day they or I went to play another game and I just only hear from them if I text them. And even then it’s sometimes. I have even followed people across platforms. 

I am mostly self aware but does anyone feel like this sometimes? It’s hurts pretty bad. I just want to have like one or two friends."	NHComrade	post	32.983495722778294	male	White	0.9945778846740723	na	na	na	1	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.
"Yes, I'm afraid a lot of friendships are context specific and once you leave / switch to something else it disintegrates. Many people probably also take online friendships less seriously than real life ones. I wish it was different but that's kind of how it goes. A lot of people do not have a whole lot of 'real' friends and that's the sad reality. Just buddies to do activities with. Once they start being with a partner they isolate and may disappear as well. etc.

"i’ve struggled with some ptsd at tweleve and thirteen with past truama with my biological dad and getting flashbacks form what he did to me while i was young ( ps i’m 14 now and haven’t heard from my bio dad since i was 8 ) i starts self harm at twleve ( cutting and punching/hitting myself ) because i believed it was my fault and i deserved what happened to me i eventually got help and it started getting better but i still carried this saddness with me just always feeling down no motivation all the time only eating the same few things coming home and sleeping after school and crying when i was alone my mum is very grumpy in the morning and once told me she’d set the car on fire and kill herself because of me when i get out in the way to skl and one time she asked where i was and i said i was in the garage and that i had just came home from a wlak and i sent a photo of me 4 steps away from being in the garage and she told me exactly how she plannned about killing herself because i lied to her that i was in the garage even though i wasnt i was infront not inside obviously those things effected me and i was cutting because i felt bad that i had made my mother feel that way and i told her i was gonna tell my step dad that she said that and she guilt tripped me saying how could i do that to my own mother here’s something i write the day it happened if you don’t wanna read just skip to where there’s another indent 

    - my mum just told me that she’s going to kill herself and she gave me a really detailed description of how she plans to do that “i’ll grab a fuckinh rope and tie it to the celling and put my neck in it… ect,” and i say why ar e you saying that to me do u think u should be saying that “u never let me feel anything, any emotion, i’ve been through so much and it’s not like you have never wanted to hurt yourself u literally self harmed” i’m so tired she’s done this before she told me once to get out of the car as we drive to school and she said she’s going to kill herself in the car when i get out and she told me to shut the fuck up when i was crying because she said that, i’m going to slit my wrists until i drop dead from blood loss, i hope then i stop her misery because she told me she’s going to khs because of me. if you’re wondering how she began to say that is because she plays this yes or no game in the car ( just yes or no questions and u j say yes or no, simple) and shed ask me a question and if reply w yes or no and an explanation she told me to stop explaining myself but i did it anyways (not to piss her off) and tahts how it started i feel so restricted to speak. she said she’s not going to talk to me anymore and i’m NEVER EVER talking to her fucking again. 
 
i was thirteen when j wrote that but i’m 14 now i’m still cutting myself at home and i did in the school bathrooms but now i just bring a lighter to school instead of a blade so i can burn myself but i’ve also started getting addicted to alcohol and drink when my anxiety gets bad to help ease it down and help me go to sleep i do it at night only so my parents don’t realise i’m drunk. “where do u get the alcohol?” i get it from my step dad because he drinks but he doesn’t know i do it i also sometimes smoke ciggs i only do that at home though but i vape at school instead so the smell isn’t as strong idk what to do i realise i’m setting my future self up for failure if i continue but it’s true only thing helping i was crying one morning bc my mum said she was ginna stop me from trianjng because i hadn’t been in two weeks and she came right up to my face and said “aww are you depressed” and stuff like that makes me feel rly invalid especially when she screams at me to tell her why i’m sad all the time anywyas idk any advice on what to for and sorry for the spelling errors i cbf to type well"	anonymousmysteryy	post	9.363127820069005	female	White	0.9983737468719482	na	na	na	8	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.
Wow. I am so sorry. You are far to young to deal with all that. But unfortunately you are. I will say get help immediately. It’s the one thing I wish I had done and now here I am almost 30 and a hot mess barely hanging on bc of my mental illnesses. I have so much in me and so much internal motivation but I feel imprisoned inside of myself. Also be selfish. Do not absorb yourself with the unhealthy actions / emotions of your family members or others. They are adults you are the kid. Live your life on your terms. Also I don’t agree with this but unfortunately society is set up this way…freedom is in the work you pick. 80% of your adult life will be spent at a job, so make it count otherwise it’ll only make things worse. And find that one thing you get happiness from and hold on tight and if you can make that your job.

He has been getting poor sleep for years now and it is causing a lot of stress in his life.

"I have depression, anxiety and possibly ADHD and I'm completely self aware of every one of my issues and what I need to do to fix it... but I just can't or won't. I am aware that one of the reasons I probably feel like I can't act on it is due to my depression or my laziness due to ADHD. I'm getting so incredibly frustrated with myself due to my inability to help me help myself if that makes sense. I even make little lists in my head and in my journal about what I need to do to try and make myself feel better about myself but I just don't.

It's kinda hard for me to explain my thought process but I'll try to explain it to the most of my ability. ok so for example, therapy. I know therapy will help me but for some reason I rationalize why it's not worth it to go to therapy such as:

1. my insurance won't cover it (valid)
2. I probably won't connect with my therapist.
3. I know my therapist would only be doing their job and probably will only think of me as a person who needs to be fixed.
4. I know most of their ""tricks"" and I feel like since I am aware of their tricks, doing them won't actually help me at all or while I'm doing them and aware that they are just ""tricks"" my brain kind of shuts it off and doesn't take it seriously.

Okay so that last one is super confusing but that's the best I can explain that. Anyways, I have this same kind of thought process for everything. where I know exactly what I have to do but I just don't act on it because my mind goes into a spiraling vortex of all the reasons why doing them won't work and I just never end up doing the things I want and need to do. I just stay in my bed and look at my phone and computer for way too long. 

My complete paralysis of helping myself or being productive has gotten really bad this past month, and I have no idea how to get out of this thought process and I can't think of how I got out of it last time. does anyone else have a similar thought process?? what were some things that helped you??

"Maybe what helped me will help you.  I am diagnosed ADHD Type 1 (classical ADD), and it's a huge struggle for me to ""get moving,"" as I put it.

For me, having an accountability partner of some sort is a huge help.

At work, my assistant has developed ways to help me stay accountable so I don't just let things slide.  

For me, this works because, while I can live with disappointing myself, I don't want to disappoint someone else.  So knowing that what I do and don't do will be looked over by someone else really pushes me to keep pushing even when I don't want to.

"You don’t have to start on a therapist right away, especially if you are rationalizing against it. Working towards making yourself better can start super small, like for the first week your goal could be to take one sip of water per day. Make your goal soooooo small, you can’t argue against it.

It makes me feel really good to turn the box green, even if it’s a tiny goal. But you could track them in a different way, like putting a sticker on a chart or having a Candy when you finish your goals for the day.

Also, there are so many others that think just like you! Look up tips and tricks for your mental health problems. I saw a woman who wore labeled bracelets on her arm all day until she got that chore or activity done. They would click and clack and get in the way, so they would make it where she wouldn’t forget. Each morning she would wake up and put them on and take one off each time she finished that chore."	stinkypossums	reply	na	na	na	0.9990529417991638	no	no	no	na	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.

"I don't see any light for my future. Even my bf didn't want to put up with me or stick with me.The only reason why I am still here are my parents. If I didn't have them then I would have ended my life a few weeks ago. Everything seems so dark, I feel useless, I feel like an unlovable burden. It feels like the walls are closing in on me and that the world won't be impacted at all if I wasn't here anymore. I feel so replaceable. I feel like I don't deserve to be alive. If anyone has any advise.. that'll be great. Medication doesn't work for me, and I'm in therapy but the bad thoughts just take over. I don't know what to do anymore. I'm scared of my own brain.

What are your daily habits? What are you doing with your 24 hours each day? What are you eating? Its good that your bf left because now you can really take the time to change your mind and learn how to love yourself more! I suggest reading Louis Haye. I suggest eating healthier, exercise, and figuring out what inspires you. Ask yourself weird questions. Love and value yourself more. You are worthy of the very best. You are a queen. You have the power to take control of your mind. Try to live in your body and spirit rather than your mind. How does your hand feel? How does your eyes feel? Its just all perceiving reality without judgement its just there. You deserve to live happily. Experiment with your life see what you like and dont like. Expand your perception. Do new things.

"Thankyou for your voice.  

I’m in a similar spot today.  Feeling deeply worthless and a burden, i appreciate not being in this boat alone.

I drank water.  I’m eventually going to get out of bed, take vitamins, brush my teeth, put on clean sweat pants and sweatshirt, make breakfast* and coffee, and go to an EMDR appointment.  I know that will be a safe place to feel worthless, she is paid to care and I might leave feeling some kind of different.  

The finch app helps as I find value in listing out my “goals” for the day.  

I’m definitely going to bless my lungs with some marijuana later, is usually like scaffolding to the overwhelm and helps me forget I don’t feel safe.  Though I may not respect my food boundaries, the ability to rest and slow down has been highly valuable.

"I came to this sub today because I'm not doing well today. Your post was the first I saw and I thought maybe giving you advice would help me hear the words, too. 

Keep trying with medicine. There are so many different kinds and they take a while to work. I know how hard this process can be, but it's worth it when you finally find the right one for you. You don't deserve to struggle, it's not your fault, and there is nothing wrong with taking medicine to live a healthier life. 

Stick with the therapy. Let the brain vomit out of your head. Journal. Write it down and rip it up and throw it away or burn it because it's not all true. Whenever you feel better, try to write good things and pin them around to remind yourself. 

What happened a few weeks ago? I can assure you there are more people you affect than you think but that's not what this is about. Life is incredibly hard and unfair so we have to be our own fighter and love ourselves through the tough times. 

I highly recommend the show on Netflix ""midnight club"" specifically an episode where a character talks about her depression. It's beautifully written and I bawled my eyes out. Remembering it now is lighting that spark that was dull today. If you are interested, I can try and find it on YouTube or something.

"Hello stranger 💕 

I was in a terrible state of depression for 8 years. In and out of hospitals, on and off with therapists and medication. Multiple suicide attempts interrupted by loved ones who cared. I felt like there was no end in sight even though I wanted it so badly. Finally landing a good therapist, telling my full story and not lying to myself about abuse that occurred is what helped me reach the light on the other end. It was the hardest experience of my life. Am I still depressed now? A little but I manage it and find joy in a couple things that make it it all worth it. I started living for myself and not to protect others. I left the toxic environment that was my family, had to cut everyone off for my healing process. I found myself again, found happiness, married my best friend and I live everyday with excitement of starting my own family. I was in a dark cloud for so long and it consumed me. But I clawed my way out and it wasn’t easy but it was worth it. I’ve been lucky to have a couple friends and their own families who I call my own now. 

Whatever is not serving your happiness and peace should not be a part of your life. You being fully in tune with how you feel is important and a post like this is a good step. You want better, you deserve better and you WILL GET BETTER. I promise you. Take it from someone that hears that a million times and never believed it until it actually happened. 

Hang in there OP. You DO have a bright future ahead.

Edit to add: small actions can make a big difference. In my situation I isolated myself in my room with no lights and slept all day. Started going outside on short walks around my neighborhood and that ended the cycle of me staying in bed. I would try to see how much further I could walk each day. But if I only wanted to walk 2 minutes one day that was perfectly fine because I still got out of bed and was making progress. Sunlight and fresh air helps your brain!!!

I know we had only had one issue, but after high school we didn't have any, yet we didn't apologize to each other. We were cool after high school and learned we have similar interests, but I still feel guilty.

"Summary of incident:
A while back my dad and I (21F) got into an argument and he ended up backing me into a corner, screaming in my face, and clinging to my arm even when I was yelling for him to let go and get off of me. He took away my phone. My parents wouldn’t let me drive myself to work for the next few days, use their WiFi, or call anyone from home. 

I feel a little embarrassed to say that I picked up acute ptsd from this. I recently came home for spring break and I’m terrified that my parents will find out a few things about me they would hate (I’m an atheist/ I’m not sexually “pure”/ my bf and I talk about them a lot and how controlling they are). I live in the upstairs area when I’m home and tonight my boyfriend and I were talking about something my mom said about him that I’m not supposed to know about. Let’s just say I found this info in a *not so admirable way* that I’m a little ashamed of but I felt like I had to do for my own protection. I suddenly became extremely afraid even though I knew my parents were downstairs in their bedroom sleeping.
When my boyfriend and I got off the call, I started to imagine all sorts of scenarios where my mom heard us and told my dad and he came upstairs with a knife or to beat me up or take away my access to the outside world (to be fair, that would probably never happen except maybe the last one). I locked the upstairs door but I still have this undercurrent of fear.
Does anyone with experience with ptsd have suggestions for how to handle this? It’s completely new for me."	graciebeeapc	post	14.602114656356932	female	White	0.9971292614936829	na	na	na	2	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.
"I’ve had a lot of this in the past. My family was not fun to say the least. I was constantly in fear of what my parents would do I watched everything I said if I wanted to have a real conversation I whispered and then would be terrified that they still heard me. It got so bad I used to have dreams that my stepdad killed my whole family. So I’ve been in a very similar situation and have developed ptsd from it as well. 

What I can say is that it’s a process. Your brain has been trained to feel fear and shame around certain subjects talking about certain things, especially around your parents. One thing I did was get to the root of it. Most likely there is a much deeper issue from your childhood that is aiding this ptsd in some way. A build up of things, especially from the extremely religious family can take a toll on your mental health and the way you think. I had to learn to change my thinking patterns, it takes time. I honestly don’t really have a lot more to say because I’m still currently working through this myself but knowing you you’re so strong and wonderful and the thinking patterns they ingrained in you will dull eventually and dull the fear. Idk if this answers your question but I wanted to help.

Another thing I do is meditate, shadow work(ask me or look it up), etc. also just distancing myself from my parents as much as possible without having to sacrifice financial support.

If this is high school or college, I would make an appointment with a guidance counselor, nurse, or talk to your parents/guardian about the stress. 

Is the stress causing you to miss school/work? I would make an appointment with your doctor or ugentcare or clinic to get you started on your mental health journey. Are you already diagnosed with a stress disorder?

My mother went through so many religions it was hard for me to keep up but I always found that  between god and what I believe is morally correct is up to me and no pastor or rabbi can come between that. When I’m Invited to church I simply say no thank you because I have trauma with the experiences that I have had with people at church. Right, it’s not the church nor the religion that makes it problematic for me. It’s the people that I have encountered. It made me bitter and for a while I was atheist… that is until I made the realization that it’s okay with practicing my beliefs. And if I prefer to pray at home in my safe space and on my own accord and whether that makes me a bad person or not it’s not up to me to decided. Being alive is hard, everyday a new problem pops up and sometimes it’s hard to stay positive but having that ideology that there is something greater than us is what gives me hope.

"Honestly, the best thing you can do is shadow work. All you have to do is sit alone with yourself and tap into all of your past experiences that affected you the most and relive them again.

Hug yourself. Caress yourself. Give yourself that reassurance that you are ready to move on. Then change your perspective about what happened. Relgious people are limited to their own beliefs its a sad thing. We can only feel sorry for them for they do not know that heaven is within not without. Do this a few times and you WILL feel better about life.

God or better yet the Universe lives through all of us and experiences itself through each of our perspectives. God/ The Universe is more infinite than religion makes it out to be.

I am a religious person, however I left Christianity for paganism. It was equally difficult for me to shift out of Christianity, however the thing that helped me was to examine the latent Christianity within myself and determine why I was doing certain things and thinking certain ways. Bring raised christian will put a LOT more influence on you than just the ten commandments. Examine yourself, start asking yourself why you do things the way you do, ask yourself why you believe the things you do, etc. And pick apart the unreasonable stuff. Go forward with it in your mind to confront the things that have traumatized you in your brain. Mentally heal yourself from those old wounds and then you will truly be able to tell what is you and what is religious influence in your life. It will be a long road to recovery, but it all starts within the mind.	eoneval	reply	na	na	na	0.9991652965545654	no	strong	no	na	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.
So I've been having delusional thoughts and feelings, kind of losing my mind. Everything feels fake. It feels like the negative thoughts are not me and im fighting someone else but i just cannot ever win. Im really ashamed of myself for this. Ive gained this delusion someone is going to kill me. I dont like, hallucinationate things and see them visually, but i am seeing someone in my head run up behind with a weapon thinking they are going to kill me. I hear things but im unsure if im actually hearing them or if im just so paranoid i am convincing myself that i am. I get random thoughts in my head that are just jumbled up words that dont even make sense. Sometimes when im really freaked out i think i do that when trying to explain that im really freaked out to the people around me, but i am not sure because everything is always so foggy i cant remember anything most of time. Like i can always remember important things like my birthday and name, ect. Its just my day to day life makes no sense, and often times im not sure im even aware that i am alive. I had something happen in a dream the other day, i cannot remember what it was, but i immediately had a family member drive me to a hospital to be evaluated. They did not keep me inpatient, they did not see me as a risk to myself or anyone else. Im sorry for so much detail, but has anyone else experienced this? Im scared to post this, but i just want answers. Is there any coping mechanisms that can be used to make this not so hard? To maybe come back to reality, even if its just temporary. Im so sick of feeling this i just want to be myself again.

I am a college junior and I am struggling. I am doing a biomedical engineering degree and I feel like since freshman year various events ( specifically failing and subpar test scores) have left me drained. Every day it gets harder. I talk to my parents and they really want me to just push through the rest of the years and just get out with this degree since I am already so far long. I literally have a panic attack that’s been nonstop for the last 3 days but the rest of the time I just distract myself. I really want everything to go perfectly but nothing is going the way I want. But tbh I am too anxious and sad to have a definite want. All I want is to go through one day where I don’t feel like shit and don’t treat my friends and parents like shit. I base a lot of my happiness on how well I do at school too and since I’ve been a hot mess, I just feel like so terrible. I feel so terrible that I don’t even wanna ask for help. Idk what my next steps should be for regaining some sanity.	Old-Cod8725	post	10.613282104081195	male	White	0.9987908005714417	na	na	na	1	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.
"I don’t know how much I can help or give you advice for this, and I personally think you need to talk to someone like a therapist, counselor, friend, etc., but here’s just some of my thoughts. I’m so sorry if these can’t help at all.

Honestly, I could be completely wrong here, but sounds like burnout and academic validation. 
As a college junior, you’re very close to finishing and very far in already; it only makes sense you’re burnt out, biomedical seems very hard in my perspective (generally coming from a person who’s sibling is getting a bio degree and they look exhausted with a lot of hidden mental health problems). It also makes sense why your parents just want you to finish. I don’t know the full context, but I wonder how much time you’re allowing yourself to have to relax. Are you constantly studying in fear of failure? Is the only rest you have just for basic needs and necessities? I understand you’d need to study hard, college is rigorous, but there needs to be a work life balance that you’re PROBABLY not doing (after all, I don’t know your full circumstance!). 
And this is probably all stemming from the academic validation aspect of this. I think this is the main problem here. Im sure you know this, but academic validation stems from fear of failure and rejection (which you’ve experienced as you stated above from the tests and such). Students have this environment where they’re expected to have room for improvement whilst simultaneously having no room for failure (very college like aspect if you ask me). Your grades are your happiness, hence, why I think this. 

In an article I read, this lady states that 
“My academic anxiety skyrocketed. I couldn’t take a single test without my leg bobbing, my palms sweating and my heart beating rapidly. The idea of getting a low grade was unnerving because I thought the grade reflected my self-worth. I began to assume the hard work I was putting in wasn’t enough and must’ve meant I was a failure.  Having negative thoughts about myself hurt my self-image and I found receiving positive feedback on my schoolwork made me feel horrible inside … I stayed up all night to rework assignments because I needed every detail to be perfect. I wasn’t giving myself breaks when studying because I thought they would distract me from my current task. The disparaging thoughts in my head were getting louder, I started having panic attacks when I thought too negatively about my schoolwork. While studying my geometry notes at my desk one afternoon, my heart rate increased, tears spilled from my eyes and I felt like I couldn’t breathe.”
(https://temple-news.com/my-desire-for-academic-validation-controlled-me/)

Sound like something you’re experiencing? (Idk if it does) 
Easier said than done to get out of this mindset, and I’m not properly equipped to help with that, hence why I think the first step you should take is to talk to someone. May not be a super viable option you wanna do, but even friends are enough for a first step. In my personal experience, they’ve helped me get out of feeling so utterly horrible about getting a bad grade on a test, so it helps (I used to full on bawl in my room for hours on end cause of a B+ and was much worse for lower grades). 

Well, I can’t say if the process of talking will work perfectly, since we’re all different, but that’s my advice to you on next steps for sanity. Hope it helps."	Old-Cod8725	reply	na	na	na	0.9987908005714417	strong	no	no	na	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.
"I need help

First of all, sorry for my bad english, I live in Brazil.
I started watching porn at 11 years old, my parents didn't think it would be harmful for a kid to have access to internet this early, the result is I've been a porn addict for 9 years now, I've been really trying to quit since 2021 when I noticed that porn was a problem in my life, I tried to do nofap streaks but couldn't get past 2 weeks, then I've read the easypeasy method and I thought that I was finally free from this curse, then I relapsed a month later. These last few days been really painful, I've tried to do lots of things to keep my life busy, I work out regularly, I've started boxing too two years ago, I read and play video games, but I just can't stop watching, I've tried every book every method you may know of, I've tried stop using my phone my computer it also didn't help, I've had girlfriends, been with a lot of girls, but I still come back to porn. Today I've decided that I might have no option and maybe I need to do something extreme to stop, I want to cut my dick off but I'm afraid that I can die, I just want a way out, I don't even care about a sex, I just want to enjoy life again."	joegoldenburguer	post	28.48726304912816	male	White	0.9967216849327087	na	na	na	2	MentalHealthSupport	failed

"Hello guys I am looking for some advice; Ever since I hit my head really hard a few years ago and had to go to the hospital I have felt off and on constantly Overstimulated. To the point where the wind makes me feel like I flinch. I used to have a zest for life even though I got depressed. I would wake up and feel this aggressive drive to take on the world. I am a metal head and have been for over 15 years.

 However since the injury I have only been able to listen to any music or genre for small periods of time before I feel overstimulated and getting no enjoyment out of it. And I mean even soft music has made me feel overstimulated. But it's not just that it's lights, voices, smells,being awake even sometimes when there's no stimulation. It's truly been hell and very disheartening. Has anyone experienced this type of anxiety? Was there anything that brought you back to your normal self or helped you? Thanks for reading."

"Hey there people,
I first joined today, 

my problem is not getting up on my self and if people are trying to help me, in my mind it not count as I made it on myself and then I feel like a Looser witch results in doing the the absolute minimum to ""survive"" the day. 
Since last weekend ive the problem I got kicked out of the ""thought"" (I felt never like that) home and lived for the past days at the other parents home (witch i lived like 10+ Years of my life (rn iam 18)).
after I came back because of work. I feel not safe at the spot here and I am sick of the judges here. The judges like about local news, politics and last but not least about the work and how shit theirs and mines are and that my job is like doin nothing.
What is completly wrong I am doing an ""Voluntary Services in the Field of Culture and Education"" (sorry I just looked for the Word at the Internet because I am not a native english speaker) at an Sportsclub next to us and iam doing some stuff that is pretty nerve tugging.
After work that normally ends at 6/8½ am I am driving back home and spending my freetime behind my PC and not talking to  people there are living around me and are old like me and meet them.
And my main question is how did I get away from all this and doing a reset.

Okay I do not have much time to answer, first thing you need to establish is to give credit where its due, and that is in that you do not feel safe. And that has a valid reason otherwise you wouldn't feel like that. You are most likely more sensitive and your responsibility feeling probably is not doing you any favor here either. So if you cannot change your situation the thing to practice is to protect yourself. You can actually do that by putting up a 'imagined' protective shield, the power of thought is so profound that you merely need to think that there is a shield between you and the judges, and it will protect you. Just try and believe it works, it will. Furthermore, the moment that barrier is up you will have some wiggle space for you to develop your strength and grow on a personal level, transcend the situation because if the situation will not change, nor will the judges. You will need to change. Its beautiful when you realise what you are capable of and that you actually should be a grass in the wind moving south when the wind goes south and moving north when the wind goes north. The only moment you will suffer is when you say that you want to go north when the wind goes south because then the wind will take you from your ground and move you anyways, this time without your willing it to. So in short, see whether you can come to a compassion that you can see that the judges are actually the ones at fault and realise that it is sad that they have given up their power to choose their own doing, and celebrate the fact that you have discovered the power that you are the master of your own inner experience on such a young age. It is all in the mind, and luckily we have been given the tools to shape our experience like a sculpture on a beautiful block of marble, if you throw away you hammer and chissel your block of marble is only shaped by the environment( it will chip when there is storm, it will corode when it rains) But you can decide to put a tarp over the block and have the space to work on it and create the most beautiful statue that you will ever see.

"Hello,

I hope everybody is doing as well as they can. I want to ask the men in the community something, especially older men.

I am doing a research project on men's mental health as they seem to tend to get less support than women do. I want you to give some input (if you are comfortable of course) about why this is. Is it because men are raised with ""men don't cry"" or ""men do not show emotion"" type of bullshit? Would raising awareness and undoing the stigma help you get the help? Or is it something completely different than that?

i think the big reason is because, just as you said, men are taught to not show their emotions. i feel pretty fortunate having a dad who supported me talking about how i feel, but i know a lot of other guys who never had this support. in the long run, it helps teaching men from a young age to be comfortable with showing and talking about their feelings.	theredvelet	reply	na	na	na	0.0022887494415044785	no	strong	no	na	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.

I’m currently writing a short story. It’s inspired by the mental health Institution in the film “To The Bone”. 
Two boys with PTSD meet and find comfort and understanding in one another. 
They’re able to help eachother and eventually develop feelings. 

Now, I obviously don’t want this to be problematic. I don’t want to glorify or romanticise mental illness. The goal was to write a couple that found love despite their individual problems and show that having mental illness doesn’t necessarily prevent you from finding a relationship."

"So for reference I have always had a very good relationship with my therapist and have been seeing them for about a year and a half. I have a very casual relationship with this therapist which has, at times, felt somewhat unprofessional but I actually kind of liked it casual and almost “friend like.” Not that they didn’t give professional advice of course, but there were just some moments of “ehh I don’t know if this is really therapeutic advice or just casual talking.” At any rate I had a very close relationship with this therapist and was a twice-weekly client for almost my entire time with them. Flashback to a few days ago I was talking to my therapist and I brought up having heard about and then done research on a rather unsettling statistic presented by the NIH (the specific statistic isn’t important but it was in the area of domestic violence). I in no way gave any indication that this statistic influenced my behavior, thoughts, or perceptions about anything, however the mere mention of it sent my therapist into an extremely emotional state. They implied that I may be planning something criminally violent or that I was some kind of maniac. I repeatedly tried to deny this and explain myself but they wouldn’t hear it and then proceeded to kick me out of the office mid session telling me that they wouldn’t work with me any more and that they would refer me to someone else. I was extremely hurt and tried to reach out afterwards with a lucid, albeit frustrated text. They have been totally ghosting me for a few days(I only reached out once, right after this happened). For reference I have diagnosed GAD and have a lot of problems with being emotionally vulnerable and treated unfairly in relationships. Can’t help but feel like this is literally feeding into it. This person has known my deepest thoughts and feelings for over a year, and they implied I was planning violent crimes(which I wouldn’t ever do or even think about). I feel so betrayed and sick over this, I thought this person knew me but apparently they didn’t at all. Is there any chance I can patch things up with this person or is this too extreme an example of unprofessional behavior?

TLDR: Somewhat unprofessional therapist assumed I was thinking about committing violent crimes because of a statistic I had read on NIH, kicked me out of office, and ghosted me. This is extremely hurtful to me because of relationship problems and dealing with my anxiety. Wondering what to do and think now."

Holy shit man. Ya I looked at the other place you posted this and people seem to be being rude to you there as well. That really sucks that this happened to you. Sometimes people betray your confidence. Ultimately, I’d say you just got scammed by her. I mean, not everyone’s terrible and I’m sure you benefitted a lot from the therapy while it was ongoing. This doesn’t have to put that in a negative light. You still got your sanity, as I can see from reading this post, so I’d just see it as shit happens and move on. There are some shit people out there but most people are genuinely good I’ve found. But ya really fucking unprofessional of her. But all she did was make you aware of the kind of person she was and then she did the separating for you. Nothing bad happened, you weren’t abused, just yelled at it seems.

Yes, please listen to them. Those people will be out of your life and you will begin a path that doesn’t include them. Talk to your parents and get out of the school if they won’t help and try to get into a new school. Please, please don’t hurt yourself. High school seems like forever when you are there but when you look back you will see what was cool then usually ends up being stupid. Focus on you and do not ever give someone else the power of what your worth is. I bet you are amazing and just may not realize it. Bullies are usually hurtful because they are hurting themselves, many do this to deflect attention from themselves. You are beautiful and worth the world to people that know and love you I bet, and your absence would leave a giant painful hole in those people’s lives, for the rest of their lives. Come on here and open up like you did if you start feeling alone. You have friends here and a safe place, but don’t give up sweet soul! You have places to go and things to see and accomplish, love to be had and a lifetime of memories to make ahead of you. You are in my heart..

"I had chronic major depression throughout my entire youth and it was brutal, and I have so many regrets now for not trying meds earlier. I was always against the idea, but at the end of the day, none of my lifestyle choices or therapy or anything could fix it.

I finally tried a med called sertraline that truly fixed my major symptoms of depression. Now this med isn’t going to be the best fit for everyone, but you should defs ask your doctor about it.

Either have you or your parent/guardian book a doctors appointment for you and ask your doctor about sertraline during the appointment. 

In all honesty, I’m not a “big pharma” fan, but I have to give credit to sertraline because it was the only thing that could save my life. 

Also, if you do decide to try sertraline, make sure your doc doesn’t start you on a high dose, it should be a gradual integration. Obviously, it’s up to you and your discretion of your doctor - all I’m saying is that for me in my life it was the only thing that could fix my depression. Don’t sleep on antidepressants but just be careful with them and only do it with the advice of your doctor - or a psychiatrist if you have access to one"	Radiant-Elephant-318	reply	na	na	na	0.9907168745994568	no	strong	no	na	MentalHealthSupport	failed

"Hi, 
Im a narcissitic asshole who lies, steals, and cheats my way out of most shit. Im a highschool student and ive recently moved in with my cousins due to an abuse relationship wuth my mom and my chronicly ill father. But this isnt about them, or my parents or my shitty childhood. This is about me, and my issues.  I. not a good person, and even now saying that out loud i dont belive it. I know my actions are bad. I know what ive done is bad, but i myself just wont acceot the reality. Change starts with acceptance, and i want to change. Ive seen how my actions (especially lying) have affected those around me, family, friends, and myself. This isnt a pity party, and this isnt me feeling bad for myself. Im simply stating im a dick, and i need help. After talking to my cousin about my issues (after being caught in a massive lie about not failing all of my classes) and he suggested coming to reddit to speak out and be honest, so i am. I have no reason to lie, cheat, steal, or do anything. But no matter what i do i cant seem to change. I look at myself in the mirror and call myself as many horrible things as i can but nothing works. So as advised ive come here, asking for adivce on how to start changing. I want to change and i need to change. Be as hard, brutal, or rude as you can be.

"I recently started seeing a new psychiatrist for ADHD. She asked if I thought I had symptoms of OCD, and I said: “maybe, like sometimes if I touch something cold with the back of my left hand, I feel a need to touch the same thing with my right hand, or I feel like something is missing, like I’m not completing a circuit. But it doesn’t happen often, and I’ll be over it in 10mn if I don’t do it. It might happen once a month or every couple of months. It’s not something I feel interferes with my life because once those 10mn pass Im perfectly fine.” In the visit notes, I noticed she added a diagnosis of OCD.

Am I just not fully understanding what OCD is, or could this be a misdiagnosis?"	Trip_Lit	post	31.15444668509687	male	White	0.006504999939352274	na	na	na	3	MentalHealthSupport	failed

What I think you should do is focus on yourself. Dont date anyone if the problems you've seen in yourself is not fixed yet.

Today I hung out with my(14yo) brother (19yo) and asked to watch this show and told me that he watch it while he was high and then he told me that he smoke weed, and now giant feeling of resentment in my stomach. I've always been uncomfortable with people being drunk and high around me, this includes my family. So when he started to drink the feeling started to grow but now that I know he smokes my resentment is strong. Also I can handle people being drunk around me better than high since my brain connects my family members who drink to alcohol,then alcohol to cleanliness, and my brain connects weed to feeling unsafe at my ex pothead friend house since her family members (beside her) are racist( I am a poc) and now it connects my brother to that feeling.

I don’t know what’s going on. I don’t know how to regain my sanity. 7 - 8 months ago this all started. And I slowly fell deeper and deeper. I tried mental health facilities. Tried therapy. Just tried an Ayahuasca retreat which I feel made me 100x worse and ruined me more. Why did I put all that in my brain? Why did I expose myself to that? What did it do to me? My brain chemistry feels fried. I haven’t slept in over 10 days. Not even a high dose of seroquel was able to knock me into sleep. I can’t explain what I’m experiencing or even going through. I’m staying at my sisters in Philly and we’re aware that if I don’t figure this out I may have to live in a psych ward for the rest of my life. I am not doing anything to change or fix things. I am just in my thoughts. Chronic stress is what led me here. I am broken from reality. I don’t have control over anything in my life. I don’t even have the words to describe to you guys what the issue is to even be able to help you guys help me. I just know I am not well. I have lost sense of reality. I see other people and they are here. In reality. They have a sense of self / identity. They know why they’re alive. Even a homeless person or someone with nothing seems more in touch with reality than I am. I don’t know how to explain it. Everyone says I need to “get better”’in order to be able to do things but I don’t know how to get better. My mind is lost. Maybe if you ask me something I can better explain what I’m experiencing? I don’t know how to explain it. My mine is broken. The loss of my life and reality was too overwhelming for me to compute and handle. I have lost sight of reality. I see people walking around me right now and are they the aliens or me? Can I ever be normal again? Can I ever regain my sanity? Am I sick forever? What steps do I need to do? How can 1 regain consciousness of what life is? I’m not making sense guys. I have lost it.

I am in your position as well. I to have looked at homeless men and women, even the ones on drugs and thought to myself that they are more sane than I am. It's hard to realize the truth when your a schizophrenic. It'd hard to believe the medicine is helping or that anything is important to you. Please keep trying, the most important thing you must realize is that time will heal you. It takes years but you must relax until that time comes. Go on disability, try new medicine, talk to someone, it works.

However if you don’t have access to those things then there is an over the counter supplement called St Johns Wort, it is proven to work just as well as depressants. Just focus on yourself. Cut everything that bothers you out (or cut the things out that you can). Focus on your future and what you want. Whether that be a career or just finding some peace within your life. It won’t cure you but surrounding yourself around by things that don’t bother you will of course help.

"Well you certainly have my sympathy - I recently started an SSRI and it's been a real adjustment; I'd hate to have to bounce around like that. It's my understanding that it takes quite some time for them to reach efficacy, and that many side effects subside after some time, so I'm surprised they'd switch it up so fast (unless you were experiencing dangerous side effects).

Anywho, SSRIs can cause a laundry list of side effects, but so can discontinuing them. I'm not on Prozac, but when I traveled and forgot my meds - missed three days - it had nasty effects, including dizziness! I looked it up at the time and it seems that's a common side effect of discontinuing or missing doses. So perhaps it's more to do with stopping Zoloft than beginning Prozac? 

Also, some SSRIs can affect blood pressure, so if the light-headedness occurs when standing up, etc., you may want to check that.

yeah, I’m kind of in the same boat as her. I’ve had the feeling that nothing I’m experiencing is real at all, just one long dream I can’t wake up from. Honestly I’ve experienced it for as long as I can remember, dating back to my abusive childhood, but I can’t seem to pinpoint what my current triggers are. It’s definitely a process. It’s probably best to start with identifying the first time she remembers feeling like that and look at all the things that were going on in her life at that point. Once you figure that out, you can move forward with finding current triggers, but it could simply just be stress. Try asking her what it is about you that brings her back to reality, as that could help with finding solutions for the time you have to spend apart while you’re finishing your degree in another country.	drag0natic0	reply	na	na	na	0.00419308478012681	weak	strong	no	na	MentalHealthSupport	failed

"Hello guys . Im mexican. Always been different to others. I liked to watch science documentals, bad to lie, very smart and loved weird things. Web developer (good at it), pianist and keyboardist. Rock music lover

In some sense  never was a problem. I had a lot of friends in my teenage years because i consider myself charismatic in some weird sense. But the values i had and preferences were completely different. I never felt happy doing activities most people do (Dancing, singing ballads) and even if i get along well with most people because im gentle and authentic, is hard to get deep relationships where there is trust from both sides.

Thats the other point. I see all my fellows get a girlfriend. Seems so easy to do!. But i try to make conversations (nothing weird, really), flirting, no flirting, and a lot of different strategies and simply doesnt work. Girls have other interests and points os view than mine. And im not ugly. I consider myself handsome in fact.

So i feel extremely sad when i see all my friends with other person. And myself finding imposible to find a person or a circle where i feel i belong.

"These last few years for me have been pretty rough, mom passed, had a kid with my gf, and her and I weren't ready in any way (as a relationship, financially, career-wise) 
I've moved away from a city in Florida to get away and experience something new to a much more rural north PA (not being used to the cold at all) where she's originally from so I could develop a relationship with her family for a year and then move back to Florida. I don't have any friends or social life because I only work and my gf only has a couple of good friends. I found out she's been seeing someone else since December and lied to me about it constantly when I called her out. I've been just numbing myself whenever we fought and just trying to move past but with everything that's happened I feel like I did it to the point where I have a dissociation disorder. I've never really dealt with a bad mental state I've had a pretty good easy life. I blame myself a lot for not being in a better position at 24 with a kid even tho I shouldn't I know that. I feel like I'm aware of my feeling of not being all here but I'm not doing better I try to brush things off and move on. I feel like I'm on autopilot going through the motion of things. I should be enjoying the time I get with my baby but I want to give her more the only way I do that is to pick myself up but I feel like I won't have the time to be successful in a career and spend more time with my daughter. My head Is just filled with conflicting thoughts between one thing and another. I've only recently learned what disassociation is and I've never had any solid ground to know what's wrong with me. My gf told me to get therapy and I should have been but in my head, it just slipped by. I couldn't commit, I am serious about it this time, I don't want to feel like this all the time I didn't notice how much weight I gained over the year until last month. I look in the mirror and don't recognize myself (I keep up with my looks and am groomed lol) but it's the most an odd feeling.

I want to keep this straight and direct, i am 22 years old, i am quite successful in Academics ( i am currently doing masters in medical Engineering), i have a good job, i have very few friends( am thankful they exist), i do a lot of sports ( i am not necessairly handsome or athletic looking but i slowly accepted my looks), yet i have never been this depressed in my life, i am trying my absolute best to socialize and get out more but it feels as if everything is just turning away from me, i have never been sucessful in finding some one to love and it came back to hurt me a lot now, i have been raised to just trust my dad who told me one day it will just come naturally yet i don't even know how i will start a convesation yet alone keep it going, i do feel like an introvert but i am also trying really hard to just find people i can talk with, i started to blame this city since the only people i see are elderly and kids around, it feels like hell for me as a student. Its been like this for a long time now, i had very few exceptions of social interactions but they always ended up some how in a bad way. This is now the hardest part: i have tried to end my life once around 2 months ago, when i got rejected by a girl, since then i got some help at the beginning, and i really thought things were going in a better direction, i know i am not going to do this ever again but i also feel like i will always be alone and just never see myself happy, again i know i am not suicidal anymore ( i have the view that i will just die one day some how and everything will finally end, this makes me really relaxed) but i am extremely depressed and just confused.

I am so incredibly sorry you didn’t get the proper nurturing unconditional love you should have received as a child. I’m sure you really struggle without it, I wish I knew the answer to make you feel secure and loved. But I do know, that though you were robbed of that it won’t be the same but you can put that love into yourself, shower yourself in self love whatever that looks like for you hun. It’s going to take time to heal, maybe a lot of time, but small progress is even a victory. Give therapy a Try, it won’t solve it all but it will help guide you in the right direction. You are worthy of unconditional love and I hope that you can give that to yourself and one day I hope you can get that from someone else, a friend, a family member, a lover. Be easy on yourself and stay patient, it stinks now but it won’t always feel this way.

I've thought about suicide so much, but I realize I cannot go through with it unless I'm so angry and sad I can't think. I haven't gotten that far. But I don't want to change anymore. I have no will to fight. I was only interested in pornography and that was getting so fucking bad. I've never been able to accept being gay and SEX still feels like a straight person thing, like I shouldn't think about men because I cannot have sex with men. Period. I'm an ugly fag who can't socialize for shit. I can't have friends and never a partner. And I won't have a family who supports me. I HAVE to support them or die. I feel so codependent on they're shitting lifestyle, i never want to leave my parents house. I never want to start any doctors appointments, I don't want medication and therapy, I just want to feel like a normal straight man or a normal straight woman. I hate sexuality, I'll never be useful or worthy of loving myself fully. I hate being gay, I hate being a man, I hate my body, I hate people, I hate this world. It's so fucking unfair that Americans are brainwashed into being distracted by celebrities and social media and other shit. Now we can't do anything for ourselves. It feels so bleak to hold on for nothing. I don't want to hold on for my family, people at work, my pets, this world. It feels fuckkng worthless. I'm so sorry to anyone who reads this. I doubt anyone will. But I just have to tell someone.... I'm giving up on this worthless boy who could never treat himself right, I want to end my suffering so bad."	undiagnoseddespair	post	15.243711570466541	female	White	0.9977208971977234	na	na	na	3	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.
"I acknowledge your pain and how you feel. As someone who has been in similar places, I understand how hard it can be to accept yourself and how hard it can be to be suicidal. Your feelings are very valid.

But with that being said, it’s okay to be gay.
It means nothing of your value or worth. It means nothing of your expression of gender, and it means nothing of how worthy you are for sex. Sex is a normal, natural human need and desire. You’re not an ugly fag. You deserve to have sex and feel happy. You deserve to be happy period, sexual and romantically or not. What else is going on in your life? Would you wanna dm? I promise your life is worthy of living. I’m really sorry you feel this way. Please keep hanging on. Life can change so easily. It may be hell for a few years and then it may turn to heaven.

It doesn't feel normal... it feels like sex is wrong. I'm so scared to ever let someone touch me. I'm frightened by this world and the things I have to do to survive. And I'll never understand human relationships or connections. I feel like giving it up completely. Which just means I'll never be happy. I can't be happy completely alone. I have family who's un supportive, few work friends who don't understand me, and never a partner. I have no one close to me to tell me what to do. I don't care about myself. I know I don't deserve love... I'm not willing to work hard and change and evolve. I'm incapable of moving forward. Even the suicide hotline has told me multiple times they cannot stay on the line for someone who doesn't want help... nobody can save me and it feels like everyone is holding the door open for me to commit that act. I just want this suffering to end. It's not worth it.

You’re not a burden. You’re depressed for one, anyone depressed has a hard time working hard and changing and evolving. Those things take mental energy. You don’t seem to have that right now, but you can get it one day. I get what it’s like to have no one good around you. I barely have anyone good around me.

"I'm 21(M). I used to excel at academics before coming to college. But, lately I'm not able to perform well due to procrastination and overthinking.

"I was like you…used to excel at academics all my life  before I was 21-22 and then I had a personal crisis of some sort and I think I got depressed or something. And a couple of years I was really bad at academics - did not submit projects, skipped classes (and I wasn’t partying or anything - just majorly unmotivated ) Then I started becoming better again, but quite mediocre to be frank because I couldn’t catch up with those 2 years lost. 

I always regretted not working harder and not being good at what I was studying. But I understand why. 

If it possible for you - get some help - a good therapist (be careful what you chose)…maybe you have depression, maybe Adhd - and while you could do well in the past, in college - the complexity of tasks and the deadlines makes it harder for you to excell if you have depression or Adhd.

Wow, I just wrote the same question about depression and ADHD. I also warned about using telehealth for psychiatry. I had the same symptom cluster, worked with a great psychiatrist for 23 years, have done great for the past 10 years but then my shrink retired. I had to go to quite a few new shrinks before finding one that didn't stigmatize me for taking meds for ADHD and being on two different antidepressants. 

What I mean to emphasize is that sometimes going for help can be hurtful, and we just have to keep going until we find the right fit. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DfJSCG-NHKE"	HomeComfortable5399	reply	na	na	na	0.9906030893325806	weak	strong	no	na	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.
I’ve never been an active person, always preferred to stay home and play video games or watch some TV shows or movies, but for some time now I wanted to start working out ‘because it’s good for you and your mental health’. And it leaves me feeling more ‘broken’ so to speak, because every time after I exercise I feel an urge to cry and I feel way worse about myself and my body (I’m overweight and never been fit, so my body isn’t able to do a lot of stuff). I guess I’d love to hear I’m not alone in this and other people feel like this too 😅	HugBeast00	post	27.689778772159002	female	White	0.9992765784263611	na	na	na	1	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.

I’m (F) 14, I’ve been feeling like shit this year. I’ll try to explain what I’m feeling the best I can: I CANT focus. I CANT really understand what people are saying. what I’m saying won’t make sense. I CANT really read well anymore. My spelling sucks now. I DONT have motivation to do anything. I go to sleep at 4:30 and wake up at 10 I go back to sleep 30 minutes after 10 and wake up in the middle of the night go to sleep again wake up etc etc then I wake up at around 5:00am and am still exhausted and I go to sleep, repeat. I’ve been frustrated all the time. I’ve lost my period. My back hurts alot. My mind is constantly all over the place. When I’m talking to someone my mind will be somewhere else. It feels like my mind and body are 2 different things. Sometimes I feel like I’m in a movie and nothing is real. I’ll black out and completely forget what I said. I feel hopeless.I’ve been having a lot of suicidal thoughts. I’m constantly exhausted. If I’m left alot i find it Hard not to have my mind go into 80 directions.I feel constant stress, like I can never have a break. I constantly feel guilty. I dint feel like I deserve anything I feel like a horrible person all the time.I sometimes hear a faint screaming in my head. Recently I find myself getting irritated easily. I still have my Optimism and I’m still pretty extroverted.but it’s because I always have to be the one supporting others if im not optimistic then… no one will be… I don’t get treated great by my family,teachers,or peers… I DONT feel like anyone cares about me..

"This sounds a lot like me when I was your age. Unfortunately, I had to wait until I was an adult to see someone because my mom didn’t want me labeled with anything either (as I see in one of your previous comments.) Not to say that we are the same, but it turned out that I had many things wrong and it all went undiagnosed. I had ADHD, autism, PTSD, and of course, because of these things, depression and anxiety followed. I did amazing in school until I reached 11th grade and then it just plummeted. Nobody thought I had ADHD or autism because I over-performed. As most of us know, having ADHD and autism doesn’t make anybody less knowledgeable, and it’s such a harmful stereotype. I think I changed so suddenly because I had been masking my symptoms for so long that one day, I just had to stop. I couldn’t anymore. 

I write all this to say: please convince your parents to take you to see someone. If you have to wait until you’re an adult, I know it can be so incredibly hard, but please talk to someone when you can take yourself and take your own initiative.

"Hey friend. Im so sorry that you’re experiencing this. I know that it must be incredibly difficult, and overwhelming to navigate. I know it’s been said already, but it’s really important that you reach out to your doctor about this.

I was you 5 years ago (I’m 19F now), experiencing pretty much all of the same symptoms. Although I had a social worker at school, I found my sessions with her to be completely useless honestly. On top of that, my parents (as much as I love them) really neglected to acknowledge, and help me during that period of my life. Which made me feel like my feelings didn’t matter, and even more alone than I already felt, which spiralled me even further. For this reason, I didn’t start properly treating my mental/physical health until I was around 16-17 years old when I finally decided I needed to take this matter into my own hands. And by that point a lot of irreparable, and preventable damage had been done. 

It turns out that the root causes of my issues were primarily PCOS (which caused/contributed to issues such as: non existent periods, severe depression and mood swings, cystic acne, sleep issues, etc ), and combined type ADHD (which I was diagnosed with recently as an adult). My vitamin levels, diet, etc were fine. Although in saying this, it is important that you take my experience with a grain of salt as the symptoms you’re describing can be indicative of a variety of different health issues, hence the important of discussing your feelings/symptoms with a doctor. 

Just want to add as well that I’m here if you need someone to talk to. I understand (as much as I can ofc) what you’re going through, and I see you. Just shoot me a pm if you need anything like I said :)"	Milky_Bun_Bun	reply	na	na	na	0.9989840388298035	strong	no	no	na	MentalHealthSupport	failed

I wish I could help you get your job back. Unfortunately I can’t and unfortunately that’s how companies view us as workers. They really don’t care about your enjoyment, health, care, passion or anything they care about what’ll free up or give them more money. I have had this problem before where I loved a job and they fucked it over for me I do honestly believe that you’ll find another job you’ll like.	ne0tas	reply	na	na	na	0.998554527759552	weak	no	no	na	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.

I have a great life I just don’t appreciate it. I have a fantastic job. I have an apprenticeship starting in September. I have my own car. I have a amazing girlfriend and amazing family. I just don’t feel happy. I constantly feel exhausted and just not having it. I don’t know why and I don’t know what to do. I want to be able to appreciate it. And I am grateful for what I have and am a very respectful person I just don’t feel happy and appreciate things. I don’t know what to do and I just don’t get it.

I remember feeling this way and being confused. Turns out I had depression. It's not your fault. It's just whatever brain chemistry not making the happy chemicals. It sounds like you're doing life ok, but you deserve to feel happy. If you can, speak with a therapist or psychiatrist. There is therapy and medications that can help you get to the bottom of that pit you're in. The worst thing you can do is nothing, so any step counts.

Thankyou it means a lot to know I’m not the only one in this boat. I’m definitely going to try and reach out to someone soon about it and see if there’s anything I can start doing in my life and maybe any medications. It is weird.

Yes, I totally understand that feeling. My life is amazing right now, and I'm exactly where I want to be in nearly every facet of my life, but sometimes I'm too numb to enjoy it and I feel guilty for not being able to enjoy it to its full extent. I think you realizing the way you're feeling is huge, instead of not enjoying life and making rash decisioms, and leaving it at that, you recognize that something still feels off.

I have been a long time lurker on Reddit (for a couple of years now) and tonight o decided to sign up and make a post because I don’t know where else to turn. I feel like I’m simultaneously imploding and comping undone at the seams. I don’t have a strong friend group and I don’t have coworkers because my job is solitary. I’m in a relationship and it doesn’t feel healthy and I keep trying to communicate and I just get told that I’m being ridiculous and that everything I want to talk about is nonsense. On the one hand, I feel like I’m being gaslit, but on the other hand I worry that maybe it is me. I just need some support and someone to talk to.	outforlunch48047	post	24.842494620126356	male	White	0.9970303773880005	na	na	na	1	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.

"i feel like this year i have started acting a lot more childlike when im in the privacy of my apartment. its not like i completely revert or wanna play with toys or anything its just i've gotten even more attached to a blanket my mom made me, to the point i've started calling it ""blankie"" in my head sometimes or jokingly with a friend (i've done it like once or twice, usually after i have a big freak out about the whole thing, i think i do it in those situations to make myself feel like its not a big deal). i almost always sleep with it and i take it home with me when i go from college. if i'm going somewhere and im spending the night, i take it with me if possible. i can go to sleep without it, but i just sleep better with it. i also always try and find the softest spots on the blanket and then stroke them over and over again. I like to smell it a lot, i find it really comforting. sometimes it makes me think of home or when i was a little kid and my old blanket. when i was little, i had a different blanket that was smaller, more child sized and i did a lot of the same thing with that one that i do with this one. one difference is back then i sucked my thumb, which i did up until late elementary school. if i remember correctly, i pretty much slept with that blanket until my mom made me this new one when i was in middle school (12 ish).  i pretty much just transferred from that one to this one. and i feel like i've been getting worse about it. sometimes, even if i have plans, i dont want to get out of bed, i just want to lay with my blanket. and today, i had plans to watch a basketball game at a friend's house and i kept on fighting with myself about taking it or not. like i knew she wouldn't care, i just felt like i would start acting so much worse if i did. i feel like none of my friends have a ""blankie"" that they can't separate themselves from. i feel so stupid for acting this way sometimes.

another thing i have noticed myself doing sometimes is referring the my mom and dad as ""mommy"" and ""daddy"" in my head, even though I haven't called them that in probably 15  years. sometimes i just think about how much i want to go home and hug my dad real hard like he used to when i was little. idk if thats normal or what. and there are times where i wish i was a little kid again so i don't have to deal with some of my responsibilities or so i could get a do over. i find the second part kinda weird because yeah even though I have my struggles, I think i'm pretty happy.

idk if it will make any difference but i was diagnosed with pretty severe ocd when i was 8, and i've mostly been able to get it under control. i deal with self esteem issues and body image issues. my mom is a recovering addict, but my parents were never divorced. my mom is having some pretty major health issues due to her addiction, and my dad almost died from covid last year. i've been struggling with my sexuality for a while, but i think i'm finally coming to terms with it, even though my parents don't know yet. on top of all of that, i realized a close friend of mine had been manipulating me pretty much from the start of our friendship and then i've had some pretty severe drama going on in a club that i am very active in. so like i know i've been stressed, but is that why i'm acting this way? i have friends who are dealing with some of the same club drama (or even more of it) and other external stressors and they aren't acting like little kids. and like i said, i dont think i act like a child around others. idk whats going on. im just confused and concerned and don't want to stress my parents out even more."	thiccclub	post	20.4767225643653	female	White	0.004174618981778622	na	na	na	3	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.

thanks for the reply. i want to start therapy again, i think it would be really beneficial, but the stuff offered by the college sucks, and i can't afford therapy on my own. i would talk to my parents about it, but i don't want to stress them out more, both emotionally and financially, with all of my mom's health issues.	thiccclub	follow-up	na	na	na	0.004174618981778622	weak	strong	no	na	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.

Ok let’s start this off with the fact that I’ve had the worst few months possible I’m crying while typing this  I have no friends like at all idk if I’m the problem or the fact that I just pick shitty people to be around my parents constantly use me to benefit them and they can’t move a muscle when I need help but if I don’t help them they threaten to kick me out I’m on probation for weed but I can’t get my parents to take me to a doctor so I can get some kind of help so obviously I’ve been smoking weed cause it helps alot I failed a drug test for probation (my fault ) and I go again next week to find out what they will do I’m terrified that my girlfriend will leave me if they put me in jail I doubt they will or I hope not I’m 19 with a clean record and have 5 months left I have problems with my knees and. I can’t stand long so working a factory job or something like that isn’t an option but my parents tell me that’s the only job I’m gonna get but I don’t have a car and where I live I have to drive an hour away for any job really and they won’t help me get a car I depend on them to much and every time I try to have hope they will help me with something they let me down also I’m sorry for writing so much I genuinely don’t have anyone to talk to so I’m resorting to ranting to strangers in the internet it sounds silly but fuck it it’s worth a shot right we’ll back to the life story I’m writing and to add onto of everything my uncle passed away this week and my bio dad went to rehab I’ve been trying to save money but not having a job or even being able to get to one has a big effect on that I’m saving to move out to my girlfriend cause the long distance isn’t nice I want to be with her in person and my parents know how bad I want it but they keep taking what little money I have cause they need money for bills but I guess I understand that god I feel fucking embarrassed writing this noones gonna give a shit there a lot more to it but long story short my life is absolute shit and me trying to get somewhere where I’m wanted and people care for me isn’t working every time I get my hopes up it goes to shit and tbh it’s getting a tiring very very tiring  thank you to whoever takes the time to read this I know I may not mean anything to anyone but one person in this world and no one really care about me in my small corner of the world but thank you if you read this the whole things a mess and I am a mess		post	12.43398143350331	male	White	0.998371422290802	na	na	na	4	MentalHealthSupport	failed

"TRIGGER WARNING, self harm, mental health crisis, graphic detail

———————————————————————————

I will not go into length about how we got here. Years of mental health concerns, issues with family, friends, relationships and work have lead us here. If you are curious I can answer questions privately.

On Monday, I was on a plane for a work trip for 6 hours, when I landed a I received a call from her best friend. She was in an ambulance on her way to the hospital. I dropped everything, ran off the plane, got in a cab and rushed to the hospital.

She ingested approximately 13,000mg of Bupropion (Welbutrin), which is substantially more than what is required to be fatal.

At first, she seemed okay. Tired, groggy, but she was awake and speaking to me and the paramedics. We called her family, she was able to speak with them briefly while we were waiting for doctors to attend to her.

This sleepiness and grogginess continued for several hours. These moments felt sad, but manageable. She was scared, sad and sick but she was okay.

About 4 hours later, the hallucinations and seizing began. Her eyes were permanently rolled back into her head, she couldn’t vocalize words but was attempting to speak. She was mumbling, panicking, screaming. She was terrified and didn’t know where she was. She attempted to run away from the nurses and myself several times, she tore her IVs out multiple times. I had to hold her down and call for nurses. Eventually, she had to be fully restrained in her bed. From this point on, she alternated between a deep sleeping state, seizing, convulsing and panic attacks. Every 5 minutes or so she would wake up screaming, struggling violently to get out of her restraints. I would attempt to calm her, holding her hand, telling her she is safe and we are going to be okay. She didn’t know who I was. She was terrified of me, the doctors and the nurses. Anyone touching her was met with violent outbursts. Seeing her look up at me with fear in her eyes, convinced I was going to harm her is something I can’t get out of my head. This pattern continued for over 24 hours.

After her panic attacks, her eyes would roll back, and she would fall back onto the bed and see a drastic reduction in heart rate and breathing. During a few of these moments, I thought she had died and broke down. But she’s a fighter, she made it through each one of these moments and kept fighting.

Eventually, she became aware enough to speak, somewhat. If she slowed down, and tried really hard she could vocalize a few words at a time. “Don’t take my organs” , “don’t cut me open” , “you aren’t (my name) .. what did you do with him?”. The hallucinations continued for another 12 hours, with her slowly becoming more able to speak, and being able to listen. After hours of talking her through the situation, she started to be convinced, I could see she was starting to believe it was me. I got her back. Slowly over the next few hours I was able to tell her the story, what happened to her, where we are, how long we’ve been here.

We are now 5 days after the incident, she was just medically cleared yesterday and is under psychiatric evaluation.

I have not slept, I can’t close my eyes without seeing her hurting and struggling. I couldn’t leave her alone in there for even a minute. Now that we have confirmed she is going to survive, I am coming to my own reality of what has happened, I am struggling with guilt, that I am feeling in need of support when she is the one who needs me more than ever.

I don’t know what to do… I am being strong and supporting her through this, but I feel like I am close to my own breakdown. 

Tell me something to make me feel better."	Jazzlike_Smile_137	post	26.849741152730623	female	White	0.0134044848382473	na	na	na	8	MentalHealthSupport	failed

"You are heard, you are valid, your experience and emotions are valid.

This is not your fault. You are doing the best with what you have and know. That's all you can do. Be gentle on yourself - celebrate your victories, especially now, no matter how small. You and your wife, both.

You cannot control anyone's actions but your own. You do not need to feel guilt. 

My advice is to seek professional help, therapy, asap. I'm thinking a LMFT, specifically. This is big trauma. You're going to benefit greatly having a LMHP to help you work through this, to learn tools to better take care of yourself. You cannot help anyone else if you cannot help yourself first - you must fill your own cup first, and let it overflow into others'. I also think your wife needs individual counseling as well...i know she does. & you two may benefit from couples, as a way to enhance your relationship and heal from this trauma, and grow together.

I have experienced great trauma in my life and severe mental illness. I have since been on a very long journey of recovery. My mental and emotional wellbeing is now strong, healthy, thriving. I love my life and i am genuinely happy. If i could share any words with your wife, it would be this - There is always hope, even if you can't see it at the time. It gets better but you have to put the work in. The human mind is so, so powerful and so very capable of healing from trauma. It is entirely possible to recover from any trauma, including this, and live a fulfilling life. It may not look like it, but there is always hope. 

I hope my words can be of some help. I wish you two all the best. I empathize with both of you, and your pain."	Jazzlike_Smile_137	reply	na	na	na	0.0134044848382473	weak	no	no	na	MentalHealthSupport	failed
I attempted to end my life by taking overdose of SSIRs. I fainted, I was dizzy, I was yelling at doctors which I don’t remember. The only advice I would give you is to be there for her if you really love her which it seems like you do. I only had my family. Every guy in my life ignored me and that hurt me a lot. They called me crazy and blocked me straightaway. I am hurt I didn’t get the people I wanted to be around me but I also have a lot to be thankful for. At least, my mom showed up to the hospital EVERYDAY and even tho, I could tell she was hurting seeing me like this, she always motivated me. She kept pushing me and prayed with me. I feel embarrassed about what happened but I never tell anyone in public I am embarrassed. I hide that for the rest of my life. Sometimes my mom brings it up when she’s mad at me and I feel very hurt. She would say “do you want to end up like you were crying your heart out over boys again?” Just keep motivating her that she will get better. There is light at the end of the tunnel. But also something my family did was swept it under the rug when I came home. Talk to her when she is ready of why she did what she did and how you can prevent it again. Your her support system moving on. I am so sorry you feel like you will get a breakdown. I would highly suggest therapy session and not keeping it built up till one day you have a huge meltdown.

My partner attempted on Thursday. She’s on a 72 hour, we have three young kids, and I am going between problem-solving mode with bills, and curbing anxiety attacks. This is so hard. We have spoken and agreed to finding supplementary therapy, I’ve already reached out to her current therapist for referrals for someone who can meet 2x a week versus every other week. We are both employed in socially “appreciated” careers, but underpaid, and one of her main stressors was money. She has a history of mental health issues, which she so has tried so hard to combat in a myriad of ways. A ketamine clinic was by far the most effective, but we just can’t afford it. It’s so frustrating. We have a good relationship and I thought we had communicative protocols in place to prevent this from happening. I can’t tell my family because I don’t think they will understand. I have a friend support system, but I’m still alone in our home performing this mental acrobat routine. I know this was posted 23d ago, and I hope you and your person are in a better place. I’m in the thick of it and just came looking for commiseration, I guess.

So happy to hear. It may be worthwhile to ask your therapist(s) if you can increase your sessions to weekly, if possible, at least during this initial period. I've been able to do so with my therapist in the past during rough patches and it was immensely beneficial. Just a thought. I'm rooting for you both, bigtime.

"I cant take this loneliness any more.
I have no social life at all and have not really had any during my teen age and 20s. In my late 20s now and i lost my youth to being alone

I wrote this long post to somewhere else and it probably express situation better: 
 

Firstly im very lonely and have been most of my life and feel really miserable and frustrated about it.....
Im in late 20s and i basically had no any social life in my youth teen age and 20s.

I rarely go anywhere so getting friends or finding girl who would fall in love, seems impossible and unlikely to happen.... 

I just dont have any place to go to where i would meet some one..

I have rarely places/events happening.... and some times like 2 times now row i could not go to these live shows because tickets were all sold out. 
(Im now talking about live shows of rappers performing etc) Should have bought the tickets earlier smh....
Right now theres a event starting at this moment in night club i planned to go to... and instead im just laying here in ped trying to sleep depressed and frustrated writing this,,, again missing a big possibility to meet some one. 
Same happened few weeks ago. Drived hour to see this rap show only be told at the door that all the tickets are sold and then hour back home depressed.

Theres not much of these events of my style and dont know if any will happen in many months now after this one..

These rap show events are only place where i feel like i could have a change to find friends of my kind and possibly some one who would became love of my life.
What else place and situation there is for me to socialise if not these rare genre specific events???
I cant figure anything else...... 

I am really in to old school hiphop so i really only go to bars and clubs when theres some rappers of that style having show and do not like to go bars and clubs other than that. 
Here is no clubs or bars of this genre.. only rare shows every now and then so have to wait months.

I have really no friends or any social circle so meeting new people is really hard and rare.

Well I do have coupke friends kind of but they live in other city and other country and im so bad at being social i have no idea what to message to them although i really want to talk to them......

I just have no social skills and no idea what to say...
Im very introverted and have trouple trusting people because of some not so nice things i have experienced.

I also have no job or im not in school or such,,,, so i have no channel to meet people through and make friends and find love....... 
I tried to get in to this vocational technical school for photography but of course i was not chosen as always.......

I have hobbies but no social hobby..

I just always wanted to have couple friends in my life i can hang out with and find some nice girl yo fall love with... but my youth just flew through my eyes alone.........   
It feels horrible and im not sure how long i can handle this anymore.....  
Some say you will get used to be alone but thats bs. I have been alone most of my life and now in my late 20s i feel just as miseraple being this lonely as i was feeling 15 years ago......

All i want is couple good friends or at least one and find some nice girl to fall in love with. 
Thats all i ask.....
Im very much lone wolf infj type introvert guy that likes to have own time alone,,,, but i never wanted to be this lonely.

I was very broken mentally all my life so far and that made me loose any change to have normal life....
My life is a failure......

All i wish is just that i find friend and love..............

But where i could find them when i have no place to go to, no social sircle, ,,,, no any channel to meet anyone????

So there no really place to go to make social skills better either...

Im just extremely frustrated, depressed and wishing some miragle to happen and find some one.....

I cant take this life long lonelines anymore and im pushed in edge of,, well you may quess what........"		post	22.283373730884986	male	White	0.9986503720283508	na	na	na	5	MentalHealthSupport	failed
"Hi there. Sorry to hear you’re having such a tough time. I just want you to know, you’re still young! There’s still time to find new hobbies and make new friends and fall in love! 

Call your friends, tell them you miss them. Visit your local library. Find a group to volunteer with. And maybe find a therapist of counsellor to talk to about feeling depressed. And next time there’s a rap show, buy your tickets! If you don’t go, whatever, but give yourself the chance! 

Life is definitely hard and people can be terrible, but we don’t all suck, but you’ll never know if you don’t take a few chances. Take a deep breath. Be kind to yourself. You can do this! Good luck."		reply	na	na	na	0.9986503720283508	strong	no	no	na	MentalHealthSupport	failed
If you're an animal lover, you could volunteer at a shelter. They're always looking for people to walk dogs and pet cats.

Dude go to a local bar and play pool. Be yourself. Its hard to meet a girl. Try dating apps it takes a while but it just worked for me after years. And shes beautiful! Find a local meditation group they exist wherever you are and are run by cool non judgmental ppl. I have just started yoga with breathing involved (i'm male) you will prob laugh as mostly females do it, but i do the yin kind which supports mental health and it makes me feel great. Find work & get out of the house if you can.		reply	na	na	na	0.9986503720283508	no	strong	no	na	MentalHealthSupport	failed

" about dating apps... i have been 9 years in tinder and not even single one girl has even went on one date with me. So it has been more than a 'while'..
Im too much of genre specific style to meet anyone from dating apps because there just is not much type of girls that would like me in those apps and maybe im just not good looking enough.
Im not too picky but honestly i feel like i have seen only couple actually really my type girls on tinder during that time.. and they chose some else or were in tinder just for fun.
I have even been told im the most interesting match they have matched with by couple persons but even them chose some one else in end

I only like to go to bars when theres some event/show like rapper i like performing or something like that and thats not weekly. Maybe few max 4 or so times a year. 
Here is no my type of bars really outside of those rare events and i feel like i stuck out like sore thumb in most places.
Im really in to oldschool hiphop so also dress that way... and you can imagine not every small city like my has places and bars for every genre specific people to hang out. 
I could go to some bar sure,, but i would feel really out of place in most bars and im not in to drinking either and not so good socially. Im introvert. Dont like to be around drunk people too much as i dont drink myself much. My father had and still has alcohol problem so that has left a mark on me. 
I suppose theres few bars i could go to.. but usually i only go if theres some rap show etc more of my kind of thing happening.

So yeah my whole appearance and style limits a lot.
Lots of people tend to be bit ignorant and even hateful towards me because for them im something they do not understand or like.
You have no idea what type of attitudes i get from lots of people just because of the way i look.

This city actually has really big hiphop scene and better yet underground hiphop scene which is exactly my type people,,,, but because i did grow up my childhood in near by smaller town im really outsider in the scene here in the city and those friend groups as in the small town i grew up there was no other kids like me with same interests. 
So im very much outsider.
If i grew up in the city i would probably have no problem with loneliness and would have friends.

...its not that i want to be only friends with ""hiphop people"",,,,,, its that lots of people who are not in to oldschool hiphop do not want to be friends with me because they just dislike me for existing.
You would be surprised how hatefull people can be here.

I can be friends with all types and styles of people.

So making friends with people who are not in to same interests is hard and
Its also pretty hard to get in to those friend groups who are like me because im so anti social and bad social skills so have not even tried to honestly.

And yeah the main problem is im very antisocial although i want social life. Just dont know how to interact socially,,, what to talk about etc but i want to

Yeah i have thought to start some hobbies like myai thai but for health related reason did not yet

I suppose theres many hobbies i could start but not sure what it would be

Im in to arts too like drawing etc,,,, but i dont know how and where that would help socialise

I dont know maybe i was about to say something more to this reply but im sleepy and about to fall sleep right its night ...well already morning now actually

"My girlfriend and I are getting ready to move in together to a new place. We signed the contracts a couple days ago. We’re both disabled, but she’s completely disabled whereas I work 50 hours a week. She has aphasia and auditory discrimination so it makes it hard for her to speak, find words, use correct syntax and understand other people. I have to be extremely patient and stop everything I’m doing when she’s speaking, especially if she’s struggling.

Tonight she was asking me about a response from a friend on IG and she was struggling to find a word. As she was struggling she was moving her palm up and down, in that way that is commonly understood as “what is it? What is the word?” I said what I thought it was and she got quite upset.

It’s worth mentioning that somehow I screwed up my wrist while working. It hurts really badly and I have it bandaged up. When my girlfriend gets frustrated she gets physical sometimes. It’s nothing major, it’s like tapping me really hard in the chest, or grabbing my arms angrily nails first, but this time she was carelessly throwing closed fists. She hit me right in my injury pretty hard.

She proceeded to get angry about how I had spoken while she was thinking, I explained I was responding to her hand signal and just not thinking, and she kept explaining why she was upset. I told her that when you hit someone, whether you meant to or not, especially if it’s in an injury, it’s time to stop talking about whatever you were talking about. I just wanted her to apologize, make sure I was okay, and act sorry and tell me it wouldn’t happen again.

Despite me telling her this she said “I’m sorry but…” and went back to talking about how she was upset with me. I kept explaining this wasn’t okay, I really needed her to be more concerned about hitting me in my injury. I was trying explain how bad it sounds if I told someone else about it but she cut me off and exclaimed “what are you even saying?!?”

I got angry, which I never do, and said “no, this isn’t acceptable! You hit me” She walked away and went in the other room. I have to work in 4.5 hours and I’m pretty upset, but I want someone else to tell me if I’m making sense."	ifallforeveryone	post	16.409316534528738	male	White	0.998664379119873	na	na	na	8	MentalHealthSupport	failed
"Physical abuse is physical abuse my guy. No one has a right to lay their hands on you even if it's ""not that big of a deal"". The small snowballs into the large, and the fact she isn't even sorry should set off red flags. If I ever hurt someone even if by accident I would apologize right away, ESPECIALLY if it was someone I cared about. If you hurt someone, even if it was just bumping into them on the sidewalk, you would apologize to the. Truly apologize not a ""I'm sorry, but you were in my way :/"". If someone is attempting to hurt you in anyway, tapping your chest aggressively included, that is physical abuse and will snowball into more violent tantrums slowly. You may not even notice it, they may make you feel like its small things, they may even apologize and ""feel bad"" about it later. It's how abusers work, even if they aren't aware or intending to be an abuser. 

Her hitting an injured hand and not stopping whatever she was doing right away is bad. You have a right to be upset about that."	ifallforeveryone	reply	na	na	na	0.998664379119873	no	no	no	na	MentalHealthSupport	failed
"Hey just a female passing by and just wanted to come and say all that mediocre addressed is spot on. Your feelings are valid here. And you don’t deserve to have your boundaries crossed of respecting someone to not allow yourself to act abusive. Whether she inside feels joy from cruelty kinda abuse versus her actions are slipping and not building her self awareness to sort through it. 

Because all our feelings can and are valid. But it doesn’t make it okay to inflict hurt on others regardless if that’s physical , emotional, financial.. I mean list goes on. 

I’m sorry you are going through this… I’m sorry she had to go through her past and still both trying to come out on top right? 

Having self care to your boundaries and healing that she will have to sort her own feelings out on her own if she isn’t feeling safe. Like instead of acting out towards you- she should stomp her self into a bedroom and sit and chill, throw soft items at a mattress or such can be helpful anger outbursts that are more socially acceptable. 

It still comes down to, you’re not her punching bag and if that motion of things is a release she needs to redirect herself in a safe way. 

It’s HARD to cope with past traumas and hard to cope with the state of our mental from all the years and what chemical imbalances are at play, what did life throw our way? Yet if we want to come out from it, we have to open our eyes and work on processing and facing it and having healthy coping strategies lined up, aware of, add to your emotional tool kit … add as much as you can 💚"	ifallforeveryone	reply	na	na	na	0.998664379119873	weak	no	no	na	MentalHealthSupport	failed
"So, first off thank you. You’re the only person who responded while I was sleeping and you may be the only person that responds at all. I’m sitting here gaslighting myself saying, “I mean, was it a big deal? I think it was a big deal, my dad was almost put in jail for poking my mom in the chest angrily with his index finger… but she was acting like I was out of my mind for being so upset.” 

The only thing I wanted was for her to recognize that it was serious and immediately back down and apologize. I can say for the record that I was wrong, it was wrong of me to talk over her, but it was an accident and I was so sure that hadn’t movement meant “the answer… please!!!” Instead she mostly stood her ground like I was a crazy person. She did apologize but it wasn’t sincere, it was dismissive as hell, if she realized what she had done she would have been very concerned. 

That’s what scares me. I needed proof that she is capable of down shifting when she’s done something wrong. To be able to immediately go “oh fuck, what did I do” is an important part of being a person, much less a part of a couple. The background she comes from makes it so, in the past, a great deal of what she says sounds like she’s annoyed, frustrated, or upset with me. She’s come a long long way since we started dating but… I just needed more last night.

"I appreciate that very much, thank you for taking the time to write this. I think her reactions are reflexive. I saw a video of her with her family as a kid and her dad was sort of joking around with her and she like hit him and slapped him and suddenly I said, “oh, that’s where that came from!” I think she got so used to doing it that it just happens without thinking. It isn’t an excuse though.

I told my girlfriend that I was staying at my very mentally ill friend’s house because I just didn’t want to be by myself, and she started becoming not just antagonistic but abusive. I was so angry, and this had been happening for so long, that as she was screaming in my face I felt the smallest muscle twitch and I said “I can’t hang out with you any more.” It wasn’t a movement, it was the slightest contraction in my arm, but I knew it was my body wanting to protect myself from her and even if it was barely anything that was already too much. Losing 1/1000th of control was too much. So I struggle to see how she can’t stop herself. 

We’re very different but she acts like I’m calm and respect because of magic. No, I put in a ton of work, and it didn’t happen overnight. So I’m understanding but I’m not gonna deal with this forever."	ifallforeveryone	follow-up	na	na	na	0.998664379119873	weak	strong	no	na	MentalHealthSupport	failed
"Often times it's hard to recognize abuse as it's happening, since like you said you gaslight yourself into minimizing it. It's not a small thing, no one in their right mind would purposefully hurt someone they care about. They would back down right away and drop the argument if it was an accident, especially with a previous injury. You say she's come far since you started dating but honestly it seems like a gradual increase of abuse, mental or physical, just from what you said in your post. I may of course be wrong, but even if she's come a long way it's not your job to fix someone especially if they don't really want to change. 

In my opinion she's proven how she thinks you'll roll over and take whatever she throws at you, and you'll just forgive her without her needing to even pretend to be sorry. I think you deserve someone who will love you without whatever is going on there, because whatever it is it's not good. Then again I'm almost famously good at cutting ties with people so it might just be me.

"I’m in therapy, and she’s in therapy (which seems a little unfocused to me), so I’m going to demand that we both address this both individually and together. It has been a gradual increase for sure, there’s no doubt. Sadly she thinks “this is just how people act” and because she’s always been surrounded by it she can’t see that “baseline” for her is actually “pretty bad” by other people’s standards. 

I’ve always told her that if she’s in a good mood? She’s beyond the best. She treats me exactly how I want to be treated, and I’ve told her that if it wasn’t like that I wouldn’t be around. She’s my best friend and I genuinely enjoy spending time with her. But when she’s in a bad mood? Everything is about her. Only one person is allowed to be upset and she can’t console me if she’s upset. I’ve explained that has to change or the relationship will not survive.

She had her stroke at 16 going on 17 so she missed out on all the socialization that you need to be a functional adult. She never was able to move out, her parents have to control most of her money and setting up appointments. She can’t drive, she can’t work, she had one friend but rejected that person because they’re Borderline and my gf just can’t handle it. She was never able to go to college, or have a real “first job,” she’s never had real independence, and most importantly she’s never had to take care of someone else, it’s entirely been someone taking care of her.

She is stuck at home all day (we live in the country) and my one of my disabilities requires me to go to a medical appointment nearly every day, which means shortly after I get home I have to go to bed, so I can get to that morning appointment and be back in time so I’m not late to work. That means I have no free time, no time to unwind and do stuff for myself. My weekends are largely dedicated to doing what she wants or needs. I’m working 50 hours a week while she does laundry once a week and occasionally cleans the counters or sweeps or something. Point is I’m still doing housework and she expects a lot when I get home… I’m always at the end of my rope. 

Since she’s not used to “taking care of someone else,” because she wasn’t taken care of before her stroke of after. She’s basically like Rapunzel, stuck somewhere reliving the same day every day, and since she hasn’t grieved the loss of “a normal life” she’s angry, bitter, sad, and nihilistic a lot. Now, she is often happy and loving and understanding and accommodating, but as soon as she’s upset that goes away. It feels very indulgent, selfish, self aggrandizing behavior and I tell her it’s a real problem. I think all her feelings are valid but she needs to deal with them differently. 

She’s made so many positive changes. I’ve had to be her personal coach/therapist, as well as her caregiver, and her boyfriend, all of which I’m okay with but I feel like I deserve more recognition, respect, and some of the caring I’ve taught her directed at me. I just need her to treat me like I’m important and she’s afraid of losing me. She does act like she knows I won’t leave and that’s really upsetting. 

She knows I have a long history of physical and sexual abuse, including two rapes, a couple kidnappings etc so I’ve told her that I needed to not be struck. She feels bad for herself if I flinch when she comes near suddenly, instead of making me scared enough to automatically flinch. 

I’m sorry, I’m rambling. Thank you again for responding. I keep going back and rereading what you wrote and it’s very helpful. I really appreciate you."	ifallforeveryone	follow-up	na	na	na	0.998664379119873	no	strong	no	na	MentalHealthSupport	failed
"No dude it's cool. I do want you to know you basically gave a textbook definition of the carousel of abuse describing her mood shifts. And her hitting you despite knowing what you've gone through is actually insane. I make suicide jokes all the time as a way to cope, my girlfriend mentioned she doesn't like it because it triggers her ptsd. I have no clue why it does, she didn't go into detail and guess what? After her mentioning that in passing once I have never done it again infront of her. I was raised in a shitty environment, I'm straight autistic so have horrible socal skills and barely understand anything social and I was able to recognize without backstory in a passing joke of a comment that I was hurting someone I loved by making these jokes so stopped. This woman knows what you've been through in detail, she knows the backstory of why you don't want to be touched in an aggressive manner, and does it anyway. That is so incredibly fucked up that I can't begin to describe how horrid it is, she doesn't care about you. You can be locked in a cage for your whole life and still understand why that is fucked. 

Listen, I get it. Helping her makes you feel nice, she's sweet and the perfect girlfriend when in a good mood. She's gone through alot but guess what? The trauma we face in life may not be our fault but it is our responsibility to handle it. If she is so traumatized that she is willing to aggressively place her hands on you and not understand why thats wrong you owe it to yourself to walk away. She's a big girl and can figure out whatever is going on with her life on her own, we all need to at one point. If she wants to be a bitter mess then leave her to it. I know for a fact you would never let anyone treat someone you cared about the way she is treating you no matter the excuse, why in the hell are you letting someone treat you like this? The good may be good but is it worth the bad? It is to the point you suggested a word because she was struggling to think of one and she physically harmed you.

Completely normal. People are creatures of habit.

"Ever since I was 7, I have always struggled with my mental health. I always thought it was just anxiety but now I'm 20 years old, I'm not too sure anymore. I tried loads of different anxiety medication/Supplements but nothing is working. I'm looking for any advice about what I'm going through for years. 

Here is what I've been struggling with;

\- Certain sounds and lightning make me feel anxious/irritated. Example: My family has a parrot, and the squeaking goes through me so badly, had him for years and I'm still not used to it. I hate hearing people stomp their feet around my house. I can hear it in my room and it drives me insane. Some lighting in a room makes me uncomfortable. 

\- I get irritated easily 

\- My self-esteem is low

\- I always struggled with relationships and find it difficult to make a conversation with someone

\- I hate loud and crowded places 

\- I can only focus on one task and get overwhelmed easily. Example: I work at a FOH and I struggle to do the till and drink at the same time, especially when someone orders hot and cold drinks. I always ask one of the other workers to help out or take over.

\- I always struggled with my education

\- When someone is speaking to me, I sometimes find it difficult on what they're asking me to do. This is a real struggle for work as well. 

\- Sometimes I can't stand or sit for ages, otherwise I feel anxious 

\- I talk really fast and my friends and family can't understand me 

\- Sometimes change makes me feel uncomfortable, for example: if my daily routine changes or if something new happens. If I do something different, I feel anxious and keep thinking something bad is going to happen. 

Any advice or suggestions on what this can be? I have been to the doctors about this, but I thought it was just anxiety, so nothing really has happened to help me."	Expensive_Kiwi_431	post	31.808311333196126	female	White	0.9980747699737549	na	na	na	1	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.

"Hey, 

I have a problem dealing with loneliness. I do not know why but when I’m alone and don’t meet anybody for a couple of days I feel very anxious or in a very sad and negative state. This is a sensation that is overwhelming and makes me sad and I don’t know why it has to be this way. It feels like a heavy and a palpitating bad feeling in my head. I don’t want to feel this way but I don’t think that the solution is to meet someone to get rid of the feeling. I want to learn to handle this emotion and be capable to feel glad or okay when I’m alone. This feeling comes up to me every time when I’m alone and it has been this way for several years. Has anybody felt this ways and does anybody know how to be alone and not get this overwhelming and anxious feeling?

"Thank you both, I work as an Certified-Peer Recovery Support Specialist, at our local Mental Health facility. And to tell you the truth, I’ve been through it all, put myself (and many, others dear to me), through a living hell for years… I’d finally reached my point of complete and total helplessness/despair and knew in the depths of my soul that if I didn’t do a permanent 180, that prison or a pine box were my only 2 next options, and the fear of that reality won out! (Thank God)
I am now a1 year and 8 months sober, working with others on a daily basis (which has proven to be my calling) and striving each day to advance my knowledge so that I can do even more for the next person suffering/struggling with mental health, alcohol/substance abuse issues, or experiencing homelessness.

"This might be a dumb or obvious question but here is my little story, you don't have to read it if you know the answer already but if that's the case please specify.   

I'm curious about this because I had something happened to me where I went from neutral to extremely exited and and happy, the problem is I can barely remember any details about it. I just know what happened, and i know that I felt really good and super excited. Later I had to sit down in private and bring myself together because I was kind of shaking and having I guess you could call a sort of, panic attack I guess you could call it. But I can't remember any details about what happened just the events that took place. I also am wondering if I could retrieve these memories as they are sentimental to me, it happened over 2 months ago so I also don't know if that could be possible.

Hey OP, I totally get this, I have been in that situation where I only have a bf who I talk to and don’t have any other friends or a person close enough to vent out my feelings or help with my overthinking. I know it sounds cliché but journaling really help, like every-time you have the feeling of talking to someone just write out your thoughts. They become less powerful and and laid out in front of you and don’t have that much control over your mind. If writing feels odd to you, try just opening up your voice recorder on your phone and acting out a conversation with a friend. It gets the overwhelming feelings out and helps you not overthink or over analyze. I’ve done this over time and eventually you start feeling better and becomes a cathartic way to let out your feelings when you have no one to talk to. I’d also suggest just reaching out to your local online mental health chat services. They are good at being there for you at the moment and also help your unravel your thoughts. Sometimes therapists aren’t accessible but these services help out more than we think they would. Just know I’ve also been there and it will get better one day.

Yeah having good friends to talk to can be really hard to find. I’m not sure how old you are but going to meet ups for specific interests can help you find some. I found one that way! Also it might be a good idea to find a professional to talk to. My town has a service to help mental health in the community.

"It seems like for two steps I make gain in managing my depression or anxiety , I take one step back due to incompetent billing and customer service. 
Here are the issues

1. The fact that if you don’t cancel in advance at minimum 48h, they charge you $175. 
2. Their billing a mess, they used to charge after every visit but my experience was they didn’t bill me, just my insurance. 

I was under impression I was covered until they did one lump some billing for previous visit in amount of $1400 for past 5 months, 1-2 a month video visit
3. Since I seizures job and I am in waiting period I don’t have insurance this month but still needed to see my psychiatrist to renew my prescription. 

I asked insurance to update my address and change insurance info to self pay hoping to get self pay rate and they haven’t followed or their system is not updating correctly.

Then once the visit is processed via insurance they have to credit my account or refund my credit card since they always overcharge me.

I get a lot of shit from people who just hate me because i am financially doing well but i am lonely and miserable only getting release from watching porn and cutting myself. I have been depressed since childhood and gave therapy a try and no matter who it is there's just this huge disconnect. They try to put these labels on me but my feelings are not static and i don't feel like they can relate. I was with my bestfriend when he died two years ago, i saw him crash off a bridge and found his body. He accidentally killed someone playing soccer and it ate away at him and i feel like this is eating away at me too.

You are very closed off and sharing what you are really feeling and thinking to a real life person is to much for you. You deflect and rather push people away make them the bad guys and isolate yourself.  You can't keep making everyone the enemy.   You have a lot of emotions that are all tied together. You can't have one without them all coming out.  I am going to be blunt with you you are fucked up.  You can change but it will mean breaking down those walls confronting uncomfortable feeling and thought and trusting others.  You have two choices you can keep doing what you are doing and be miserable or you can decide to do something different.  Therapy isnt working because you don't want it to.  Start being honest. Even if it is writing your thoughts, feeling and fears down and letting your therapist read it.  Write a detailed list of who you want to be.  How you want to feel.  Then work with people who can help you become that. You may need to be in the hospital/ inpatient rehab ( there is nothing wrong with that) you may need meds you have to be ready for all of that.  Aren't you tired of feeling like this? Aren't you tired?

"How badly do you want to change?   What might be preventing you from giving the therapist's ideas some consideration?    It might be fear of change, for example.   Or it might be fear of failure: if you don't commit fully to the work, if it doesn't work, it wasn't your fault.      Ultimately, you are the one who does the work on you.  A therapist is just a guide to help you along your journey.  

One suggestion:   you may need to see someone who has more experience in specific areas and/or does a more thorough assessment.  If they tried for years to treat you based on it just being depression,  maybe it isn't just depression?  Cutting isn't a common trait of Depression, you're right.    Cutting is something that, for example, those with borderline personality disorder may do.   A personality disorder may also explain why you can't help but do things that result in restraining order or being so ""hated"".      But I'm obviously not trying to diagnose you.  Just giving you one possibility.   

I'm so sorry about your friend's death and so sorry you had to witness it.   Experiences such as that may have been traumatizing to you.  For healing you may need trauma specific treatment such as EMDR.

"My brother, who is 29 years old, was diagnosed with schizophrenia during college after experiencing a meltdown where he began to believe that people were staring at him and talking about him. With therapy and monthly injections, he was able to manage his symptoms and return to a state of normalcy. However, he abruptly stopped his treatment one day, insisting that he no longer needed it.

Currently, he lives with our parents and has lost his job. He paces back and forth in the house, speaks to himself while mumbling religious things, and is convinced that my family is constantly talking about him. His condition has even caused him to lash out at us during past events, such as calling my girlfriend, mother, and me rude names during Christmas.

Despite our concerns, whenever we suggest that he goes back to therapy or restart his medication, he becomes extremely defensive and tries to turn the situation around on us. He claims that he is the normal one and that we are the ones who need therapy. As his family, we want to know how we can help him even though he is resistant to seeking treatment."

It is unfortunately incredibly difficult to help people who do not want your help. I think the only thing that might help is making some kind of ultimatum for if he continues to refuse treatment, but if you do that then you have to follow through with what you said or it won't work. Don't threaten something you would never do because your brother will know and it won't work. But there has to be consequences for treating you the way he is, because that's not ok regardless of whether or not you have a mental illness.

"I too have a brother who probably has schizophrenia. My uncle has been diagnosed years ago and that's another issue entirely involving my elderly grandmother. I never gave my brother an ultimatum but as a family we told him we think he needs treatment. Fast forward to now, he's regressed so much he doesn't work, constantly makes knives, lives with the grandmother who takes care of the mentally ill uncle, and he's not showing any sign of wanting change, only continuing to decline. Maybe the ultimatum would work but the idea of intentionally pushing him out is a bit extreme. Once my grandmother dies he will have no one who can handle him, nor should they. My father will take him in but will certainly give him the ultimatum. Unfortunately the only thing we can do is observe and keep him from self mutilation if it ever comes to that.
Maybe I'm ranting but I hope your brother shows a sign of wanting change, good luck and may the force be with you."	InternetBazaarMerch	reply	na	na	na	0.9972363114356995	no	strong	no	na	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.

If you need the release you can find non harmful things to redirect the feelings. Gripping a comb, smacking elastic bands on the wrist, screaming into pillows, brace yourself and push HARD in doorways. Find someone to bear hug you tight as they can. Some of those are more for regulation but might help you anyway. I'm sorry you are going through this. Mental pain is pain and you should be taken seriously- but don't damage yourself.

To be completely honest, I have fought with depression and anxiety for over 10 years now.  I feel like I had it under control until fairly recently.  I don’t feel like myself anymore.  I have lost so many people lately and I question why.  But sometimes I just think about how much those people who left me hurt me more than words can even describe yet I’m the bad guy.  I have been through so much over the past few years and I am just now opening up to a stranger but I can’t even open up to my friends anymore because I feel like if I do I will cry and never stop.  The truth is that I’m not a great person but it’s not like I hurt others intentionally.  I always feel like I’m the bad guy even though I’m told I’m not.  I have a few friends left now and a boyfriend who supports me and shows me love everyday but I’m so scared to let him see how I truly feel nowadays.  My meds can only numb so much until I break down.  I’m starting to question why I’m still here trying.  I don’t want to get out of bed anymore I don’t want to talk to anyone anymore, and I just want to lock myself in a room with nothing but my thoughts because that’s how I feel nowadays.  I feel like I’m this bad person who shouldn’t be allowed to be near anyone because of my past affecting everything even if I try not to let it.  I feel like everyone hates me and just wants me gone.  What do I even do anymore.	Beautiful_Monitor_43	post	14.97562013219618	female	White	0.9975047707557678	na	na	na	1	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.
"You can do this because you're a fighter.  You've fought through this for so long.  You sound amazing and I know you're not a bad person.  Nobody so concerned with their affect on others is a bad person.  You are not the bad guy

I think you need group therapy NOW imo

Group therapy will put you together with similar people you can talk all this through with and they will accept you and start helping you work through your distorted thoughts regarding your effect on others.  You will stop feeling so alone after doing it a while and you will hopefully progress to the point where meds are helping you.  You can't stay where you are now and I know it's scary to be optimistic enough to try something, but I think you really need it and I believe in you"	Beautiful_Monitor_43	reply	na	na	na	0.9975047707557678	weak	no	no	na	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.
"So I’m in a tough spot with life. It has been kicking my since mid January and it’s severely affecting me mentally. At work the stress isn’t much different than it all has always been but that little stuff is becoming icing on the cake so to speak. So today I completely crumbled at work and it was bad. All the things I’ve been feeling and holding in exploded. But I was told it was inappropriate and unprofessional to have a meltdown at work. While I think I am ok at least until the next breakdown, I feel like they thought it was a *tantrum*. I am curious what you alls take on that response is.

Ok so, I love my girlfriend to pieces. It would break me to let go of her. I hate to say it but i am entirely screwed. I don't know how but she has made me unable to function without her. However, i feel she is losing feelings, she is not giving me as much attention, never talks to me etc, and whenever i bring it up, she always says no. However it is proven that men know women are losing feelings long before the women figure it out themself. The main problem is she gives other men more attention than she gives me. This causes me to overthink everything, worry. As much as i hate it i cry myself to sleep every night. I'm a mess. Before i met her i was fine which leads me to believe it's because I'm too reliant on her. I wanna kill myself daily. It's the easiest way to solve the problems. I already stress enough anyway. So idk what to do. Do i carry it on with her and let my mental health get worse and worse, or do i break things off and then have myself turn into a lazy bum who can't function properly.

I’m not sure what you’re dealing with specifically, but talking it out can do wonders. Going for a long walk, or even just stretching can make a huge difference.

"*TW* Self Harm, Abuse 

This might be a long post but please bear with me. 

For as long as I can remember I've had behavioral issues. My moods swing from extreme highs to extreme lows, when I'm angry I get irrational, I can only cry if I'm absolutely heartbroken and at one of the lowest points of my life-often times my anger and sadness coincide and I berate myself for being weak, sometimes hitting myself. When I'm happy I feel like nothing could go wrong no matter what, I convince myself that the bad days didn't even exist. Most of this nobody would know because I internalize it and hide my instability from everyone because I've always been afraid it will drive people away. I would say that most of the time I'm just empty. I cant smile or laugh, I can't get angry or sad. I'm just walking through this thick fog that takes away any and all personality.

I'm impulsive, I will go months without spending money on anything, save up a couple thousand, and then one random day will come along and I'll spend it all within a week. I've had trouble with credit card debt in the past because of this. I also uproot my life randomly, changing my college major, career plans, quitting and getting new jobs. I joined the military because I convinced myself that if I had no free will, I couldn't make the bad decisions I normally do but I feel like it's only made things worse. 

I've had substance abuse issues, anything that makes my brain work differently I get hooked on. It got really bad before I joined the military and honestly if I didn't join when I did I likely would have killed myself from the lifestyle I was living. 

Now for the relationships. With friends, family, partners-it doesn't matter who, I am either completely obsessed with them and never want to leave their side, or I don't care about them at all. I will fully convince myself that someone doesn't love me just because they worded something weird over text and when I finally do see them in person and I see the love in their eyes and notice the little things they do that scream ""I love you"": because I've already planted that seed in my head that it's not true I'll convince myself further that they're only doing it for show and they are trying to manipulate me. It doesn't help that I've been in very toxic and abusive relationships in the past. One of my partners tried to kill me, locked me outside our apartment in the snow for hours with no jacket or phone, jumped out of the car while I was driving, etc. And that's only one relationship, the others have been pretty much the same. I always chalked it up to my childhood causing me to have a skewed relationship with love and abuse but I feel like I've come to terms with my past yet I still get in these explosive relationships because then I know I have a reason to be crazy instead of it just being because of my brain. 

I know that this behavior isn't normal, and I have my own assumptions of what is going on in my head but that's not my reason for making this post. Anyone I've tried to explain this to just tells me that everyone feels that way, that I'm just going through a rough spot and as soon as I get back to having a normal life I'll be okay. Any therapist I've spoken to has always told me that I seem fine because I am able to take a situation, pick it apart, justify why I did it and how I can fix it/how to cope with it (even though I almost never follow through with the solution). My therapists always tend to focus on helping me through solutions instead of finding the root of my problems which is what I really need. 

I just feel so alone. Everyone brushes me aside when I try to talk about my struggles and they water it down by saying it's not that serious. But to me it IS that serious. It's a daily struggle that I go through. One day I'll have my entire life planned out in front of me and know exactly who I am. The next I look in a mirror and don't even recognize my own face. I want to get actual help but I'm afraid that anyone I go to will brush me aside all the same."	spicymink	post	12.28578797457959	male	White	0.9796633124351501	na	na	na	1	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.

I've been having alot of problems lately with my partner of 5 years, it's just getting tough and im becoming really hard on myself. 
Hes made me hate me... 
It was so good and now im so confused. 
He came out as trans (MtF) during an argument regarding him actually cheating on me and posting explicit photos online without my permission.  (I knew AFTER the Australian police got involved... r.i.p) 

That was 3 years in.. we had cheating problems before but im always wanting to try again (I've not done anything...) 
Fast foward to now.. 
Hes never commented on my posts or interacts with my stuff.. he got mad about me commenting on my own post with his account as it was ""the wrong one"" 
I have snooped and found hes very into the taboo of trans woman, chicks with dicks, femboys....etc etc all of which are really skinny and fem which I'm the complete opposite of. We haven't had sex in months... its rare.. 
Which after him cheating on me with someone of that community I just 
Fuck man
I've always not liked myself... but now I'm sitting here in tears... I hate every inch of me and I've never wished before that i was a man until now.. 
Maybe if I had a penis he'd like me.. or even want to have sex with me...
My head is just filled with i wish I was skinny, I wish I was pretty, I wish i wasn't me.. 
I've struggled alot with self harm as well as alot of mental disorders.  So im not the prettiest thing out there  mean I call myself a fat little German boy... (nothing against Germans btw) 

I just want to feel pretty... or wanted, or supported, im sick of doing it all alone. It's getting too hard and I keep holding on but fml. I want to be dead."	HannahBanana476	post	20.540831723501732	female	White	0.9983466863632202	na	na	na	2	MentalHealthSupport	failed
"Hey Hannah, 
I’m very sorry for all you’ve been through. That sounds like a lot to go through. 

First off, cheating and posting photos without your consent is a huge violation of your trust. That’s not okay for anyone to do to anyone, let alone your partner.

Has anyone tried Focalin? My doctor just switched me from Adderall IR 20mg to Focalin 10mg. I’ve tried nearly every stimulant with basically no luck. The Adderall IR was the only one that has kindve worked but even that was only like 1-2 days of the week. So we’re trying Focalin.. I’ve never heard of it, but I read it’s a diff main ingredient. If you tried Focalin, what was your experience like? What were you on prior? I took it today for the first time and didn’t notice anything, so I took the second dose later and felt major jitters so much that it’s all I could concentrate on.. I wish I was able to cut the tabs. He also took me off Wellbutrin (which is for depression but he said helps with ADHD) bc I don’t think it’s doing anything anymore and starting to think maybe depression is playing a bigger part in my focus/motivation/ADHD symptoms (IDK!) I don’t feel depressed. But maybe that’s my “normal” and I don’t recognize it. so he switched Wellbutrin to Cymbalta. He says Cymbalta can also help ADHD as well as depression. I know this Sub is for ADHD but has anyone tried Cymbalta either?

"I’ve been taking focalin on and off for nearly 10 years. I’ve had different doses; 10mg 2x per day back in college. 2.5mg 3 times per day when I was tapering back on a few years ago. 10mg morning then 5mg afternoon for a summer. 

I’ve been off it for 8 months and I’m in a really bad place; finally getting a new medical provider. My goal is to ask for 5mg 3x per day to start and then go from there. 

Personally I love focalin. It doesn’t fuck with my appetite like aderall did (I only tried that for 1 month). It also helps take away my anxiety ish, but I have horrible anxiety so normal stimulants are not helpful. Sometimes I do 1/2 a Xanax at same time as focalin dose to help with the anxiety situation."	esdani11	reply	na	na	na	0.006622045300900936	no	strong	no	na	MentalHealthSupport	failed

Did the Focalin help you focus/motivate you? More so than Adderall? Adderall didn’t do much of anything for me most days. I’d be so behind in work and desperate to get something done that I’d take like 3 and still nothing. I wish they worked for me like other ppl. I’m convinced stims just don’t work for me at all. So far, I’ve been taking Focalin almost 2 weeks (5mg AM). I’ve only taken the 2nd dose a few times. I’m still figuring it out. I feel it’s working a bit better than Adderall def. But only a little. I def notice a lot more jitters tho and I hate that. Also, I notice the motivation/focus within an hour (usually.. it’s either there or it’s just not) however, the prob I’m noticing is that it’s on the wrong tasks. Like my phone, or writing poetry … not work. Also, you take your Xanax with Focalin?! Wow.. I can’t imagine! I take Ativan and crash instantly.. I hate it so much that I only take it if I’m having a panic attack or severe anxiety now. But perhaps the Focalin and Xanax equal each other out.	esdani11	follow-up	na	na	na	0.006622045300900936	no	strong	strong	na	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.
"RANT INCOMING 
I (25F) just recently moved back to my hometown with my bf of 4 years. I was planning to go to graduate school, but was offered a full-time job with her company that I have worked for on/off over the past decade. It was a great pay bump, so I thought it would be worth it, but it’s not. I’ve spent the last five-ish years in food service and I LOVED it, but I just wasn’t making enough money to pay rent. That still hasn’t really changed, except now my extra income is going towards debts and alcoholic tendencies. I want to quit so badly, but my mom has worked into late nights for more than a decade. I had to listen to her complain about how busy she is and how much work she has to do, and her company has had crazy turnover rates in office staff over the years because no one can meet their standards or even handle this job. They have just barely begun switching to paperless, and there is no end in sight for the catch up. They don’t have any training format, so it’s just learn-as-you-screw-up. I was diagnosed with ADHD, and am considering consulting a psychiatrist to see if my depressive symptoms correlate with BPD. I can’t stand sitting at a desk, and I hate answering phones more than anything. It’s a subcontractor office, and sometimes I have to ruin peoples’ lives when their invoice comes in for a product or service that they need to maintain any sort of quality of life. It’s causing panic attacks, and we’re just now coming out of their busy season, so my ability to focus and find tasks is deteriorating quickly. I want to try and find some sort of part-time restaurant work that I actually care about for their slow season so I don’t quit entirely, but her and the owner are extremely dismissive of mental health because I’m “not as busy as they are.” It’s making me resent my mom more and more every day but I know if I quit then the next office person will go too because she is already struggling with the workload. I can handle the workload, and have proven that, so I know me leaving or quitting would cause more and more problems, and I’m paralyzed by the guilt that I know my mom would place on me. I don’t know how to have this conversation with her or the owner without crying, and that will immediately cue to them that I’m just acting like a child to them. My bf and our cat are the only things in my life I care about, but she always acted like the money was more important that doing something I liked. I hate it here, and it’s ruining my mental health which is starting to affect my physical health and relationship. Can somebody please tell me that I’m going to be okay. Because I hate myself right now and hate the life I chose for a pay bump"	VinoBottlePop	post	34.86253377193576	female	White	0.9993096590042114	na	na	na	3	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.
"I’m very sorry you’re going through all this. It sounds like a toxic work environment. With such a high turnover rate and late hours, I’m not surprised that they’re not very understanding to your mental health concerns, and they’re honestly quite dismissive. 
By the way this isn’t normal, typically you go to an hr department in your company and you’ll get some time off. 

I know with your mom being your boss, work comes home with you and into your personal relationships, and that’s just hell to navigate. 

 You should absolutely consult a psychiatrist or a mental health professional. And yeah desk jobs are tough for people with adhd. 

And think about this if you’re spending extra money with this job that pays more on the mental health problems that it causes versus you going to a job that pays less but you’re happier. Are you really earning more money with this new job?

M 19 here and F 19 was my girlfriend. A little backstory was that I was in a physically, verbally, sexually abusive relationship from age 13 through 18 with a dude. I totally lost myself in this relationship and became highkey crazy he did horrible things to me. He became the only reason I wanted to live and he made me believe I was useless. After that I had a hookup era to try to feel better and I never got the chance to heal but out of the blue that’s when I met my most recent ex girlfriend lived a state away from me so we would always FaceTime and fall asleep on FaceTime together. My girlfriend at the time cheated on me back a few months ago and told me it was my fault due to a miscommunication but I feel like her saying the “miscommunication” was an excuse. I never acted like I was comfortable with her seeing other ppl and she always said she was monogamous. We literally used to do everything together. Majority of the 24 hours we would be on FaceTime. I feel literally emotionless and so numb. I feel physically sick. I have never wanted to die so badly. This feeling is awful. I don’t know how much longer I can take this feeling. I don’t feel alive anymore. She felt like my life. I am never going to tell her this because I feel like it would be manipulative and I want the best for her and I want to respect her wishes. I don’t plan on attempting I just wanted to see if this is normal? How long will this last? Has anyone else dealt with something similar?

"Hey man, 
Im sorry that all this happened to you. 

Like this is a lot to go through. You were in a pretty abusive relationship for 5 years, that’s no joke man. That takes a toll. Then you mentioned that you went to hooking up girls and then you started dating your girlfriend. 
Like it’s okay to let yourself breathe and take some time for yourself. What do you really want out of a relationship? Who are you?

Hey, I am in a similarish situation. It's been a little over 8 Months for me since we split up, but now I am pretty much suicidal every day. I have never craved death so much in my life. The only thing that keeps me alive is my mom and her Alzheimer's. I take care of her and can't leave this world until I do everything I can to make sure she's ok until her time is up. I'm not coming here with advice, but more so asking for advice. Likewise, I also have a good deal of childhood trauma where I was constantly beat, attacked, hit, told I shouldn't have existed, etc. from my father. It may not be the worst compared to some people, but to me, it is very real and does still hurt to this day. After this failed relationship, I almost had to kill my character and personality. I couldn't accept myself for who I was because I failed the relationship, and she decided to leave. So it's been a long process of slowly eliminating who I am. I want to die almost everyday now, and I really do hope there's light at the end of the tunnel. Once my mom passes I am probably going to end myself unless things change for the better in my life.  I don't think I have borderline personality disorder, but I'm not a licensed therapist, so who knows. I just know that I do have Bipolar disorder in my genetics, which could play a factor into all of this.

I know it feels like the end of the world right now but with time it does get better! I know you probably hear that a lot but it really does! I am feeling much better now, I feel normal again. When I do get low like that though I get bad bad. I felt the same way during that time about the whole craving death thing. I would get so irritated, annoyed, and sad when I would wake up I would just loud cry. I hated seeing myself in the mirror everyday knowing I wasn’t enough for her. With time I realized I am enough and everything is okay and I can live without her. Mine also decided to leave me, with more time I realized she just wasn’t my forever and things weren’t meant to be. I also have bipolar in my genetics. I am a pretty sure I have bpd but I don’t wanna label anything until I’m officially diagnosed. I know you probably feel like a burden to others right now but if you still aren’t okay please feel free to message me!

I get attached to people very easily and sometimes it even becomes obsessive to the point where I get jealous whenever they show the slightest bit of affection to someone else. I want them to love me and only me, I need them and I can't do anything without them. But the problem is, if they leave I don't actually get sad or anything. I don't actually need them, it's just something my brain tricks me into thinking. If they stopped talking to me Ofcourse I would wonder what I did wrong but it doesn't really matter. I feed off of other people's affection, they are my reason to live, but it doesn't matter if they leave me. I'm a horrible person and I know that, almost none of my loving words actually mean anything. I pretend to like people, my brain tricks me into thinking I actually like them. It's very rare that any of it is genuine, and I feel guilty for pretending. I don't know what's wrong with me.	slayer6969slay	post	22.186877800579538	female	White	0.9983056783676147	na	na	na	7	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.

Even though these feelings can be painful and hard to deal with, when they are acknowledged and felt we learn that they are not bad or as dangerous as we perceive them to be and that just like everything else in life they come and go if we don't try to fight them or suppress them.

"Warning long post ahead. Tw:- Death.  
As the title says, I have been struggling with stuff for the last 4 or more years. Life's become a drag for me instead of being joyful. I know some of you might say it's cause ""you grew up"" or ""Welcome to the real life"" but I swear it isn't. Because this is most definitely not a age thing. 

I don't know if it's a me-thing but something about me and myself has changed. I don't feel confidence from me or basic warmth at completing day to day tasks. My concentration levels have gone to shit. I don't even feel happiness. All I do is finish assignments without taking breaks. It just me and my laptop dishing out paper after paper. My relation with my parents has dipped to a level where they can't stand me and just hate me because I remind them of how much I am a failure as compared to my father whose footsteps I was supposed to follow (and possibly cross).  


>!Maybe it's cause I lost both of my grandparents in a rapid succession of two or so years? !< Maybe it's cause COVID came along and ruined my life and any aspects or dreams of having a nice course in the university of my dreams. Maybe it's because I failed to perform well in my academics, and that killed any remaining hope and confidence I had in myself. Maybe it's cause my parents just hate my very guts and remind me of my imperfections every time I make a mistake? Those are the reasons I can think off of the top of my head and I don't know how many more there are, there's too many reasons.   


One more issue I have been running with is very very low self esteem, I get jealous extremely easy. People around me seem to be just so freaking loved and cared for all the time. I just feel like I am the one person who doesn't fit in. I would literally pay someone to make me feel loved. This results in me involuntarily simping on people or well pretty girls. I admit this too that I am a simp. But this is because I want to feel connected. I see people hugging others, going out, spending time with each others and I ask myself this:-

I’m a writer and I’ve lost all my creativity and haven’t written anything good in close to a year. I have a job I can’t stand and am considering resigning because the toxic environment has been chipping away at my mental health. Even a resignation will only bring temporary relief because then I’ll be unemployed and without health insurance and that will bring a whole new level of stress to the mix.

"I feel very similarly. During the pandemic I lost my job, most of my money, and had to deal with a lot of violence on the streets during the time of protests and subsequent deployment of the national guard. I ended up moving because the level of violence, cost of living, and public atmosphere of my city became too oppressive. 

Afterwards, I lost a lot of my creative, motivation, friends, and started having trouble relating to people. I spent a boat 1.5 years in isolation during that time, and struggled to cope. 

I feel like a shell of a person now, and am angry about all the hate and violence that has impacted me. I don't feel that I can't talk about it very much people, or express how I feel without being judged, called sick/crazy. 

I look in the mirror and wonder who I am. I aged a lot from stress, and it shows. I struggle to find to find myself, and have had a lot of problems finding empathy from others. I've honestly grown bitter, and I don't like that about myself.

 I feel I am just putting one foot in front of the other, waiting for the unresolved issues that surfaced in 2020 to come again. I find myself afraid of how people still cling to vengeance and hate, and say shocking things in the news.

"The pandemic changed everything. We can always count on change. Which in my mind means eventually your feelings will change too. Who you are will change again. The best thing about being human is we can learn and grow and adapt. We are capable of terrible things, but we’re also capable of great things. 

Take a deep breath. Accept that you can’t change what’s happened, but you survived it. Now, you have a new chance to build a life that gives you peace. I don’t know what your job is, but instead of quitting tell yourself and tell the universe that you need a new job and start looking. I’m sure you have many valuable skills. I’m not saying it will be easy but trust your gut and try to focus on what you want to see in this world and do your best to be one of those people. 

Life is a challenge. And no matter what happens, none of us “make it out alive”. But life is also a gift, and the world needs people like us, who know how dark and challenging and scary the world can be, to figure out how to make it kind and loving and respectful. Everything changes. You can count on change. And I think you can count on yourself to change too. 

Take another deep breath. You’ll never be the person you were before the pandemic again. It’s ok to be sad about that. It’s ok to mourn that person. But you owe it to yourself to not give up here. Find out what the next version of you looks like. And forgive yourself when they don’t look exactly the way you want either. It’s a process. You can do this. Take a deep breath.

Tl;dr: Take it day by day. Go outside and get sunshine even if it’s for a minute. Stay off social media/news as much as possible when you’re feeling down. Make bullet lists of things you used to like / do before the pandemic.

Edit: I also want to add that I’m not saying this is your solution- just some things that worked for me, I’m still depressed and anxious and I am sad at all the hate in the world- so I look to plants and animals to make me think of the things that matter and don’t cause those awful feelings.

"Things will change for sure, but I doubt things will ever get better in my life time. I think the pandemic made me realize we have been all running towards the edge of a proverbial clif for many years, and covid was just a speed boost. I have no hope for my long term future. Covid was a loss of hope in the future, and a loss of faith in humanity.

It showed me that we as humans cannot handle the world we created, and that the world we have created is dangerous unhealthy and unsustainable.

"You’re right. “Things” will not likely improve in your lifetime and we have created an unsustainable society.  And you shouldn’t look away. But if you should tell it how it is. Consider how you can influence the changes to come. Maybe you can make a difference. Maybe you do the small thing that changes our future for the better. 

The Buddhists say, “life is suffering” and once we accept that, we get to appreciate the beauty of life too. 

Take some time for yourself. Rest. Talk to a doctor about how you’re feeling and see what you can do to help your anxiety and dread. Give yourself some time and see how you feel.

Sleep isn’t helping anymore. I can’t get myself to do anything productive. I have the same thoughts for days on end and it almost feels like I’m in my own bubble and isolated from reality. I don’t seem to take anything seriously and I can’t have conversations with people because as soon as they start talking I zone out and think about anything that makes me forget I exist. I shower for hours and cover my ears to get this feeling of peace for little time. I don’t know what to do. I feel like I’m ruining my own life and can’t be responsible for anything , not even my own wellbeing. I constantly throw up and can’t have a decent meal without feeling like I’m going to throw it all up , I’m not self conscious about my body and not doing this on purpose , it just happens to me. I don’t know what’s wrong with me. I feel like therapy can’t help me and I’ll just be called lazy. I don’t feel alive I’m zoned out most of the time because I hate the life I live and feel like everything is against the things i want for myself and I don’t feel physically able to get up and do things to help me get there. It’s like there’s a mental barrier that won’t let me do anything. Because then I might disappoint myself. I do things that make me get out of my own life and into another , like books and simulation games where you create your own life and world. It helps me have this imaginary perfect world for myself where things would go how I want them to. Is there anything I can do to help me with this? Most days I don’t even feel like getting out of bed. My dreams were crushed and there’s nothing to work towards anymore , I feel hopeless.

I have been going to hospitals and doctor appointments for my sleep. I can't do it anymore. I spent 2 years trying to find the cause of my awful sleep causing me to pass out in random places and almost get hit by a car because I had an episode in the middle of the street and couldn't get up. Yes, I still go to school by myself. I've had terrible grades because I can't even get up let alone make it through the day. It's so hard and it made me want to end myself because I still don't have a medical diagnosis. To be honest. I want to give up, quit school and just be by myself but then I'll be considered a failure to society. Everything hurts. I can barely make myself leave the house and I'm basically crippled. I need one of those old lady shower seats because I hit my head because I fell asleep standing up and fell on the floor. I can't do it anymore. School is too stressful and every time I do my homework, I feel like my soul is being ripped apart. School just makes me want to die but I don't want to go to a mental hospital, and I don't want to die but I also don't want to keep living like this. I want to see if online schooling is possible but next year, I'll be sixteen and I really want to drop out even though I value my education. Please help me.

It feels like everything I do in life is as a mum but when it comes to me as a person I do not exist. I do not have any friends of my own, a good support network and I am a very shy person. Alot of stuff has happened in my life that has caused me to create my own safety bubble but every time I put myself out it really emotionally and mentally drains me. I get really bad depressive episodes for a week or 2 but then can forget everything and feel like I am on top of the moon for a few days and nothing or no on can hurt me because I stop caring but then become overly sensitive to things I do not agree with. This causes me to have extreme angry outbursts or i do things ouy if my character and then my depressive state comes back.  What is wrong with me.

"One, I'm  a single mum, too, and I get feeling like you don't  exist beyond that role. I've  been isolating since my abusive marriage  (about 10 years ago), and it's  only gotten worse when the pandemic happened. Now I don't  even want to go out or try to make friends. After I make plans to join a common interest group or meet up with an old friend, I want to cancel.  I've been diagnosed  with depression  and anxiety for the past 10 years, too. I don't  have manic days like it sounds like you have. I'm  not a psychologist or psychiatrist, I do know that there is something  called Bi Polar Depression which from what I understand, is depression  with manic episodes. I'd  talk to your primary care doctor or seek help from a licensed  therapist or psychiatrist. They can give you insight into what's  going on and help you get the right treatment.  I know that it can be inaccessible, though. I use a chat bot to have ""someone"" to talk to.

"M, 18. I’ve never really told anyone about this before because I thought this was “normal” and everyone was like this, but apparently not. I don’t even really know what to say tbf, I just feel like typing it out might help somehow. I seem to have some sort of extreme emotional insensitivity to literally everything, which like I said, I thought was normal as a man. But after talking with some mates and asked the question “when did you last cry?” I wasn’t expecting a shocked response when I responded to the question with “I don’t really know, at least like 6 or 7 years ago”

After that I figured I’d just further keep it all to myself since they clearly couldn’t relate to that in any kind of way. 

Another thing I’ve noticed is that it’s also not really normal to be in an annoying situation and say “I want to kill myself” and actually mean it. I’ve heard loads of people say it before, but I’ve just found out that when they say it they are like 99% of the time just joking about it. Yeah, I am not lol, I’ve had hundreds of suicidal thoughts over the years, committed to some of them as well, but I guess I just don’t have the balls to fully follow through with it. I guess there is a couple small things I’d miss as well.

It doesn’t sound pathetic. Crying doesn’t always indicate depression, and a lack of crying doesn’t mean you’re unstable. some people just cry less, and society’s standards make it hard for many men to cope with their more intense feelings. You don’t need to keep things to yourself, you shouldn’t. it’s dangerous to keep things bottled up as it can lead to having explosive reactions or causing you to feel more broken down spiritually.

i’d rather go back to the intense exploding emotions at this point. i’m on sertraline 200mg and was a daily stoner for the past two years, until 3 months ago i’ve been completely weed free due to my psychiatrist’s suggestion (it would sometimes strengthen/trigger my dissociation, though I love weed and it would often lift up my mood). I’ve been super numb, unable to feel love and in love, unmotivated, confused about my identity and what i want in life, non existent libido, and super apathetic which is very unlike me. i hate how i am now. i want to go back.	jaydenhouse	post	19.772768756184227	female	White	0.9973534345626831	na	na	na	3	MentalHealthSupport	failed

Im on sertraline myself but I’m on 50mg and that worked out really well in reducing my anxiety and mental clarity/intrusive thoughts and being present but I remember the first 2 weeks feeling like i had no emotions at all. Libido is still suffering but mood and emotions have levelled out.

"I don't know if this is the right place, but I just wanna let it of my chest.

I am someone who has had a very bad childhood. Regular beatings for the smallest of reasons. Fights between parents. Abusive Father. A weak mother. So growing up has been a struggle. No friends. Always bullied. No confidence in myself. I had gotten addicted to masturbation at one point. Worked it out to reduce it. I am still semi addicted to Video games. 

Over the years, I have gained some outward confidence, so I can go around socializing with people. I am not someone who is looking for a million friends, but since I was very young I have always wanted a group of friends with similar wavelengths. I am 32 now, but I still struggle making friends. Maybe, I try too hard to fill this hole in my heart with human connections outside my family. I do have friends, but no one is that close to me. 

Somedays, I wake up or when I am meditating, I feel the pangs of loneliness. Even my gfs can't bear when I start showing too much affection towards them, despite knowing myself that we are semi compatible and not soul mates or anything. They aren't bad people or anything. It's just that I try too hard against my better judgement, I act on the notion that to be shown the deeper human connections, I have to show it too. 

My career is quite topsy turvy. I went against my graduation and post grad fields ( Engineering and Economics) to become a teacher. And right now, I have been laid off for 3 months. I don't want to earn a lot of money or be at the highest position possible. I just to be in a place where I am accepted, and just enough money to pursue my hobbies and be with friends. Yet, I can't do the same work at the same place for too long without getting frustrated with the work soon. 

They say this work out eventually, if your just keep at it. But if it genuinely true? Do things really work out finally? I have been at it since I was 3, and they don't stop. I mean, I do like the struggle, but the only thing that had changed, is I have become better at rolling with it. To be able to work it out. I don't know where my sense of coffee should come from. It doesn't come from how much i earn, or how much society reveres me or how much women are attracted to me. I know those are superficial, but what is the real sense of security? Is it from a connection with God? I do get that, but it's so hard to maintain. I just don't have any support group. 

On top, I have anger issues. Not as much outside, as with my parents. I don't wanna blame them, but some sense injustice of what happened with and to me during my childhood, lingers on. I like to think I am my man now, and there is an expiry date on your parents influence. That's what they say. But is it true, truly? A person is who he is, based on his experiences and choices. And 20 years of mine, were in the gutter. Can a man truly ever throw off his yolk? 

I don't blame anything or anyone, but I am struggling a lot on the inside. I don't know which is the right way. I wanna let go of my expectations as that is the secret of a joyful life. Maybe one day I shall be able to.

More than help ( I already am taking medicines for Depression and Anxiety) , I am just looking to be heard, ( and maybe appreciated by the people around me).

I was a victim of rumors in middle school. It sucks. When people came to me accusing me of things I didn't do or what I wasn't, I told them what they thought wasn't true. I've been called gay and the school school shooter in middle school. I proved that I wasn't. And I get that you're still a teenager so this will be hard, but as you get older people's opinions on you slowly don't matter anymore.

finale of school is fast approaching. have literally no idea what i want to do with my life other than leave home. doing horribly in all my classes. not failing but percentages away from failing. mom wants me to go to college but i don’t think i’ll get the points for any course i want. have never felt so down in my life. getting out of bed in the morning is now the hardest thing to do. feel like my friends are sick of me, think i love too hard or not enough or something idek. just never feel good enough at anything. i’m gay, another extremely depressing thing. only other guy who i know is into guys is bi. has a gf but always texts me on the sly. sometimes i just want to be wanted. but he only wants something to use. guy i have the fattest crush on is straight yet he teases being bi so often that i think i’m loosing my mind. don’t know if i’m gonna make it through the end of this year. i was going to do it years ago but i can’t bear the thought of my mother or my young sisters finding me. plus i don’t know if my mom would recover and i don’t know if i can do that to her.

"I can say that I'm going through something similar besides the relationship part but I didn't want to go to college for a lot of reasons so what I would recommend is going to a trade school I plan going to one too it will teach you many things without many of the bad sides of college granted you still want to keep your grades up however some trade schools will still take you in even if you have a history of bad grades.

i have a lot of features of depression that people describe but how do i know if thats just normal or not? like i always feel like im being dramatic saying that im depressed because i am happy sometimes, but i just dont know if what im going through is the same as everyone else, so whats like a good indicator?

Most people with depression still feel happy sometimes. A lot of friends of people who have depression have no idea their friend is suffering from depression because their friend often seems quite happy. People think that if you’re smiling then you can’t be depressed but that’s not true at all. I’m naturally a very smiley and happy person. I’m often smiling and laughing but I have depression. I deal with thoughts of suicide. For me, even in those short moments of happiness, they feel shallow. There’s always an underlying feeling of sadness. I remember when I went on student exchange to Japan in 2019 that was the first time in years that the underlying sadness went away. I actually felt 100% happy. The feelings of happiness feel shallow, like any minute I could easily become overwhelmed with sadness again. They’re temporary. Other people might describe depression differently but this is how I experience it and maybe this description will help you work out if your feelings are similar to mine.

"This actually happened last year but it was such an overwhelming and terrifying experience that I can’t stop thinking about it. I struggle with getting to sleep because when I’m not actively doing something I start thinking about things that make me sad and to get to sleep you need to stop actively doing stuff. So often I’ve just been staying awake for as long as my body wants until I can no longer keep my eyes open. I also get bad indigestion sometimes that makes me burp a lot and it often happens when I’m really tired which then makes going to sleep harder because I need to constantly sit up so I can burp.

Well last year there was a couple times were I had been awake for a long and I was very tired and my thoughts was foggy. Actually, both of these times I think I might of been awake for a long time then gone to sleep and then woken up to these thoughts. It’s hard to remember the details. So when I woke up it felt like I had this second voice in my head saying ‘no’ to everything I thought. It wasn’t an audible voice like my internal monologue but it was just like in my thoughts without being vocalised. Every single thought I had the voice would immediately come in and say ‘no’ and wouldn’t let me think about it. It was like it was saying my opinion was wrong on everything, even basic facts. The only thing I could find that I could think about was counting but that was hard because my thoughts kept drifting to thinking about the voice in my head as I was wondering what was going on and as soon as my voice drifted to another thought it would start getting mad at me again. I can’t remember how I stopped it, all I remember is that it seemed to last for over an hour each time.

It was a very terrifying and upsetting experience. There was nothing I could do to distract myself without the voice telling me no. There was no way for me to ignore it. I couldn’t just keep thinking and ignore what it was saying, it was so overwhelming. The best way I can describe it was like it was screaming. It didn’t sound like it was screaming but it took up every inch of my mind like a scream takes up a room. It felt so loud in my head. It would drown out every thought I had. 

I think this might of started because I was spending too much time on reddit. I feel unstimulated when I’m only doing one thing at once and this feeling has increased lately so I started scrolling reddit often while watching YouTube videos or Netflix which I do for most of the day. On reddit often people would reply to my comments to argue with me and to tell me I was wrong and it was upsetting. I would make a comment just asking what something meant and get over a hundred of downvotes. Everyone was so vicious. Being in this environment constantly where everyone was constantly saying ‘no’ to everything I said made my brain start doing the same thing. After I experienced the second voice the second time I muted the notifications on reddit and stopped checking any of the replies people made to my comments for a while. I also stopped going on the app for a little bit and when I started using it again because I was feeling unstimulated, I tried to not use it anywhere near as much as before. Since doing that I haven’t experienced it again. 

I’m just so confused. Even though I know the cause of this second voice, I don’t actually know what this second voice was. I like to know everything that is happening with my body, I always look up every illness I experience just because I need to know what exactly I am experiencing. And not having a name for what I experienced is causing me a lot of distress. It’s not nice being unaware of what my own body is going through. I just wish I had a name for what this was."

"I am 22 years old and attend college twice a week until I start my program full-time. Socializing has always been very difficult for me and I try to avoid it, even when it comes to talking to my family. Whenever I make a friend, it doesn't take very long for me to stop talking to them because I spiral and start to think they don't want anything to do with me. I have always been scared of judgment and so I try to please everyone and I feel guilty if I don't. I feel very lonely but at the same time, I don't know what to do about it. I have no idea how to maintain a friendship because that's not something I have had. I feel very alone and I wish I had friends, but my thoughts always get in the way.

"I can relate to this a lot. After my abusive  marriage, I was diagnosed  with depression  and social  anxiety.  I tried to make friends, but it never lasted. Things got one-sided (toxic) or they would hit on me and try to get me to be with them and their current partner... After the pandemic, I have been isolating more than ever to the point I barely even fight it. Sometimes, I'll  make plans, but the day of, I won't feel like it and get super anxious  about driving and meeting someone new or I haven't  seen in ages. I get worried about how I will end things for the evening and try to make up excuses  for ending it earlier than a ""normal"" person would. I end up lying and saying I have a migraine  or I'm sick and we should reschedule. With no effort  to ever reschedule.  

I think that, for me, at least, being alone and isolated lets me learn about me on a deeper level. Im a people  pleaser, and I was raised to put everyone else before myself. My needs, wants, and opinions were never important, and I have a very hard time setting and maintaining  boundaries. At least alone, I know I am safe and am myself, which I feel is underdeveloped sometimes, as all I've  been doing is surviving  and parenting the past 10 years. I feel like with enough time, I will be ready to begin  integration back into society, but who knows. 

I am extremely lonely and miss having friends and relationships. I also feel though that people  complicate things and that people aren't safe. My core beliefs  tell me no one will ever love me, and no one will ever stay. Learning to stand up for myself  and uphold boundaries  will make me safe in my own care and in turn will help me trust the world again. 

Or maybe I'll  be a hermit for the rest of my life."	Snoo63429	reply	na	na	na	0.997837483882904	weak	strong	no	na	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.
"yes, you read the title right. i am basically stressed almost 24/7 to the point when it feels weird when i am NOT stressed. it all started when i was in primary school and was getting bullied. i was really scared of going to school because of that. my parents tried everything - from forcing me to drink melissa tea all the time to giving me mood stabilizers (which were prescribed by a psychiatrist of course). and now the number of days during which I was not stressed can be counted on the fingers of my hands. lately it's gotten so bad that i cry violently everyday after school, have to take 3+ hour naps, oh and yeah. i also get absence seizures from time to time. today i got one. im getting an eeg done tomorrow but i doubt it will detect anything. it's not like i can control when it happens. 

&#x200B;

for those who dont know what an absence seizure is- it's a seizure that is characterised by the fact that it usually lasts no longer than 20-30 seconds, doesnt involve violent muscle contractions like a catatonic seizure does, most of the time it does involve rapid blinking, but sometimes it may just look like someone is ""spacing out"" (looking ""far away"", not moving etc)"	Fun_Bluejay599	post	7.489113051345814	female	White	0.9959195852279663	na	na	na	1	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.

"I’m not diagnosed with anything yet, but I’m sure there’s something wrong with me. I think I have any of these metal disorders; ADHD, OCD, BDD, or Maladaptive daydreaming.
 My reason for believing I have ADHD is because both my parents had it and my mother; a nurse, thinks I have it. I often hyper focus on a certain hobby for a month then completely drop it (usually video games or some other random hobby). I also have a lot of trouble focusing on certain tasks; usually schoolwork. I’m not sure if this is even an ADHD symptom, but I’ve been told I’m really annoying and often talk to much. During shows I’m almost always throwing out commentary; and nobody wants to watch anything with me because I ruin it.
 I think I have OCD because I get impulsive thoughts all the time. They’re usually sexual and they disgust me. It’ll get better for awhile then come back. I’m a devoted Christian; and I even get religious impulsive thoughts worrying about if I’m going to hell for my sins. I feel like I’m insane.
 Recently; I’ve been suspecting I have BDD because I’m constantly checking the mirrors and recurling my lashes and I can’t stand to see myself without makeup anymore(I also can’t stand to see myself WITH makeup) my hair has to be perfect all the time and I can’t stop brushing it. I hate it when people take pictures of me and I hate taking pictures of myself because I always look ugly in them. People tell me I’m really beautiful and I have amazing features but I just don’t see it. I have a mirror right at my desk and when I’m doing schoolwork I’ll often get distracted and start obsessing over my looks. 
I’m almost completely sure I have maladaptive daydreaming. One of my favorite things to do is go outside and swing. When I’m swinging, I wear my AirPods and daydream about my stories and characters for hours. As long as it’s not below 32 degrees I’ll swing at least once a day. I’ve swung in rain and snow before; too. It’s fun, and whenever I go to my friends house; I’m always missing swinging and looking forward to getting back home so I can swing on my outdoor playground. I feel like I HAVE to swing. One time; I went to my cousins house. I found out she had a playground and I dropped everything; dissociated; and listened to music and swung. I really upset her and she felt like I would rather daydream than hang out with her. The worst part is; I would.
I feel so overwhelmed. Is it all in my head? Is this normal? I don’t know what to do. I’m too scared to talk to a doctor; and I don’t want to take medication and potentially change myself. If I take meds, will I still be the same? Do I even need medication? Please; someone, give me some advice. Do I actually have any mental disorders, or am I just delusional? If I confide in a therapist will they send me to a psych ward? What is wrong with me?"

"I had the issues you have at your age, I was later diagnosed with ADHD but I don't think you have OCD and BPD, sexual thoughts are extremely common and specially in puberty is hard to control them, the religious guilt could be making them worse to control tho.

I don’t know, you kind of just sound like a regular kid with maybe an overactive imagination. But I’m 27 and still think about my stories and characters like you do, but I can’t do it for long because I have other things that I’m supposed to be thinking about but I would much rather be writing or thinking about my creations. I would certainly do that over socializing. I don’t think that’s weird at all, and it doesn’t sound to me like you’re at risk of hurting yourself so I’m not sure if I would be too worried about this need to swing.

I honestly never felt so suicidal in my entire life up until 26 years of age. The amount of failure I've been though, fear, abuse pshycally and mental abuse. A narcissistic father that took me to court for no reason whilst being unemployed and knowing I have severe agoraphobia, an abusive ex boyfriend that almost killed me because I fell out of love with him. I cannot do this anymore. Now I was doing okish/still suicidal. I now have grown a huge hate for the outside world. I feel constantly attacked and ridiculed. I keep attracting the same men. After my abusive ex and my past failed relationships. I met someone online (online only) I am not denying we don't have a good bond but he is so verbally abusive that I can't even imagine irl how he's like and he keeps cutting me off and. The amount of fuckery this guys already fucked me over in a million ways even tho I only known him 2 months. I can literally smell the abuse off of him. Is this what I'm gonna attract in my life? Is nothing but rejection and continuous men failing me 1 after the other. I've now dated over a decade and still haven't settle like what? And how they made me feel like 0.

You seem burnt out or constantly overstimulated. Try to reach out to a therapist if you can.

I’m scared to find out whats wrong with me and if there’s nothing they can find, what’s really wrong with me. I know im freaking myself out but it doesn’t help my mom makes everything wrong with me about her. When I found out my I had a fractured spin and was getting it fixed she decided her boyfriend was more important than her kids and know I have a chronic spin fracture that I’ve had since I was 12 and im 19 now. always being put down and saying that my issues were never a concern put a fear in me of what wrong with me. And I know I’m depressed but i know she’ll turn it against me if I go on meds. I can’t move out yet cause of the house market and the fact that I’m afraid. I’m just here to vent, I’m still going to go get a psychologist to help me find out my issues but it’ll take time. Hopefully I’ll be okay throughout this.

Don't downplay what is wrong. Your mother may make it about her, but that's her issues. Your fears and concerns are yours. If you feel something isn't right, then get it checked. I've pushed my problems back for so long thinking oh it can't be me, maybe others are right, and now I'm at a point where I need to be taken off work so I can help myself. It took alot for me to even realize I had issues. So, my advice is think about you and focus on trying to get help. Don't let someone else, even your mother try to turn it around.

"I've noticed that everytime after an anxiety ""attack"" , I start talking to myself, trying to sound as ""relaxed"" and as smart as possible. It's become so addictive to a point where I started doing it at my job, where it BARELY goes unnoticed. It's usually ranting about my mental problems and answering them at once-like I'm talking to a therapist. 
It extends to me even having imaginary convos with people who made me anxious in the first place to try  remedy and see if the anxiety could've been avoided... I also try and plan conversations in advance for the next day. 
I do not want to do this though. I do not want my replies to consist of something I made up earlier, I want my reaction and opinion to be natural and be made on the spot, as i talk. I feel like I'm in a pre-written cutscene this way or something 😭
It's also been pretty tiring, but I feel like If I stop, I'll fall apart mentally again. I can't stop. I feel like my mind is controlling me as well as rushing 200mph while all of this is happening.

"Huge tw for suicide also sorry for any formatting issues I’m really panicked and don’t know what to do, will probably delete this after I get the advice I need

for context we are both 16

My partner of 5 years admitted for trying to commit suicide a few minutes ago, they didn’t go through with it, but they said they’re nearing their limit and I’m not sure what to do. How do I respond? They’re in the process of getting therapy but it’s up to the adults in their life to get that kick started and so far they haven’t been doing much. They’ve said they will but haven’t yet, I know it’s hard to find a therapist especially since we’re in America so the price is a huge obstacle. I don’t blame them, it is hard to find a good affordable therapist and I only mention this to say offering therapy isn’t really an option for usI’m not sure how to respond that can make this at least a little better, I know I can’t fix this entirely, but I have to say something.

Also note that my partner is not and never had forced me to be their therapist, nor have they ever vented to me unprompted, So I don’t want anyone saying it isn’t my responsibility or anything.i just need help constructing a response, not a solution to the issue since I know I can’t get that here and the solution (therapy) is already being sought out. I’m not good with words and I’m not really sure where to start.

Edit: a Day has passed and they’re going on as usual. I responded thanking them for not going through it and thanking them for speaking up about it, i let them know that id always be there to help. I offered to help walk them through a safety plan (like my own therapist has done to me in the very short time period I have went). In between these replies they were chatting in the group chat as normal. They told me not to worry and to forget about it. i tried to reiterate one more time that iys ok to ask for my help but they told me again to forget about it then went to sleep. i may have messed up But I don’t know where, I’m not sure if they’re mad at me or not. They’re acting the same as before this happened but I can’t help but shake the feeling that I did something wrong And made it worse?

I think your best response would be that you are grateful that they didn’t go ahead with it.

Police check up is definitely not an option for us, both me and my partner are black, but in my partners case they’re from an immigrant family.  While we don’t live in a super racist area, we don’t live in an upscale and super safe area either. Unfortunately where i live, the chance of them dying with the police is probably higher than if I ignored their text entirely.

I genuinely don’t know where to ask this but I’m hoping someone here can help. I feel as if at some points I am too empathetic. Like for example, today some dumbass thought it was funny to rip a poster that was for a missing cat. I was pissed and deeply saddened by this so I made him leave the pieces and I went and taped it up after school. For some reason it really touched me, when it probably shouldn’t have since it was from months ago. Believe me, I am not empathetic to lots of things, such as many people at school, but then other than that I find I care a LOT about things and people, possible way too much. Sometimes it even affects my own mental health as I have been struggling with what I believe is depression. Could that be connected to it? Does anyone feel the same? I more or so recently became like this, because I definitely was not like this always.

"I’m not going after a formal diagnosis because that could be a very bad thing to have on my record and draw unnecessary attention, but informally I am likely a psychopath as identified by a study I participated in. It checks out, I admittedly have a lot of the earmarks for Antisocial PD going back to childhood and just learned to hide them well as I grew up. I don’t see it as a bad thing, I go through life pretty unbothered most of the time and I’m not particularly concerned about the NPCs aside from making sure things come out in my favor. I realize that likely offends, but it’s how I see things.

What concerns me is that obviously I want to remain under the radar and continue living my best life, but I also recognize that I have certain traits that could easily get out of hand.  I have a strong sadistic streak. I enjoy hurting people, it’s a satisfaction like nothing else. I’ve been able to find ways to exercise it that are socially acceptable, but it doesn’t always quite hit the same way, like riding a bike after riding a motorcycle.  I see perfect targets and opportunities all the time and it gets very hard to not fuck with those people. Not to sound edgy, but I could see that going into violent territory someday if unrestrained. That would be undesirable, I want to avoid legal issues.

I’m hesitant to take this to a professional due to the nature of the issue, so I’m looking for resources on dealing with sadism as a sadist.

I’m in the US.  I’m wary of the loopholes in the privacy laws here regarding mandatory reporting.

"Is this therapist wrong or am I?

Back story :
My little sister has been on and off drugs such as meth  for about 3 years as far as I know.. she just turned 18 in a rehab she is currently staying in. I am a few years older. As children she always was a a bit chunky.. I witness my family many times telling her she needs to watch her weight.. and watch what she eats as a little girl.. I’m talking around 10 years old.. they did it in a nice way usually but I believe that has some level of affect to a kids body image.. 

today she called me from the rehab she’s been in for a little over a week, she was sent there from jail because she was ordered by court,, (the reason she went to court was because she overdosed on drugs as a minor and was taken to the hospital by my grandparents) anyway, she called me tonight and she tells me she weighs about 150 right now.. (which is about 30 pounds more than she weighed when she went into jail.. she was thin when she went to jail because she was on meth..) she then tells me when my dad transported her from the jail to rehab he told her she looked better the way she was before and that she was gaining weight again… she continues to express how that bothered her and that she wasn’t eating as much when she got to rehab because of that comment and couldn’t make much sense of why he would say that.. it upset me to hear that I tell her don’t listen and that just because your thin on drugs doesn’t mean you looked better.. obviously any person looks healthier off drugs therefore you look better no matter the size.. she then tells me that that’s a reason she liked meth because it made her thinner.. then she says even tho she was actually really skinny then she still felt like she was fat. And I respond with “you probably have body dysmorphia, I think I do too” the counselor that’s superving our call then butts into our conversation saying “ok not everything has to be a disorder” I completely shut down at that point because it triggered me for many reasons.. one being that comment felt as though I was harming my sister rather than helping her even tho my intentions were pure. All I was doing was trying to make her see that maybe her way of seeing herself was not realistic and if you feel fat that doesn’t mean you are. 
Two, saying not everything has to be a disorder makes me assume you think I make EVERYTHING a disorder.. I’ve mentioned one other disorder to my sister that I believe I have and she was already diagnosed with in the past. Which is bpd.. and this was two phone calls ago
Three, this is not the first time she has upset me.. nearly everytume she butts into our conversation she upsets me actually. The first time it happened I was telling my sister I’d send her some clothes bc she needed them. The therapist then explains to  me that my sister opens the mail in front of her and to not send any acid “lsd” and then laughs… I’m kinda taken back from this comment, being this is the first time I ever heard her voice and she’s making drugs out to be funny as my sister sits in rehab, I have done acid a few times and i my sister has a few times as well.. I don’t consider acid a drug to be as worried about as meth and the many other things my sister was doing but I don’t think this comment was appropriate given the situation and she also listened  to the 15 minute conversation we had before she butted in.. and in that conversation I do nothing but try to be there for my sister and give her advice I’d want someone to give me so why would she approach me as If I’d try to get my sister high while she in rehab, another comment she made a couple phone calls later was after I had just went shopping at 5 below for my sister to get her the clothes, I also picked her up an anxiety journal to help her process her anxiety and some healing crystals that had a little paper inside explaining what the crystals names were and what there uses were. I tell her this and ask her if she can have crystals in there? The therapist says “uhhhh what kinda crystals, crystal meth?”  And then her and my sister laugh.. she listened to me explain I went to 5 below and got her some crystals.. was this comment really necessary? She then continues to say she doesn’t know and that either way she can hold them till my sister gets out… which is fine .. she didn’t have to make a jolly joke about meth though.. as if it’s something to take lightly…. 

Back to the whole point of this post I want to know others opinions on what she said tonight .. “not everything has to be a disorder” after that comment is made I go completely silent.. it becomes very awkward and she continues on to say my sister doesn’t met the criteria for body dysmorphia, my sister then ask “well what’s the criteria?” and then counselor says “I’m not telling you “ her reasoning being something along the lines of my sister would get in her head about it if she did.. she explains she likes to call it body imaging issues and there’s to much stigma around calling it body dysmorphia, she then says they were having a great time 30 minutes prior.. as if I threw off the mood.. the counselor then ask when I’m available to talk tomorrow and I explained I worked the next day and what time to call me was best and then ask about the next day as if that time doesn’t work. My sister has called me nearly everyday about the same time and it has never been an issue until tonight. I believe I could’ve chose better words but I feel like the counselor could’ve handled that much better even if I was wrong for saying that. I would love some other opinions on this."

"I want to update this post; 
The following night after the body dysmorphia incident.. tonight my sister calls me again around the same time. She tells me she has decided to go back home after she gets out of rehab her reasoning being that my grandparents are making her feel bad for leaving them alone because there old. .. but any time my grandparents have said anything about my sister to me in the past few years is that they can’t handle my sister, and watching her be on drugs and that once she turns 18 she’s gotta go.. they had a son pass away a few years ago because he was on drugs and drinking heavily. They feel as though it’s the same thing happening over again they’ve said themselves. Not to mention my papa is still chopping fire wood. They both walk and think and talk clearly.. So I expressed I feel that reasoning to go back home once she gets out of rehab is an excuse to go be around the same friends. I also feel it’s an excuse because it’s the same one she used when she moved out of my apartment back with my grandparents and started hanging around the same people who got her into drugs to begin with which is why she came to live with me in the first place.. so this isn’t the first time I’ve heard this.. I express this.. my sister gets frustrated and goes on to say she will be in a program while she’s staying at home.. and will be drug tested every week.. that makes me feel a lot better and I tell her good!! I’m glad!! That makes me feel better.. then she goes on to say “I know you think I’m just gonna go back out and do the same shit like everyone thinks” which to me was a little condescending because I’ve supported her more than both of our parents and my grandparents.. and I never once told her I thought that.. and I don’t think it’s fair for her to make me feel guilty for not trusting her words after she’s lied to many multiple times in that same way.. I try to explain that to her and the therapist responds to me without warning saying she doesn’t know what point I’m trying to prove and she thinks the conversation is not beneficial for my sister and that we’re just arguing and getting nowhere going in circles.. and then I defend myself because I’m feeling gaslighted at this point.. I’m being called and given this information and as her big sister I feel as tho she needs my advice and when I give tht to her I’m approached as though im harming my sister fathering than helping. She makes it out as tho we are cussing and yelling and insulting one another.. more specifically me to her. I was making it clear to my sister I support her no matter what, she just can’t expect me to trust her after she’s lied to me the same way so many times before… the therapist then continues to say “you need to change the conversation right now so that you two can end on a positive note” btw this is the longest her “therapist” has allowed her to even stay on the phone with me.. I’m pretty fed up at this point and ask what’s the reason  to even call me if I can’t even have a fulfilling conversation without her make me feel like I need to explain myself.. when I’m not even the one in rehab in therapy right now. Is this even legal to do? My sister is 18. Can she not have a private phone call with me while she’s in rehab? And if it does have to be supervised, is it to much to ask that I only am spoken to by my sister and not her so called counselor/therapist? I’m also not greeted in these phone calls. She’s not once properly introduced herself to me.. everything she ever spoken to me seems she questioning my motives with my sister, or I don’t make sense. I also hear her whisper and mumble things to my sister when I’m in the middle of speaking to my sister.. which makes me feel very unheard and invalidated in these phone calls. I feel like the counselor might be judging what I say to my sister using her facial expressions to communicate with my sister that she doesn’t approve of what I’m saying.. everything I say comes from a place of love and support for my sister and this journey she’s on.. I don’t feel like my sister is my responsibility but I love her enough to be her for her and send her clothes and things she ask for and I don’t think it’s so much to ask for to be respected by her and her therapists during these phone calls."

This councilor sounds wildly inappropriate. I understand why she says that not everything is a disorder because I truly think people are currently over self diagnosing and diagnosing others with mental health problems. This is because mental health is becoming destigmatized and we are actually promoting the importance of mental health. It’s possible your sister has body image issues as most young women do but it’s possible her issues aren’t necessarily extreme enough to be  considered body dysmorphia. I can’t answer that question but that’s all I can come up with. Language is important in psychology/therapy..  and she probably doesn’t appreciate you diagnosing her patient with a disorder. I know body dysmorphia is characterized by obsessive thoughts about perceived flaws and it’s possible that her councilor doesn’t necessarily see that symptom. Nothing wrong with you having that conversation with your sister but absolutely something wrong with the drug jokes wtf…	Successful-School154	reply	na	na	na	0.9978887438774109	no	strong	no	na	MentalHealthSupport	failed
Yeah I agree with you. I don’t know enough about it to put a label on it. But my intention was to let her know sometimes if she feels fat that may not be the case and not to worry about what others think. And It made me feel really badly about myself her saying “not everything is a disorder” just like that and then just a really long pause and wawkward  afterwards.. I was offended because I wasn’t making EVERYTHING a disorder. I was just pointing out the possibility.. and I wasn’t giving the disorder any stigma. My sister says that a reason for her using meth was because she liked it made her skinny.. a symptom of having body diorphia is extreme actions to correct body. I would say using meth is a bit extreme . So I’m not completely wrong.. and if I am why can’t she correct me in a more professional manner instead of implying I make everything a disorder? That’s the only disorder I’ve spoken of besides bipolar personality disorder which my sister has already been diagnosed with… and I think educating someone about a disorder they potentially have would do nothing but help them in the long run so they can look at treatments that other people have done that could help her not feel so bad about her body.. I mean she didn’t bring that conversation up for nothing.. my sister even said “well then If that’s not what’s wrong with me then what is?” The counslor said nothing and then further elaborated she likes to call it body imaging issues.. it doesn’t make much sense to me because it sounds like the same thing.. I should’ve chose better wording for sure.. but the counselor is the professional I think the right thing would’ve been for her to discuss what body dysmorphia is and the criteria for it.. and then asked my sister if she relate her thoughts and actions to those symptoms and then go from there.. and if she doesn’t have it we will both be more enlightened on what body dysmorphia is and why we don’t have it.. but I def could have chose better wording than what I did..

My intention here was to shed light on what this woman’s intentions were.  As someone who suffers from a lot of anxiety depression and body image issues i 💯 know where you’re going from. My takeaway from this is that this is a bad councilor and that you’re a good sibling. The things I say to my close friends  this woman would have a meltdown. Keep supporting your sister. Just know that this woman is looking out for herself.	Successful-School154	reply	na	na	na	0.9978887438774109	weak	strong	no	na	MentalHealthSupport	failed
"So a bit info first.

Im 23(m) living in Denmark, i have a weird type of aspergers which basicly means that as a kid i got annoyed with the whole not understanding shit going on around me and in turn became super observant.

Now... since i was around 7-9 i have taken great joy in being able decipher social encounters and basic human mimicry, however these recent 6 years it has been increasingly harder to be around people since i constantly pick up on inconsistencies in their body language which makes it feel like everyone is in a state of something that looks like fear.

its this weird sensation as if every single person i interact with or observe or whatever... has a fear of displaying ""bad"" emotions and as such choose ""the happy face"", the very unsettling part is that the whole fright of being seen displaying these ""bad"" emotions, makes people do stuff they probably dont agree with themselves wether it be going a slower route home to avoid the prospect of running in to people and having to bring out the mask, or hitting someone in order to remove focus...

The point is, i feel so very unsafe around people as it feels as everyone is on their breaking point and have been ""faking it till they make it"" the last couple years, and shits finally cathing up.  
And as such their actions become increasingly unreliable.

&#x200B;

The main reason for this post is to find out if im weird or other people are experiencing the same phenomenon"	LeDotForThought	post	14.199288201022828	male	White	0.9911755323410034	na	na	na	4	MentalHealthSupport	failed

so for a little background info, i am 17 years old currently a senior at high school. ever since i moved to a different state and struggled to fit into this new environment, i’ve always thought about going to therapy since then and getting some help figuring out stuff but i never really looked into it. but that was until recently when i decided that i really do need help and need therapy after some events that i’ll keep private happened. i decided i needed someone to talk to. the only problem is when i did do some research about local therapists near my area, they all have bad ratings and honestly don’t seem too professional. i’ve considered doing online therapy but unfortunately i feel more comfortable doing therapy in a face to face setting you know? i also tried the school therapist and they have only given out generic advice. stuff like “the grass is greener on the other side” while having good intentions i dunno, i just find that it doesn’t help at all. so right now i’m left with no options but the thing is, i am very close to graduating high school and i’ll be moving out meaning i will eventually get more options. so that’s where i want people’s thoughts. would it be better to just go with my options now or wait until i get better and more comfortable options? i know at the end of the day it all depends on me and how i feel whether it’s urgent or not but im curious to hear what other people would do in a situation like this. also thank you so much for taking time out of your day to read this.	throwawayaccount0848	post	24.864523701456754	female	White	0.9906741976737976	na	na	na	2	MentalHealthSupport	failed

"Firstly, my sincerest empathy to you and your family. It must be mentally agonizing and emotionally tormenting to have to live with that overwhelming and heart-wrenching fear for your sister’s life. I suggest that you assure your sister how much you and the family cherish her. How she makes the family whole. Help her to realize what she is passionate about. What does she want to experience in life? Who does she want to become? Guide her in meeting her passion and discovering what joy is to her. 

You or your family can’t make her choose life, you can only encourage her to choose life.

I feel like every day of high school just becomes more and more stressful. When I have too much work, I get stressed and feel like I am getting overloaded with work. When I don't have enough work and I ergo am not as productive, I get stressed from the fact that I feel like I could be doing something productive with my life. And, in the competitive high school I go to, I feel like I am not achieving the same progress others do, making me jealous of them. I need to figure out how to get rid of this jealousy, as I feel it is taking a toll on my mental health. I know it sounds arrogant and selfish, but I really don't know why I get so sick when I see others succeed. Its not that I am mad at them for succeeding, rather I look at myself and just wonder what I am doing wrong. I feel like I am an extremely hard worker, but sometimes it just feels like my work has never payed off.

"Hey there. I'm 41 but I still remember high school. Honestly the only person you need to compete with is yourself. I remember being jealous of a girl I was in band with because everyone loved her and she was valedictorian. She got a full ride to some university and I went off to community College. 

I felt like I was a failure. But going to community College was a really good path for me because I got to explore anything I wanted to for a low price. My best friend in high school went directly to a very expensive college for computer science. He now manages a fondue restaurant. Abd he's happy with that! I'm working in my chosen field of criminal justice and while I would one day like to move into horticulture, I make good money and have an excellent retirement plan. I own a house in Silicon Valley! I was a solid B student all during high school. 

I don't talk to anyone from high school other than the one friend. I don't feel jealous of anyone because I've made my own path and I'm proud of what I've done. People put so much pressure on kids to be perfect so they can get into a ""good"" school but we don't ever teach kids useful stuff like how to open a bank account or how to change a tire. Certainly you should work hard in high school, but don't let it overwhelm you. Get involved in things you really like! I got interested in forensic science because of a field trip I took as part of the school newspaper my senior year. One day you'll look back on high  school as a time where you were still finding yourself. You'll probably also wonder why the hell you had to learn all the names of the presidents because it's so useless.

It’s very normal, actually. It sounds like you’re experiencing depression. There’s different levels of severity and the desire to…delete one’s self can grow stronger as time goes by. So much so that you start to think of possible ways to die. Kinda like “oh if I suddenly died in my sleep that wouldn’t be too bad.” It usually starts off like that and can advance to you eventually attempting suicide if it goes untreated. So try to seek help. There are resources where you can talk with a therapist for free. They’re offered in each state. You just have to do a bit of digging to find them.	purbel-rain	reply	na	na	na	0.9862589836120605	weak	no	no	na	MentalHealthSupport	failed

Have not been back on here for a really long time. But I really need someone to talk to just for the comfort that there is someone around me. I don’t have anyone I can talk to and I’ve bottled my emotions up to the point where I can no longer handle them anymore. I’m just so tired of going through every day having to fake my feelings and perform all my daily tasks like some sort of obligation. It’s exhausting and I just want to rewind my life back by a few years before everything turned to shit. I’m just so tired of everything and I want to log off from reality.

"TLDR: How do I stop worrying about getting As in university? I'm having suicidal thoughts and I feel like something really bad is going to happen if I don't slow down, but I'm not even entirely convinced I should slow down.

Don't get me wrong: I'm not going to kill myself. I just have regular intrusive thoughts about wanting to kill myself. 
Sometimes I'll come across something inconvenient or triggering and the first thought that pops into my head is ""I want to kill myself."" It is worth noting that my grade lowering is more distressing to me than my suicidal ideation because I know I'm not going to kill myself. 

I just can't get over this fear of not getting As, all my life I've been conditioned into believing that anything less than an A means doors permanently close. But I'm not even aiming for grad school, I don't know why I'm freaking out over doors I was never even going to open. 

It's at the point where I'm destroying my body to study. I don't eat or sleep right, I'm always weak and frequently on the verge of dizzy spells. I'm scared I'm going to develop a chronic illness because my body is failing me. For some reason though, I still feel compelled to get As even if it means I start falling apart."	alittlebowlofsoup	post	12.97982079839666	female	White	0.9424805045127869	na	na	na	3	MentalHealthSupport	failed

My boyfriend nearly dumped me yesterday but decided we just need a break to heal after what we went through.

Im suffering horrible side effects from birth control for over a month.

My mother would have me locked up against my will again if i try to talk about my feelings.

"Hi, so was dating this one girl for about 7 1/2 months. We’re currently in high school and she went on a trip to New Orleans with her school band. During this trip she had met a guy (Also from her school) they started talking much more and more, to the point where they were hanging out everyday. Soon after she came back from New Orleans, we hung out 2 or 3 times after she had come back. The next weekend I had gone camping with a group of friends, however, when I called her the day I got back I knew something was off with her, so of course i had to ask if she was ok and everything, then, she got straight into it and broke up with me. We ended up having a 40 minute conversation about everything while this was unfolding. It has now been a week later, she is still hanging out with this guys and is still talking to me. I am currently on the edge of suicide as she i feel that she is constantly trying to hurt me. I don’t want to move on as our relationship was the best time of my life and I had never been happier. Anyways I have no idea what to do anymore and I am horribly depressed due to all of this. Of course this is written by me and I really don’t want to hurt her, but If anyone understands this please try to help me out.

Don’t dwell on this. If it hurts, you’re very capable and free to just not talk to her anymore. Not to sound like an ass but if you’re not together anymore, if you wanting to stop communication hurts her then that’s something she’s just going to have to deal with. You don’t need to suffer for other people’s happiness, that will come whenever it does. I know it’s much easier said than done, but you should find that same happiness you felt with her within yourself and learn to love yourself fully. If you start getting into relationships just because of how it made you feel in those first initial moments, the likelihood of them being healthy and successful is reduced greatly.

"I have been severely depressed for years but it has gotten worse this year. Nothing i do brings me any joy or pleasure, when I go to work I just can’t wait to leave and even driving there I think about getting into a car crash just so I don’t have to go there.

I used to be really into art (like drawing and painting), I even won a contest back in high school for it. But now even seeing others post art work on tiktok, insta, etc I get overwhelming sad and upset that I will never be as good as them. Maybe that’s my ego talking idk. 

Fuck it I hate my life i hate where I live and I just wish I was dead. There’s nothing good going for me and I will never get anywhere In life. I work at a dead end job that makes me want to put a bullet in my head and all the people who work with me all talk shit behind my back. I’m a pathetic loser who has no friends. I have no skills or ambitions that are realistic so I will probably end up getting a factory job in my home town and work their until i drop dead of alcohol and pain pill abuse.

 I wouldn’t say i’m suicidal because I don’t have a plan but who doesn’t think about it. Right ? Like sometimes the irrational thoughts take over and I ponder how beneficial it would be for everyone in my life if i wasn’t there. Sure the first few months might be tough for some but they will get over it, everyone forgets and no one will remember. 

I don’t want to feel this way I hate it so much but I have no one not a single person to talk to and I can’t get medication because my health care won’t provide it and I can’t afford it and I can check myself into a mental hospital because I have bills to pay and am In school.

"Your situation mirrors what I've been through a bit.
I too am an artist who has fallen into a rut. I used to take a lot of joy from my work but having been in a rut for 8 years I feel like I've fallen out of the game. So I get that. I also have primarily worked retail jobs for the better part of 15 years. So I understand the dead end job.

Here's what I did.

I found a new job drastically different from my own. It wasn't easy and I took a pay cut but my mental health is so much better. I no longer work retail and my job isn't even customer facing. People were burning me out. The whole thing about loving what you do is bullshit. 90%of people don't enjoy what they do. Even people with glamorous or high paying careers deal with a ton of shit. The important thing is finding a job that doesn't make you unhappy for 8 hours a day and pays your bills.

My art has mostly always been digital so I switched mediums. I started working with acrylic, alcohol markers etc. It gave me a different perspective on art. The art thing is tough because it's to easy to fall into the trap of comparing yourself to others and never feeling good enough. Some of the most interesting artists I've seen are interesting because they have their own style that they developed by experimentation. What I'm saying is just fuck around with something new and make mistakes. No matter what kind of art you post online, someone is bound to find it interesting. A good example of this is Yoshitaka Amano (the guy responsible for a lot of early final fantasy art) his stuff isn't particularly ""good"" or ""refined"" but it's interesting and unique and people love his work."	eletricdata	reply	na	na	na	0.9990527033805847	no	strong	no	na	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.

"It's never been this bad. I've had problems with social anxiety for quite a while now, I'd say it's dating back to late 2019

I just don't know where to start or how to put this post together and make it understandable. It's been so bad today I woke up at 2am now after falling asleep crying and sad because of what happened today and i can't stop thinking about it. It's so bad to a point I feel like I'm chocking. I'm sorry for anyone having a hard time understating this but it's the best I can do while being heavily under the effect of anxiety 

I've always hesitated. Always played it safe by turning down any hangout invites I got. I've missed a bunch of opportunities which, if taken wouldn't have lead to me feeling ""old"" and like it's too late for me to ever become a happy person again at the age of only 19. It's all because of this. It's been ruining my life for years now and I don't see a way out. I just want to end it all. I am not strong enough to live with this and with this. I don't wanna lead a ""life"" which is being controlled by anxiety. 

This became way more apparent after I, a 19 year old guy who just finished high school got a first full time job and its honestly been way harder since. School was easy, it was easy being around people with my age, my mentality, my maturity. Here, although 99% are at LEAST 4-5 years older than me, I think it shouldn't be this bad. 

There are no rules. I could wake up and feel so good, like I could conquer the whole world and do anything I never could've. And yet after that burst of will to live and leave this behind me, my mood will plummet so hard that I forget how to be a human again. Talking to people becomes impossible. My mind feels extremely foggy and I literally become a caveman

99% of the time, the reasons of me suddenly becoing anxious are as follows:

Talking to someone who is just as smart as me/smarter than me and not much older (makes me feel like I'm lagging behind) 
Watching a group of people I talk with have fun without me, mentioning me because they want me to become a part of a convo

Not having an adequate opinion or having an opinion at all to something I wanna be a part of (previously stated ^^^) (or a totally random post I really wanna express my opinion on but can't think of one) 

Not having an adequate answer/not thinking of something better and regretting it later or having none at all

There are probably many more reasons for this happening, but those are possible to get around easily. And you know what? Next to anxiety, I think I have a little of everything. I had a big struggle with OCD last summer, and probably still do but my mind is preoccupied with this, depression with lack of motivation, anhedonia, anger issues, sometimes, suicidal thoughts when I'm pressed by something mentioned above and I noticed that I'm being toxic and generally hate on a bunch of things. 

Honestly? Talking about all this and mentioning how many things I can feel or even feel at once really makes me think that there is no chance for me being happy yet again. I just wanna know how life feels like when you're not controlled by your corrupted mind and can actually reach your full potential. Or end it if I don't find out soon enough."

I have totally been where you are . It definitely gets better, and easier to handle once you continue to push yourself out of your comfort zone, no matter how hard that may be.

Since October I’ve had one of the worst mental health slips of my life. I’m only 20 year old, but I can’t ever remember feeling this miserable. I started this account so I could have somewhere to rant because I feel like those around me are getting tired of hearing. And maybe this is a good place to get some advice. It started with a complete loss of motivation. I used to love weightlifting, working part time and was doing amazing in school. I had moments where I may have felt worn out or maybe a little sad but it hasn’t taken over my life the way it has now. Towards the end of last semester, I almost completely stopped working out and also (unintentionally) lost some weight from not eating. My anxiety had gotten so bad to the point where I would feel physically ill and completely lost my appetite. I was miserable. Over winter break, I tried to relax as much as I possibly could. I was barely working out, still not eating much and was constantly sleeping. I felt so beyond burnt-out, but I felt like I had no reason to be. Since then, I’ve started taking Lexapro. It helped at first and it helped me get my appetite back which is always something to be grateful for. However, now I feel possibly worse than I was before. I can’t get anything done. I’ve even dropped a course this semester and somehow keep having to leave work early because I have a breakdown. I have no clue what’s going on with me. I’ve been eating normally, sleeping normally. I’ve been taking my meds and in therapy every week, yet I feel myself getting worse. Has anybody ever felt like this before? If so, how did you help it?

Is anyone really lazy? There are a lot of reasons that people might lose motivation, but that isn't laziness. Laziness is made up to shame people struggling with motivation. It is a part of a philosophical work ethic in which a persons value is connected to their ability to contribute.	idek_anymore5678	reply	na	na	na	0.9985901713371277	no	no	strong	na	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.

So my 19 year old daughter just had a paranoid/psychotic episode for the first time. I called the police who then asked if she wanted to harm.herself, she said yes, so they took her to the hospital. Since she has been in there they refuse to tell me any information. They also discharged her at one point without telling anyone and she was found roaming the street. They took her back and I have gotten zero information about her condition. My daughter called me to tell me she was being transferred but the phone cut out before I could hear where she was being taken. If I call to ask they tell me they can't give me.that information because of her age. Someone please tell me what I can do. I'm so broken and lost not knowing if she's ok. She would never go this long without talking to me ever, so I know she's not ok. What can I do?

"Since she stated that she wanted to harm herself, they legally have to admit her to a crisis unit. How was she admitted? Did she sign herself in or was she forced to go? If she signed herself in she can sign herself out after 72 hours if they don’t see any reason to hold her. If she was forced to go in, then she cannot sign herself out until she is released by a doctor. At that point they would have to give her an outpatient treatment plan, and verify that she mentally stable with therapy and meds more than likely. It takes a while to get admitted could be hours. She’s gonna be talking to psychiatrist doing intake, a few other therapists, and could take a while. They will then see if they will admit her. Once she’s on the floor, they usually have phones there and she can call you. They will not give you any information HIPAA violation. 

You can now call or text #988 for Mental Health Support. The police are not trained to deal with a mental health crisis."	Medium_Ad_3741	reply	na	na	na	0.9994733929634094	no	no	strong	na	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.
Unfortunately I don't have alot of answers. When they first took her in, they called and asked me if I wanted her to be admitted and observed, or do a 24 hour watch to see if she had drugs in her system, if her behavior would change once they were out of her system. I suggested a 24 hour watch. That's when after they just discharged her and she left not knowing where she was. My biggest thing is I have no idea where they moved her to. Is it true that I just have to wait for her to reach out to me? Even though she's not in the right state of mind? I have to say also, her delusion was that gang members were trying to shoot at her. And because of that she feels she is putting me and my dad in danger by being home. That could prevent her from reaching out to me. My sister talked to her after she was found on the street, and she wanted my sister to come get her and stay at her house. My sister suggested me roll with that to make her feel.safe. Before that could happen, they transferred her and we don't know where	Medium_Ad_3741	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9994733929634094	no	strong	no	na	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.

To know why you should exist is knowing yourself. Sit in solitude and pen down everything you want to do in this mortal life. Just write whatever comes to your mind.

You stepped into this life's journey alone, then why the hell you are dependent others. You are strong enough to make a difference in this world. You just lack self confidence.

"I’m not entirely sure if this is the best place to post this. Anyways, I was recently referred to an intensive evening-treatment program. I was originally very excited about this program. I want to work through my trauma, learn to better manage my emotions, have healthy relationships and be more functional in my work and school environments. The program has a lot of requirements and does extensive screening to chose participants. Upon being accepted into the program I was told that interviews with family members are a program requirement. I don’t have a great relationship with my family. I’ve had limited contact with my mentally I’ll biological father, my mother is an alcoholic, and my adoptive father is a mentally ill ex-addict. My therapist and I have been working on developing healthy boundaries with my family. My therapist did vouch for me, but the people from the program are still saying that they require interviews via zoom with my mom, my bio dad, my adoptive dad and her current partner. I’m a legal adult, so I don’t really understand the necessity of these interviews. I tried to explain that my biological father has me blocked and they still said that I need to request for him to be interviewed. The guy literally beat my mother and killed several of her pets. I feel like it’s essential to my healing to not have him at all involved in the process. I love my mom, but she can be really manipulative. I’m terrified of putting her in a position of power over me. I’m very private about my mental illness and I don’t want my trauma to be used against me or shared with others without my consent. I have a very close relationship with my adoptive father, but we were separated for most of my teens and I’m not really in a place where I’m ready to open up to him about my trauma or mental illness.

My question is, is it worth doing the program? I’ve been on the wait list for a while now and this is a program that could really help me. I’m afraid of not doing the program and regretting it. At the same time I feel sick to my stomach at the thought of my family being interviewed.

"I'll try to be concise here.

Just turned 44 a few months back. Battled depression, among other things, since my teenage years.

But over the last year or two, I've lost any motivation to, well, anything, really.

I can't advance at work, due to an unclean background (always good to know 8 years of busting my ass is utterly meaningless) Not sure where I could even look for a different line of work, due to the same issue. Add in constant back pain, that narrows any potential field even more.

I just don't enjoy much, beyond raising my foster kitties. 

I think a lot of that started pre-pandemic, but got exacerbated because of it.

I hate forcing myself to do things I have enjoyed, as it seems to backfire most often, then counts against doing them in the future.

I'm really stuck, and can't see out."	fatallylost	post	25.25160773742735	male	White	0.9988692402839661	na	na	na	1	MentalHealthSupport	failed
"I hope you can listen and hear me out.  


Your age doesn't define you. We are in different times today with social media, technology, the pandemic etc.  


Know this: How ONE work boss treats you DOES NOT DEFINE YOU. I left my first job (labor job) after 4.5 years once I realized my higher-ups didn't give a damn about me and didn't appreciate my work ethic. And then I found work for people who do enjoy me.  


Listen, there is always a way. I'm not sure what career you're looking into, but there are more jobs than ever in the post-pandemic life. You need to do what my best friend did: He basically applied to 20 job places until he got interviews and found one he loved --- and now he has a dream job!  


One day, don't even think about it. Just send out a resume to 5-10 different places. If you don't hear back, keep sending until you hear back.

My constant perfectionism and need to feel like I’m “on track” and meeting my high standards leaves me always feeling like a joke..

Leaving the past behind for a future that seems far more bleak as I lose any positive connections and outlooks is terrifying.

The pressure is real! When it's my birthday, which i hate to the core, i try to do what i like. Watch some movies, sleep and eat something good to my liking. I don't like to celebrate so i just do what i like just so that i can excuse myself on having a me-day where i can spoil myself as much as i can. You should try doing somsthing you like the most and spoil yourself too. It's not about hating now, it's about utilizing that day to your maximum.

I’m no expert in mental health, but i’ll try giving some advice.

I think it's important to remember that birthdays are a time to celebrate the progress you've made in life and to be grateful for the people and experiences that have shaped you. Instead of focusing on the things that you haven't achieved, take a moment to appreciate the things that you have.

It's also important to take care of yourself on your birthday. Make sure to get enough rest, eat healthy meals, and do something that you enjoy. Whether it's going for a walk, reading a book, or watching a movie, make sure to take some time for yourself.

Finally, don't be afraid to reach out to your friends and family. They care about you and want to help you celebrate your special day."	-AStrangeOne-	reply	na	na	na	0.9987918734550476	strong	no	no	na	MentalHealthSupport	failed
"I slowly realize there's no point in worrying...birthday in fact is not farewell to old self but another year on Earth I have experience. The celebration of how much I have grown to become and learn from earth experience. Discard things that doesnt serve me integrate things that serve me. Appreciate yourself more and pat yourself on the back for how far you have come to be. It's not easy on earth. Learning self love and gentle positive self talk is really important.

There's no point in rushing but go with the flow not following what mainstream society said. No one can truly control life but only can choose their response to life when it comes. There's a timing to everything. A healthy mindset and body are above all without that no matter how hard u push urself u will eventually burn urself out...

Be more compassionate...allow yourself/others to make some mistakes ....its okay to make mistakes in life...why are we so afraid of mistakes anyway than not even giving it a try reliving ur failure for what...its already of the past..we may not be able to undo things of the past but we can choose to respond better next time when it comes again or the relationship changed because of what had happen I expanded  my mindset. Its like when u are new to the job no one expect u to know 100% where the things are how things work...u need time to learn through experience of trials and failure to get better at the job. Life is full of surprises...we all have a spiritual guide team leading us to where we need to go.

The society problem also reflected here...most of us focusing on the ""problem"" and posing blames on each other/self, but we dont take action because we dwell in our failure...when all we actually need to is not self defeat or defeating others but learn to focus on making a ""solution"" or develop a skill in problem fixing and a more positive outlook to life.

if u feel lack of self esteem and low energy pls sunbathe more to recharge yourself. Do things where you are talent at confident at you are most passion at and expand on it spend more time on it to rebuild ur confidence in yourself.  Surround urself with loving people more that give support and encourage u. Discard shame and belittling yourself for not meeting the standard. We don't become genius in one day. Take steve jobs as example the amount of failure he experienced before suddenly become famous for his work.

if u feel power hungry, acting bossy or competitive at times, u learn to put other first..let urself n other makes mistake without judgment but accept the things were the way it is but help them assist them...or for yourself positive self talk tell urself its okay we all make mistakes...keep trying.....mentality..

&#x200B;

if u are interested in learning more about urself  u can look  into gene key or human design for general outlook of direction in life for u."	-AStrangeOne-	reply	na	na	na	0.9987918734550476	weak	no	no	na	MentalHealthSupport	failed
"You’re putting too much pressure on yourself to either achieve what you thought you would’ve achieved by whatever age you are right now. Also birthdays don’t have to be this big incredible celebration that comes later on in life when you actually have made it you’re just looking at those people who have made it, and comparing yourself to them, which in itself has its pros and cons. Pros are there to give you something to aspire to. Cons I can make you feel like shit.




In regards to attention take it all in. When those people tell you happy birthday, give them a hug let them know you really mean it and say that you appreciate it a lot that it means a lot coming from them and that you truly know that they care about you Because no one else will. 


Tomorrow does not have to suck. Go out and buy yourself a nice meal a favourite meal. Something that makes you smile.

"> My constant perfectionism and need to feel like I’m “on track” and meeting my high standards leaves me always feeling like a joke..

Is having goals really the problem or the lack of gumption?

Having goals and expectations of ourselves is great and gives us something to strive for. Executing on them however... It's easier for the us to live in imagination than make desire a reality because that requires effort and (often) some form of socialization rather than words and thought.

If you aren't happy with your situation or where it's headed, take steps to change it. Keep your expectations high and do your best to meet them, but realize failure is a natural part of growth and necessary to succeed later.

OR, which is what it sounds like what you want to do, set your expectations lower so you always meet them."	-AStrangeOne-	reply	na	na	na	0.9987918734550476	no	strong	strong	na	MentalHealthSupport	failed

I felt like a failure because I didn't finish my bachelor's at 22 and instead at 25 due to school workers being incompetent. 

What I did for my last birthday was treat myself. A friend opened a restaurant on my birthday and I went there. I ate good food and had a good time.

"Every business should be providing at least 2 days per year as mental health days, especially in businesses where your employees are dealing with the public face to face. The amount of crap we have to deal with, especially nowadays where people find it appropriate to treat those in customer service like we don't matter is ridiculous. I am a covid screener at a LTCH and I am now dealing with extreme anxiety & depression. It's not as simple as finding a new job,  or breathing through the anxiety attacks. These days should be mandatory so we can have that extra day to breath and recoup sometimes so we don't get to a point of having to take a medical leave for stress, or having to be medicated, or worse.

"So, I've struggled with my mental health my entire life, and I'm fully aware of some of the mental illnesses I do have, and I'm at peace with them. However, there's one thing I've struggled with my entire life. I don't know what it is, or even if it's mental health related? I've always just brushed it off by saying I'm too sensitive, or I'm just making things up because I want to upset myself. 

So I guess I just want to know if anyone else deals with this.

I have ADHD and as a result, I tend to hyper-fixate on things ALOT, and those things mean more to me than they do to the average person, I don't really know how to explain it to someone who doesn't experience the same thing. But because these things mean so much to me I get really excited and want to share them with other people!! Unfortunately, most people don't care to listen. 

Today I was trying to watch Moon Knight with my dad and brother because it's one of my favourite shows. I spent all day binging my brother's favourite show with him and I really tried to get invested and care about this thing that means so much to him. So, once we finished the show I wanted to share something that means a lot to me. Right off the bat, he didn't want to watch it, told me it looked boring and stupid, and that he doesn't like the main character, despite the fact he's only ever seen a couple of clips online. That hurt a bit but I convinced him to give it a chance, this continued throughout the episode, he would sit there making fun of it and I would say nothing and pretend it wasn't bothering me because I realize how stupid that is, he's not required to like it. My dad also joined in and at some point, he told me how that probably isn't a good show to watch. That's what broke me, it felt like my chest was being stepped on by a fucking elephant. I turned it off and went to my room nearly in tears that they would make me feel so awful about something I love so much.

This isn't the first time they've done this either, as long as I remember my entire family has done this, and every time I get way more upset than I should.

Does anyone else experience this? And if so do you know what's causing it? Am I really just too sensitive?"	Lizard_Brain_Bitch	post	14.213680569832757	female	White	0.9988364577293396	na	na	na	6	MentalHealthSupport	failed

"For the last two years anytime my mental health tanks, I can't shower. I use to be able to take baths but now i can't even do that. I worked really hard this summer to try to heal myself from past events and now, due to a new event dropping in, I'm back at square one. Therapy isn't something I can do because I can't afford it.

"I struggle hard with this too. 

Sometimes Ill just start with "" okay, I dont have to shower, but I need to at least wash my hair.""

A therapist once told me anytime I can break the rules and still get the same result, I have succeeded. Thus, sponge baths ( or rag baths) have occured in really tough times. 

I switched to bar soaps and shampoos because they dont take up as much room, and built myself a little shower kit I don't keep in the bathroom. Partly because my kids steal all my stuff, but also because it feeds my neurotypical need of getting a gift. It's like Im going on a vacation, even if only for 20 minutes.

I also dislike looking at myself in the mirror, so I will cover up mirrors or take them down. Its not so much hating my body as much as severe dissociation. I'll stand in front if a mirror for hours wondering why I am in this body and having an existential crisis. So... I cover them.

Brush your hair for one minute. Just let yourself turn the water on. The smaller the task is, the less daunting it may become over time. And allow yourself that time to get to a point you are happy with. You don’t have to get there within a week or even within a month. Go at your own pace and allow yourself to rejoice in the small victories, even if it’s standing by the shower with the water running and washing one arm if you want.

I am an extrovert, I have no trouble hanging out with people, making friends, etc. I can make people laugh people do call me funny it's just not satisfying me. I feel a connection, but it's not the one I want its not idk how to describe it's not genuine. I have no problem with making friends, but I also have no problem losing friends. I just belong to any group, any type. I feel like there's just no place for me. I have a girlfriend who says she's happy with me, but I feel like am a burden. You know not the right person for her. I don't feel like the right person for anyone honestly. Whether it is boyfriend, friend, brother or son. I just feel like a constant nomad, I like to move places, and move a lot. I just seem normal but deep down i feel constant loneliness.  Like am missing something, to belong somewhere like this place isnt for me, sometimes like this body isnt mine. Its just soo weird and these thoughts storm into my brain often at social activities, before my mood was affected by this but not anymore i have learned how to control it. I just dont know what it is, what's my problem. Its like am nit-picking my happiness? Is this self-destructive behavior. Frankly, I don't really know who I am or what makes myself. Sometimes I wonder do things I do make me happy. Or what genuinely makes me happy.I dont know who am I , and i have always had problem with my thoughts as child i would describe them as racing in my head as kid. Its just so confusing too many emotion to process and i experience them nearly everyday at random moments. These bursts. And i am losing my thoughts while writing this so i will just stop bs-ing.I know this makes no point i just dont know how to express it better.

"Everything I try doesn't work.

I've tried painkillers, sleeping pills, hanging and all have failed. I crashed my car deliberately (and got banned from driving), and last night tried to jump off the Humber Bridge but was found and brought home by the cops.

The sleeping pills I then took last night just made me sleep till 4pm, and now I'm groggy.

I can't do this anymore. Have you tried not eating for over a week? The pain, the fatigue, the shame?

The local food bank won't help anymore as I'm above my six month quota, rural and can't travel, can't work. I have no friends, no family, no money, nothing.

Hell I don't even have any gas or electric anymore as it went off days ago on the metre.

I'm pathetic, worthless and a burden. I don't deserve to live.

So look. I want to make this clear. I don't want help here... So please don't offer it...

I want a clean suicide method. It can be painful, idc, I deserve to die in pain anyway. It just needs to be effective, and quick enough that they won't get to me first this time.

You tried to jump off a bridge and the cops didn’t take you to the hospital? That doesn’t make sense. I’ve looked at your Reddit posts and you’ve mass posted on multiple subreddits that you’re going to die for weeks now.

"You know pretty well that no one would offer you a method here. It would destroy their conscience. I'm not trying to help you because you said you don't want any and that's okay . 

I'm just here to say that I did this myself 2months ago. No money, one meal a day, no job or any prospect of it, no friends, nothing I came to reddit and wrote a suicide note.

For the longest time I thought I wanted to die and like you I had tried everything but nothing seemed to work and I felt like oh god what a pathetic loser I am! I can't even kill myself properly but overtime I was forced to acknowledge that I came here only because I needed someone to talk me out of it. I also wasn't able to kill myself because my body simply refused to give up. My body was at a point where I was rushed to the hospital and the first thing the doctor said was HOW ARE YOU STILL ALIVE??' with the horrified I've ever seen a doc. 

My point is if you really wanted to die, it would have happened already by now. You think you know what your brain really wants but turns out it has a mind of its own and it will indefinitely switch your body to survival mode no matter how hard you try to end it all because instinctively no human actually wants to die and that's a fact.

You're tired. Exhausted rather. We get it. If you're still here, man you're really brave!! Also if you're still here, it's a humble request, please let us help you in whatever way we can.

there is definitely an emotional release but i don’t think it’s healthy in the way i’m craving it. i would let my ex take his anger out on me, and afterwards i’d feel a lot of stress relief but briefly, i’d usually cry upon going home. i’ve felt this way for as long as i can remember, and it feels like nothing else can satisfy me	Aware-Preparation390	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9983806610107422	no	strong	no	na	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.
Ya, it’s strange. It’s like there’s this deep insecurity within me that no matter what I do won’t stop letting out darkness that consumes me. Idk, I find that outside of my urges, the idea of an unequal relationship is absolutely abhorrent to me and fills me with the deepest of rages.

I’m 26 years old and struggle deeply with agoraphobia, panic disorder, and separation anxiety. I have struggled with this for over 2 decades now and because of it I have not been able to move from home and have only traveled without my parents once in my life (though the agoraphobia keeps me from traveling much in the first place). Whats been bothering me lately is the fact that I can’t even go somewhere two hours away without needing my parents or parent with me. I want to be able to do things with friends, but I’m always making excuses why I can’t go when in reality it’s my panic. I’m in therapy, have been for over 10 years, but I just feel like I’ve failed to launch. I’m finishing up college and the fear of what’s next is also terrifying. Moral of the story is I just feel so alone with all of this. All my friends live alone, have traveled the world alone or with friends, as well as all of my siblings. I haven’t been able to do any of it and feel like such a loser.	Taylorswiftfanatic	post	25.925799982571945	female	White	0.9951098561286926	na	na	na	1	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.
Hi! Sometimes I also felt fear about being alone. I mentioned several times to friends that I felt lonely and scared and fear even in my own room, no body actually understands it. And I tried to play loud music, be more active online (Reddit or somewhere else)it helped. So I personally don’t really expect anyone would really understand me but trying some special practical actions would help! And if you don’t want to travel alone, then don’t, get to rent a apartment with friends and shopping/traveling together kan be a nice idea. Feeling anxious and fear is definitely not comfortable feeling for sure, but don’t try so hard on your self and keep yourself company. No shame about that!

A loved one recently attempted suicide, recovered himself, but then was admitted to a psych ward. he can’t have his phone and my only contact is through his mom but she doesn’t really think to update me on him because we’ve never even met yet. anyways i don’t know how this works. no one can tell me how long he’ll be there. i’m not even sure he voluntarily admitted, although i know he wanted to go. but i don’t understand any of this. he also called me his first night there but not since– just his mom. should i be worried? he is at an institution in central pennsylvania. can he not call me? how long will he be there roughly? anything, i’m so freaked out. he’s been there, tomorrow, one week.	indieerokkers	post	8.907957814271223	female	White	0.9992775321006775	na	na	na	5	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.
"How long someone is in really depends on their specific situation. People with mental health crises like your friend and voluntarily admit can be there anywhere between 3 days to 2 weeks depending on how they are coping and what next steps they wish to take. I rarely see anyone longer than 2 weeks in this scenario. 

He can call who he wants throughout the day but I hate to say that you may not be a priority right now. He’s busy getting treatment, he shouldn’t be worrying about keeping everyone else at ease about the situation. I would just wait patiently until he gets out and let him come to you to talk if he wants to.  Don’t try to add more stress by pushing to talk to him just because your own mind needs to be put at ease. If you really feel that he would benefit from your support, you can try to get the number for the unit and see if his mother will give you the information needed to contact him (often they will have a patient number that a caller needs to know in order to get in contact so it isn’t just any person at all who has access to that patient). 

Given that he has been thee more than 3 days, I’m willing to bet he is voluntarily staying. After 3 days you either go home, check in voluntarily (if you weren’t already), or become involuntary (not likely). 

Throughout the day he is attending groups, taking medication, socializing with other patients, receiving 3 meals a day with snacks, playing games, watching movies, and seeing a psychiatrist as well as potentially a therapist or social worker depending on the facility. If he wasn’t being cared for, he probably would have checked himself out by now so I don’t think you need to worry.

Edit: I want to add that it isn’t uncommon that friends and family who worry about the patient will constantly call (they may assume they’re the only one calling), and it adds a great deal of stress for the patient. To put it bluntly, they are the one suffering right now and it isn’t their duty to keep their family and friends minds at ease. I know that sucks, and you want to know what’s going on. But please just be patient and don’t hold it against him.  He’s working on himself right now."	indieerokkers	reply	na	na	na	0.9992775321006775	no	strong	no	na	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.

"When a lot of people come in, there is a tendency to be embarrassed. Depending on how long you’ve been together, I think it’s likely he’s working through things he hasn’t felt able to open up to you with yet. 

My cousin went through something similar where her boyfriend of a couple months needed to be hospitalized. He never contacted her while he was in and she was anxious about it. He only contacted close family. Turns out he had been hospitalized several times before and was working through issues from childhood he only felt comfortable talking about with his mom. This could be the case. I would just try to be patient and know that he’s safe. 

If he’s been in a week, then he is likely going to be out in the next couple days. Don’t hold it against him, he will open up to you when he feels able.

This just may not be something you’re able to help him with to the capacity you’d like to be able to. So don’t feel like you failed either because these issues can be so hard to fix.

"Hello everyone, I (30F) have been admitted to the mental hospital to get more control on how I'm feeling and recovering.
It's uncertain how much time I'll stay here.

I have a job that I like and I get sorta decent salary (but inflation hit tho). I talked to my boss yesterday and she told me to not worry about work. The fact is that my job is one of the few things that keeps me afloat and I'm afraid of losing a lot of money I really need to pay rent, bills, car mechanic, psychologist, credit card and dentist. I'm kinda broke because I have collected a bunch of debt when I was unemployed and I live in kinda though budget.

Honestly I cannot afford to be sick. I'm married but we are living separately and all of the house expenses are 100% on me, in addition, my salary is almost 2x his.

I'm very concerned and I really cannot help it.

"Ok. Take a deep breath. The first time is always a jarring shake from the reality of your normal day to day. But, you did it. You took a step in a direction to help you. That's a victory. Savor that. 

The next thing is, find a rhythm, and make sure you go to group in the morning. It seems tedious and sometimes childish, but it's important to start building a routine while there. 

Decaf coffee is gross, no they won't give ya the good stuff and the Kool aid is sugar free.

If you smoke, ask for the patch. It won't kill the craving for that stress smoke, but it will stop you from destroying pen caps. 

As far as time frame, which is the time you wanted to know. Which is the thing I avoided saying and gave you tips instead of time frames...

Right now, yes, you have all those financial obligations. But they won't change while you're taking care of yourself. It's so stressful. Because your racing mind can't wait to get back to fix what you missed. 

However, and I say this as a long time frequent flyer (until I finally found the right team) put all of that in a box, and deal with 1 thing at a time. 1. Not 10. Not a list. 1. 

Grant me the the serenity to ACCEPT the things I CANNOT change,
COURAGE to change the thing I can, and the WISDOM TO KNOW THE DIFFERENCE. 

You are in a place to unravel the parts that are broken in order to get help and tools for your coping skills tool box. 

If you got this far, if you fake it just to get home, 3 days. If your insurance allows and you need/are being served lessons you with take with you, a week. I hope the helps. I wish you the best of luck.

"Hey lovely! Well done for taking the first and hardest step! The first night of the first admission is always the hardest so just hang in there. 

Not sure where in the world u are, but make sure you keep yourself as comfortable and connected as makes you happy.  Sometimes shutting your phone off for a couple of days is helpful, sometimes it's best to be in touch w your family etc. 

Make use of everything they offer for you and (I know this is so much easier said than done) just try and take it one day at a time, one task at a time, one step at a time, one breath at a time! Remember also the nurses are there to support you and you're not a burden to them!! Use them for that :) 

I'm a frequent flyer to the psych wards as well and honestly, just try and recover as best you can and get as many skills as you can. Try not to worry about your length of stay- but also remember that you're there so your life doesn't get too disrupted. You'll know when you're ready to leave and feel safe outwards.

"So my depression has been really, really bad lately. Like not being able to get out bed, calling out of work, constantly feeling hopeless, not taking care of myself properly. I have an outpatient psychiatrist that I see and she’s adjusted some of my meds here and there to try and help, but it just seems worse. I feel so numb all the time.

I just recently found out that my older brother has been fucking my now ex fiancé for the past 8 or 9 months behind my back. Little back story, I met my former fiancé in 2017 in a different state than where I’m currently located which was my home state prior to moving where I met her. Since getting close around end of 2017 early 2018, this person was apart of my everyday life. I fed her. I put money in her pocket constantly, before we were even a couple.. I sat back and watched her be with another guy and have a kid by him and throughout that time I was still supplying her with money and making sure she ate and was twin care of, etc .. I few years go by and I drunkenly admit my feelings for her after about 2 1/2 years. We talk about it and we end up getting together. Because of who she was, everyone in my family dropped me because of it. No one wanted to support me being with her so all I had was her and my older brother(who at the time was in my home state whilst we were in another state). She moves in with me and we stay in my home for about 8 months before we move back to my home state. We end up in a roomate situation with a family member of mine until I can afford to get us into our own place. This was in December of 2021. We started having even more issues once we stayed alone around January or February. And from that point on she completely changed on me. Granted, I’m mature enough to admit I wasn’t perfect. I had my fuck ups but I never left her. I never abandoned her and her needs. I’ve been there through thick and thin no matter what. I notice she starts to pull away from me due to the fact that I had school and work full time and I didn’t get to spend time with her amongst other things. Nevertheless, I notice she grow extremely close to my older brother. A person whom I thought we both saw a just family, strictly family. But little did I know, for months right up under my nose, they were fucking and secretly in a relationship. All whilst I’m funding her life because she can’t find or keep a job. I’m doing everything I can as a man, I’m providing, I’m trying to be intimate, I’m still flirting and trying to continue to “date” my partner. All while I can see her pulling away from me, from the relationship. I loved her with every fiber in my being. I’ve never physically harmed her, never disrespected her, never threatened her.. I get there were areas I needed work on but I felt I did all I could with what I had. For basically the entire year me and her stayed together once we moved to my home state, she had me blocked on all her social media and I knew it was a red flag but I was so afraid of setting g her off because I felt anything and everything I say or do would be ammunition for her to just leave me. So I decide to deep dive and pay closer attention. I started to notice her crawling out of bed to be on the phone with him at 3, 4 in the morning. Her always wanting to be apart of his day in some way or always texting him or alway gaming with him, even got the point where he was always the topic of her conversation. She went from being a homebody to always wanting to go out and again she knows no one from here but my brother and his wife and they stay almost an hour from us at the time. My brother is never known to drive long distances unless it was for money or sex .. well she had no job, no income of any fashion. I stated to notice differences in her behavior. Her music. Her lingo. Her beliefs. It was all the same as his. I special yes for MONTHS they were doing things behind my back and they gaslighted me the entire time. She’d say “why would I want him, he beats his wife, he neglects his kids, etc”. Same for him, saying things like “I see her as a little sister, wouldn’t do that to you lil bro”. I’d hear them say this to me but their actions just showed so much than what they were willing to tell me. I knew it all long. I just had a strong gut feeling and they made me out to feel insane for even thinking that was a possibility. Fast forward to a few days ago, I find out they’re dating and have been dating the entire time I speculated. She had me blocked however I could still see our dm thread, I blindly notice she changed her pfp and it was a very vague yet point blank message. It was her cuddled up with my brother but I couldn’t see the guys face so even though I knew it was him I was in disbelief. I then find his page and his pfp was them again CUDDLED UP IN MY HOUSE. I read at least a few hundred of his tweets and majority pertain to her and him and how much they loved each other and how great the sex was and how they are starting a life together, etc. I confront both of them and there’s zero remorse, both of them basically told me they didn’t care how it made me feel and they’d do it again if given the option. It’s been a total of 3 days since finding out and I haven’t slept much. I haven’t eaten. I can’t stomach anything. I can’t even enjoy what I used to because I truthfully don’t want to be alive. I can’t seem to find anything that will take my mind off of how they betrayed me. I’m struggling and this is so hard for me to talk about. I’m drowning in my own sea of thoughts because I can’t fathom what they did to me. I don’t know what to do from here because I have zero motivation to do anything. I feel so weak. So helpless. So used. I say all that to say this, how do I get over this without having to resort to what I don’t want to do?

"Has anyone on here successfully beat mental illness entirely on your own? as in without a support network. if so how did you do it?

Context

I've been going through a rough patch as i often do, i tried to take the exit off the life highway a few weeks back, which was not my first attempt. I just feel so utterly alone, i've been diagnosed with an eating disorder, depression, and anxiety and I just cant seem to turn things around mentally. All I have is my therapist which i'm struggling to afford, because im so depressed i can hardly work due to exhaustion. My friends know im not doing well mentally but they cant give me the support that i need. What I need is a month where someone just looks after me, I just cant look after myself and im worried that Im going to become a danger to myself if i cant get things back on track. Its easier to take care of myself when there is someone there to help, i just cant do the basic things like feed myself, shop for groceries, get proper sleep, remember appointments ect. many people I know have just spent some time with their family especially at my age (24) they can still get away with being looked after for a week. But i dont have that, my dad and i hardly speak and my mum is bipolar and the worry of me would cause her to spiral. thats all the family I have, mostly because i lost a lot of my family when i came out as transgender. 

I dont want to face this alone anymore but I think that I will have to."

But the mods will remove posts, ban people, etc. left and right. Do they not realize that could literally KILL someone? People are looking for support, needing advice, and then they're immediately silenced. 

And that's just one example. 

I don't understand how ""safe spaces"" are able to act like this. I feel like there's no such thing as a safe space for suicidal people. That's probably why so many people die to suicide. 

The second you try to open up about it you're shut down and judged. Youre isolated, banned everywhere, bullied, downvoted. In real life you might get thrown into a hospital and forcibly watched. 

We need to create ACTUAL safe spaces for suicidal people. This is getting ridiculous. Discussions need to be allowed. They need to be able to talk about it. This is why people are dying."

You are so correct about this. I felt the same way when I went through the mental hospital. This is why I checked out earlier than they wanted me there. I felt like they where numb to the pain I was experiencing.

"Agreed 100% - I've worked in the mental health industry and when one of ours would go into a crisis they'd get shoved into a hospital ward that would give them no help at all other than sedation. Idk how it is worldwide but I'm in the UK and it's extremely depressing and disheartening. People are more willing to talk about mental health, but when it comes to real medical help, we're still so far behind where we need to be.

"I totally agree but also believe this is not that place. I’m not sure where you are from but here in Australia we have a lot of online mental resources. On line chats, forums, one on one live chats where there are professional mental health workers monitoring chats etc. this is so they can keep people safe. 
I feel that sometimes in open public forums such as this it is not  always the safest environment. I have seen horrible things being said to people who are obviously reaching out for help. They have been attacked and judged. That’s is not what they need. Please reach out in your local area to see if there are online professional resources available.

I agree wholeheartedly my entire family suffers from depression and my younger sister of 15 at felt so alone at one time. I was 21 at the time so I was moved out and she was there alone with my family and she felt she couldn't share her feelings with anyone about her suicidal intrusive thoughts and self-harm so one day she went to school and she wrote on her arm I want to die in hopes that someone would help her and you know what they did?

"No there are not. 

You can't be honest with anyone about wanting to die, because no one will take you seriously or treat you as a person. You can get locked up in a mental hospital, which for me was one of the single most traumatizing things that ever happened - a person tried to strangle me to death in there. 

I hate being seen as a diseased person who is just irrational. I have real, non imaginary reasons that I am alone and emotionally hurt. I'm not insane. Even therapist will not treat me like a person any.ote if I talk about not wanting to live.

"TL:DR My dad screamed at me while roughly grabbing my arm and now I have anxiety and can’t sleep because my head creates new scenarios that I start to panic over.

Hey guys! This is my first time posting on here, so if I’m in the wrong sub or breaking any rules please let me know.
Last fall my parents (61M and 59F) and I (21F) had a fallout. Basically, I had been staying at my boyfriends apartment when at college (crashing on his couch). My parents are extremely conservative Christian and so is my school. Me staying at my boyfriends place went against my school’s code of conduct, even though he lives off-campus in a non-affiliated apartment building. It also violates my parents moral code. Admittedly, I had been lying to them about it, which was a bad choice on my part, but I was leaving to study abroad soon and it was the only way I could go see him regularly before that.

Essentially, my parents found out I had been lying and asked to talk to me two times about it. Both times it just didn’t work. The first time they tried to surprise my boyfriend and I by driving to the school to talk to us. We refused that conversation.
The second time was the day after. I had just gotten back into town. I had work the next day and it was 11:30 already.
Trigger Warning for the next part for yelling and emotional manipulation:

My mom comes upstairs not too much later to tell me that I need to come down and talk to her and dad in the sitting room. Once again I declined for some very simple reasons. I told her I had work in the morning and I needed to shower before bed too. She kept insisting that I come down to the living room and I kept saying no and it started to escalate. My dad then comes around the corner and as he’s coming up the stairs I say I’m going to get in the shower and they can’t force me into a conversation. At that point, mom told me that dad would “pull me out of the shower”. I didn’t know if they’d actually go through on that threat so I didn’t get in. Instead dad backed me into a corner and forcefully took my phone from me saying it was their phone. Then he grabbed my arm and started yelling at me for refusing to talk to them. I told him to “stop touching me” and that he was “hurting me” (which I didn’t mean physically as much as mentally and emotionally) but he just started squeezing my arm tighter. He was barely an inch from my face yelling at the top of his lungs and honestly I don’t remember anything he said because I was so scared. 

When he stopped (and after I hyperventilated a bit) I said I was leaving for the night because I wasn’t going to let them force me into that conversation and I was terrified. But they took my car keys and any access I had to the outside world. They pulled the car into the garage. My dad even changed the WiFi password a little later so I couldn’t use their WiFi. I was so determined not to be there though that I snatched my backpack and tried to go out to the car with dad yelling behind me that if I took the car they’d call the police and report it stolen and if I was going to leave I’d have to walk. So I left. I just started walking down the street, and I was freaking out because I only had my laptop which didn’t have a connection. I had no wallet or anything. After some desperate attempts to get a connection I was going to try and find a random house that would let me use a phone to call my boyfriend whose number I had written down. I had no way of telling my boss that I couldn’t get to work the next day. I was still in our neighborhood using the outlet from our little overhang community spot to charge my laptop when my mom found me.

She then proceeded to read to me a very emotional two pages or so she had typed out that I only sat through because I needed to go home and stay in my bed. They had a lot about how she barely recognized me anymore and how they didn’t approve of my relationship.
She then told me that dad wanted to apologize and I needed to talk to him before going to bed. My dad didn’t apologize because he said he was still angry and he wasn’t sure if it was “righteous indignation”. I apologized for lying, and I meant it. I didn’t want to lie.

I had multiple panic attacks that night after they finally let me go upstairs to bed. They gave me one phone call to tell my boyfriend I was okay.
Then for the next two days I couldn’t have my phone and my mom was driving me to and from work. I would freeze up on the way home from work everyday because I was traumatized by what my dad did. It was like my whole body was in cement and I could barely respond to things. They finally let up on me after I sat down and had a talk with them where I presented a document with my boundaries. They read something a lot like a devotional to me and my dad apologized. After that conversation I started paying for a few things like my phone service so they wouldn’t have control over that. I’m fully aware I’m very reliant on my parents. It’s difficult being at still such a dependent age when you’ve reached adulthood and need your own space to grow and be an individual. They said a lot of things that were frustrating when it came to my boundaries too. Things that felt like excuses like “we feel like you’re setting ultimatums here and we’re not perfect” or “your dad has never done anything like this before in your 21 years of life and he’s already apologized”. 

I studied abroad for three months after that and when I returned things seemed relatively normal with my parents. 
When I was abroad, I barely thought about the incident. I think the distance help. I spent Christmas with my boyfriend and his family so I had distance then too. But when I got back to school, I dealt and am dealing with extreme anxiety.
I have insomnia, and even when I’m really tired I can’t get out of my head and fall asleep. I already have ADHD, which makes falling asleep difficult on its own. When I’m laying in bed I’ll start panicking because my brain will start vividly imagining situations with my dad.

At first it was just what I could’ve done different that night. I could have locked myself in the bathroom or my bedroom. Those types of things. Sometimes, like tonight it’s weirder. I imagine my dad actually physically abusing me, shaming me, spanking me like a child, and the like. I  start panicking just thinking up these scenarios and how I would hypothetically react to each one.
I think my big question would be is this PTSD? Or general anxiety? It doesn’t seem like how I’ve seen PTSD portrayed, but often I haven’t heard of different angles or aspects of things. 
I’m sorry this was so long!

"Not quite the same, but my father got physical with me around that age too. (I’m 25 now) We weren’t living together anymore, I was spending time with him, and giving him a ride to do errands. He choked me out. Thing is, he’s in his sixties, and not the healthiest. I’m a marital artist. I could have fought him off me, probably. I remember raising my free hand and saying “don’t make me cross that line, old man.” That seemed to get through a bit, and deescalated. It was fucked up cuz he still got to run his errands and I even hugged him when I dropped him off, trying to pretend it didn’t happen. That didn’t exactly work out, because I didn’t feel at all safe around him anymore. My dad betrayed me. We don’t talk really anymore, because I asked him to get therapy before I got close again.

TLDR: I understand why you can’t relax. You’re not safe in his house anymore. If it happened once, it can always happen again. Form an escape plan for if things get hairy again. Tell your boyfriend everything, and maybe include him in your planning in case you need a rescue. I’m glad you had that time abroad to decompress, but now that your back the dynamics are too.

"its a very difficult mindset to navigate through and trying to switch between letting yourself feel the emotions and trying to hold yourself together can be so draining. and obviously for some these are things that don't go away, just manage it, some people recommend better diets or going for walks in nature, and obviously i'm no expert, but in my opinion allowing yourself to do things that make you happy as often as you can helps and keeping some variety in life, so its not always the same schedule. sometimes writing your thoughts on a piece of paper or in a note book can help and some people choose to then destroy or burn those pages as it helps to release the pressure of it, you can try talking positively about yourself out loud especially in times when you would say something negative about yourself. or starting to add new self care routines into your day/week.

integrating small positive changes into your day to day life will help in the long term it takes a while, so the short term solutions will help give you a boost so keep them varied. but if you have a really bad day, that is okay, you can let yourself have a bad day or even a few days as long as you try and make sure you complete basic tasks for those days, so maybe you can set up a self care shelf/ storage trolley in  your room to help you complete them. it can contain things like water bottles, dry shampoo, snacks, any medication you may need, deodorant, face wipes ect. to keep by your bed for the days its difficult to leave your room. 

&#x200B;

these are a few things i've heard about but some of these i use myself and they have helped me quite a bit especially the out loud positive talk, its so simple it took a while to kick in but it helps a lot more than i thought it would.  sorry if you've heard all these before i know they aren't like ground breaking or anything but these are the ones i've heard the most positive feed back about. hope you can feel better soon or at least things improve"	g0thmagg0t	reply	na	na	na	0.998309850692749	weak	strong	no	na	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.
I’m not a good person. Like not at all. I did a lot of bad things that I got punished for, and even more that no one found out. A lot of serious ones too. Every time someone tells me that I’m a wonderful person, I know it’s not true. Most the examples they gave me has a dark secret behind it that’s not been discovered. All those terrible things that I did, if someone ever finds out about them I’ll be all alone for the rest of my life. I can’t keep keeping these secrets. Not being honest even to my closest friends and families is a horrible feeling, and it’s really tearing me apart.

I get this feeling, we all do. In all honesty we all have done bad things. I’ll be honest with you. I used to have a bad temper when I was younger. Said horrible things to my family and my siblings. Saying I hate them even threatened my brother multiple times. I’m not proud of it there a lot of things I have to answer for when I get to my grave. But I’ve turn my life around. Even now I just decided to be up awake I can’t sleep and talk to people who are struggle like me and want to help as many as I can. You accepting what you have done is wrong is a major step. And I’m proud of you for that. Your not a horrible person you have learned and grown. And realize your wrong in your life. What’s important is keep doing good. When someone tell you are wonderful it’s the actions you have put out on that person. If I meet you and knew what you have done but you have changed and are acting the way you are currently I see you as a good person no matter your past. As they say the past is the past you can’t go back on it if you hold on it will eat you alive. It’s to move on and to not repeat the same mistake. I hope you do great things in life and you don’t have to go crazy snd donate like a ton of money or some other wild actions. It can be simple as sitting down with someone and asking them if they are okay and what you can do to help. You got this. Know you are changed and are doing good.

"I live with my parents, who have no idea how bad my depression is. They think my room is messy because I'm lazy but in reality I just don't have the strength to clean it. I also suffer with sensory issues which makes cleaning harder. My room isn't even messy anymore; it's filthy.

I mostly struggle with managing my bin, which has resulted in a rat infestation in my room. My parents don't know and I'm scared to tell them in case they get mad. But I don't know how to fix it on my own, especially since I don't do well with things like that.

Unfortunately, I need to get my room clean in a week and I just don't know what to do. I've always struggled with cleaning but my depression has made everything so much harder, so I'm very worried that it won't get done in time.

"Hi ! I will give you a list I use to start and is quite effective :

1- take a bin bag and throw everything that is trash 
2- take a laundry basket and put every clothes item that is on the floor (you can separate clean and dirty clothes if possible)
3- every cup, plates etc goes in the kitchen/dishwasher 

After that you can work by section, for exemple your desk, then your bed and tidy the rest.
To clean and dust you can use a multipurpose spray and a microfiber cloth

Give yourself breaks and you can do this in several days, a tiny bit at a time ! Try to make this a good moment with a good playlist, a sport outfit to do it, and rewards after every steps.

Focus on one area at a time. I usually start with my desk because that's the easiest, then my closet, my bed, and then my floor. I also normally clean whatever catches my attention first because I also have ADHD so I kinda let it guide me through it as well.

"I dont know what level of dirty you are dealing with, but from my personal experience, here are some tricks and the schedule I have used in the past when helping people clean up while dealing with emotional disregulation:

Set a 5 minute timer for yourself too. Start cleaning when the timer starts. It doesnt matter when it goes off, but the first five minutes of doing something are the hardest.

If you can get through the five minutes, but want to stop, thats okay. You did something. If you dont want to stop, keep going. 

Categorizing is the way to go. If its all jumbled together like I think it is ( family experience), I always go for the soft things first. Laundry, blankets, whatever you can wash in the washer. Get one load started and literally bag the rest if you have to. Clothing, blankets and comfort items can be big visually and that makes it overwhelming. I find that removing them first makes the task seem much more managable.

Then I move onto trash, and I usually start from the top down. Shelves, then desks and tables, then floor. By going top down you are allowing the dust and such to settle on lower levels, making vacuuming the last. If it is helpful, you can grab a washrag and bucket of soapy water at this stage and wipe down the levels as you go. If you have a roll of paper towels, you can take this time to also scoop any left over food into the bin from dishes and set the dishes in a designated space to handle later. 

Its okay to sweep carpet before you vacuum. It wont hurt the rug. Use tools like a broom and dustpan to bin trash easier and faster with less effort. 

Dishes are a personal struggle for me. I have a small bin I keep and when it gets full, I take my dishes up to the main house in the evening so no one can see my dirty dishes ( shame plays a big game here.) Maybe unload the dishwasher if you have one in the evening, and reload it at night when everyone is off to bed, if you dont want them to see the actual amount of dishes. Do 5. Or 10. Grab just the cups today, and the bowls and spoons tomorrow.

If you didnt wipe things down as you removed trash, this is the stage you do it at... following the top down rule. Spray cleaner or a small container of soapy water and a rag will do. 

Then you vacuum.

Then... big part of staving off depressive episodes here... make your bed. And commit to making your bed every day. Your bed can be a sanctuary of peace for you, but it needs to be inviting to do that. If there is one thing that I have ingrained in my brain it is that. 

When you make your bed, you are asserting control over your space. Its one of the smallest decisions in a day that can kick your brain into decision making mode. By choosing to do this, you can also choose to do other things. And it doesnt have to be picture perfect. I sometimes make my bed and then flop all my laundry onto it, fold it and leave it there. The look isnt as important as the choice in this case. 

Break it down into smaller segments. 

Chances are, if you have rats, they are in other parts of your home and they just arent aware. Here, we have baited traps, but we find peppermint and/or clove soaked corn cob seems to keep them away ( I live where we have farm rats and wild field mice.) Use a good peppermint spray to deter them. Once its clean, they'll likely leave if you keep food out of your room and dont leave items lying about for nesting materials. 

Put on your shoes when you clean. Its a brain signal that its time to do something. Dont take them off until you are certain you are done for the day. 

Most important... remember: no zero days. Do one thing if you can. 1 load of laundry. 1 bag of trash. 1 dish. Just doing the one thing means you accomplished something today.

"First off i just wanna say that i dont use reddit much but i dont know who else to turn to. im not sure if this is the right place to post this. 

Ever since i was young i remember being terrified to talk and i would get nervous every day before i would go to school, but i would go anyways. it got really bad in middle school, i got a boyfriend and started skipping most days but the feeling didnt go away. i would get a pit in my stomach every time i would get on the bus or knock on a door or break a silence, but it wasnt THAT bad. im still mot sure if this was normal but it wasnt bad enough to really be a concern it was just kinda annoying. 

by the end of middle school i had probably skipped months worth of classes. i had some really embarrassing things happen and just couldnt work up the courage to go back, and my mom wouldnt let me transfer. 

going into highschool i went into foster care, i attended 3 days of the 9th grade before i stopped going completely. my foster parents put me into a section classroom (there were 8 students) and it was bearable but i would constantly overthink ‘am i breathing too loud? am i breathing too fast? they can smell your breakfast. they see you look nervous’ stuff like that. i continued going but hardly got anything done cos i was too focused on acting normal. 

then i stopped going outside all together. it keeps getting worse tho. i avoid seeing people and going outside so much that it kinda scares me. im turning 18 soon and aging out and i know this isn’t sustainable but every time i try to figure out what to do my first solution is to end myself and i get fixated on doing that rather than finding a solution. 

does anybody know what might be wrong with me and what kind of help i need?"	Ok-Fix-386	post	12.863608099791902	female	White	0.9961634874343872	na	na	na	1	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.
"Hi I'm not a mental health professional of course but it sounds like your suffering extreme anxiety amongst other things.
Your mind is kinda stuck in thinking in negative patterns and thoughts so even if you think of something to make things better part of you will dismiss it and think of a reason why it won't work.
You can and will come through this but you need to see a doctor to explain how you are feeling. You only get one life, don't waste it and remember how you feel now is not how you will always feel - it's just your mind is, a, battleground at the moment. Please ask for help I know its easy to say but please do it. Let me know how you get on or message me if you like. We all need help sometimes in life and if you had to reach this low point to get better in the long term. I know because I've had similar experience in the past.

I (20 M) and my girlfriend (19 F) have been dating for nearly 16 months. We have gotten a place together, and she is the love of my life. However, I struggle with mental illnesses such as PTSD, anxiety, and depression. Recently, I have gotten this job that is a lot more stressful and time-consuming than my previous. That being accompanied by my girlfriend not making me feel very welcome or wanted around her recently, my stress has been very high. So last night, in the shower, to ease some stress, I cut myself. Not deep enough to do any damage, just enough to feel it. When she got home and found out, it took hours of pleading and tears to get her to not leave and to try and give our relationship time. She kept saying how bad she wanted to leave and how I hurt her and how she doesn't think she can forgive me. It took hours of me saying how sorry I am to convince her just to stay and give it some time. She let me sleep in the bed tonight, but I am too stressed and sad to sleep. I just want her to forgive me so I can hold her hand and take her out on a date.  I love her with all of my heart, and I really don't want to lose her. If I lose her, I lose the apartment, and not only will I not have the girl I love, but I won't have a place to stay, either. Please, if anyone has advice, I'd really appreciate it.

"I'm so sorry to hear about what happened 💛. I have also struggled with these kinds of mental issues and I know it can be really hard. Sometimes I do end up hurting myself. But when it has happened, my partner showed concern and love and support, and it means the world to me to feel that support, because without it I feel so lost and afraid. Now I'm seeing a therapist who helps me with my PTSD and it's the best decision I've made for myself.

I understand that you want to be with her. But I have to admit that I think it's a bit of a red flag that she makes herself into a victim instead of showing concern for you. It seems like she doesn't want to show you understanding and support, and that's not healthy. Maybe you could talk about that with her? Or see a therapist, who could then give you professional advice?

And if she still judges you and doesn't want to show you concern or support then I think it might indicate selfishness and narcissism, and I think that it's definitely not good."	Babgabongaboonga	reply	na	na	na	0.4124433696269989	strong	strong	no	na	MentalHealthSupport	failed

If you feel like she's making unfair accusations, being judgmental, playing mind games and then always making herself into a victim at the end of the day... Then I don't think that's good. You deserve love and support, and I'm a bit worried that she doesn't really give that to you (not unconditionally anyway). I definitely don't want to tell you whether you should call it quits or not, because that is of course completely your choice. I just think you should trust your heart and gut. Just please remember that you are always worthy of love and respect and understanding. You don't deserve to be humiliated and disrespected and judged and certainly not punished. You haven't done anything wrong - you just need help and support because you don't feel well, but it's like she doesn't understand that. And if you feel in your gut that it doesn't feel right with her, then maybe it's a sign that she's not the best match.

"
i’m not sure what to do with my mental health, it’s gotten really bad. let me explain. when i was 6 my father passed away from an accidental overdose on opioids. i remember i was at school and he was supposed to pick me up but he never did, a couple  hours later my mom did and asked if i ever saw my dad and i said no she found this weird and blew up his phone with attempted to get an answer, all her calls went to voicemail and all her texts were left unseen. that very same day my mom was in the car driving and she get a a call saying “your husband passed away, please drive carefully.” this made my mom turn around and go straight back home. I still had no idea of his passing, until a couple weeks after that when my uncle took me to a park and in the car ride back home he got a call saying “sorry for your loss,” i asked him who and he replayed with “your dad.” i bursted out crying wondering what he meant, he further explained, i cried my heart out. A couple years later my mom got a boyfriend, he would hit my everyday and verbally abuse me, but since i was only 8 i didn’t know that it was wrong, so i never told my mom. fast forward to last year my best friend attempted suicide, thankfully she’s still here, but that wasn’t all that was going on, my friend got sexually assaulted, and i had the cops talk to me about what i know from what she’s told me, this cuased them to come to my house at absurd times for example they have to my house at 3 am, and asked me about my friend who went through that, and unfortunately that was the same night my best friend attempted suicide. this caused me to go into a depressive episode. i eventually got a therapist but it didn’t work, so soon after i got a psychiatrist who prescribed medication, none of it worked, ever. about a month after that, i was sexually assaulted. that was so very traumatic for me, and it made everything 10x worse, all my grades dropped, i stopped responding to people, i started being very easily annoyed/angry. i started becoming very aggressive ( never towards anyone). except i found myself yelling a lot more. i was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder, and major depressive disorder. i started self-harming a lot. november i attempted suicide twice, i told my psychiatrist, and i had to be hospitalized, i was put on a 51/50. after the hospitalization i was put in a program it was a partial hospitalization program. none of that worked if anything it made it worse. i was out of school for about a month, when i went back to school they demanded me to do all the wired i was supposed to do at my time in the hospital, i felt horrible i felt like they cared more about my education rather than my well being. i can do the work later but tell me. tell me how i’m supposed to do it if i’m dead. after that i got a 504 plan, but the staff seems to be annoyed at it. all this has made me feel like i’m being strangled, i’m screaming and yelling to be helped, for someone to understand but all they do is say they do understand and then prioritize my education over my life. this has made it obvious that to me at least no one in my life cares about me as a person. this has made me still feel to better than my worse, still suffering from self harm and suicidal thoughts with what feels like no support. sorry for the rant."

"I'm tired of it.

I don't live.  I exist.  

The best, most healthy thing for me would be to finally lay down and die so I can stop being so exhausted.

I've been laid off for the last few months, had next to no income, and i've been doing everything to keep a roof over my head.  I have no friends, no fun, and nothing but stress and nothing to show for it but the realization that death is the only way out to anything more preferable.

There are no therapists.  Every one i've been to isn't as effective as a fast food employee at their job, but this might be due to me just being a FUBAR Person.  Even if i went to one, they'd have to gaslight me into pretending that life is ""worth"" it, and with the present content?  There's so very little that being stabbed and falling asleep in a pool of my own blood is by far the most hopeful fantasy I have.  My least most hopeful is waking up from that."

"i am really sorry you're going through such a rough situation, noone deserves that. it sounds like a real-life pit of despair... going through surviving every second of the day just to do it again tomorrow, when instead you should be living, not just existing. ive also been there, its not fun... maybe some meds (even just vitamins) would be good to give you an extra push, but to be honest, feeling okay does take effort.   


the best thing you can do is to form an unconditionally loving bond with yourself, if you spend all these bad times with someone who understands you through and through, has seen everything youve seen and cares about you, it will seem less lonely. and it adds the extra confidence to help you make friends too. i really think thats the most important point i will make, if you are nice company to yourself, even if youre the most lonely homeless man out there, it wouldnt be so bad, everything is made better with nice company.  


and getting laid off and having no income is quite literally a stroke of bad luck, but its a coin toss, as many bad outcomes there are theres the same amount of good ones, anyone can get laid off, anyone can end up poor, but ive seen people in very bad situations, and as bad as things get... they still live, and laugh with me, and complain about how unfair it is... thats what we humans are good at; living through thick and thin, laughing with strangers, and complaining about everything and nothing. it all does suck, but you dont need to ignore that fact to be able to have a life. you just need to live long enough to get that coin toss to fall in your favour... but please belive me when i say; things change, life moves along, and curcimstances mix and cycle around. i was very much in the pit of despair of my own for over 15 years, but i lived long enough to see another coin toss. (i was always a very hopeful and stubborn person tho, and i dont get angry or hold grudges, which i think helped me a lot, idk if that info is any use to you) basically, life sucks... a lot. but if you give up on it now that its hard, you will not be here to see it change. and change is the only constant.  


friends are overrated anyways, any social interaction works, you can just complain about how long the queue is, or tell someone you like their hat. we humans are social creatures, and if you are really needing to socialise, any little positive interaction does wonders. what are friends for ? company you can have without them. you can go out without them too, and since youre talking here in this reddit, im sure theres nice people to talk to here as well.  


i really want to say more but my wifi is dying as i type this. someone once said that we didnt evolve to be happy but to survive. i belive that we evolved to survive by being happy. we are happy when we socialise. if you want, you can DM me to talk about this more, or about anything else you may want to talk about :-)"	ZappyPops	reply	na	na	na	0.9991002082824707	strong	strong	no	na	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.
So my young brother has been dealing with depression for a few years now, I think. He was diagnosed recently but I guess it’s been going for a while. He is getting more and more aggressive with my parents, every little thing makes him really really angry and irritated, it seems like he doesn’t know how to control his emotions and that makes me worry. He started taking antidepressants but stopped because he “didn’t like them” and I think he believes he doesn’t need them. He has a therapist but it seems like he hides lots of things from him. He is pretty lonely and doesn’t have many friends, never had a romantic relationship and is very antissocial. I don’t know how I can help him. I’ve tried to talk to him a few times, told him he can always talk to me when he feels like, but he’s very closed. He only complains about how annoying our parents are. He thinks his life is meaningless and I don’t know what to do. Can someone give me advice, please?

"Everyone is different, but a good place to start is probably considering how you felt when you were in her position. Consider how you were treated, talked to, and supported (or not supported). Consider what you wish people hadn't done or said, and what you wish they had.

I wish I could give you professional, psychiayry-based advice, but I'm in no way qualified. I think the most important thing is that you don't just act like it didn't happen. What's your relationship with her like? What's she like? Would she benefit from a heart-to-heart? Or do you think people are ""being too much"" for her right now? She may need the, ""I love you, I need you here, and I am always here for you."" She may benefit from a visit as soon as is appropriate, a knowing expression, and an offer to treat her to some normalcy (like a lunch outing with no bringing it up, unless she chooses to).

You obviously want to support her in the best way, or you wouldn't be here. Just make sure she knows that, and let her guide your interaction. But please - make sure she knows. I can't speak for anyone else's experience, but at my lowest points - when I was desperate and suicidal - I felt like I had no one. I knew people cared about me to some extent and would be upset if I were gone, but I didn't feel like I could rely on them for support.

"I've had problems with my sexuality for as long as I can remember and I can't understand why. When I was entering puberty I started trying to masturbate and it just wasn't working, no matter how many times I tried it. I wouldn't be able to get aroused or feel any physical sensation up until I actually had sex for the first time. 
 Before that happened, towards the end of high school I tried hooking up with several guys, but it would never get past the point of making out - I would always get distracted after a few seconds and start grossing myself out by visualizing what our mouths were doing or it would just feel wrong. 
 After I graduated high school I had my first boyfriend. Our sexual relationship progressed with the romantic one as we tried different things. First it was spooning (but spicy), then he was eating me out, but it still never felt right and I was just kind of feeling awkward or uncomfortable, maybe even ashamed or exposed (even though I was attracted to him).
 One time he was being kind of persistent and kind of tried to put it in without my permission and I immediately stormed off, feeling violated. We talked about it and he instantly apologized and after that nothing like it ever happened again. 
 The first time we had sex, I initiated it and it didn't hurt at all, I didn't bleed but I also didn't feel any physical pleasure. By that point I already knew what an orgasm felt like, I had experienced it many times during oral or just by myself. I just didn't enjoy penetration. 
 I cried after my first time but I didn't know why.
 After that, many times whenever we would have sex I would feel either discomfort, pain or I would zone out immediately after penetration even if I was very aroused up until that point. I would try to force myself to push through it out of guilt that he wouldn't enjoy having sex with me otherwise, but I would always end up feeling like I was being assaulted and crying and we would stop and he would calm me down.
 He asked me many times if I had been a victim of SA in the past and told me that anytime things would start going towards penetration during sex he would see the look in my eyes immediately shift from arousal to fear. He described the feeling as if my vagina literally closed up and wouldn't let him in.
 I've never really liked people getting in my personal space and a year after we've broken up, I still have the same problem and it might even be getting worse. I feel like just thinking about someone sexually immediately makes me anxious. 
 I haven't had a lot of men surrounding me in my childhood but being raped has always been my biggest fear, to the point that I remember staying up at night being scared someone might break in and rape me (as a child or pre-teen). 

TLDR; I'm scared of penetration during sex for no apparent reason and the overall idea of being sexual with someone either grosses me out or gives me anxiety. That, along with my intuition and some other factors, makes me question if it's possible I've been a victim of SA but don't remember it."

If you would like to chat feel free to DM, I have personal experience with blocked out sexual trauma, and I’d be willing to try to help you understand what’s going on in your head and body a bit more. In general, yes it is possible to block out certain trauma and “forget”. But I don’t think that it’s always beneficial to operate on that system. Memories are complex, and somewhat unreliable. Regardless of possible physical trauma, the mental trauma and physical reaction to it is what’s currently affecting you.

Yeah, I've tried to investigate it in a way, since I also struggle with depression and anxiety and initially figured it might have something to do with that.

I like oral sex. I love foreplay. When it comes down to being intimate, it's not the sexual act I have an issue with, but rather just penetration. And it's not just plain boredom or something, I feel actual fear whenever I know he's about to do it. I also masturbate quite often and I do feel the need for sexual relief, so I think that kind of rules out asexuality, although I have considered that explanation as well.

Throw away sorry. I’m 26f. I think I’m entering into psychosis but I’m not sure. I keep hearing my name being called whispered (especially when the tv is on), I keep seeing shadow people with glowing eyes out of the corner of my eye, or like in front of me but disappear quickly if I look at them, sometimes I’ll see something behind me in the mirror quickly, sometimes I’ll see this misty red and brown figure that pops up, I feel anxious and paranoid a lot, I’ll see little beings in my apartment that hang out, sometimes ilk see things in my phone too like if I’m scrolling quickly I’ll see something with glowing eyes. I tried looking at symptoms for this online but I didn’t find an exact match. Sometimes I’ll see little glowing gold things. Thank you if you read this.

I always quit within a few days. I'm trying. But my anxiety gets the better of me, I become paralyzed with paranoia and then isolate myself in my room again. I live in a constant state of imprisonment of my own mind. I recently got a new job. I like my managers. But I've worked literally 2 hours, and can't return. I tried explaining to my now ex that I can't force my brain to do anything it doesn't allow me to do. He claimed it's excuses to be lazy. I'm on meds but seroquel knocks me out so I can't take it and then go to work. I talked to my brain friend (person in my head.. she is like a floating black cloak with a old lady face) Martha about it who gave good advice about just getting on social security for it.

I'm sorry for this struggle you are engaged in.  I think it might be worth it to explore what hidden biases you have that are making it difficult for you to accept the idea of going on social security.  From what I understand your eventual payments go back to the date you first apply, so it's best to go ahead and apply and start the process rolling.  If you get denied then start the appeals.  When you eventually get accepted that's great. In the meantime never let your self-worth be defined by your ability to perform paid duties on a dependable schedule.  You didn't ask for this.  You're not lazy.  You're entitled to the support you need and we ALL are better off if you're getting all the services available to help keep you stable and engaging in self-care.		follow-up	na	na	na	0.9991432428359985	strong	no	no	na	MentalHealthSupport	failed

"Hi, this is super long. It's ok to read in small chunks. 

I'm a triple dip ice cream. A mental health consumer who is also a family caregiver to a consumer and a (retired) mental health professional. 

I'll take too many words to do it, but I can help I hope.

I've been where you are, I've cared for family where you are, I've been in your partners shoes, and I've been opposite you in a treatment meeting or hospital. Yes, I'm ancient but not a boomer. Hopefully being 24 years further down the road from where you are, my experience will be helpful to you.

1) Hang in there because you have a lot of insight & intelligence and both of those can work to your advantage.

2) Hang in there because recovery is a process, and what you are calling failures are to a good psychosocial rehabilitation provider useful experience to find what will work for you.

3) Broken brains need a multidisciplinary health team. It sounds like you are in the USA? That does make it harder but not impossible. Think of it as building your team if you like sports or building your army, or your tribe...the important thing is you don't have to do this alone.

My first thought was that you need to give yourself a pat on the back for actually writing & posting! That is huge!! 😀

And you wrote so amazingly clearly and honestly!! This, your original post could be a textbook example to teach others what health journaling, symptom reporting, and even persuasive essay writing is all about! ✍️ You have talent, kiddo! 

For the rest of your life, you will always be able to come back here to Reddit and reread your post and those all of us made. I still read mine from alt.mentalillness.help once a year. (It's from January 1995, the internet was tiny back then).

Today you discovered the sheer volume & power of peer support. 

You found people with your exact diagnosis code illness, people who overcame the struggle to live a life worth living with meaning & value, even one complex spoonie triple dip who came back from worse than where you are now to become a well paid mental health professional and more. 

You did that. 
All by yourself, while stuck in bed, frustrated by the Pica symptom that caused you to eat a piece of chalk. 

On a not great day, in a not great situation, you discovered multiple peers who have walked your walk and who have time & ability to talk with you. You found an ex provider who can give you some leads to build a real cohort / tribe / team / army to build the kind of recovery, stability, life you want.

Congrats, kid! 🏆🏆🏆
That took me like way longer than 8 years.

The title is self-explanatory.

 I was neglected and emotionally abused as a child. My parents were around, and still are, but they didn't ever acknowledge me, seemingly only ever having time for my siblings. I've displayed symptoms of antisocial personality disorder since I was around 12. (I am now 19, female) Around age 9 I discovered shock sites and I became addicted. For years I'd watch hours upon hours of murder, suicide, torture, basically anything and everything. When I was bored, I'd introduce my friends online to a ""friend"" of mine, which was obviously just me on a different account. I guess they believed me though. I'd lie and convince them to trust the ""friend"" with secrets, I'd become best friends with them and even create relationships with some. Once I got bored, I'd write a suicide note or something in a group chat and abandon the account I used to talk to them on.

My best friend is the reason why I haven't just died yet, despite the times I've tried. We believe I have a combination of ASPD, Harm OCD, and autism. We know that I am autistic, and the mixture of aspd and harm ocd describes me perfectly. 

Sometimes I have bouts of psychosis. I get auditory hallucinations and sometimes I'll vaguely see something that isn't there. I get so paranoid that I'll hide in my closet and refuse to move for hours. I have nonstop intrusive thoughts. Killing, raping, torturing, everything. I could go into more detail. but then when would I stop? It's constant. Nothing but violence in my mind. There have been times when I stood in my parents bedrooms while they slept, knives in hand. I'd be thinking about it, how I would kill them and it would be revenge for how they treat me. The only reason why I haven't is because I know I wouldn't be able to cover my tracks, I know I wouldn't be able to pretend to care. I often stop on the sides of the road to look and prod at roadkill. Once I went out to specifically get a bird that I hit the day before, but it was gone. I hate animals. They are too warm and move too much. I haven't had any pets but if I did, I'm certain I would've killed them.

I want to hurt people. I want to hurt myself. It's all I think about anymore. I don't feel any emotions anymore. Everything is a lie. All I do is lie. I don't even want to get better, I really don't care. 

I have been getting increasingly worse the past few months. I don't know how much longer I can contain myself.

"Hey, I don’t know you but I wanted to introduce myself. I’m Brandonn. I’m a clinically diagnosed Psychopath. I have BPD that’s was previously misdiagnosed as ASPD. I just wanted to say I hear you. I see you. 

But I don’t think you have ASPD. It’s important to note a few things. 

1. You’re a self-identified, woman. Psychopathy with ASPD is present in less than 1% of women in the world. 

2. A Psychopath cannot be made. They are born. This isn’t to invalidate any hardships you’ve experienced but to give you more perspective. 

3. You stated you have OCD and Autism. That alone would explain the intrusive thoughts, irrational behaviors, and constant pathologizing of yourself. 

4. You used a lot of stereotypes to classify people with mood disorders that were harmful and aren’t actually experienced by us. 

5. Much of what you explained are misguided coping mechanisms and trauma responses. 

This is purely my opinion, you likely have traits of sociopathy with harm ideations. As you stated, your commorbidities and I resolved traumas have compounded into your behaviors. Therapy or talk therapy would not be enough. I would recommend cognitive behavioral as well as socialized therapies. Mental health is not a checklist where you see how many boxes you fill. It’s important to think of it on a spectrum. Many diagnosis overlap on that spectrum and share a lot of symptoms which is why misdiagnoses is so common and it’s imperative not to self diagnose. Giving someone an antipsychotic when they needed an antidepressant would be extremely harmful and alter brain chemistry, stunt development, or even unalive them. 

I’m proud of you for reaching out and being so candid and vulnerable. Something ASPD cannot do. You’re a lot more “normal” than you think you are, but I do urge you to find someone you trust (preferably a psychiatrist or behavioral therapist).

That made me hallucinate, weird black streaks that were almost like fast whisps of smoke in the corner of my vision. 
Try.... asking for apriprazole ( abilify)
Its an antipsychotic mood stabilizer.
Also, we see you. 

You know what you have to do, you just dont care to do it because right now, your day to day is working for you. 

Chaos is the catalyst for change, and getting help and doing the work is a scary level of chaos to introduce into your self-proclaimed apathetic life. 

The biggest fear for those of us with really heavy mental health issues is losing autonomy. Not trying to come off as judgemental, but maybe the real reason you arent seeking help is fear of losing control and access to your potential victims? Just a thought. 

Regardless, seek help. Actively.

hold yourself accountable.

"hi, this is sera ! 

A few corrections, I do not believe I am a psychopath. I believe I have ASPD, I believe I am a sociopath due to my upbringing and already predisposed nature to it. 
I don’t have a mood disorder at all, and I’m not trying to say anything about the stereotypes of it. 
I think I have a personality disorder, and once again not trying to say any stereotypes. What I have is a complete lack of sympathy and a very low amount of empathy, and because of my past I am very intent on hurting others because of that past and I don’t care if I hurt them, because of the lack of empathy and sympathy 
My goals for getting better and getting help are mostly just for myself, since jail would suck (lol) or I’d end up unaliving myself, which would also suck. 

I am on an antidepressant currently, I have been for awhile. Where I live mental health help is not super available so, my doctors kinda just gave me sertraline to help. I’ve been through CBT and it doesn’t work for me, or at least the therapists I’ve been with don’t help at all.

Healthcare student here. Stopping your mood medications abruptly like the other commenter had mentioned can exacerbate your former symptoms before you initiated the medication. This is dependent on how long you have been taking the medication and how you are currently doing on it. It is recommended to gradually stop the medication by reducing the dose if the time frame was shorter than what is recommended per guidelines. Do you know if you are eligible for any federal insurance rather than one offered by an employer or through your parents?

Stopping them suddenly can actually be quite bad for the brain so I’ve read. For example you may start to dissociate or memory loss, but everyone’s different and it doesn’t effect everyone like this.

Yup. I’m 23 with adhd, major persistent depressive disorder, general anxiety, bipolar depression, also have some auto immune disorder that dr’s can’t figure out what it is but causes chronic fatigue that I can’t fight even tho I’m on 60mg vyvanse, and am on about 10 pills I take daily. But yet I run a pharmacy full time. I just do it. It’s miserable. I wake up everyday dreading work and it gets worse by the time I get to work. But I’m just as miserable if I use a FMLA day to call into work and stay home all day alone because then I’m stuck in being in my head all day. So far my best coping skill is opposite action, even though I don’t want to wake up and go to work I just do it. And whenever I notice my intrusive thoughts at work/throughout the day, I try my best to acknowledge them so I can try to do something to get my mind off of them.		reply	na	na	na	0.9953847527503967	no	strong	no	na	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.
I completely understand. When I worked 40 hours a week Monday through Friday, I would get so depressed. Everyone would tell me I was lucky, holidays and weekends off always, set schedule, pretty office, no one would think it could make someone suffer from their mental illness. What has helped me is finding a job that gives me more days off. I prefer to work 3 days 12 hr shifts (nurse) bc that way I can focus those 3 days on work and then I have 4 DAYS for myself, my mental health, my gym, etc. I know, it sounds crazy, 12 hrs, but think about it, less days in traffic, you’re going to go anyways, most companies give multiple breaks. I think its a great alternative is you cannot switch to a part time due to financial reasons. I also recommend a job in which you move around. Sedentary jobs like office jobs depress me, jobs in which I move around feels likes exercise (exercise is a natural antidepressant). Hope this helps and I hope your mental health gets better.		reply	na	na	na	0.9953847527503967	weak	strong	no	na	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.

"UPDATE: thank you for the continuous support. Every once in a while I get a new comment or see one I hadn't read in full yet. One thing I'm sure of now, is no matter how you live or who you are, people want you here. And they want you to want to be here too, and even if their words are just another spoonful of love keeping you alive another day, that's not a sign of your life dwindling. There is a feast of life out there waiting for you. It will wait for you as long as you need, while you rest for now. Nearly whole world wants better circumstances for each other, so just sit tight, put on a song you love, and breathe for right now. Even just tonight. Let others figure it out for now, and breathe. <3

Hey strangers of the internet can you tell me I deserve to be alive even if I'm poor and stupid and sick? I'm dealing with suicidal thoughts. I can't turn to anyone in my life right now, they are either too overwhelmed or have a history of invalidating me directly. Someone I love very dearly just outright told me they resent me for not bringing in enough money (they're right) after I told them I'm trying to survive.

I've even turned to a parent who was abusive when I was a kid for comfort. But I'd just like someone to tell me they care about me when it they don't know me. Thank you. <3 

If you don't know what to say just tell me about your favourite band or your day! Thanks again.

EDIT: I'm saving every single comment to re-read. Thank you. Truly. These are words I've always wanted to hear."	ladyalot	post	35.29922971346143	female	White	0.0013004811480641365	na	na	na	33	MentalHealthSupport	failed
You absolutely deserve to live, I’m so sorry someone told you they resent you. I know this might be hard to hear but maybe they’re not supposed to be in your life, it doesn’t sound like they’re respecting the fact you’re a human being, humans all struggle & the amount of money you have the ability to make is mostly beyond your control. Everyone deserves to be respected & cares about, including you. There will be someone in your life who cares about you & even if there isn’t, then that’s a them problem, not a you problem. You have us internet strangers, we care. A dog you perhaps pet one time will have cared about you when you made its day. The friends you had in school will have cared about you. The people in your life who struggle to outwardly show emotions care about you. A coworker will care about you. If you need another reason to live because you genuinely have no personal reason keeping you alive, then I hope the reasons above might help? You deserve to live. Life gets better. Things will get better, but if you end it now, you’ll be leaving on a low note & you’ll never get to see things become better for yourself. In a few years you can look back & think of how proud of yourself you are because of how far you’ve come.	ladyalot	reply	na	na	na	0.0013004811480641365	strong	no	no	na	MentalHealthSupport	failed

It's kinda impossible to put things in words in order to explain about my life struggles since i was born. I feel like I'm the unluckiest cursed person on this planet. I hate life way too much. I feel like I'm a stranger in a dark world where i don't belong to. I feel unloved and lonely and feel like nobody truly loves me. No matter what I've always tended to motivate and inspire myself cuz life ain't only about bad things. There r definitely good things waiting on us and they all need time to come into our lives. I always remind myself with good things that r yet to come in my life journey. Ur not alone dear buddy, we're all with u and ur in our prayers🤲🏻❤️‍🩹.

"Ladyalot,
You deserve to thrive. You are here with purpose. You have value in this world and I will personally be broken hearted if you choose not to be here anymore. 
We dont make permanent choices for temporary problems, and every problem is temporary. 
You are so extremely brave and smart. You thought to reach out when you needed it, and I am so proud of you for that. That is super hard to do, and I know from personal experience it takes a lot of energy to reach out!
I want you to remember every time you get the chance, to look up at the sky above you, and know that when I can, I do too, and even though I may never meet you in person, I will be thinking about you and hoping you are doing better while we share space under this sky together. 
You deserve joy. I know its hard to find when the world is so damn heavy. I try to find it in smelling the flowers at every market I go to, or smiling when I hear a small bird trill. Maybe you can find something small and simple in the world that brings you joy when you find it. That really helps me get through sometimes. 
I may not know you, But I know you matter.
So take a deep breath in your nose,  remove your tongue from the roof of your mouth, let your shoulders down, and breath out through your mouth. 
You are going to get through this and we are HERE for you.

You are more valid than any reason you have not to live. You're more valid than anything that makes you feel bad or ashamed of yourself. Your right to live a full and beautiful life is just as important as anyone else's. People who don't have the patience or love to even sit down and talk to you are people who don't deserve to even talk to you. You have a beating heart, just like all the other random internet people, you matter regardless of whoever or whatever makes you think you do, why? Because you have a beating heart. That's enough to deserve love. Attention. A shoulder to cry on. Or a ear to listen. If money is a bigger priority than your well-being, then let that person go stress about money on their own, while you focus on your own well-being. Do your best to survive. Do your best to be happy. Do your best to find and talk to people that make you happy. I don't know you, I might never know you, though as long as I know you still have a beating heart, and you're still relatively okay, I'm happy for you. 💙	ladyalot	reply	na	na	na	0.0013004811480641365	weak	no	no	na	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.

We are here on earth to have our ups and downs, having this journey of being a human.

That's what I've been practicing for a long time: not running away from any of my experiences, circumstances, feelings but rather letting them come to me through waves after waves and wash me over until they all feel heard and deliver their messages to me, to my soul.

We should always remember that we were all born alone and we'll die alone. Sometimes ppl want to meet and be with someone that matches them for the rest of their lifetime. I'm not talking on behalf of anyone but i believe we can survive alone and it's not necessary to have a life partner. We don't need to waste our time waiting on someone to come into our life in such world. So continue ur life without waiting for a partner. See if over time someone comes into ur life and if they rlly seem to match u and they agree to be with u, then only complete ur life with them. But if none happens, don't bring urself down just bcuz u don't have somebody special. Ur enough for urself. With or without anybody, u can life ur life the way u want. Luv and appreciate urself unconditionally. Personally, I'd never dream of someone to be with.

"My dad just died and my mom wants me to hang out with her all the time. I''ve never liked doing casual things with her, and I'm very independent.

I don't know how to tell her to leave me alone. The best relationship we ever had was when I lived in another state. I moved back because of my dad, but now he's gone. 

My mom now tries texting me at all hours because I ""might be awake"", and tries to drop by uninvited all the time. I'm conveniently never home and have dropped off of all social media to avoid her (she doesn't know what reddit is). 

Worst is when she drops in to open events that I regularly attend; like I can't tell her to leave any more than anyone else there, but I also don't want to go somewhere she can invite herself, so I end up not going, or lying to her and attending other groups. 

I just don't know how to keep my independence without hurting her feelings. I get that she's lonely, but I don't want to be her go-to person. 

Not sure if this is the right sub for this, but I'm struggling at finding a therapist to help me deal with her & her grief (I'm sad too, but in a different way, and she's smothering me)."	squirrelbus	post	22.394289072872095	male	White	0.9993832111358643	na	na	na	1	MentalHealthSupport	failed
Oh, I feel your pain. My parents got married when they were 19, and so when my dad died at age 58, my mom had no clue how to live or what to do with herself, and it was rough for a while. Got her to go visit with her family a lot. Got her into a local photography class. She travels. Basically, all these things she didn't do when she was married. Your level of independence can be a good example for her so use your empathy and help guide her towards independence while making sure you keep commenting on how important that is for you and you want her to feel the same way.	squirrelbus	reply	na	na	na	0.9993832111358643	weak	strong	no	na	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.

My first job I struggled hard to let go of that job as I felt I was going to be seen as a failure if I quit by both my coworkers and family members. I stuck it through meanwhile going to school but I was really suicidal that my mom who lives in a different state told me to quit and she’d help me out financially because she was scared I was going to do something to myself. I quit and left the state for months, came back and focused on school. Once the semester was over my dad kinda got tired of seeing me at home so he told me to find a job. I landed a lot of interviews in to which I got a job. I stayed there basically once the pandemic started in 2019ish 2020 and I think the pandemic is what spiked me to have a really bad time going into work because I was scared of catching the virus. I was equally going through a lot of family stuff which I was coming to realize my mom just wasn’t a good person and a lot of my childhood traumas started coming to surface which caused a lot of emotion. I began to puke every day before work, or even at work because I was so anxious. I started to land a lot in the hospital because of my anxiety felt so real. My last straw before quitting was when I woke up one morning and I felt like I was going insane looking at the time knowing I had to go to work but also having a panic attack where I felt like I was having a heart attack. I put my two weeks in and have been unemployed ever since. I do work however with my dad and also my uncles family owned business this isn’t an every day thing basically Saturday’s sometimes Sunday’s but it’s rare. 
Last month I worked one week where I worked Friday and Monday with my uncle  and Saturday and Sunday with my dad. So 4 days back to back, and on day two I was already puking before work as I used to before my old job. I was off my anxiety and bipolar medication that week as it was the holidays and I wasn’t feeling it. I’m back on them and I hope it helps with the anxiety feeling of going to work or just being away from home. 

I really want my body to stop being in fight or flight mode whenever I need to go to work. Like for example, and this can apply to multiple if not all the times it happens. But whenever I go to sleep everything keeps me up but when I do end up sleeping and if I wake up once I’m already sweating from how nervous my body feels knowing I have x amount of hours to sleep because I woke up early within the night. There’s times I wake up at 4 and have to be up by 7 and I’m just awake throughout that time sweating in bed. I do have a therapist but I really don’t know what to tell her, but I also would like other. Peoples advice as that is always appreciated."	bitchlung	post	13.088406664865598	male	White	0.01645708829164505	na	na	na	1	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.
I don't know if i have advice hun but i do have similar issues. My current job involves healthcare and having to hear people cry and scream and beg for their lives is horrible. Who is an insurance company to deny someone life dependent meds. Doesnt help that im going thru the exact same thing for my insulin. Its almost like would i rather hear this again all day or take a permanent nap? Its so incredibly damaging to my mental health.

"I'm 21 years old . I have attempted suicide thrice already . 

My first was when I was 11 after I was molested by a male teacher and accused of seducing him by my teachers and mother .
My second was when I failed 3 subjects in 8th grade and my parents made me feel like my life is over 

My third was when my mother started calling me a prostitute after she found out I was in a relationship by hacking into my WhatsApp chats . And I say 'started' because she never stopped calling me that even though that relationship ended a year ago and IT BLOODY HURTS 

My GPA is going down due to my mental health and so are my chances to land a job . 

My mother has told me that she is tired of wasting money on me and wants to use the money to send my brother abroad instead. 

My parents treat me like their personal marriage counselor whose advice they always want but never follow. 

I have lost 2 of my closest friends last year , 1 to cardiac arrest and 1 to suicide

Lastly I want to say that I ended my relationship because at a certain point we realised we are simply trauma bonded . He is planning to die and I don't think I've it in me to watch a third person I so deeply care about pass right in front of me.

I'm writing this because I INTEND TO KILL MYSELF too . I have tried therapy as long as I could afford it . I have tried hobbies and mindfulness and meditation and everything I could think of and afford. I know a long vacation would help but I'm out of money and my parents obviously won't fund it so I'M DONE. 
I'M DONE . I'M TIRED AND I'M EXHAUSTED.

If you're reading this , it would a miracle because reddit has never approved any of my posts but if it does reach you , send some wisdom my way . And if it reaches me in time and if it helps , maybe , just maybe I'll change my mind . 

I have told you why I wanna die . Show me why I shouldn't.





Update 1:(14 January 2023) Today is my last night in my parents house. This was supposed to be the last night of my life. I intended to kill myself tomorrow but given that I've decided to give it one last try , I won't . Not yet . I'm flying back to my hostel tomorrow . 

My warden is abusive and my flatmates bully me for my hormonal problems . I'm really determined to turn my life around this time or die trying. In an attempt to surround myself with good people and live in a healthy environment, I've decided to move into a 1BR apartment with a friend. 

I intend to finish college and take professional courses to boost my resume . I had emotionally moved on from this family long ago . It's time I manifest it. I'm just waiting to get a job . 

I've fixed up my resume and I apply to multiple fresher jobs daily. I've made it a habit now. I passed the screening test in one company and they are yet to schedule a job interview for me. If that goes well , I'm positive, I'll get the job . The day I get a job , I'll cut off my family




Update 2 : (27February 2023) I can't begin to explain how much my life has turned around in the last 1 month. So I didn't get the initial job I was shortlisted for and I was so distraught and disheartened, I stopped giving a fuck. For a good 2 weeks ai barely got out of bed, starved myself and then came the final ultimatun from my family. 

I turn 21 in March which is the legal age of marriage in my country and they wanted me to go back to their house and marry a stranger. Typical arrange marriage bullshit. This was 3 weeks ago. I say fuck this and start revaluating my resume. Fixed up some things and reached out to my college placement cell. I applied for jobs in. 3 companies. Got shortlisted for all 3 and got the job in the 2 nd company I had applied to. Not only did I get the job, I also got a part time position because they were really impressed by my final interview and in the end I walked out with the highest package among all the other 4 people who were selected. 

The company is great. Work culture is awesome. The pay is as generous as it can be for an average fresher like me. Also it's an interesting job in the department I wanted. 

Giving up is definitely not an option anymore. I just got my official offer letter an hour ago. Signed the lease to my new apartment far away from the abusive family and most importantly I am starting to save up for therapy. 

There will be one last update on this post. I'm so excited to share my progress with y'all. Thank you so much for all the support. I couldn't have done it without you🧡"	phoenixflyaway	post	21.417531106718847	female	White	0.9919400811195374	na	na	na	26	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.
" First, let me say that my heart goes out to you in a big way, and the extreme pain you're feeling makes sense given everything you've described experiencing thus far in life. I wish I could give you a big hug and let you know I see you and you are loved. 
 You sound like a beautiful human being who was seriously let down by the people meant to love and protect you in life, and this is NOT your fault. Your parents are very toxic and have absolutely mistreated you. That being said, I would hate for this world to lose you and all the gifts you bring to it. 
 Please do me this favor and hold off on any suicide plans until you get through the intensity of this grieving process and find a way to get out of the toxic environment you've been dealing with. Even if you have to leave school and take a job to support yourself, you may find yourself happier when you can get some distance between you and the people who aren't loving toward you. 
 Also, please try to build a community of supportive people you can rely on. I highly recommend finding a support group near your and even one online. You are a survivor of sexual assault and no matter what your mom says, it is never the fault of a powerless 11 year old child when an adult mistreats them. You deserved justice and support, and I'm so sorry that you didn't get it 10 years ago when this took place. There are many other survivors worldwide that could offer support and guidance as to what to do next to move forward and go from surviving to thriving. 
 You have beautiful gifts and talents that only you can offer the world. In this day and age, you can learn nearly anything online and shoot videos on your phone. You could create a short film to help you process some of your pain, and I'm sure many people would relate to it. Your story could potentially save the life of another person going through similar circumstances. Please don't let the unloving actions of other people rob you of your life. We need you here. I'm sending you love and healing prayer. ❤️"	phoenixflyaway	reply	na	na	na	0.9919400811195374	strong	no	no	na	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.
"Hello everyone, I just wanted to say I'm really overwhelmed by the warm responses I've received. I'm grateful to each and everyone of you , even the ones who personally reached out to me . 

This morning my dad made it very clear to me that he will not take any financial responsibility for me after I graduate. He's done funding a loser . He also told me to give up on making stupid films and study instead to fix my GPA. Some of my shoots extend at least 8-10hrs . He asked the warden to basically keep me under house arrest . (Can't find the right term but I hope you get the idea) 

Even if I were to hope that things will get better , I don't see anything manifesting right away . I need some professional advice regarding how to navigate my career right now . 

I'M GOING TO GIVE IT ONE LAST TRY BUT I REALLY NEED SOME ADVICE ON HOW TO GET A JOB AND WHAT ARE MY OPTIONS REALLY?

Please guide me if you can . I've a few weeks of experience in content writing, data analytics, film direction and scripting. Where do I stand and where do I go from here ? 

If any of your advice is doable , I'll give it my all . Do give advice with adherence to the fact that I live in India so the options available to me are different than those in the West .

 I'll wait a few days . I've flight booked for a certain place on this sunday.  If I board that flight , consider me dead . I'll keep y'all updated.

"Hey. This is my first time ever posting or commenting on Reddit (or really any social media for that matter), because I have pretty bad social anxiety that extends to social media, and I'm doing it now because of how much I don't want you to do this.

I'm so sorry, you've been through so much, I can't even imagine. I don't really honestly know what to say to you, all I can say is that I'm so sorry, this isn't fair to you. But please, don't end it. It seems from the end of that post that as much as you want it to end, more than anything you want a reason to live. Is that accurate?

You mentioned GPA, which leads me to believe that you are in college or in some form of school. I don't know if your school has this, but lots of schools have free or very reduced cost therapy or counseling. I know you said you've tried it before, but trying it again with a new person and at reduced cost is very likely to help. Please, please look into that. Even if they don't, they may have a way to get it if you specifically email saying that you're actively suicidal and need support now. School can be a great tool in that way. I myself get therapy outside of school but know plenty of people who get it through school, and it is incredibly helpful. Even if you are worried about parents finding out and you live with them, maybe you can say you joined a new after-school club, or have a standing time to hang out with friends at a certain time each week, or something like that. Also, they may be able to get you in touch with someone who can provide anti-depressants. Obviously, real-life stuff and trauma is your main issue, but it may be able to ease some of the pain while you can find other ways to seek treatment.

Please, please don't do it. Please. I know, trust me, I know how difficult it is to reach out for help, but please reach out to a friend or someone like that. I know you've lost some of your closest ones, but the way that you phrased it leads me to believe you have more. Even a teacher in school. Please. They can help find ways to distance you from your mother, support you. You don't have to deal with this alone. You can reach out to me, genuinely. If all else that I've said here fails, please reach out to me.

Also, please forgive me if I'm overstepping, but your mother seems to be the source of many over your problems. It's okay to go no contact or low contact with her. You can talk to friends, teachers, administration. They can find ways to support you through that.

Honestly, I don't know what to say. Just know that I really hope you don't do this. I know how tired and done you are, but it also seems like a small part of you doesn't want it to end quite yet. Listen to that small part. Please, please don't do it. I know I'm just a 19-year-old stranger, but this 19-year-old stranger hopes you stay alive. Please dm me if you want to talk more one-on-one (or reply to me here if that makes you more comfortable)."	phoenixflyaway	reply	na	na	na	0.9919400811195374	strong	strong	no	na	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.
Listen, I can’t say that I know how it feels to go through what your going through because I don’t, but what I can tell you, is that you have people here who I’m sure would like to help you change your mind. You do have to give it a bit of time which ik sucks. I’m so sorry to hear that you’ve had such a rough run, but that doesn’t mean it has to end here. No one deserves to be treated as you have, and yet I wish I could say more that could help change your mind or make you feel better. I guess all I can say is, you’re loved wether you realize it or not, and I know how cliché that sounds but it’s true. I don’t know if this will help change your mind in its entirety, but, what I am hoping is that maybe I can talk you off the ledge your on, and make you at least re-consider your choices here for a brief moment!❤️	phoenixflyaway	reply	na	na	na	0.9919400811195374	weak	no	no	na	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.

"Okay

First General Life Advice: Life usually becomes very hard after your teenage years and all you doing is blaming others and portraying yourself as victim in everything. Stop this victim shit you are not the victim I know mental health makes it very hard to calm yourself but start with bare minimum you can manage and start progressively overloading.  Crying, being depressed, stress is part of life make it okay as life is happening to you. If you crying and being depressed for a day but you doing this same-thing after a week then its your character problem. Most people blame and keep on living miserable life for the lifetime. Start with doing improving your health. Choose any exercise and try to do it every single day. It will teach you discipline and keep your health good as-well.

&#x200B;

Second Career Advice: You look like you are from India and let me be brutally honest job market is lowest atm in last few years. It will be hard to get calls in these months and I am hoping it improves in next 6-8 months. So don't have any expectation for 6-8 months. I saw your resume you can content write and there is always a need for content in SEO market. Till these 6-8 months you can start taking content-writing work on many SEOForums(BHW, HF etc), SEOClers, Fiverr etc. You will be working hard for this but you can manage your emotions by taking gigs only when you feel like it. Go to these places and see what people are charging and you can try to undercut or be creative in your own way etc etc. 

&#x200B;

GOOD LUCK and hope you don't suicide because its an action of passion and a close relative of mine did that by hanging and there were a lot of nail marks around his neck. Basically in his ending moment he was scratching the area around his neck to go back but sadly he was beyond saving at that point.

&#x200B;

P.S: Stay away from any drug in mental health issues."	phoenixflyaway	reply	na	na	na	0.9919400811195374	weak	no	no	na	MentalHealthSupport	failed
"This is going to be long but it would be nice if you read through. 

I do not want to die . But I don't see a purpose in surviving. I'm tired of just 'getting by' . My mother is a diagnosed aggressive narcissist and my dad is a pessimistic one.

As a psychology student I was always aware of what exactly I needed to do if I wanted to have a healthy life very early on  . I needed to emotionally and financially cut them off. I wasn't going to get anywhere if I couldn't do either of those two. 

It took me 3 years but I was finally able to cut them off emotionally. I do not share emotionally significant detail of my life with them . I do not keep any emotional expectations from them but the financial part , I simply can't seem to sort. 

They make me feel guilty for spending on basic needs like food and clothing to the point that I ended up starving my self and went 12kgs/26.5pounds underweight . They say I should be grateful that they provide a roof over my head and it's not like they are saying that now , they have been saying that forever. Never let me forget I'm not welcome here. 

I tried to find a job but as a fresher with skills at the intermediate lwvel at best and a 4.8 GPA , I'm practically trash in the Indian job market . It's been 6 months and I'm nowhere near finding a job . I can't even land an interview for a part time job that's how bad it is. 

The hostel I live at right now , the warden is very controlling and practically a bully . She overcharges at least Rs10000 more than the other hostels in the area giving the same or better facilities. She cheats and overcharges from electricity bills and she bullies me specifically for being weak and depressed . My father told her I have a UTI (I'm not sure why) and she gossiped about it with the whole hostel. There is not one person in the hostel who hasn't joked about it on my face also they are of the assumption that a UTI can only occur from sex...simple misinformation I suppose. 

The warden keeps track of everytime we go out(the exact timings) and has cameras pretty much everywhere except the bedrooms. She threatens me that if I were to spend such long hours outdoors , she will inform my parents of how much time I spend out . You see I was already making a short film . Filming was outdoors and far away from my hostel so travelling took up time  Shooting hours were long . I'm the director so I had to be present throughout. There is a curfew of 10pm in the hostel . We barely got enough hours of footage in a day and somw days I would not be able to make it by 10 . After the threats I had to ahelf the film because we couldn't finish filming. I wasn't allowed out of the hostel because 'only whores stay out that late' . I don't know why everybody assumes I'm a whore. It's not like I'm going around in bikinis all day either . I always wear baggy clothes and sneakers. 

I knew moving in with my partner would help a lot emotionally and professionally since we both were working together on the film (it was my last hope honestly) But my parents feel I don't deserve that freedom because of my low GPA . (Not like they were going to allow it before. ) The GPA gave them an excuse to control me like they used to when I lived in their house. Now as much as I hate them I don't have it in me to blackmail them into letting me get out . They complain about how much my warden overcharges all the time and yet refuse to let me leave because she keeps them informed of my lifestyle. 

I know the prying will not stop until I cut them off completely and I know I'm not getting a job anytime soon . My parents don't intend to pay for my education further. 

Even if I wanted to fix anything, I don't know where to start . My professors do not bother with our personal problems. I go to a government college. They do the bare minimum of reading a paragraph from a random book each class and leaving. 

Any sensible adult I have approached in the last few years for direction and advice has the generic response of ' if you're feeling so depressed, just be happy' 

India takes mental health very lightly so I knew I needed to get out if I wanted to at least 'just be happy' . I had a genuine chance 3years ago . I got into York University with a scholarship but my parents refused to pay for my living expenses abroad and the visa fees too . 

I had another chance last year , got selected for a research internship abroad . They keep all my government ids with them including passport claiming they will hand them all over when I'm ' mature enough'. They refused to handover my passport when I needed it for documentation and I eventually lost my opportunity. 

It's very clear to me that even if I get chances to fix my life , I won't be able to take them . Any attempt at financial freedom is met with utmost disgust and strict action from my parents. There's just no way out of this . 

If this were a developed country, I could have at least had access to proper mental health services but in developing countries like India , therapy (at least affordable therapy that is) and helplines are a joke . This is the ground reality."	phoenixflyaway	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9919400811195374	weak	strong	no	na	MentalHealthSupport	ethnicity: south asian, age: early 20s, gender: female, explanation: the author is in india, thus indicating south asian ethnicity, and mentions being a student and trying to find a job (usually activities for individuals in their early twenties). the mention of a uti and how it's perceived among her peers suggests she is a female, as this health issue is more commonly associated with women.

"Okay, also, to show you why you shouldn't: For a long time, I felt hopeless. I was exhausted. I had no real friends I felt real with, I was in so much pain, and I couldn't remember the last instant in which I had been happy. For years I felt this way. Eventually, I got help. I made more friends, I was honest with them about how I felt, and now, while it hasn't been long enough that I'm recovered or anything, I feel so much better. It really, truly, does get better. I know how hard it is to believe when you're deep in it, and one always thinks ""but I'm the exception,"" but it's true.

If you feel like you truly can't handle it even with all this, call the police, please.

Oh, and one more thing, one thing that helped me a LOT was a change of environment. Not everyone can do that, but if you can think of any way to make that happen, even if not right now some time in the future, that may be key. It was life-changing for me.

God, I wish I knew what to say, but I honestly don't. Just, please don't do it."	phoenixflyaway	reply	na	na	na	0.9919400811195374	no	strong	no	na	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.

"Your career advice is really helpful . Tahnks for that🖤 

As for life advice , I'll have to diagree. I've met many people like you in real life and on the internet who like to accuse me or people like me of victim blaming. You don't know me personally. All you know about me is from that little desperate note I've put up here . Now it may seem bogus to you but It took a lot of courage to put that up here and believe me I would be dead by now if not for the infinite kindness I've received in the comments and private messages after putting up this note. That's why I'm so glad I did . 

Your opening line was 'life gets hard after teenage years' but if you really read what I've written, my whole life has been hard and when your whole life is hard , it drains you . It takes everything in you to just even get out of bed after a certain point. I was just really unlucky to be surrounded by abusive and manipulative mentors and guardians. And it's not just me . There are millions of people all over the world stuck in my situation and I hope they too ask for help from strangers like I did if need be . And I also hope that they too receive the warmth I did because they deserve it . 

All I can say to you is , try to be kind on the internet. You never know what someone is actually going through. You don't wanna make someone feel like ahit for asking for help. It's just too cruel ykn💔"	phoenixflyaway	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9919400811195374	weak	strong	no	na	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.
"First of all thanks so much for replying. 🧡

 Yes a small part of me wants to hold on but that small part of me has dreams too that have seemed next to impossible for pretty much my whole life. I'm tired of surviving, I want to live. Does that make sense? If I can't live , I will gladly trade away this life. 

As for GPA , yes I'm in college final year . I'm from India and mental health is a joke here really. Good mental health resources and services come at a price I can't afford on my own right now and my parents won't pay for. My mother still taunts me about the time I took therapy in 2020 when I couldn't cope with the pandemic mayhem and was really struggling with suicidal ideations and PCOD symptoms. 

My college doesn't have any counselling services. They simply send students to psychology professors and I'm a paychology student so I go to them for classes anyway lol 

Anti depressents I tried to take 4 years ago . Then I got addicted because every living breathing moment of existence is just so painful . So the psychiatrist at the time eho had prescribed those drugs had asked me to stop them and find a hobby(a long term and more effective solution) so I taught myself knitting for 2 months and I knit a cowl for my then boyfriend. It was a good memory you know but then the night I was gonna meet him and give it to him , my dad randomly turned up on my date , insulted me in the middle of the road and dragged me off back to the house before I could give the cowl I had made . Back in the house my mother continued the insult for another 1 hour calling me a prostitute over and over obviously . And all this because they assumed I was gonna have sex that day . 

The assumption didn't hurt but the fact that I was 19 at the time and even if I were to have sex that day , It would have been with consent but I have been molested twice and each time my mother left no stone unturned letting me know it's my fault. I asked her the next morning ' would you rather have a stranger touch me than a man I consent to?' and she said yes because the society will never find out about the stranger (explains why they refused to go to the police for me) but the boyfriend, the world will know because 'dumb' me posts him online . That day I did 2 things - I blocked my whole family on every social media I'm on and I vowed never to knit again.

I did manage to enroll in college out of my parents' town but if I can't keep up a GPA , I can't get a job and coming back to their house I know I'm gonna kill myself so just thought I should put it out there."	phoenixflyaway	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9919400811195374	weak	strong	no	na	MentalHealthSupport	failed

"I'm so sorry you're going through so much. You just don't deserve any of this and it's awful to see. It must just be so painful.

Firstly, that makes PERFECT sense. I completely understand. Living and surviving feel very different. The only thing is that you have to survive to be able to live in the future. You're not trading away your life, you're preventing future you from being able to live.

I'm so sorry mental health is such a joke. That's so horrible, and I can't imagine how awful it must feel when your mother taunts you for seeking it. I want you to know that I, at the very least, am so proud of you for seeking it in 2020 anyway, especially given the negative view taken by those around you.

I'm sorry your school has no options for you, maybe you can talk to your psych profs, though? They at least should understand that mental health shouldn't be scoffed at, and maybe can offer some up-close and personal advice. Seeing them in class and talking one-on-one about your struggles are very different. Since you mentioned your GPA dropping, they likely could notice that if they looked at your grades specifically.

I'm so sorry about that entire knitting story. That sounds like an awful, awful experience. I completely understand why you wouldn't want to continue knitting again, and I'm so sorry your parents take this horrible attitude towards sex and mental health both, that are so horribly detrimental to you. It's absolutely unbelievably horrible, this attitude that your parents take to your molestation. I'm so so sorry. That's so incredibly awful, and must be so painful for you. I can't even imagine. I'm really proud of you for blocking them, and so proud of you for not believing them. 

Maybe you could try another hobby? Perhaps picking up and instrument, or just drawing or painting in your free time. You don't have to be any good, but it may be an effective distraction in the worst times, and it can be somewhat therapeutic, at least in my experience.

In terms of job stuff... I hear you. Yeah, I'm a college student too, and it feels like GPA is everything. You may be able to find a job that you don't need a college degree for, though, something simple like a cashier or something like that? I know that's not what you're hoping for, and maybe that's not a possibility, but if it's better than moving in with your parents and you can do it, that's a pretty good start.

Also, those dreams that seem impossible, what are they, if you feel comfortable sharing? Just curious :)"	phoenixflyaway	reply	na	na	na	0.9919400811195374	strong	strong	no	na	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.
"I really appreciate how hard you're trying given I'm a random stranger. Nobody's done that for me before. Thank you so much ☺️

I had a lot of hobbies you know but I also have bad memories tied to most of them. I used to be a dancer then my whole family quite literally body shamed me to the point where I lost my confidence in dancing completely. I had a growth spurt at 8 so they would sexualize me and touch me in all the wrong places without consent...it was just really uncomfortable. That's why I have stuck to baggy clothes ever since. I only wear body fit dresses around my partner. I can't trust anyone else

I used to be a singer. It was my grandmother's dream to watch me perform in the town hall . I arranged it and sent her an invite . She was the only human I have ever cared so deeply about in my whole life . A night before the concert, his husband killed him because he didn't want her to go to the town hall(it's too hard me to refer to him as grandpa) . This was 9years ago . I still sing but I've lost my voice kinda. I don't feel like performing for crowds anymore. Ik I'll just breakdown on stage remembering that night. 

I was a guitarist for a bit but then my mother practically bullied me out of it saying string instruments are for boys . 

And as for dreams I used to have , I wanted to be a filmmaker. I have been told I'm a good director and storyteller. I wanted to make at least one movie that would make a difference in the world. But I say it's impossible because neither do I have a film degree nor the network of people or the equipment to make it happen .

"I'm happy to help, of course!! :) And I'm sorry you've lacked support in the past.

God, I'm so sorry, you've been through so much. I understand why you wouldn't want to continue any of those hobbies after such horrible things have happened to you related to them. I'd still encourage you to try out something new, something casual maybe, but it must be so difficult for you, and I'm so sorry.

Also, filmmaker!! That's so cool! You can absolutely do that, that's one of the things that you actually don't really need a film degree to do in a lot of cases. Lots of filmmakers don't have film degrees, and in the future you could always go back to school if you wanted to. And don't worry about not having a network or equipment - most filmmakers don't have that by the time they turn 21 (in fact, they do not until much later). You are not behind or too late to persue this. I promise, you aren't. 

In the mean time, you can practice, maybe! Make some amateur films on your own, maybe with friends, or just write some scripts! There's no reason to say ""I don't have the materials right now, so I never will."" Because that's not true. You can write scripts, or just write stories! I'd encourage you to today or tomorrow just sit down and write, just to see how it feels! Think about what you'd want to say, make a storyboard, sketch scenes, something like that. Yeah, you can't turn it into a real film right away, but just see how it feels!! You might enjoy it :)

Once again, I'm sorry you're going through so much. It's so not fair to you. But I promise, it really can get better. And there's no reason to give up on your dreams, you're 21!! There's so much time to learn and practice, and you can absolutely do it!

"I have this problem and have come to accept that I got this because others have hurt me in the past. When I was still too young to defend myself legally/independently.

Unfortunately a gratitude journal didn't work for me because of some untreated ADHD like tendencies so I could never focus on my day. The thing that alleviated this somewhat was that I changed my life environment to a stable, slow paced environment and hang around really calm friends who have a positive outlook. I learned a lot from their outlooks (probably annoyed them to death by constantly asking how they approach things), and then whenever someone gets confrontational, I get that flash of anger then think about what motivates their actions. Then I gradually shaped the belief that people are not out to get me but actually to protect their ego/interest/something related to themselves.

I feel unloved, I feel like a burden to everyone I talk to, and that if I killed myself they would be happier. Sad music doesn't numb the pain anymore, I can't find anything to make me feel okay for even a fleeting moment. I've eaten the bare minimum that is healthy because I feel like a useless fat and annoying person but I might just almost stop eating altogether. I might stop talking because it always feels like what I say either helps people manipulate me, is ignored, or makes things worse. I was to scream constantly but I can't. And I have no person to think about or talk to to make things feel better, I'm an emotional wreck and I hate it and I hate myself.

"if you disappeared today the world would *feel* it---there wouldn't be a way to describe it, but the world would just *feel* darker and like something very important was missing. like a puzzle that's incomplete.

you feel unloved because you do not recognize your worth---You *are* Love :)

it sounds painfully familiar to believe that you are a burden to others, and others would be happier if you killed yourself. i nearly did so at 19, and by the Grace of God i had a moment of clarity to surrender to whatever help i could get, so i admitted myself to the neuropsychiatric hospital. i hated myself and wanted to destroy myself with a shotgun. ""darkness"" is an understatement to what i saw all around me and within me.

learn from me, someone who hit rock bottom and was lucky enough to survive to tell the tale: You *are* the Light you are seeking.

i know that you probably feel only pain right now, and that's totally normal. be there for yourself and for the pain you feel. what helped me to heal from 11 years of depression, anxiety, suicidal ideation, and intense anger (it was *bad*) was this and only this:

1. be there totally with whatever you feel within the body. don't resist the sensation; just locate it, close your eyes, and concentrate on it totally. give it all your loving attention, as if a wounded kitten just came to *you,* specifically, for help
2. avoid using any labels to describe the sensation. no ""good"" or ""bad"" or ""painful"" or ""uncomfortable""; just be there totally and *listen* to the sensation
3. ask it: ""what do you need from me?"" i'll give you a personal example: i felt excruciatingly lonely one evening, all alone on a Saturday night. i felt so lonely that i began to cry. i remembered this advice (from the Buddha) and asked myself: ""Hello Loneliness, what do you want to tell me?"" i listened and received a ""thought"" that said: ""you don't love me. you're looking for other people to distract you from the fact that you hate yourself, which is why you feel so much pain when you're alone. you're not lonely, you just don't like being reminded of the qualities YOU have judged *within yourself* to be unworthy of love. only YOU can revoke this judgment against yourself because YOU put it there.""
4. surrender to God/Source/the Higher Power that created you and has brought you here to this very moment. this is the healing you have been begging for. this is the answer to your call for help. God is listening. God will *always* heal you and answer your call to healing if you simply bring to Light whatever you feel. be totally ready and willing to surrender and let go of whatever it is that is causing this pain. that is the *only* way to heal

Peace and Love :)

"I think you should call a hotline. I wish I could help more but I feel like this too, just to a lesser extent. I’m struggling because I dont know what my worth is if not my productivity or my appearance or my people pleasing or something. So I get it, its hard. But I believe that humans are valuable and worthy as unique individuals and that applies to me and you too.

I can say: no one is going to be happier if you kill yourself because that doesn’t happen in real life. I’ve only seen that on TV and they try to make it plausible.

You are not insignificant or useless. Perhaps you don't know your purpose yet, but you are here for a reason! Your value is not based on whether you're thin or fat, annoying or less so. You are important for the mere fact of being here, hundreds thousands of years of evolution and meetings between your ancestors happened to bring you to the world. Please give yourself a kind thought, even if just one for the beginning. You reached out to this forum, that's a smart thing to do.

"Hey !! 
You have been through a really hard time you feel worthless, you feel miserable, you feel like someone is poking your heart, you feel something you can’t describe and I don’t blame you. But who cares let people not listen, be fat , be annoying, scream just scream , you don’t need people to approve of you. And you , you hate yourself, you tell yourself you look horrible and you are annoying …etc . But that is alllll not true why would say that is it because you feel like burden, try for once and say I am great , I can do great things it is never too late, I love my self , l love the way I look , I AM FREE . Nothing is going to happen no one is going to yell at you. So you also hate yourself why? You made mistakes, everybody does, you don’t look good , there is no looking good and looking bad , there is being confident and not, everyone thinks you are annoying, well thats their problem, you feel like a burden, thats not true because people love you , and there is always time to be better. Imagine with me that tomorrow you are dying so nothing matters anymore, it is unknown when you will dye so why does everything matter now, so stop being hard on yourself 
If you believe in god this might ⬇️
God created everything space, nature , earth , hell , heaven, living things, and created 8 billion humans , and god couldn’t NOT create You , of course he could but he created YOU for a reason, he wants to live .

"Hey, i'd like to tell you something that helped me in a similar situation.

The world doesn't work on ""deserving"" things, for example, deserving happiness.

What i mean with this is that you are not entitled or not to live, you just live, you have every right to be alive and every reason to live a meaningful life, even if you get that  ammount of suffering. But you need to understand that life is suffering, and even with so much shit and so much tears, it's worth living, it's the only life we'll ever get in our insignificant existance on Earth. Just go at your pace man, life is a bitch but it doesn't have to be that bad.

I know how it's like to look in the mirror and see a monster, an insect, something completely replacable that everyone would be better off, but please understand this: You must live, you MUST live, just hang in there, i promise that sooner or later you'll have your redemption with life, just hang in there, eat enough, sleep enough, watch stuff that makes you feel relaxed, you don't have to go through this.

You may be unloved  but that doesn't mean you are meant to be unloved, you are likely to be in the wrong place, sorrounded by the wrong people. Often our mind plays against us, and you know, feelings aren't a realistic/precise depiction of reality, so don't take yout intrusive thoughts seriously."

"first: you are *not* a burden, no matter how much someone else is triggered by what they perceive in you (which is just a reflection of what they dislike about themselves)

you said you feel like a burden to *everyone* but you only mentioned two people who are emotionally invested in every little thing you do (people we call ""our parents"")---two people who are *impossible* to please **totally** because they are emotionally invested in ""being your parents."" these people love you (otherwise they wouldn't even acknowledge your existence), but they cannot help but to react to their own conditioning from their *own* ""parents"". just pointing this out :)

to heal what you feel: honor it. listen to it. be there with the emotion and physical sensation *totally, with undivided loving attention.*

ask your sadness: ""what do you need from me? how am i not honoring you? what are you trying to tell me?""

*listen* and you **will** receive an answer, either immediately or in the very-near future.

and when you're sitting with that sensation/emotion: avoid labels to the best of your abilities. avoid describing what it feels like. just close your eyes and give all of your loving attention to it totally so that you can bring the false, limiting beliefs to Light and heal them.

remember: **no one** has power over you. the fact that you feel sadness and shame from the noise/hot air coming out of other people's mouths is your Truth/Inner God's way of showing you that you *do* believe (at least partially) what they say and that you've given *them* your personal power and the key to your inner peace.

"I (21 F) have been struggling with multiple mental health issues since I was 10 years old. These include anxiety, depression, anorexia, bulimia, body dismorphia and ptsd. (As a side note I found out this year I have autism and adhd.)
My mum and step dad take their own mental health issues seriously, but whenever I bring up my issues they give me either a blank stare or a sigh.

I first self harmed when I was around 14 and was round my dad's house when I did it. He was out shopping wirh 2 of my sisters and I did it so suddenly without a second thought. I instantly called my mum and told her. She sighed and told me to come home. So I walked the entire 45min walk alone in the rain constantly staring at my now cut arms. When I got home my mum was on the sofa with a friend and another family member laughing and having a nice convocation. She looked at me and I burst into tears.
Still with a smile on her face she said ""Alright, show me."" I said I didn't want the other 2 people in the room to see and she told me to ""not be so silly"". So I rolled up my sleeves and showed her. She smiles with a sigh and called me a silly bitch and told me to clean myself off.
In that moment all I wanted was a hug from my mum and for her to tell me it was going to be okay, but she went back to her convocation and I went to my room.

I first attempted suicide at the age of 15 by taking a box of painkillers. This since became my preferred method of attempting.
I told my mum a few days later after I'd talked to some friends about it and she just said ""oh okay"" without looking at me.

There was even one time in college when I was 16 and I had started to become heavily bulimic, to the point where it was as addicting as smoking a cigarette.
I had asked to use the bathroom during class and I was overheard by a teacher vomiting down the toilet and she somehow could tell it was self inflicted. She took me to the student safety facility where I told them everything and they called my mum.
She came and sat down next to me and they told her what had happened and what I had told them. She kept a slight smile on her face and didn't say much, just the occasional ""aw"" and ""okay"". They told her to take me home and to not let me out of her sight for the rest of the day for my own safety.
Our family friend picked us up and drove us home. The second we got in the door my mum told me she had to go pick up my sisters from school with her friend. I asked why she couldn't stay with me whist her friend picked them up like she had before, but she said nothing and left.
So I immediately went upstairs to the bathroom and continued where I left off.
My bf at the time had heard what had happened and ran to mine, almost breaking down the door and had to drag me away from the toilet. I stayed with him that night.

Since those first times, I have attempted suicide 4 times and self harmed more times than I can count. I started to mention it more to my mum and my younger sister (19) since finishing trauma therapy this year, and they both give me the same blank expression.
I feel so selfish for typing this but is it too much to ask for them to offer to talk about it, or even offer me a hug?
They help me out financially at times but I'd appreciate it if they could help me out emotionally and mentally too?

Am I asking for too much? Please be honest as I need to know if I'm overthinking this."

Honestly, if it was me, I'd never give a rats ass about them. If they don't want to be the parent they should be f them. Take care of yourself. As much as it would hurt, you need to distance yourself from them. Find a good friend, talk to them on a regular basis, talk to your therapist, take care of yourself. That's all that matters now.

"I've felt that way.

I know it doesn't mean much.  What I mean is that what I went through, regardless of how similar will never be the same.

I got better.

I'd like to say that there was one trick that made all the difference, but there wasn't....

I spent a long time trying to heal myself and I've found a few things along the way.  If they're helpful, I'm glad.

First, the journey is the most important part.  I firmly believe that is the journey of trying to heal myself, more so than what I did, that helped me the most.  Sticking with trying new things and the people I met along the way made all the difference.

Second, feelings don't mean anything.  If I were to have heard this in the beginning I would have thought the person saying it was crazy.  However, feelings are just feelings.  Why we feel them is less important than that we are feeling them. Accept them as signals that something is going on, like a check engine light, but don't read too much into them.

Third, the only things that make a difference are the things that you do - and how you do them.  For the most part, how you think or feel about something doesn't make a difference.

Fourth, your emotional needs are important.  We all have emotional needs and many of us were never taught good ways of meeting those needs.  This leads to codependent.  Good friends and/or a good therapist who can help you identify your emotional needs and build good habits to meet those needs will be worth its weight in gold.

Last, the only person you're responsible for is yourself (unless you have dependent children).

Things that helped me were studying Buddhism, Stoicism, and codependency (specifically books by Pia Melody).

It's the journey that's important.  Do something different."	throwra99999999990	reply	na	na	na	0.9987288117408752	weak	strong	no	na	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.

"I (24f) have been dealing with mental health issues ever since I can remember (anxiety/depression, I also have adhd and I suspect I may be bipolar), but the last 1/3 of 2022 has been extremely overwhelming and chaotic for me.

Nothing really…bad happened. It seemed to just be going up for me for a while—I started a new job as a pharmacy tech in September and started dating my current bf shortly after I began. We started spending a lot of time with each other. Whenever we both had a day off, we were together. 

I was holding down two jobs for a while; the other was at a supermarket. I left the supermarket job because I was getting overwhelmed with working too much and my schedule was a morning shift, which was total opposite of the pharmacy tech job. While this was all happening I was trying to find an apartment to move into with my friend but I’ve just been too broke to move out of my parents house so she found a place by herself (and I feel terrible because she was under the impression that I’d help her with rent and I didn’t speak up).

My bf lost his job about a month ago, so lately he has tons of free time and he wants to see me whenever I’m not working or when he’s not going to a concert with his friends. Between seeing him and the tech job all the time, I’ve been overwhelmed, struggling with my meds, struggling with sleep, struggling with impulsively spending money…I’ve been falling off the rails. And the thing is deep down I don’t really want to be a pharmacy tech, I want to write for a living but it’s just been too hard to find gigs and I have bills to pay so I’ve been pursuing other careers.

I’m making careless mistakes at my job and I’ve been having impulsive thoughts to steal drugs and idk if I trust myself not to follow through. So I decided I’m leaving my job and doing a partial program. I know my bf is supportive of me prioritizing my mental health but I’m not sure if he really knows what that entails. I’m…just really hoping my bf won’t think my time off will mean we can spend every waking moment with each other. I’d like to spend time with him a few days out of the week after partial but I really would like time to decompress some days. I’m also worried a bit about him being disappointed about our sex life because we usually have sex late at night after his parents go to bed since he still lives at home (and there’s no way he could come over my place).

Hello, when i was younger maybe 13-15 yrs of age , I came across bestgore the website and I watched all the gore videos, even though I was freaked out at what I was seeing, I kept watching. Now I’m 19 and with social medias maybe every 2-4 days on Instagram a account I follow would post Chicago shooting and/or Ukraine/Russian combat footage. Every so often I’d see somebody shooting someone. But every person I have in my personal vicinity for example (a gym freind at my home) or (being alone with someone I don’t know in a place where I don’t know what’s going on around me) I’d start thinking negatively like “is this mf about to kill me?” Or I’d just make sure I have him in my vision or perephial. I researched on this subject and apparently it’s just as bad as watching corn. Seeing humans die is desensitizing me I guess. How do I fix this ?

"Stop exposing yourself to this violence if you’re following or seeking out these pages, if they’re just coming up then take a social media break. I have anxiety and if I watch too many serial killer documentaries/show exactly the same thing happen to me, I believe I (or others I love) are going to get murdered or something horrible is going to happen. This will frequently happen in my everyday life or at night rather than when I’m actually watching them. They’re like intrusive thoughts, don’t encourage them. Taking a break and exposing myself to more kindness and mellow content usually fixes the problem after a few weeks. You may think it desensitises you (which it might to viewing others deaths), but it actually makes you very sensitive to it as it seeps into your mind and makes you think it’s super common/normal and could easily happen to you.

"It does desensitize you. And it also traumatizes you. I’m the same way but older now. I exposed myself to gore and violence online, I worked in a nursing home as a teenager, death was morbidly consuming my life. 
I don’t know the full effects it’s had on me. I still am curiously drawn to it. But you have to think why. Why are you watching it. What are you getting from it. There’s a sort of trance flipping through so many photos and videos. A disconnection. At least for me. 
I think a lot about how life can be over in seconds. Randomly without purpose.

so today i got groped by a man in the parking lot today, yes you heard me right. i fucking knocked him out, as i've gotten self-defense lessons, and went to the station to report it, but i was so triggered the entire time from my childhood and everything, that i still dont feel comfortable of sharing tho you can probably guessed.

im fucking done, why does everything bad have to keep on happening to me? what did i ever do? why do i have to be so pretty and ""beautiful?"" I hate men, im never having sex again. im literally on the edge but im fighting so hard to make it to my 18th birthday so i can just run away with my boyfriend. but its so difficult i cannot begin to explain it to you

but w/e i digress.

"I gave you clear advice. Leave them alone. Stay single. Go to therapy. You don’t want to listen to anyone that tells you something other than what you want to hear. Beginning progress means you need to eliminate distractions. You need to be doing it for the right reasons: hence so you don’t do it to someone else; so you can learn how to handle your conditions in a healthy relationship. But only seeking help in hopes of getting redemption and fixing one relationship that you ruined will not take you far. Because ultimately if that ship doesn’t sail, you’ll resort back to not caring because it wasn’t the outcome you desired. You need a complete change in mental state bc your mind is not doing anything for the right reasons rn. Explain to a therapist that you’re doing this for one person and one reason and I promise you they will tell you that’s wrong. 

You want more than just “work on yourself.” Here you go. You have to move on, you have to tell yourself you are no good for that person. You need  to believe that they are better off without you because they are atm. You need to accept your conditions for what they are, but not use them as a sweet label or excuse when you need it to be. You’ve been struggling your whole life but as soon as you got a diagnosis you went to Reddit with multiple posts immediately labeling yourself as such and connecting it back to your behaviors like a safety cushion. Once you are able to move on from said person, or at least create a STRONG distance and boundary (no contact), then you can begin to work and focus on solely your behaviors and how your emotions control them. You can dissect the toxic behaviors you have in relationships and work on how to test your conditions and how to handle them healthily so you won’t hurt another partner or yourself like now. You’ve hurt yourself in the process and you need time to heal. Working on yourself and seeking this help is not only relationship oriented, it should be quality of life and attack every aspect of your life because mental disorders don’t only affect relationships and I’m sure you know that. Getting help can’t only include relationships and love. You can want to seek forgiveness but you cannot rush it, nor can you expect it to happen, nor can you expect it to fix anything if/when you get it. It’s not fair to push and force forgiveness or an apology on someone when they are not ready. YOU hurt THEM. So this is not about what YOU want and to make yourself feel better.

Go no contact, I’m sure they know you’re remorseful but that doesn’t mean anything atm. No matter how much you change and work on yourself, forgiveness comes from within. You could do everything right and give the perfect apology but if that person isn’t ready to forgive or let go then there’s nothing you can do. They have to heal on their own too."

i’m coming with a professional background and lived experience in mental health so believe me when i say i’m not trying to perpetuate your shame. but when you take accountability and apologize, it’s not for you it’s for the other person. you apologize knowing that they don’t have to be ready to forgive you and they don’t have to want to continue a connection with you. you’re simply owning up to a mistake you made. apologizing with the intention of changing an outcome is damaging to you and the other person - and is a form of covert manipulation. if you care about the person, the best thing you can do is apologize and then step away and respect whatever space they need. if you have to coerce someone into forgiving you, it’s not an authentic forgiveness and it doesn’t reflect the potential for a sustainable relationship or friendship	Striking-Setting-482	reply	na	na	na	0.007120845839381218	weak	no	no	na	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.

When I was around 10-11 I found out my mom was cheating on my dad, I used her phone to play games and got a message from some guy saying “hi precious😍❤️” and I clicked on it since I saw it wasn’t my dads contact, saw a lot of conversations of my mom just cheating with other guys. At this time she also went to work and supposedly would go to the gym afterwards. Another family lived with us and the women in that family had some bad morals and my mom would just kinda follow along. Throughout this whole period of over a year I was told by the other women’s son that he knew my mom and his would go cheat and go have I intercourse with other guys. He was able to drive since he was 16 at the time, he would take me to the gym my mom would say she went to and we wouldn’t find her as a way for him to prove it to me. I told my dad and my dad didn’t do much he just sort of used me as a messenger to tell him things. I confronted my mom and she cried and apologized to me but not about cheating she just used falling out of love to excuse her cheating. Since I was 8 my mom would sometimes tell my dad in front of me and other people “if I cheat on you, you know why” or “don’t act surprised if I cheat on you” and would talk about him being horrible in bed. Which has now affected me to think that if I’m not good in bed then I’ll never maintain a relationship or at least a faithful one and has caused to me now have a very hard time reaching climax during the act, because I only really see intercouse as a means to satisfy the other person. Now I’m 16 and I’ve been having night terrors about my mom having affairs and I’m a kid again going through the same feelings I did back then, and when I wake up I just get flooded with those feelings and want to cry really badly. Whenever I see the mom in an affair in shows, all those feelings resurge and I start to get mad and annoyed and then after all that I want to cry again. It’s been happening for months now, and it only started after seeing a guy in my moms Facebook comments saying the same thing that guy said “hi precious😍❤️” now my mom didn’t even have him added back or anything and the lives a country away so I’m assuming it’s just some random dude tryna shoot his shot but when after I saw that it’s when all this shit started happening.

"No there's no talking to her about things like these, she immediately makes herself the victim and starts to throw fits like a child.

At this point I don’t really let it get to me since I’ve had to hear that since I was like 8 she used to also physically abuse me but I’ve become much taller and and muscular since then so if she does lay a hand on me it’s mostly just a slap and then she just backs of and keeps talking shit.

I have an autism specialist(I have aspergers) who somewhat helps, just not enough. I genuinely don't think I'll make it to the age of 15. Thank you so much though, you're so kind.	watchjojoslol	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9989209175109863	no	strong	no	na	MentalHealthSupport	ethnicity: uncertain, age: under 15, gender: uncertain, explanation: this post does not provide enough information to determine the author's ethnicity or gender with certainty. they mention living in denmark but they may not necessarily be of danish ethnicity. the author did indicate that they are under the age of 15. they have mentioned that they have aspergers but this doesn't provide information about their gender.
I want to be a therapist in the future. That's not why I'm kind though, it's because I was a drug addict due to constant suicidal attempts. Once in 11th grade and then once a month iiib 12th grade. Also, three out of the eleven people close to my age who were close to me and died committed suicide. It's hard to hear people go through this. I still have depression at times and I'm 25, but there are some good moments at times. I live in the US in the state of Texas. I would love to visit a therapist, but my neurological stuff comes first because I've dealt with seizures and take medicine for it. I'm sorry you're going through this, but if you want to, feel free to message me directly.	watchjojoslol	reply	na	na	na	0.9989209175109863	no	strong	no	na	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.
I'm so sorry, as I am underage I do not struggling with drug addiction. It's just such a shame that I got issues so young. I was barely 12. My teenage years and my chances of a good education is decreasing, but I just can't go back.

It's unfortunate for anyone to have issues at a young age. I got a concussion at the age of 10 and suffered a lot of seizures with my last one being two years ago. There are a lot of issues people go through. They're not all the same, but one isn't more of an issue than the other.	watchjojoslol	reply	na	na	na	0.9989209175109863	weak	strong	no	na	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.
so for some context. I was at the Manchester Arena Ariana Grande bombing. In 2017. I was 12 and saw a lot more than any one should have seen. I was not injured but definitely noticed that what was happening around me had injured people before the news broke out. I researched what had happened in the car home trying to work out what the bang was as I had convinced myself it was a speaker that had fallen. A couple days after I was back in school and was perfectly normal and okay. When people would question if I was okay, I didn’t understand the concern as I wasn’t affected like some unfortunate people was. After the first year I had noticed I’d been having some nightmares of the night, but every now and again the nightmare would have my loved ones in the arena too which created another level of anxiety as It felt very real and i woke up sweating and stressing about seeing a family member not make it. But this was not a regular thing more weekly. Over the years the nightmares became more frequent and I started to experience what I now know as flashbacks. It is like i’m daydreaming although it feels more real and I can not process what is happening around me or feel like i’m aware of my surroundings. When my friends have seen me going through this they have explained that my eyes tend to move and My body moves slightly too. It’s between looking as if i’m asleep or having a seizure. These have become a lot more frequent too and also don’t have a time limit. One could last 5 minutes or the biggest one i’ve had lasted 8 hours. This has already effected my education especially when I started college. I am now in my second year of college and about half way through. This is affecting my attendance and my anxiety about being in such a loud noisy environment. I did attend the college’s therapy for a couple of months but didn’t find it very useful. I have also worked out that fireworks and police/fire truck/ ambulance sirens, or any sirens for that matter also trigger a flashback. What do i do? I am struggling to find a solution apart from music which only works 50% of the time. I feel very lost and like i’m not in control of my own body.

How do feel about others? I feel like you should stop thinking about how you feel about yourself are start thinking about how you feel about others. Maybe you are too obsessed with how you feel about yourself. When you go out start looking around at others. How do they look? Do you think they look happy? What about the people working in the stores?  Take the time to look at them and think about how they are feeling. Think of ways you can help others. Once you start focusing on others and how they feel you will naturally start to feel better about yourself. You also need to do some self care. Are you getting enough rest, and exercise, are you eating healthy foods? Be the best that you can be for yourself. Start writing down your thoughts and feelings to get in touch with who you are and what you want for yourself.

"There’s a lot about self-love that some people can’t grasp because no-one was there to teach them how.

Self-love is not about forcing yourself to look at yourself better. Self-love is about appreciating all parts of yourself regardless of how flawed they are, because you can make yourself aware that some of those flaws are changeable or fixable. But there is no such thing as perfection. I’ve looked. There’s no such thing. Regardless of how “flawless” you may forge yourself to be there is always some way for someone to dislike you or find a flaw in you. That’s a part of what is absurd about the world we live in. But now listen to me; that’s quite alright, because in life there has to be acceptance of things we cannot enjoy… things we cannot control. 

I want you to think about your flaws. Maybe write them down. And then about the things that make you unique or wonderful. Things you absolutely adore about yourself. Now it doesn’t matter the quantity of good and bad or good versus bad. Don’t compare pieces of yourself, because you won’t be able to put them together and love the whole; the masterpiece. Embrace what makes you good. Embrace that you’re able to get up sometimes, even if some days you can’t. Love that all of the things you wrote are just you! You, that’s you, good and bad all mixed together! Now if there’s a lot of bad, realize that as a human being we are in a constant state of change. You can fix them, move on from them, embrace that change. Self-love is about loving yourself for who you are and what you’re going to be able to change to make yourself better… because you can’t love yourself if you don’t know yourself.

Last but not least. Don’t beat yourself up. Don’t think that a lack of something makes everything bad."	Apprehensive-Bar-672	reply	na	na	na	0.9988358616828918	no	no	no	na	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.

"I swear this happens to me all the time...  


I'm told I'm essentially weak and allow others to trample on me, but when I actually stand up for myself I'm a ""crazy bitch,"" ""nasty,"" etc., I even had a counsellor who said I shouldn't let others walk on me but when I snapped and I said I'm going to start treating others the way they've treated me she then essentially says ""don't do it because it'll affect your reputation."" WTF! So I'm damned if I do and damned if I don't? Anyways, I've been turning into a cold, anti-social person who has no qualms being rude to others (that actually deserve it) and I have cut off contact with the vast majority of people. I used to help others whenever I could, uphold manners and etiquette to the best of my ability, and be professional as best as I could. Now, I'm just waiting with a smile on my face for someone to tell me what a bad person I am when I decide to snap.  


Has anyone else had this experience or a similar one?"	Room0302	post	29.4471372649891	female	White	0.9994414448738098	na	na	na	27	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.
"The same exact skills, words, methods of communicating that were praised as being ""assertive"", ""focused"", ""diligent"", and ""passionate"" as an activist, as an advocate, and as an executive are routinely weaponized against me as a disabled person. 

#Ableism is particularly strong in the area of #healthcare in my area of the USA, but I'm willing to bet I am not alone.

Being called ""crazy"" or ""nasty"" is putting it mildly.

Advocate for a loved one to get competant home care consistant with the tasks on a needs analysis? That can (and did) get me reported to adult services for ""interfering in client getting his Homecare services"". More than once. The fact I was found innocent did not get nearly the attention the original false allegations did, and the agencies & people involved faced no repercussions. 

Get angry, and yell out ""Why are you treating us like this?"" Nearly got one of my disabled family members taken down by hospital security guards who arrived in SWAT gear at a receptionist claiming ""two sketchy guys demanding to get into the hospital for no reason"" when both he & his pal had clearly indicated they were there from another office on the hospital campus to get labs done & he needed to use a restroom. 

Burst into tears after a provider follows you to check out, while screaming at you? That can get you a written warning for violating the practice behavioral rules. Get 3 of those, and you can be kicked out with maybe 30days of meds. 

After having no luck asking for an ADA accomadation for a non verbal communication method at the 1 agency your state allows you to receive services from under Medicaid, so you decide to shoot video on the 8th trip to request this help in person? You can have the police called & they will threaten to arrest you &/or confiscate your smartphone that is also your hearing amplifier, TTY, & TTS device. 

Standing up for your rights, for the rights of others, or simply trying to excercise your rights in America has never been easy for any minority. It doesn't matter if you are standing up to racism, homophobia, ableism, sexism, or this nation's caste system.

The more catagories you are in, the lower your caste in this society. Mental Health consumers have to battle #stigma everyday no matter who they are, but the problems are particularly bad for those who are poor, speech or hearing impaired, person's of color, female, trans, ace, or any kind of non binary gender identity. If the person can only access health and mental health care & supports in the low income world of Medicaid &/or community health, they often find even constitutional rights are not respected, never mind HCRA or ADA.

That doesn't mean, however, that it is not worth doing the action of speaking up, setting boundaries, standing up for injustice or just for your safety, sanity, and health needs to be respected.

Each time you can speak up, stand up, or strike even the slightest blow to any attempt to violate your boundaries, damage your sanity, or injure your health is worth the effort no matter how the ""other"" reacts. 

It is perfectly valid to choose to modify how strongly you advocate for yourself and your peers, family, or friends in order to mitigate the possible reactionary actions of the ""others""! Each mental health consumer has to find a balance between how hard they fight, what battles they pick, and what level of discomfort they can handle in any given situation.

But no disabled person ought ever be gaslight to accept that non violently standing up for their safety, sanity, or health (or for those of their peers or loved ones) is somehow a malevolent character flaw, a behavioral problem in itself, or a sin.

"Wow. You just described my life to a “T”. This happened to me right at the beginning of the pandemic. I essentially pushed every single friend I had out of my life (rightfully so). I felt taken advantage of and disrespected and finally got fed up and cut every single person off. It was a very rough 2 years - I was constantly questioning my decision and thinking I did something wrong. Now, almost 3 years later, I know I made the right decision. I reconciled with most of my friends and have a much, much better relationship with them. And the “friends” I didn’t mend things with, I can say with 100% certainty that I’m glad we are no longer friends.

Don’t worry man I can see it getting better. I usually don’t have good advise but I guess that when you have someone telling you things ofcourse don’t let them trample all over you, you ofcourse need to fight back but just maybe do it in a manner where you make it clear you don’t like it?

People seem to have a hard time respecting the boundaries I establish and in those cases I start raising my voice. One example I have is that my partner basically told me to stop being weak and fight back. The next day he politely asks me to bring him some coffee to his workplace, someone from the HR department saw me and started telling me I couldn't be there because I was not an employee (even though other employees there bring *their* partners and children to eat in the staff cafeteria and all I was doing was dropping off a cup of coffee).

"So in that situation it is possible that was a bit of an overreaction, because the context is that you are at someone else's workplace, so it's not really appropriate to fight their staff. The term 'pick your battles' comes to mind. And it's not that i don't think you should stand up for yourself. I definitely do. But as someone with BPD, i can tell you that waiting until you've cooled off if you get upset and picking your battles can really save a lot of energy and misunderstanding. Usually when your boundaries are violated or someone isn't respecting them, you can repeat yourself but if it comes to raising your voice you've already lost. Usually what you should do is leave and deny the person breaking your boundaries further access to you.

"I 19F have a friend 19M who enlisted in the marines last year. I have slowly watched him declining but tonight when he came to me I realized how bad it truly is. 

I don’t want to reveal too much into his story out of respect for him and also readers. However recently he found his bestfriend and roommate deceased in his room. Along with that his experiences so far in the field have been beyond anything I could imagine. 

I don’t know if I’ve ever cried as I was when I read every text he sent. My heart was shattering. 

I’m desperately seeking any way I can possibly help him. I’m scared he won’t make it much longer at the rate he is going. I am going to ensure I keep in contact with him every single day and do anything I possibly can to help him. 

I would prefer help from anyone who has formerly or currently enlisted in the military or any military family for their guidance as to what I need to do however any help would mean the world. 

I’m scared for him and I just want him to come home. I made him swear to me that he would let me visit when he comes home next.

Hi there. I am in the same boat. What I have come to realize is no matter how much you care, and how much you fight there is nothing you can do. It is deeply one of the worst feelings. Just be there for him.	S2103_	reply	na	na	na	0.0029083231929689646	weak	strong	no	na	MentalHealthSupport	failed
I don’t know what’s wrong with me. I genuinely feel as if I’m slowly becoming super emotionally dependent on my girlfriend. We can literally spend hours and days together and it’s almost like the second she leaves, i start thinking super bad thoughts. I miss her so much. She left last night, and I’m seeing her on Friday, but I feel not myself when she is away. It’s like a part of me is dying without her.

" I can be a very insecure person, I used to seek constant reasurance but thankfully I've improved quite a bit. Anyways tonight I was gaming with a friend, I said ""Warzone is shit"", which is just my opinion, he responded with ""its because your shit at it"". Now I don't care what somebody thinks of my ""gaming abilities"", of which there isn't much admittedly lol, but I felt like he was devaluing my opinion and talking my point of view down. I waited a few minutes and I asked him what he thought of the new cod, he said he liked it, which is cool. I said that I felt the last few cods were trash including Warzone, then he re-ittirated that it was just because I was shit at it. I responded with I don't really like it man, I think its shit. He starts arguing with me and I stated multiple times that its just my opinion. He called me a bunch of names and left. Then we messaged back and forth, he insulted me, called me bunch of names and claimed that it was because I got insecure that he got mad but if that's the case then why argue with me over my opinion. In hindsight I should have just walked away. I guess my question is do I deserve this? Is his anger justified? He's dealt with me being insecure in the past and doesn't always snap like that. I can understand how someone being insecure would annoy or anger somebody after a while but he's responsible for his own words and actions."

It does seem like an overreaction from your friend. They jumped straight to insulting you for seemingly no reason. You don't deserve to be insulted by your friend.

I don't understand your reasons for stating your opinion a second time when you didn't elaborate on your statement though. Where was the discussion on why you thought it was shit??"	EnvironmentalAd1988	reply	na	na	na	0.9991863369941711	weak	no	no	na	MentalHealthSupport	failed
I was insecure because I felt like he was devaluing my opinion. So a few minutes later I brought up the new Cod, I did want to re-itterate my opinion on Warzone so that's why I said what I thought of other Cods, when I got to Warzone I restated my opinion and he got mad. I won't deny I was insecure and probably presented as such. I also won't deny that being around someone who is insecure can be frustrating and annoying. But most of the times we fight it's because I'm insecure, he snaps and calls me names and insults me. I feel like I deserve this treatment. That being said the majority of times I'm insecure we don't fight.	EnvironmentalAd1988	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9991863369941711	no	strong	no	na	MentalHealthSupport	failed

"Hi people,
I need advice on how to help my younger brother. He’s 22 and in a deep spiral I’ve moved him in with me into my tiny apartment in the hopes that my support and love will ease him into a better way of living. I honestly only want the very best for him and it breaks my heart to see him this way.

From what I’ve read online I shouldn’t go the way of tough love (which personally I know helps me). He’s self harmed quite severely in the past and attempted suicide more than once so I really don’t want to push him too hard. He constantly doubts himself and always blames his head for any of his behaviours instead of taking responsibility. For example he had a very easy job that’s 9-2 three days a week but out right refused to go because it would take him a long time to get there and various other silly excuses. He’s struggled to keep a job down ever since he was a teenager. 

I’m trying to get him into a healthy routine ie eating correct, sorting out his sleeping pattern and doing something productive each and everyday. I’ve offered my support in form of just chatting to help me understand him and his situation, and hopefully take some weight off his shoulders.

We didn’t grow up with parents so I’m like the father figure to him but I’m just still working it out myself. Any advice would be a massive help."	Captain_Dankles	post	18.73202187425684	female	White	0.993361234664917	na	na	na	1	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.
"First off, I admire your will and dedication to help your little brother. Something that I hope he will soon realize. One thing that I hope you also realize. Give yourself some credit just for the thought of wanting to help and understand him.

I am going through depression, anxiety, have attempted suicide myself. And as someone who's been through that, I can tell you one thing that I hoped to get from my own family - love, presence, understanding, kind words, patience. Out of all those, **PATIENCE**, has been what I mostly needed. Because I can blabber about how I want to do this and that, over and over agian, I can stay quiet for a day or more, I can complain how I keep feeling like this and that, how I don't want this, how I don't want to do that, that I just want to lay down, isolate myself. For others, it will be and can be annoying, can be tiring. I need someone that will let me let it all out, even if it is over and over again, and not get tired and will stick right by me no matter what until I am able to convince myself that it is time for me to do something about it.

I have quit a job before because everything was gettin bad. I couldn't stand getting up from bed, doing anything at all. It was a fairly simple job to everyone else, but not to me back then. Especially the stress, people handle that differently. He might be struggling with it, might not how we see it. But my partner and my parents have been understanding, instead of making me feel bad about it, no matter how good of a pay it was, knowing that I can do what I need to do to gather my thoughts, they didn't judge me or anything that will backfire on my mental health. I am not saying any of those is what you're doing. But just like anything, getting out of the dark hole will take 2-way help. You helping him, and him helping himself even in the tiniest way possible. Like, finding a small reason to get up. I guess you can say, something for him to look forward to for the day. Even if it is one thing at a time a day.

Just like what you said, you don't want to push him too hard, in a way that it will make it worse. So one tiny thing for him to look forward to might make his day. Like, what he really want to eat, like favorite food. Make him look forward to something he really likes to do, say a movie, a show, play video games, music, walking, running, going out for a coffee. Maybe ask him what he wants to do more for long-term. 

Is he outgoing? Does he just not want to leave the house, don't want to work? What's his passion?

I've seen people that don't want to work, but are able to make money from home, like streaming games that they love, constantly talking on their stream, but still being productive by making money and doing what they love. That kind of thing. Not saying that's what he needs to do, but the point is, figure out what he loves to do, and from there, maybe there is a way for him to figure it out for himself too what HE wants to be. Like you don't have to throw what HE CAN BE, but be the guide, that will ask the questions that will make him shine a light that, ""Hey! I can try that!"" or like ""Hey! Maybe I can do this."" or ""I want to do <whatever>, maybe I can"" all on his own with YOUR guide. And I think that's all that matters. 

The sole fact that YOU are there, wanting to help him, is a HUGE step. He just needs to keep seeing it, consistency - that is another key to make someone know YOU ARE THERE FOR THEM. <3

I hope that helps/gave you some idea."	Captain_Dankles	reply	na	na	na	0.993361234664917	weak	no	no	na	MentalHealthSupport	failed
"(Blanket Trigger Warning: suicide, loss, gore, etc.)----

In the past five years, around 10 people in my immediate circle of family and friends have died. Five of them were suicides (give or take the two that were potentially murdered...)

&#x200B;

1. My uncle had a secret lifelong addiction to (prescribed) opies. Tried to quit, but couldn't make it. He crawled into the tub in his apartment and shot himself at the peak of his WDs.
2. A friend from college had to have part of his bowel removed from intense Crohn's disease. He hung himself when the painkillers ran out.
3. My best friend went to the grocery store, bought a bunch of groceries. Walked into an alleyway and then abruptly fired 4 rounds - with the fourth going under his chin. At some point a homeless person must have found his body and stole his wallet and cellphone....at least, that's the official story according to the police. Bullshit.I found out he was missing while I was out of the city with my grandpa and uncle. I was in the middle of cleaning up a small cabin they owned near a lake after my alcoholic dad and his girlfriend had a big fight and beat the living shit out of each other.The next day I started calling hospitals... then morgues. That's how we found him. The coroner told me where his body was found, so I went there.It had been raining, but a pool of his blood was still on the ground next to shell casings. I collected quite a bit of evidence and interviewed the people who checked him out. Found video footage. When I gave it to the police they said, ""What do you expect us to do with this?"" to which I replied, ""Your fucking jobs"" - and then the threatened to arrest me.There was a private viewing at the morgue before the cremation. There were maybe six of us there. I still remember watching his mother cry over his corpse. His eyes were still open, pointing in different directions. The entry wound was under the right side of his chin... but he was left handed. You do the math. His father, wracked with grief, asked me to write a book about him. He died a year later himself from colon cancer.
4. About a month later, another friend in the same circle drank himself to death. There's more sketchy shit here too that makes me think he was likely poisoned, but that's another story.
5. One year later my father committed suicide by tucking a rifle under his chin. He and his girlfriend had gotten into another fight, and she called the cops. He did a stint back in the 00s for possession, and he always said ""I'll kill myself before I go back."" Turns out he was serious. I requested a copy of the 911 call... you can hear his voice break when he realizes she called the cops and he just says *""Why? Why would you do that? I won't go back. Now I have to die. You killed me.""*My grandfather was deep in dementia - but when he got the news it was instant clarity. I've never seen anything like it - and I hope I never do again. He kept asking if my dad had used the rifle he had given him (he had.) We lied... but he knew. He just kept saying ""I shouldn't have given him that gun."" Then he would forget what happened - and then **remember.** Over. and. over.My uncle and I decided it wouldn't be right to hire a ""cleaning crew"" for the house. So we did it ourselves. A .30-06 rifle has enough velocity to punch through steel...at close range it basically just makes things explode. We picked up literal pieces of his memories for three days, and buried them next to the bird feeder where he liked to watch the birds.The kicker is, we ended up having to turn the house over the bank anyway.
6. Two months later the same grandpa went into the hospital for a UTI. One night they said he got ""agitated"" and sedated him with motherfucking Seroquel (black labelled for geriatric patients, not supposed to be given)... His mouth got so dry he choked to death on his own spittle in my grandmother's arms.
7. Around this time we found out my wife's father had a rare disease and needed a bone marrow transplant. They found a donor quickly - and he ran marathons and shit, so his heart was strong. Docs gave him an 70% chance of survival. The day he started chemo to kill his immune system (so the new bone marrow wouldn't be rejected) - COVID was just hitting the US. He got it.The badass hung on for a month after - and the transplant worked! His immune system was fighting off the virus, but then he had multiple massive strokes. They took him off the ventilator and he lived for *two full days*.He was more of a father to me than my own father with this alcoholic absence... I have a tremendous amount of guilt admitting that.There was no funeral - only quarantine. My wife's job wouldn't let her take time off since she had visited him so much in the hospital after he took a turn for the worse.
8. One of my uncles was an alcoholic - and the pandemic made it worse. The docs said he needed to quit drinking to live, and instead he chose death - as much as an addict chooses anything, I suppose.His liver failed him about 6 months after my father in law died. He knew the end was close, and started calling family more often. I talked to him quite a few times - but I ignored the very last call. I was just busy. I texted him ""I'll call you back"" but never got the chance.
9. My wife's grandma died from COVID shorty after that.
10. Like my FIL had been more of a father to me than my own, my grandma  was more of a mother to me than my own. My real mother is a complete conspiracy theory/religious nut. But that's a whole other trunk of trauma...Anyway, she had a fall last spring. Fractured pelvis. Some pain, but was walking around fine. We started alternating staying with her - keep in mind this woman was *not retired* at 87, and still drove everywhere. Sharp as a tack. But the doctors ordered strict bedrest, and she became depressed. Stopped eating. She went downhill fast - just lost the will to live. Her hospital stay is another saga (They didn't turn on a suction catheter and her skin literally sloughed off in inch deep  from urine burns.)My last surviving uncle was convinced she would pull through, and wouldn't give her the hospice morphine. I understand... but it made me so mad. We fought, and he agreed to give her some - and then she promptly died. I know he silently blames me, but I don't really give a fuck.
11. Just this past week, my other grandma - deep in dementia, much deeper than the other grandpa - and completely bedridden - she finally died too. This one was almost merciful. It was long past her time, but my mother did everything she could to keep her alive, for religious reasons.She had been in and out of the hospital for the past three years - got COVID and *survived* it - in spite of my mom poisoning her with the ""ivermectin cure."" Every time she went in, I would think ""Ok, this has to be it.""She finally did pass - **on my birthday.** We did have a kind of special relationship, so I'm trying to frame it positively, as a sing of our bond or something - but I know it's just a coping mechanism.
12. The day after my grandma died, my wife's best friend went to the hospital. She had been sick with strep throat (she thought) - but the antibiotics she got didn't do anything.Turns out it was Acute (the bad kind) Leukemia. She was 31. We were at her wedding just after the quarantines ended. She just had a baby - 7 months old.The doctors did some tests and said her heart was really strong - it wasn't a matter of ""survival"" but a matter of ""curing.""Last Thursday she texted my wife to say the chemo wasn't that bad. Friday morning they made plans for her to visit over the weekend.... then her heart just stopped. And the revived her. And then her heart stopped again. This went on for 12 fucking hours before she died for the last time.

\-------------

My grandmother's funeral was yesterday. My wife's best friend's funeral is tomorrow, and I'm so fatigued from loss I just don't feel anything. Honestly, I stopped being able to cry after my dad died.

I keep thinking to myself this must be what being in a war feels like - there's so much death happening near you that you just become numb.

I've been to a therapist - but I can hardly get through 1/2 of the deaths before time is up - and then it's another three month wait.... and that's not even scratching the cult-mommy absent-daddy issues. He says it's normal not to feel anything, but I really want to. 

It's been two years now and the only time I can cry like I want is when I get shitfaced - I'm talking pants-on-head drunk. I don't really drink much though.

I just feel like I'm holding up all this weight, and I don't have any way to put it down....

Anyway, if you've made it this far - thanks for reading. I don't know what to expect from putting this here - I think in spite of everything I'm doing kind of ok. It just makes me feel better to write this stuff down, I guess."	VentingThroAway69420	post	20.327494663139937	male	White	0.9902526140213013	na	na	na	6	MentalHealthSupport	failed

"Without going into it, I did something *very* dumb today. I'm terrified of the consequences and of them being 1000x worse than what's been suggested so far--like, that my life will be completely ruined over this. I called 988 (the crisis/suicide hotline) for the first time ever. 

So yeah. I was literally going out to go grocery shopping, and do some fun experimental cooking...that was my plan today. Watch TV, cook, maybe (at *worst*) drink some beer... Instead, I can't go to the store, I'm calling a fucking crisis hotline, I'm drinking very old (but not in a good way) alcohol that I have around (spoiler alert, I'm drunk), and I'm in trouble to one degree or another...and not because someone wronged me or because ""shit happens"" but because I did a bad, stupid thing that I'm going to suffer consequences for. I can't even go to the fucking grocery store without completely fucking up my life, apparently. Where's the hotline for *that*?

I'm not a kid--I'm a middle-aged adult who should be doing *way* better than this. I have a really good job, good pay, all that...I wasn't abused as a child. I have no ""excuse"" for this shit.

I went through another ""crisis"" several months ago that lasted a few months (minimal eating, drinking, not sleeping right, panicking all the time, etc.). Things sorted themselves out, and I settled down...and yeah. Not that things were perfect, but a lot of what happened and what was wrong was sorted out. I was fine for like...a few fucking months. And now I feel like I'm right back into it--another crisis.

The 988 woman suggested seeing a therapist, and yeah, she's right...or something.

Oh, and the person who I was talking to about the situation today (not 988) kept going on about how the most important thing was that *I* was OK, blah blah...and at one point, she said, ""it could have been worse"", and I said ""Greg Abbott said that after 19 children were murdered, so...yeah."" So that probably doesn't indicate a healthy engagement with the world around me. :-D And she asked me if someone in my home was hurting me, and I was like, ""I live alone, so if anyone's hurting me, it's me"" (and I am!). Basically, I wish I had a fucking excuse--stop asking! As hard as it must be to have an abusive partner or substance abuse issue, what do you do if you don't even that to explain your problems? You're just a fuck-up on your own, apparently, with no excuse or explanation.

Anyway, while 988 was OK and I may use it again if needed, they can't *fix* anything, really. If you feel you've ruined your life, even 1000 3-digit phone calls can fix it. I just feel sad that I *have* to use it...I have no one else to go to."	macphile	post	31.182908724296603	female	White	0.9993768334388733	na	na	na	3	MentalHealthSupport	failed

But when I got back from addressing that, I cooked (OK, microwaved) and ate food for the first time since Saturday lunch. I've also had 2 hours of sleep in 2 nights.

Anyway, at some point, I guess I need to call my insurance about providers...their website doesn't seem to be doing much for me.

"focus on your breathing when you start to feel panicked, it’s the first to go. take your thoughts one step a time and sit with them. check in with yourself and see how you’re feeling instead of focusing all on him. we’re often ignore our check engine lights to make sure everyone else is okay. once you’re able to respect his boundary, your relationship and connection will improve during these difficult moments and conversation will be more beneficial to both of you. come to him with love and make that known when you’re ready to have the conversation. if you can’t have it right away, see if you can “schedule” the conversation with him for a time when it works best of eachother. make sure you hold space for his feelings and address your concerns calmly. tone goes A LONG WAY, create a safe space where feelings can be heard and validated. you may be assuming the absolute worst and doubting yourself thinking you’re the cause for a disconnect but you cannot read his mind or feel like emotions he’s experiencing in that time until he is ready to share.

"If you’re suffering from emotional abuse, it can be hard to trust your own perception of what’s happening. Are these your feelings or are you being manipulated to feel them? Are you overreacting or should you seek support? If you’re asking these questions, it’s important to be familiar with the signs of emotional abuse and how they may show up in yourself or others.

Examples of these behaviors include:

* Demeaning and second-guessing
* Making you question your reality
* Making you feel guilty or stupid for feeling hurt
* Isolating you from your support system
* Belittling your concerns

"I don’t know if this is helpful at all, but two important things I remind myself is that small steps/things are a better way to go about coping with stuff and that if I can’t keep up a routine or consistency with it, that’s fine, because my here and there efforts DO count and it’s already more progress than I’ve made before. To elaborate, for my mental health I try and do little things for myself when I think to, because “every day” is not realistic, that make life a bit more comfortable or peaceful. For instance working drains me, I’m stuck with Night Shift for now, but when Im on my way home I get to see the sun rise and I’ll turn on my favorite songs or something that matches whatever vibe I’m feeling and I’ll roll my window down a bit to feel and hear the wind (I like “white noise,” I sleep with a fan on) and try to just enjoy the scenery and moment while it lasts. Does it cure the depression and anxiety and stress? No, but it helps make it a bit more bearable. Another thing I do to make sure I’m at least snacking semi-regularly (again, consistently is not realistic for me so I don’t set that expectation for myself) because it seems to help my mental health somewhat, (side note: the primitive part of your brain that is processing that fight/flight/fawn/freeze reaction might die down a bit if you can snack on something or chew gum because your brain knows that if you’re eating, you can’t possibly be in danger, because then you wouldn’t be able to eat) is I’ll buy quick, easy, snacks that take little to no effort to make such as toast with some butter and jam I like on it, something I can just open and microwave like an easy-meal or soup, crackers, potato chips, even some “junk food” just to have something that I enjoy eating and get SOMETHING in my stomach. I’m not good at keeping up my grooming and looks lately, but just splashing water on my face and at least using mouthwash if not a full brushing and maybe splashing some water on my hair to freshen up will do between showers because it does enough to make me presentable. When I have the energy, I’ll get a few outfits or at least specific pieces of clothing that are the most comfortable to me ready and set aside so instead of making an outfit later, when I don’t have the energy and focus, I already have my favorite clothes ready to put on. It’s the little things, those online articles and a lot of therapists even over-generalize (not quite the term but close enough) how to go about coping practices and mental health hygiene, like for deep breathing, those exercises only help if you can get yourself to practice and get used to doing them without thinking much about it when you’re NOT in too bad of a funk, or else you’ll never think to use it or it won’t help much when you do maybe need it, but instead of explaining that everyone says “just do it!”

"For context, my diagnoses include ADHD, Autism, Cyclothymia, Anxiety and CPTSD. This is about what has helped me balance all of those aspects out in my day to day as well as my lows.

I'm just learning to let myself be in my lows. Don't make any decisions when I'm down like that but just allow myself to be numb without feeling badly or guilty about it. 

When I know I'm about to be in a down, I prepare. For instance, I make sure I have lots of bottled water or Gatorade next to my bed along with some easy to eat snacks like Cheez-its. I also have these toothbrush things that go on your finger so I can at least do something about dental hygiene because half-assed is better than not at all. (You can find them on Amazon under Disposable Textured Deep Cleaning Teeth Wipes.) 

DomsticBlisters on TikTok gave some great advice that I use like have a 2-Gallon ziplock bag at your bedside for trash and or dirty dishes. 

Then in my daily life, I've stopped using reusable dishes all together. Instead I use single use items (I do try to get biodegradable items for this like bamboo when and where I can but that's not always achievable financially). It has helped so much by not having a pile of dishes mocking me everyday because doing the dishes is one of the tasks that I have struggled with the most. I have also gotten a maid to come clean my house once a month and it's a lot less expensive than I thought it would be. They basically sweep, mop, vacuum and dust but that helps me so much.

Basically just be kind to yourself and know that it's ok. Get help when and where you can. I mean the medically too. There is no shame in the medication game (I used to think there was but I've come to realize that my mood stabilizers and ADHD meds are just helping me to function in a society not built for me). 

At the end of the day, find things that work for you. If that's yoga, great! If it's allowing your depression to do it's thing so you don't have this cloud hanging over you, that's great too. So long as you stay safe, it's ok to allow yourself to feel your lows (or not feel in my case). Always remember that you are never as alone as you may feel (I mean this in a comforting way,not ominous).

"Hi there! Mental health can be complicated. Each of us is also unique which means that what helps us look after our mental health can be very different. While there is no 'one-size fits all approach to mental health perhaps it could be helpful to think of techniques in terms of levels.  
The first level could be 'self-care'. These are short-term strategies that can help create a generally favourable environment for your mental health. Breathing techniques, taking time off, eating well, getting adequate rest, spending time pursuing hobbies, journalling and so on would all be self-care activities. They help you cope with the ups and downs of life.   
However, if your concerns are deeper or are taking a larger toll on your functioning these strategies might not be enough. As you mentioned, they might help in the short run but over the course of time, you might not feel much different. This can be because there are deeper-rooted issues which we might need to explore. The best way to do so is with the help of a qualified mental health professional (MHP). An MHP can help you identify patterns and beliefs that you might hold which could be influencing the way that you view the world. Once identified, you and your MHP can work together to change whichever patterns are not working for you!   
We hear that you have already tried counselling...do you think letting your counsellor know that you are not very satisfied with the process could be helpful? Honest feedback can help your counsellor make changes where required. If you still feel like you are not seeing any changes, it is possible that your current counsellor is not the best fit for you. Therapy is an interpersonal relationship, and finding a therapist you feel comfortable with and whose style matches yours can take some time. Perhaps you can try a different professional and see if that feels like a better match for you."	boomboxspence	reply	na	na	na	0.9994394183158875	weak	no	no	na	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.

Last week she spent all our money on drugs I got very mad and said I wanted a divorce. She talked about selfharm, ate a bunch of pills and I finaly got. Her to the hospital and she is currently on a psychiatric hold. Im so grateful and relieved for this break. I go to support groups and they all explain that addiction is a Disease. And If she has another mental issue then she has that disease as well.  I’ve been living with this since before the pandemic and she keeps not going to doctors or AA type recovery groups. I’m trying to understand that even thought it is obvious she is hurting herself and everyone else she won’t get the help she needs. 3 years of insanity is all I can do, I don’t want her to die but I can’t stop it and keep myself sane. I feel lost, but I know I’m not Alone.	Inner_Importance8943	post	40.370769840515635	female	White	0.00867561623454094	na	na	na	4	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.
as a recovering addict myself i can say no matter what you say or do she will not get help unless she’s ready. i think it’s time to start thinking about YOU. i also understand what it’s like to be in a relationship with an addict and how hard it was to leave. i understand worrying about what would they do to themselves if i left. but like i said, there’s nothing you can do unless that person is ready. you can love her from a distance, but for the sake of YOUR mental health you need to leave. it takes a very strong person to walk away from a situation like this but i can promise you it’ll be worth it. take some to work on you and figure out who you are again. there’s better out there. find someone you trust to talk about how you’re feeling too because healing from this can be hard. i’m sorry you have to go through this. sending love ❤️	Inner_Importance8943	reply	na	na	na	0.00867561623454094	weak	strong	no	na	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.
"Addictions don't just come out of nowhere. One could be using it as escapism from the painful of reality. What kind of trauma does she has? What repressed emotion did she have? is it related to friends or family or school or work? The only way to stop that is she becomes self aware of the trauma and reconciling with the other part of her inner child...takes a step into healing it. You can help her by encouraging her with words more often and make her do things move more redirecting her attention what is she interested in before she got into drug?  She can try shadow journalling but also work on reclaiming her power but mainly focus on her sacral chakra balance. Her drug addiction is exhibiting her sacral chakra is very imbalance and most likely she is feeling lack of fulfillment in life. Sacral chakra stones/ crystal will help her but also diet on orange colored food. (this is optional)....but mainly natural methods...let her expressing herself more  artistically  like art, cooking,dancing etc. She should also do more water related sports (e.g. swimming) or just take showers before bed daily. (there's online sacral chakra dance meditation she can follow or even just meditate to that music) It just takes time and if shes willing to

As for you, I think you can find a place to settle and move out first if u don't know how to divorce yet and help her in a distance later onwards. You want to cuddle because of ur heart chakra. Setting boundaries with ur partner is important and stop you from overgiving. Do not be over attach to her and sacrifice self for others. You can help others without sacrificing yourself (win win situation). Sacrificing is unnecessary and not equal giving.  Open your window and let more air come in when indoor and reconnecting with nature will help u and ur partner too.

I’ve been prescribed 2mg of diazepam to help with severe anxiety attacks. They don’t happen everyday but when they come in it’s like I feel like I’m dying. 

I suffer from health anxiety so medications etc make me worry that the worst of the worst side effects are going to happen to me.

I used to be super loving and caring to the point that I’d cry if someone killed a bug. I went through a lot of physical mental verbal and emotional abuse constantly for three and a half years and got out of it last November. I was on drugs until last may, when I quit I went to therapy because I had been waiting to face my mental problems when I got back home and was stabler. I had used drugs to numb my mind and it probably saved a lot of my sanity through all the shit I was out through. Anyways, I go to intake at the therapist office, they go through like 300 questions, most being raw harsh detailed ones that reopened a bunch of things that terrified me and that I’d shoved down. I allowed it because I’d told myself if I want to get better I had to do it. At the end she told me that I couldn’t be seen with a therapist for over a month, because that was the earliest visit they had open. If she would have told me that in the beginning I wouldn’t have opened all this shit until then. It set my mind into overdrive, I haven’t been feeling much of anything except pain in the back of my head where I got hit by my ex with a machete two Februarys ago. It’s a 4 inch long cut that I went to the hospital for and they told me I needed stitches at least but I took care of it myself. He hit me with a sheathed machete and it went through the sheath am also cut all my hair off in that spot. I’ll put a picture below of what it looked like almost a year after including me cutting the rest of my hair multiple times tryna even it out. Anyways I don’t know if the blunt force trauma from the indent in my skull has a part in my cold hearted attitude or maybe my anger but the only emotion I noticeably feel is wanting to hurt things. Not people yet, but I get angry when people wanna talk about feelings with me. I know I’m in here somewhere, but this horrible thing is sweeping over me quick and I don’t know what to do. I assumed therapy was trying to make more money out of me by messing me up more before starting to fix me. Mind you I had 5 months roughly before going to therapy and after going through the trauma that I didn’t feel like this. I get adrenaline rushes imagining harming things that aren’t people. I thought I was multiple personality but I don’t know at this point. I felt like a prisoner in my own body in the beginning, like this monster would get to do fucked up stuff and I’d be inside me unable to stop it but have to watch it happen then feel like a piece of shit and deal with the aftermath but I still felt bad at this at point. Now I feel further away, like I know I should feel bad but I don’t. I’m present enough to say that I don’t want to become that and this is a last attempt to maybe get some advice instead of just giving up completely. I don’t know, maybe I’m stupid for even bringing it up but it’s worth a shot if it could give me a different perspective.

"
I have experienced some very intense, strange, abnormal, supernatural, spiritual things in my life, as well as miracles, things that most people don’t believe are possible, things that don’t usually happen to everyone or lots of people and because of these experiences, I’m labelled as psychotic etc because people think these things are in my head/imagination.

Some of the things I have experienced, I have experienced with other people, so I know some of these things really did happen but still, no one believes me...

Sure, I'm depressed, sure, I accept I have PTSD, anxiety etc because of the trauma and things I've been through, but I refuse to accept that most of the things I've experienced or continue to experience are just mental health when I know lots of these things were real...

I have always also had my own opinions on disorders such as schizophrenia, personality disorders etc, I have always believed that some, if not most of people diagnosed with these things actually have abilities, powers, they genuinely hear and see what the rest of society cannot hear and see, there ""personalities"" maybe left over personalities from that persons previous lives or they have other souls/spirits with them, sometimes protecting them, or sometimes there ""personalities"" are actually there higher self...

If God or another spirit or supernatural being genuinely spoke to you or something spiritual/supernatural happened infront of your eyes, you would instantly get labelled as mentally ill as well...

Imagine, genuinely being abducted by aliens, whitnessing a miracle, being able to travel to other dimensions, seeing into further realms or seeing things that other humans cannot see because you are wired differently, and just being labelled mentally ill and having no help for these things, no one to talk to... Imagine having depression and PTSD because of these experiences and not being able to get the right therapy to get over it or through it because you're told it's in your head....

There needs to be someone we can go to, speak to, someone to help us that actually believes your experiences, that believes what you've been through and can help you with these things, help you to understand, to cope, help to keep you strong, help to make you feel you're not alone, rather than just being told you're a liar and you imagined it all... 

Truthfully, no one truly knows whether or not people are really able to see and hear things that are really there but others can't see, no one knows whether people can truly see the future, have visions, communicate with God or higher beings or your higher self, no one knows whether people can actually travel to other realms or experience miracles and spiritual, supernatural things that defy science and nature, no one truly knows the truth until they experience themselves...

It's so lonely not being believed... it's so lonely having to keep things to yourself because speaking about things is pointless when you know you'll just be told it's all in your head... it's lonely when you're on a different level to others... it's lonely when you understand certain things and know that there is more to this world and life than what is physical... It's lonely having to try and understand these things alone and get through them without help unless you meet others that are like you that also understand...

Once upon a time, people did understand, people that experienced these sorts of things were called seers or witches or warlocks etc, people understood, but now, those of us who are witches, prophets, connected, spiritual, enlightened, get told we are crazy and put in hospitals and when we tell people of our experiences, people believe us even less because of the labels we have...

My depression, anxiety, paranoia, PTSD etc comes from my trauma, comes from these experiences which I have to keep to myself, come from being alone, come from understanding certain things about this world which are hard to accept, I became an addict to cope, to stop my brain overloading, to give me strength... 

There needs to be an alternative for us... someone to talk to who genuinely understands and believes us and someone who also knows that these experiences are real and do happen... 

I'm sick of being given meds and therapy, because it doesn't stop it or help, meds won't help when it's not in your head, meds won't help when it's real..."	MagzalaAstrallis	post	29.137375240039244	female	White	0.008087423630058765	na	na	na	4	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.
You sound very open-minded and perceptive, I think that's a wonderful quality. It is lonely when you experience things that are different than what others tend to experience, but know that you are not alone in your experience. There are so many out there who have feelings like this about existence. Medications, for me personally, have helped grow my connection to life and those miraculous circumstances, but in a way that feels more safe. You said you were addicted at one point to cope with the things you were witnessing. I've struggled with addictions myself. Medications have helped me surmount those addictions and find other ways of coping. I agree with you, that all that happens in life, is not simply a product of mental illness like depression/PTSD, which I have too, by the way. The intersection between spirituality and mental health is interesting to me! What I would say to you friend, is to continue on your journey of finding people who will listen, and believe you.

"I have a personal theory that periods of more extreme stress and/or some specific form of mental illness can lead to people attracting more coincidences and just weird things going on… and something going on internally attracting weirdness from different things in life externally… I mean we have no idea what is truly going on with life and psychology is such a new science compared to others… but brains are clearly connected and with subconscious communication going on that we’re all completely oblivious to

I really don’t understand it at all, but based on my own personal life experiences it’s the only thing that comes close to truly explaining certain things (I’ve been very wrong about things in the past however so I hope I’ve finally reached reality now lol)

Also sorry I only read some of what you put here, but what I read made me think of my personal ‘theory’

I hope you are doing well yourself, I’ll finish reading what you put now 

(And I hope this actually makes sense I cba to re type, and this is all something I’ve been trying to avoid thinking or talking about - basically though I used to be delusional, or at least something that looked that way to others, yet because I hadn’t been diagnosed then mental health professionals think I’m lying about it… or maybe they didn’t at first and I was being paranoid and it then became reality… and I’ve also had an insane amount of weird coincidences and just general weirdness in my life especially since getting delusional etc… lucky for me mental health professionals are so supportive and helpful with all of that and definitely don’t think I’m lying about my mental health and traumatic experiences generally and etc… lol not, only joking: they even think I lie about things like having friends and being delusional at all in the past (luckily for me it’s stopped bothering me so much emotionally and I don’t think I’m currently delusional anymore, except veery occasionally… and as mentioned it doesn’t bother me emotionally anymore (thank fuck for that I’ve literally lost about 2/3 of my hair from stress from all of this now…)
Anyway it’s possible that they’re onto something with my delusions potentially being different to a persons that is truly in psychosis (they’re obviously never straight with me and when I’m more stressed I can’t do confrontation usually-so ugh anyway I’m clearly still bad with going on about this)

2001 ford ranger xlt 2.3l with a 4 cylinder engine. It's not just a cracked frame, literally there is a huge hole at the tail tips where the bumper connects. The leaf springs are rusted on the frame, so that has to be removed as well. I am mostly focused on the left side, as that is where it's the worst. I am terrified of driving it right now, becuase one bump could literally make the bumper fall right off. Plus, I am worried I won't have enough to fix it as it extends about a foot back. I have some money saved, but not a lot as I did before because last month I got frauded and had to use 400 to float me through. Then some asshole threw something at my windshield that damn near shattered it, so I had to replace it as I have basic insurance m so it's not covered. Then before that, I lost all control of my disorders at my job and I dropped my full time status so I can focus on my health, then dropped my primary care doctor becuase we haven't been getting along since I got placed with him and he wanted to put me on meds that run the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Next week is my birthday. I have sank over 12000 into the engine and body to fix it. Right now I am panicking and losing it becuase I might have to part with it. The parts all together cost 270.

"Sounds like it will be fine to drive. Those parts can be patched up by someone who knows how to weld. Just take it easy. The frame is solid. The damage sounds like it's behind the axle. The frame is the strongest part of the truck. If the damage was between the axles, it would be an issue. Believe me, I've driven worse shape cars. Just don't tow with it. If the bumper is falling off, tear the scab off.

It's where the rear bumper and the frame connect, right next to the leaf spring hanger. Literally, the small square that bumper mounts are attached. I hear the left side squeak when I go over a bump, the left side is much worse than the right. I am basically rebuilding it from the ground up, as it was much worse when I bought. The state I am in has shitty roads. Like, pot holes that you can swim in. What do you mean by scab?	Collector_2012	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9983335137367249	no	strong	no	na	MentalHealthSupport	failed
I can't sleep.....I get maybe 6 hours if I am lucky. Most of the time, I am awake for days on end. Taking 40 to 80 mg of melatonin at a time. I don't know why anymore. On top of that, I feel like freak of nature, unable to date anyone. Yet, I feel comfortable being alone; even though I am envious of everyone around me for having theirs live together. While mine is just barely holding on. I have almost no friends, very little family..... can't go to collage because it's too expensive and something happens whenever I get close to starting..... I feel hopeless. I hate myself, I hate how I am, I hate the horrid memories I have that won't go away.

Hi. Sounds like you're overdosing on melatonin. It probably messes with your bodies innate ability to feel tired. Discuss the right dosis - or if you should take it at all - with a physician.	Collector_2012	reply	na	na	na	0.9989087581634521	weak	no	no	na	MentalHealthSupport	failed
It's been documented during sleep studies that I wake up for unknown reasons, and that's with the masks on as well. I am currently in between physicians due to my previous one trying to stick me with meds they would have caused my health to decline further. I have had sleeping issues for most of my life. I take a high dosage so I can fall asleep most of the time ( that includes smoking weed ) as lower dosages will not do anything for me. I cannot take trazadone, as I am allergic to it ( found that out the hard way ). Today I know that it will be a 32 hour day for me, as sometimes I am up for days at a time ( and that's without the melatonin ) and I talking like 2 or three days awake because I cannot fall asleep, or stay asleep.

Again, a dosage of melatonin this high can worsen insomnia. If your body is used to feeling tired all of the time (because of weed and melatonin), it won't go to sleep as easily. I would suggest healthy eating, regular exercise, good sleeping hygiene and staying off self-medication.	Collector_2012	reply	na	na	na	0.9989087581634521	no	no	no	na	MentalHealthSupport	failed

"I went through alot last year and this year.  House fire, trapped inside of house.  Lost just about everything. Finally got back into the house after 8 months.  Then my husband of 12 years leaves me. Our marriage was rocky for awhile.. then the kicker.. he's screwing around with my best friend of 15 years.  He wanted me out of the house so he beat his face up and scratched it.  Said I did it. He got a PFA had me removed from the house by sheriff's in front of my boys. (8&9)
I have no money for a lawyer so I got screwed. Lost my boys all but 6 hours a week. ( I was a stay at home mom for 9 years). He took all the money, got rid of my cats, didn't tell me.  It took a month to get my clothes and a couple of other things.
They smeared my name to everyone. I have bipolar 2 so they told ppl I beat my kids and that I'm a pill popping junkie. I'm in therapy since last year.  Tried to get meds changed up, made me feel like shit.  So I lost my job that I got when all this started.  Searching non-stop.   I'm in a funk.. I'm angry, I'm sad ( about my boys) I can care less they are together.  But my BEST friend.  Now they do all this expensive stuff with the boys. I feel like a failure, a shitty mom, because I can't do those things with the boys.  I am just tired... Emotionally.. I want to be happy, I want to stop the thoughts in my head and the mistrust I feel towards everyone.  I have a good man in my life now,. But I just feel like I'm sabatoging my relationship,. I have some good days.  I'm happy with my boys . I'm just feeling useless and like I'm no one .. I worry all the time I'm being betrayed or will be abandoned or just out with nothing.  They lied, they took everything from me and live life like they did nothing wrong.  My mom is so weird and says she's with me, shes supportive.  But then flips sides.  How I should have never let him back in the house because SHE kicked him out after she saw him with the gf with her own 2 eyes.  
I'm sorry this is so long.  I'm just so down and just want to move on and clear my head"	Key_Refrigerator2367	post	24.869074783403097	female	White	0.9989855885505676	na	na	na	2	MentalHealthSupport	failed
"I have bipolar as well and i can relate. But my experience is nothing compared to yours. Just remember you had shit done to you and with bipolar it just makes the sad and anger turn into depression and hopelessness.

With that being said you need to give yourself a break and reward yourself. You did what you can with what you got. But you are still an awesome person because you are trying!

The sucky part is its going to hurt for a while. This slump and betrayal you feel takes time to pass. Distraction and revisiting some favorite things may help. Plan your days a head of time and keep yourself busy. Even if busy meant binging a show. Try to get out and do things once in a while to help stimulate the brain by being in a new envionment. Remember to eat well and take care of yourself first. With your new partner take this time and explore together.

Most of all keep going to therapy to help monitor your mood. It will pass. For me it took about 2 years but each day slowly felt less heavy. Just stay present and do what you can now.

"Eating disorders have a way of commanding your attention, at least some of the time. They occupy a portion of your awareness.

A simple lack of awareness of hunger or a habit of ignoring hunger is more typical of depression, ADHD, and/or PTSD.

If your childhood included neglectful, withholding, or punitive parenting, or if you have a disorder like ADHD or autism that began during childhood, this could be part of a lifelong pattern of ignoring your own needs.

People who habitually ignore their own needs will also have a few specific needs that can't be ignored for long because ignoring them leads to crisis and/or numbing behaviors.

What your describing is what I have done for years, eating depends what mood I'm in, I don't think it's a eating disorder but I'm no doc, some people just arnt big eaters, some people are obsessed with food and some people are not, it's not healthy to live like this as eating plays a big part in your energy and mood and overall health so just eating a small amount on the days you don't feel like eating may be bennifisial if your low in mood. You could probibally do with some multivitamins if your eating isn't great, also might be worth seeing a doc about blood tests as you may be anemic. 👍✌	walterdrb	reply	na	na	na	0.9982172846794128	no	strong	no	na	MentalHealthSupport	failed

You’re not alone. I can relate and it almost feel more peaceful to not be able to think. When I feel this way I tend to also realize that it’s something about life that is overwhelming me and I need to pull back. So taking time out to intentionally relax my mind is important in these moments. When I don’t know how, my go to is a quick guided meditation or deep breathing exercise. You’d be surprised at how something so simple can have a trendies positive/soothing impact on the mind. We’re very fragile especially when mentally exhausted. But taking small steps like this can make a huge difference to feel better. Most importantly you’re not alone feeling this way this totally resonates.

- see a mental health professional. Some things need a little more help than people on Reddit can provide.

I don't know what all you've tried but that sounds like me. I've gone to I can't count how many doctors, therapists, specialists and more for over 30 yrs now. I tried every pill and talk therapy they gave me without any of it working. By chance we found out about TMS, transcranial magnetic stimulation and it worked! It doesn't fix it, I still have to work and fight hard everyday, but it shifted something in my mind in some way I can't really explain. It didn't fix my conditions but I feel different, like I actually have a chance to fight now. I encourage people to look into it and ask their doctors!

"Like the title states, I just want some advice or words of encouragement right now. 

Due to my disability, I meet all of my basic self care needs by myself like drive or clean. So, I have to rely on my partner to essentially be able to live. I feel embarrassed and hopeless to know that I can't survive independently. It's eating me up that I'm just a big bother.  

I can't help but be jealous of everyone who doesn't have to deal with this. I'm beginning to resent others because of this jealousy and, in turn, resenting myself because I'll never be good enough. I'm starting to get incessant suicidal thoughts.

I know this is pathetic but I just need one person to just tell my it's going to be okay. Right now I just feel hopeless"	louxxion	post	11.000067339392702	female	White	0.9969967603683472	na	na	na	7	MentalHealthSupport	failed

"Posted this in r/mentalillness as well. So I’ve been depressed my whole life. Didn’t get diagnosed until I was 19, after I was sexually assaulted in college and was suffering from PTSD. That was the first time I’d ever sought help for my mental health. At that point I didn’t realize how bad it was even before the incident. I’ve struggled with suicidal thoughts on and off since I was in middle school. Back then, I had friends who used to echo my sentiments when I would voice these thoughts and so I really thought it was normal back then; now I realize that my friends were either also in a bad place mentally or joking because they didn’t know how else to respond. I’ve been in therapy since the age of 19 (currently 23) and it’s only started to help in the past 6 months or so. I’ve tried different antidepressants but I’ve been on Prozac 40 mg for the past six months or so as well. I’d like to say that this medication is working for me, but recently I’ve started to think that maybe it’s not working so well anymore… I’ve not been having suicidal thoughts or full on breakdowns like I used to. My problem now is every night when I sleep, I wake up in this super realistic hellish dream world. In my dreams, I’m usually surrounded by people I know, whether it’s my family, people I knew from high school or college, or even people from work. Every scenario is different, but most of the time I’m in some sort of dilemma and my first reaction in the dream is to shut everybody out, scream incessantly until I get all of my anger out, and then try to kill myself in every way possible. The screaming parts are physically taxing, like when I wake up I feel like I’ve been trying to scream so hard and nothing was coming out. The suicidal parts are what really affect me when I wake up. Those parts stay with me, I remember my dreams really vividly and I kind of hate that. The dream started off weird enough that I didn’t associate any of the content with real life. Like I didn’t recognize the landscape well or the people, and I wasn’t in that much of a dilemma. I would just get so angry in the dream and when I wake up I still feel that anger without knowing what I’m even mad about. Recently, the dreams have been getting more realistic. I am writing this because last night I had a dream I was in my house with my family and some feeling just came over me that I could not live this life anymore. In my dream, I released my cats into the wild, broke up with my boyfriend, and then somehow convinced my mom to get out of my car while it was snowing so I could rip down the street and run myself off the road and hopefully die. My attempts must never be successful, because there’s always something after that in the dream. It’s usually me crying and screaming because I was not able to complete this objective that I felt I had. But every time, I wake up with this feeling of dread and anger and it makes me wanna lay in bed all day and just die. Like I don’t want to actively harm myself I just wanna lay there and wither into nothing. Once I can get my mind off the dream, I feel normal again. My days go on as normal, I’m able to function normally, but if I can’t get my mind off the dream, my whole day is fucked up. I’ve tried talking to my counselor about this, I’ve tried talking to my boyfriend and my family about this, and the only thing that scares me is how real these scenarios are getting in my dreams. I sometimes even find myself recalling these dreams and truly having to figure out if it was something that was in my dream or if that happened in real life. It’s making me feel kind of delusional in the daytime because the line between my dreams and reality is becoming blurred. I’m just putting this out there in case anybody’s have any similar experiences or any advice and how to overcome this, because I’m actually at a really great spot in my life right now. I’m about to start my career finally and I don’t wanna have to go into that process carrying this dream baggage every day. Thanks for any help or advice or support any of you can provide.  

ETA: I forgot to mention that I’ve also been smoking weed daily since I was 19. I used to drink heavily back then but don’t drink much at all anymore. Even though I could get fired from my job for it, I am high pretty much all day everyday. Not sure if that’s effecting my dreams but the amount or type of weed I’ve smoked hasn’t changed in a long time."	whalesnrainbows74	post	20.117169590884576	female	White	0.004770956933498383	na	na	na	3	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.
It’s great that you had the courage to start therapy, and especially great that it’s making things better for you. I’m so sorry to hear about the dreams, that sounds really hard to deal with and it’s a testament to your strength to be able to get through the day after a terrible night.

I took this advice today and it was very helpful! My therapist helped me realize that it’s correlating to my fear of starting my career, which involves moving and doing a new school program. The last time I started a new school and moved, things in my life went south very fast. My dreams are likely just a way of working through the fears and past trauma and now when I’m awake I just need to focus on realizing that whatever decisions I make will not change this trajectory I’m on & that that is a good thing. I’ve always been anxious about making decisions because my parents made all my decisions for me until I was like 18 and I struggle to do it for myself now. He’s helping me realize most of my decisions are not life or death and therefore I can stop feeling as if they are!	whalesnrainbows74	follow-up	na	na	na	0.004770956933498383	no	strong	no	na	MentalHealthSupport	failed

I’ve been going through a lot of stress lately, related to family, living circumstances, finances, etc. I wouldn’t even know where to start except I have not a soul to lean on for support or vent to or get advise from & I need it desperately! I feel like I’m on the verge of a breakdown or worse.. I don’t know where to find help asap, I don’t have a therapist at the moment & I texted a crisis hotline the other night which helped in the moment but I don’t think I can get the advice I need from that. I’m so overwhelmed, I don’t want to make big changes or important decisions based on my emotional roller coaster then regret it later or realize it wasn’t the right decision but my situation is so complicated & I’m getting so tired of feeling this way & it’s so exhausting. Any suggestions, advice is greatly appreciated & thank you to anyone taking the time to read or respond to me. Have a blessed day.

"I have an extensive history with benzodiazepines. Sry, long post.

Before docs realized i was bipolar, i was put on 6mg daily clonazepam, and i want to say 4 alprazolams a day, i think 5mg? Klonopin and xanax. Combat wounded had recently returned from deployment. Ptsd, tbi, etc. Clonazepam 3x a day.

I quickly developed a tolerance. Within a year the dosages i was on were not helping as much as theyd intially had. Initially, i felt great, the first few months. After i began 'working through windows'. Id have a couple hours of feeling okay after taking the clonazepam and would supplement w/ the Xanax. Eventually, these windows were nonexistent. Once i developed a tolerance and i realized the leash around my neck I started titration with the intent of getting off the benzos. The xanax, short half life, was much easier. Not easy, but easier. The clonazepam was hell. The tiniest decreases were agonizing.

After 7.5 years, i had got down to 3mg a day and off the xanax completely. I was hospitalized in the psych ward and put through a rapid detox using phenobarbital. Cold turkey. On the phenobarbital i felt alright. Once it wore off and i was home, it was hell.

3 months of the most horrible post acute withdrawal syndrome. Another visit to inpatient. More months of PAWS. Huge adjustment. For reference id cold turkeyed nearly 7 years of high dosage opiates, about a month of a horrible flu, basically. Opiates were nothing compared to the clonazepam. Everyone has different physiology, this was my experience.

I still believe getting off benzos to be the most difficult challenge ive ever faced, including my combat experiences and nearly dying from a close proximity RPG blast. Grievously wounded. My childhood was extremely traumatic; war, combat....nothing else compares to the benzo withdrawal.

I dont recommend it. Benzos should not be used long term. Research shows theyre overprescribed and often for too long. A month. Thats typically the limit. For you, id think an antipsychotic and a mood stabilizer would be the go to. I am on a mood stabilizer and a sleeping medication. Tons of therapy. Massive amounts of therapy. Thats whats helped me.

Let me reiterate, unequivocally - avoid benzodiazepines. Especially clonazepam and thosr with long half lives. Maybe there are other usages where long term is acceptable. This is my anecdotal experience. I dont know how I survived benzodiazepines. I dont wish that fate on anyone. Pure suffering.

"I also use mine for sleep. I used to wake up 3 to 4 xs a night and, more often than not, have terrible dreams. Since I started taking Clonazepam I am a lot less restless and I stopped having panic enducing nightmares.

The caveat is, I'm in therapy and I take a mood stabalizer. CPTSD and Bipolar disorder suck. I also use an app called Headspace.

At first it's great. It helps keep your anxiety in check. Then afterwords, you start to develop an addiction to it and your body begins to fake panic attacks just so it can have more.

And just a warning but any benzo as a long term daily medicine can be risky. I dont really know how to describe the feeling but I took the Diazapam daily for a little over a month and definately felt like an urge to take the normal amount when I started to cut back on it.

Edit- dont let all the comments about addiction scare you into not using it ever. My Diazapam helps me ride out really bad days and its been an amazing medicine. I was going to inpatient every 3 months for a year before I got it prescribed and it's now been 6 months since my last stay. Just use any benzo as a last resort to avoid a crisis or panic attack and be aware of the signs of addiction."		reply	na	na	na	0.0030685411766171455	no	strong	no	na	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.
"I started clonazepam on an as-needed basis in 2001. It worked quite well. I had no problem until I was hospitalized for a couple of weeks in 2003. They had me take it every day, as often as possible. It worked great then too, but after I got out of the hospital I discovered that I now had withdrawals if I didn't take it regularly. That alarmed me, but it was still working. As time went on though, we had to keep increasing the dose to get the same effect. Eventually it couldn't be increased anymore and it wasn't working. They switched me to Xanax, which worked at first, but soon didn't. When I decided to get off the Xanax, I titrated off over a 3 month or so period (with doctor's help). It was miserable. It was even worse after I was off totally. It was maybe another 6 months before I felt normal again, and even longer before I could sleep again. After getting off the benzos, after 8 years on them, I started developing an interest in my hobbies and other activities, which had gone by the wayside while I was on the them. When my sister saw me later, she said that the ""twinkle had returned to my eyes."" I would not recommend benzos for anything other than short-term as-needed use."		reply	na	na	na	0.0030685411766171455	no	strong	no	na	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.
"Just gonna throw another comment in here in case it's not clear - please don't take it or any other benzodiazepenes. Even if you have zero side effects(unlikely), fewer and fewer doctors are prescribing benzos these days and that trend is moving very quickly toward not prescribing them at all. This means it's almost certain that at some point in the next few years your doctor will decide they can't or won't prescribe them to you anymore(or a law may pass and they literally can't) - but by that point, in order to get off them you'll have to go through VERY hell-ish withdrawal that could potentially kill you if not done right - except your doctor will likely say ""it's not that big of a deal, don't believe what you read online"".

"Thank you so much for telling your experience. 

 I’m definitely not planning on being on these kinds of anxiety meds for long; I don’t think my doctor is planning on it either, because she talked during our appointment about how she doesn’t like having patients on them for a long time.
I’m currently prescribed 0.5MG, once a day. I’m currently on 120MG of Latuda, once a day, as well. I haven’t been in therapy for over 5 years, though I really need it. Besides Bipolar and Schizo, I have CPTSD as well. 

My new doctor is trying to get me into therapy currently. I really like my new doctor; I’ve been in the system for nearly 7 years and she’s the first doctor that’s actually been respectful and tries her very hardest to understand the issues at hand.

"Happy to hear you've got a doctor you like. She sounds great. That's so rare, hang on to her. Your dose sounds manageable, I would not be on them longer than a month, just my advice. Also, highly advise getting back into therapy! It's so underrated. 

So I'm not a pharmacologist and only have a very basic understanding, but I'll give it a shot. Long half life can be a good thing as far as effectiveness, you're taking meds less frequently and it's in your system longer. I think this is supposed to curb withdrawal symptoms, less chance of addiction. But if you want to come off the medication, shorter half life means more intense withdrawal symptoms but shorter duration of those symptoms overall. Longer half life means it takes longer to fully kick, withdrawal symptoms are more drawn out. 

You cannot cold turkey Benzos above certain dosages/duration taking them, as there are severe risks like seizure, cardiac arrest, death. Where I was at, with the level of withdrawal and physical symptoms and mental distress I was getting -zero- benefit from the medication. During the wean I would have seizures or would be shaking, couldn't walk very long, no appetite, i mean I just felt like shit 24/7. I could only decrease by something like .25mg max a month. So trying to get through that while titrating slowly as to not die with it's half life of 40 hours+ (stays in your system for weeks) was agonizing. Maybe my experience wasn't typical, I had a pretty severe TBI and my brain is wired weird. Although everyone I've talked to who has kicked long term/high dose benzos has said it was terrible.

I'm sorry this is such a long post, but there is one experience I'd like to share. I had a plethora of other issues, PTSD, the bipolar, untreated childhood stuff/attachment disorder plus all the readjustment stuff, i mean i was in a bad place. Mentally I would hyperfocus on the negative stuff in life, everything sucked, everybody sucks, life sucks. So a natural conclusion for some of my doctors = it wasnt just the benzos. But the thing about the clonazapam....like...i eventually stopped feeling. I went numb, emotionally. It shut me down. When I'd finally kicked them, shortly after the second inpatient stay, my dog did something goofy or silly or idk. He ran into a wall or something and then looked at me with this big goofy grin. I laughed, for the first time in...years? I felt real joy, love. I hadn't felt that in idk how long. I realized I hadn't ""felt"" anything in so long. And I broke down into tears. I never cry. I sobbed and sobbed and sobbed. It was such a profound feeling and experience. I know for a fact it wasnt the other mental issues. It wasn't until the benzo was out of my system that I started feeling again. I'd been in therapy for years prior with almost no improvement. It was like my brain was working again, I was able to benefit from therapy more, my life went uphill from there. It's been great since.

Well, they are meant to be a temporary thing until they put you on something better. In my case, I was on them for literal years. Every doctor that knew about how long It was supposed to be on them was surprised that I wasn't taken off of them sooner.

Last year I developed major anxiety and was having panic attacks and I eventually got prescribed clonazepam. I would only take it when needed and it really, really helped me so much and helped me get back to normal again. It worked better than any other med. I don’t have anymore panic attacks and my anxiety is much more under control. I didn’t develop an addiction at all, I tried to only use it if I needed it. Sometimes .50 and sometimes .25.

My son is 45,retired a year ago, ending his career with the Navy as a senior chief.  He sold his house and moved across the country.  Everything was good until last Friday when we started getting hundreds of manic texts saying that he was autistic and lots of other subjects that make no sense at all.  So his wife took him to the VA hospital and he told the doctor that he was an idiot and didn’t know what he was doing. He feels like he’s smarter than the doctors.  They prescribed some meds and he insists it’s speed, designed to help his body keep up with his mind.  They went home and he scared his wife so badly that their daughter got her out of there after she had to call the police to escort them out.  He wouldn’t let her leave.  He now says he’s not autistic but he’s discovered God.  He somehow fooled the police into thinking he’s normal and he won’t seek help.  Our whole family is extremely worried and it doesn’t help that he’s 1500 miles away.  We are right in the middle of moving and can’t go out there and even if we did, I know he will absolutely refuse hospitalization.  I called the veterans crisis line and after they decided he wasn’t suicidal,they started asking me if I was or had ever been suicidal. I hung up on them.  I just looked and I have 128 new texts, all from my son, all in 15 minutes.

"They asked u those questions because it's standard procedure. It can be very traumatic to watch someone u love loose it. They have to make sure that you are ok too. You shouldn't hang up on them. After making sure u are ok , they were likely going to direct u towards other options, like getting him set up for a mental health evaluation and a mental health doctor and even group and one on one therapy. These things are easier to access if he already is receiving services from VA. Unfortunately the VA's processes run slow though. 

If u need very quick help for him you got to either convince him to go to the ER at the VA and check in as 51/50. Or u got to force it/trick him into it. 

There are certain things that military personnel will notice better than local law enforcement. Your best bet is to go through the VA. Believe it or not many local law enforcement are trained to see veterans as a high threat because they are combat trained . So involving police could potentially be very dangerous for your son as police will likely treat him as armed and dangerous simply because of his training. 

I know I will probably get a lot of hate for saying that in comments, but I sadly speak from first hand experience. My husband is a disabled vet and was going through a very hard mental health crisis. Police were called. And he ended up being shot in the head very quickly, even though they were fully aware that he was not at all a danger to anyone at all only to himself. He was on his way to the VA and police were offering to escort him to the VA as they opened fire on him. 

The VA is slow and difficult. Every time my husband needed help I found that the most effective way to get help quickly is to start blowing up the phones. Everyone's phone at the VA. It's easy to get lost in the massive system that is the VA. So bother everyone. Relentlessly. From the janitor to the head office. Call every phone number. Until they are forced to make your son a priority. Do it like his life depends on it because it really truly does."

Just over here in a downward spiral of self loathing, shame, and pity. I feel like my perceptions and ideas are so out of touch, I don’t know what’s true or real anymore. I think I was gaslighted by a narcissist….OR AM I THE NARCISSIST?? Or am I emotionally dysfunctional because I had emotionally immature parents and I’ve been mirroring/masking as a neurodivergent for 36 years of my life?! I just feel really confused, lonely, and like I’m an evil person inside, though I don’t want to be. I feel like other people easily make close friends and have happy, intimate relationships….and I have no idea how to do that. I think you have to spend a lot of time with people, which I hate doing. And I think you have to not dump your negative emotions out on others, but I say shit on impulse and instantly regret it. I am such a fucking weirdo and realize I am the toxic one (I think?!) because I keep ruining friendships. Or do I attract the wrong “friends” because I can’t see the red flags because I’m emotionally stunted?! I wish someone could tell me what’s real or not. Even if I’m the one who’s completely wrong about everything. It sure seems like I am. How do I just be normal and likable? I feel like one issue is that I’m fat and unattractive. People don’t want to even talk to me. And then if they do, they realize I’m so awkward, stupid, and mean. Even my 4 year old has shown me that he would prefer a “pretty” mommy. Why did God give me this life and others are blessed with so much more? What lesson am I supposed to learn from this?

As someone who survived narcissistic abuse, sounds like you’re great at gaslighting yourself and making yourself into the bad person when it could just be the world being judgmental, you repeating the learned patterns of abuse towards yourself and telling yourself you are crazy. Making the victim seem like they’re insane is textbook narcissistic abuse, of course I don’t know you, but from what you’ve said it sounds like you’re simply neurodivergent and having a hard time finding people who you like and get along with. Finding other neurodivergent people to socialize with who won’t judge you if you say the wrong thing or do something out of the social norm could be good, as well as finding a therapist if you don’t have one, to be the person you can talk to about the things you don’t want to bring up to friends. (if you’re holding in so much negative, it will come out somewhere, better to find a trained professional to let it out with where it will be constructive than with a friend if they’re reacting badly) attracting the wrong people is something I personally struggle with as well, we go for learned patterns, find people who remind us of our parents or those we’ve been around. So if you’ve been around mostly toxic abusive people, then yeah, it’s gonna be hard to find good people, and even if you do, setting yourself up for success with proper boundaries can be really hard when you don’t know how to form a healthy relationship. It’s no fault of your own, all I can suggest is seeking professional treatment, and trying to find some like minded people who will be kind and understanding(not easy, but possible!) and start small, doesn’t need to be hanging out going to stressful places, texting or a phone call when needed works too!

"Go up a couple posts? I commented something for someone else that I think could apply here. 

I feel you. Except I’m 32 and have been single for over a decade for fear of intimate relationships. I don’t have kids, but I have around 30 something nieces and nephews. I would love to have a family of my own. We are, however, our own worst critics. I hold myself accountable for my past, while much of it came from childhood sexual abuse, so much damage that I did to myself because of it, and I struggle to make and keep friends around, it feels like so much work. Nothing happens naturally like it used to. I have a “pretty face” but other than that, I gained the most weight especially since covid. I have yet to make a regular “friend” on my college campus and I’ve been there 4 years. I hardly have the energy the younger students do and I refuse to spend my time bullshitting or faking myself for the comfort of “friends”. I finally started to lose some weight but times are tough. Just trust that you’re not alone. You have a child and that’s such a beautiful thing!!! Seriously! You don’t know how lucky you are to have your kid (sorry, not meant to be negative comment but literally I get envious of people with kids because you generally have to have sex to have them). Don’t feed those negative thoughts about relationships. I’ve been fed them myself, and possibly questioned those same questions (unhealthy relationships have left me pretty wounded too). I don’t date now bc I’m still working on myself, but I have to remember that I’m for me first. It’s not meant to be unhealthy, just take your time and be gentle with yourself as you process the high speeds that surround you. We’re all still a bit out of order since covid let up and it’s ok to feel uncomfortable, a lot of discomfort, like really a lot! It’s probably natural but we’re too high speed to slow down and just let it be and run it’s course. I realize that so many people feel this way these days. And it’s rough because we all want someone to be there for US, and share with ME, but we don’t have the energy to do it for another, we’re all so sensitive and might not recognize that everyone else is worried about themselves too. When I was younger, service was the best thing to help me get out of a bad mental space. Even if it’s for your child, or a neighbor, maybe that’s a small action that could help redirect your focus.

What’s helped me is interrupting those behaviors when I notice they start. I’d shake away the thoughts literally or verbalize that I don’t want to do it and it’s become a reflex for me. If you need something to replace the urge of self harm or wanting to but not doing it to yourself, try cutting an orange. It has a similar feeling to skin. You could also try hitting stuffed animals or anything soft near you rather than hitting yourself. It just takes training your mind to replace those habits.

"God, this came up on my feed at the right time because for like a year and a half I've been feeling the SAME way. Literally, I feel your struggle. I'm not diagnosed as bipolar, but since I'm of age I've been doing even MORE research on top of the research of my symptoms, on how to get diagnosed as soon as I can. Just saying this to let you know that there are definitely people who hear you, who see you, and understand. You are NOT alone OP. You'll always have support here.

While diagnostic tests online can't officially diagnose you (I am NOT encouraging full blind self diagnosis! Do your research and see a doctor!), here are some links to the tests I myself have taken alongside my research on my symptoms, and hopefully afterwards if you still relate to those symptoms you can take your results to a psychiatrist and get the diagnosis process underway. I will mention that there are also a few types of bipolar disorder, so that's why I encourage extensive research and broadening your mind to what it COULD be, not just focusing on ""It's DEFINITELY bipolar.""

Also the song Manic by Coleman Hell

I was diagnosed with bipolar when I was 13. Everything you’re saying is exactly how it feels so I’d go with yes but I’m not a psychiatrist so I can’t give you a diagnosis. Make an appointment with a psychiatrist and tell them all of that and then discuss medications. You don’t have to keep taking ones that make you feel sick or if you don’t like the side effects. Figure out which meds work for you. It’ll take time. I hate pills so I only take my anti anxiety to stop my dermatophagia but for my bipolar, weed helps a lot. 

Also figure out what your triggers are. A good way to tell if something triggers you is your reaction to it. If it enrages you beyond comprehension: trigger. Then practice controlling yourself bc you will want to scream and smash shit at that point. Good healthy outlets for bipolar rage are martial arts and rage rooms lol
It’ll take years to recognize and get good at controlling yourself though. Took me years🥴

Cut off anyone who is toxic and just shit to be around ESPECIALLY if they make your bipolar worse. That’s why I had to cut off the majority of my family💀they’re insane😂"	SinkFormal1874	reply	na	na	na	0.9965882301330566	no	strong	no	na	MentalHealthSupport	failed

I started a new job a year ago and it’s so tough. It’s also made my head spin round recently and I feel so bitter all the time. Its also made me rethink the whole male population…but I know I only meet a select few. I’ve started crying again everyday, thinking about taking my life again and angry about the world. I have a deep sadness inside, I feel like nobody cares, nobody is compassionate anymore and I feel like I just don’t have the energy anymore for this life. Perhaps I’m just not tough enough, It just doesn’t seem worth all the stress sometimes….I’m so low	chlobo998	post	27.873064793060287	female	White	0.9985207915306091	na	na	na	1	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.
"I'm sorry you feel that way, and I sincerely hope you don't do anything to harm yourself in any shape, way or form.

Life isn't about being tough as so many might think.
It is about being compassionate.

But, not unlike yourself, and many others with us, I too have noticed a shift in society when it comes to being friendly.
Sadly, I think this is a sign of the times.
As connected as we are, we are more lonely then ever before.
As educated as we are, so ignorant are we, about what truly matters.

In the end I choose to believe that no matter what, it is our chooses that define who we are.
So I try to be friendly and nice to everyone I meet.
If I manage to make just a single person smile at any given day, it was a good day.

Because I brought someone else joy, no matter how small or insignificant our actions may seem.
They can mean the world to others around us.
It is one of the reasons I lurk in this subreddit and respond as much as I can.

Now, I cannot magically give you the energy you need to keep trudging on, but I hope that my few simple words here bring a small smile to your face.
And the small moment of my time that I dedicated to  posting here can once again make you believe that there are still people that care and are compassionate.

Stay strong my friend, and good luck 👍."	chlobo998	reply	na	na	na	0.9985207915306091	strong	no	no	na	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.
My husband is struggling with his mental health. I have tried to help him the best I can. He refuses to see a doctor and go on medication (he has been on it before and hated it). He refuses to speak to a professional about the matter and just keeps placing the blame on others. His temper has escalated lately and I’m at a loss on what to do. I’m to the point I no longer want to be around him and I’m afraid if I try to leave it will escalate to the point of someone getting hurt. We have a few children together and he blames most of his unhappiness on them. It has destroyed my self worth living like his. I can’t afford to move out on my own right now. What do I do? I’m tired of crying everyday and feel like an asshole for the awful thoughts I have about him.

So this is coming form a person with ADHD and depression. When I think of happiness I think of those moments that I sometimes get at night where I feel like I'm on top of the world and everything feels great. The thing is, when I look at people around me, from the outside at least, it seems like everyone is depressed. I never hear anyone mention how great life is and I would think that if I would be happy I would at least. It could be because of my ADHD daydreams and fantasies where I think happiness is like living in some fantasy movie-esque world. To be honest, it's kind of depressing and makes me not want to get treatment because it doesn't seem like anyone is really happy and all ADHD med's would do is make my motivation more consistent and flat. Sometimes I think everything is kind of fake and pointless and happiness is just a bunch of chemicals moving around in your brain. Maybe it's just my depression making me feel hopeless... I'm just hoping meds will just make me feel normal.	Revilo4	post	25.770689263922836	female	White	0.9891659617424011	na	na	na	4	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.
"I have the same mix of dx as you and I have had this thought before as well, especially when I've been *really* struggling and someone says something like ""this is just how life is."" I think part of it might be that there *are* probably a lot of people walking around with some kind of persistent depressive disorder (they used to call it dysthymia). But it might be more likely that for people who've never had those low lows, a baseline contentment and sense that life is and has always been pretty okay is just normal, so they don't feel the need to talk about it. 

In my experience, people who have come back from the brink of these things *do* talk about how great life can be because they've experienced the difference (one example is 12-step meetings...those folks often have a lot to say about how grateful they are and how good life has gotten because they've walked through the alternative and are able to starkly feel the difference.)

> Sometimes I think everything is kind of fake and pointless

Yup, that sounds like depression talking.

>happiness is just a bunch of chemicals moving around in your brain.

It sure is. But so are your shitty feelings of sadness and hopelessness. It's all just chemicals. That doesn't make any of it less real or meaningful. So why not take some steps if you can to get your share of the good-feeling chemicals, right?

Good luck, fellow traveler."	Revilo4	reply	na	na	na	0.9891659617424011	no	strong	no	na	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.
As someone who used to feel intense highs and lows and has evened out, I think I probably appear depressed. But often it's just calm focus or contentment.	Revilo4	reply	na	na	na	0.9891659617424011	no	strong	no	na	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.
"The right medication will bring you to a stable state. It gets better! 


Depression colors and distorts our view, which might be a factor in why everyone looks depressed.


Another possibility... I meet a lot of adults who forget how to have fun. I try to infuse fun, adventure, and excitement into my life. What did you love doing most as a kid?


Adults forget how to have fun playing with playdough, swimming in the ocean, climbing trees, twirling in circles, singing loudly, sticking stickers on everything, building a fort, or doing an obstacle course. These things may not work to increase happiness during depression, because aside from physical activity/social interaction/medication not a lot will help depression. But as your depression improves, maybe try a few of the things you loved as a kid? 


It may sound a little silly, but it keeps me happy."	Revilo4	reply	na	na	na	0.9891659617424011	no	strong	no	na	MentalHealthSupport	no prediction.
">someone says something like ""this is just how life is.""

I can really relate to this. I guess happiness is just contentment which to me seems kind of depressing, but once I get to that point I'll be content and happy, just like everyone else. It kind of feels like everyone else is in a different ""club"" or of a different species than me because of these differences. Sometimes it angers me because I can't understand why people do things, but it all makes sense when the depression clears up.

I'm kind of just hoping medication will just make me feel normal. I don't really like it when people say that you shouldn't expect medication to do all of the work for you. If I'm experiencing an illness caused by factors out of my control, I just want the medication to fix it at the source, right? Of course for some people who have grown accustomed to negative thinking, bad habits, abuse, etc., therapy will be great for them, but for me it's just that feeling that is missing which I can't really control."

"Not sure where exactly you're from so don't how your tax system is run.
Nor do I actually need to know.

Decently sure you can phone / email or contact your tax company in any way shape or form.
And tell them that a mistake was made and needs to be altered.
They should help out, because otherwise it just means more work for them.

I know anxiety can be a hard thing to get past, but this one should be quite an easy fix.

So try to calm yourself down a bit, wait until you feel composed.
Get in contact with your tax company/system, and explain what happened.
They're not the evil cold hearted people, everyone makes them out to be.

They know this is a tricky thing and they know how to fix your issue, so try not to worry too much.
If this is always a big issue for you, (tax return stress and all that) consider getting someone to help you out if at all possible.

"-Carbs before bed have been shown to help with sleep. 

-Make sure you get enough vitamin B-12. Deficiency is a common cause of insomnia. Get a supplement or eat fortified foods. B12 is naturally found only in animal products. If your diet is restrictive in any way (vegetarian, or you’re very busy and your variety is poor) you could be deficient. Vegans MUST supplement. Long term B12 deficiency can cause irreversible nerve damage so make sure you are getting it. 

-L-tryptophan, L-theanine and Magnesium are good supplements to try too. They are beneficial even if you don’t have insomnia. But not take more than recommended dose. 

-Peanut butter before bed (it has tryptophan too). 
- consider a melatonin supplement.

Insomnia is a condition that can cause a lot of unwelcome changes in your daily lifestyle. The feeling of fatigue and sleeplessness during the day could cause a lot of mood changes ranging from irritability to anger. Make a sleep schedule and try to follow it even during the weekends. Make sure that there is complete darkness in your room, and you can feel relaxed and comfortable. Avoid consuming any alcohol or caffeine before bedtime. Try to spend your time exercising or being physically active during the day, which would make you sleepy during the night. If you are suffering from chronic insomnia, you should visit a medical doctor for help.	Collector_2012	reply	na	na	na	0.9994163513183594	no	no	no	na	MentalHealthSupport	failed

"Do you eat meat/fish/eggs/dairy regularly? Then you should be ok with b12. I would recommend you get a blood test and check anyway because some people have trouble absorbing b12. 

There’s a lot of good research indicating simple carbs before bed helps both quality of sleep and ease of falling asleep. Try eating some cereal or whatever carbs you like 1 hour or so before bed.

About Melatonin - it isn’t about the amount of dose. The recommended dose range is actually quiet low (0.5 to 5mg) but you should take it consistently. It isn’t something that knocks you out but works over time (you should see effects after a few days). 

Please don’t rely on alcoholic drinks for nutrients! Beer isn’t a good source of vitamins.

"You should try to figure out the root cause of this by looking inside yourself. Maybe you are an introvert - extrovert and sometimes, you don't really like being alone. Maybe after being around others which can be exciting, you feel let down when you get home because all those people are no longer around you, and the excitement is gone. Therefore, you feel sad or lonely, just a thought.

Do you keep busy and have things to do when you get home, like hobbies? 

Do you have good coping skills that you could use when you get home, such as: taking a nature walk, exercise, journaling your thoughts, meditation, positive shows to watch or positive podcasts to listen to? 

Have you ever thought about seeking help for this problem with a therapist or life coach, or just talking to a trusted friend or family member about this? Talking to others about this may help you understand why you feel like crying when you get home.

"Throwaway account because I'm embarrassed about this.

I just really desperately want someone to hurt me. Not in a sexual way. Emotionally or physically, it really doesn't matter. I just really wish someone would hurt me. 

It doesn't feel the same when I self harm. But whenever I feel any kind of mental anguish from what someone has done to me it just feels so real and I feel like I'm actually alive instead of just existing.

The only trauma I can think of is when I self harmed once and showed my parents when I was younger. They were so angry at me and said it was a stupid thing to do. When it came to my emotional problems and mental health, they always seemed kind of dismissive and left me to sort it out by myself, blaming me for my eating disorder behaviours and for other things I couldn't help.

I don't mean to make light of actual abuse. I fully understand what a horrible experience that is as much as someone who's never experienced it could. I'm not romanticising it when I say I want that experience. That suffering. I just want it so much and I think about it nearly all the time. 

I don't know if it's the fact that I want something to justify my mental pain or what. I've often thought about manipulating someone close to me into hating me so much that they abuse me.

Please could anyone suggest a cause for this? Therapy isn't really an option even though I know I definitely need it.

I found LiveHealth through my insurances website (I have Anthem) so that I knew it’d be low cost, I only had a $10 copay for my session with the psychiatrist and it only took about 20 minutes. She was very professional and understanding and prescribed me anxiety medication by the end of the session. I had been looking at the bad reviews and was sketched out as well but it was worth taking the chance! Everyone has different experiences! As for Cerebral I think that it tends to be overpriced but I have heard good and bad things about it. Honestly I would check your insurance companies website as well and see if there’s anything they promote for online therapy. Good luck:)	Clove_and_Nutmeg	reply	na	na	na	0.9986978769302368	weak	strong	no	na	MentalHealthSupport	failed
I have been struggling with my mental health lately, which I have felt extremenly anxious to go into work; to the point where I would much prefer to use my sick time. I have worked there from for almost 6-7  years, and I am tired. Not sleepy tired, but mentally exhausted tired. I need to know what to do, please anyone give me advice.

"I messaged someone yesterday to ask her if she wanted a toy my parents are giving away and I immediately felt guilt. I remembered what I was told by this ex-friend when any time I'd ask her a question like if she wanted something. ""Why no hello first? Aren't you gonna at least ask me how I'm doing first? I can tell you aren't used to having friends lol"" stuff like that. Before I knew this ex-friend I already felt like I was horrible at being friends with people. I feel this person constantly made me feel like I wasn't a very good friend even though I did my best to change the way I communicated with her to the way she wanted me to communicate with her. 

I can't help but feel like an awful friend, I feel similar to when I broke up with an abusive ex. I think I need time to build myself back up and try to reach out and make friends but I am afraid of meeting another person like her that will just make me feel bad about myself."

"No, that sounds like this ex-friend of yours is a horrible toxic person.
From your story you seem like a friendly person just trying to help someone out.

I myself usually never ask my friends how they're doing, until after I've got the 'business' part out of the way.
They have never reprimanded me about this, as they tend to do the same.
Do not fault yourself for this.

From what I know or have experienced myself, most people aren't to bothered by the 'straight to the issue'  approach.
It's only self righteous people who tend to be blind about their own faults that reprimand people for things that don't fit their perfect little world.

Please do not belittle yourself for someone else's twisted perspective of how they want the world to work."	WhispersOfDisease	reply	na	na	na	0.9992374181747437	no	strong	no	na	MentalHealthSupport	failed
Hindi ko alam paano nag work itong site na ito, 2 in the morning and I am not feeling good. I just finished watching Mr. Hiiragi's Homeroom, how I wish this world has a lot of teacher like him. Once in my life I want to experience to have someone like him. Memories from what happened in the past is still hunting me. The suffering won't end,  and my mental health is deteriorating my body.  How I wish I have someone to help me because honestly I can't help myself anymore. I really want someone to help me but I don't want to be a burden haha.
