"We've been seeing a worrying increase in pro-suicide content showing up here and, and also going unreported. This undermines our purpose here, so we wanted to highlight and clarify our guidelines about both direct and indirect incitement of suicide.  

We've created a wiki that covers these issues.  We hope this will be helpful to anyone who's wondering whether something's okay here and which responses to report.  It explains in detail why *any* validation of suicidal intent, even an ""innocent"" message like ""if you're 100% committed, I'll just wish you peace"" is likely to increase people's pain, and why it's important to report even subtle pro-suicide comments. The full text of the wiki's current version is below, and it is maintained at [/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/incitement](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/incitement). 

We deeply appreciate everyone who gives responsive, empathetic, non-judgemental support to our OPs, and we particularly thank everyone who's already been reporting incitement in all forms.  

Please report any post or comment that encourages suicide (or that breaks any of the other guidelines in the sidebar) to the moderators, either by clicking the ""report"" button or by [sending us a modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FSuicideWatch) with a link. We deal with all guideline violations that are reported to us as soon as we can, but we can't read everything so community reports are essential. If you get a PM that breaks the guidelines, please report it both [to the reddit sitewide admins](http://www.reddit.com/report) and to us in modmail. 

Thanks to all the great citizens of the community who help flag problem content and behaviour for us.

###Summary###

**It's important to respect and understand people's experiences and emotions. It's never necessary, helpful, or kind to support suicidal intent. There are some common misconceptions (discussed below) about suicidal people and how to help them that can cause well-meaning people to inadvertently incite suicide. There are also people online who incite suicide on purpose, often while pretending to be sympathetic and helpful.** 

###Validate Feelings and Experiences, Not Self-Destructive Intentions###

We're here to offer support, not judgement.  That means accepting, with the best understanding we can offer, whatever emotions people express.  Suicidal people are suffering, and we're here to try to ease that by providing support and caring.  The most reliable way we know to de-escalate someone at risk is to give them the experience of feeling understood. That means not judging whether they should be feeling the way they are, or telling them what to do or not do.  

But there's an important line to draw here.  There's a crucial difference between empathizing with feelings and responding non-judgmentally to suicidal thoughts, and in any way endorsing, encouraging, or validating suicidal intentions or hopeless beliefs. **It's both possible and important to convey understanding and compassion for someone's suicidal thoughts without putting your finger on the scale of their decision.**

Anything that condones suicide, even passively, *encourages* suicide. It isn't supportive and does not help. It also violates reddit's sitewide rules as well as our guidelines. Explicitly inciting suicide online is a criminal offense in most jurisdictions. 

Do not treat any OP's post as meaning that will definitely die by suicide and can't change their minds or be helped. Anyone who's able to read the comments here still has a chance to choose whether or not to try to keep living, even if they've also been experiencing intense thoughts of suicide, made a suicide plan, or started carrying it out.  

In [the most useful empirical model we have](https://www.apa.org/science/about/psa/2009/06/sci-brief), the desire to die by suicide primarily comes from two interpersonal factors; alienation and a sense of being a burden or having nothing to offer. These factors usually lead to a profound feeling of being unwelcome in the world. 

**So, any acceptance or reinforcement of suicidal intent, even something ""innocent"" like ""I hope you find peace"", is actually a form of covert shunning that validates a person's sense that they're unwelcome in the world. It will usually add to their pain even if kindly meant and gently worded.**  

###How to Avoid Validating Suicidal Intent###

Keep the following in mind when offering support to anyone at risk for suicide.  

* **People who say they don't want help usually can feel better if they get support that doesn't invalidate their emotions.** Unfortunately, [many popular ""good"" responses are actually counterproductive](https://www.speakingofsuicide.com/2015/03/03/what-not-to-say/). In particular, many friends and family tend to rely exclusively on trying to convince the suicidal person that ""it's not so bad"", and this is usually experienced as ""I don't understand what you're going through and I'm not going to try"".  People who've had ""help"" that made them feel worse don't want any more of the same.  It doesn't mean that someone who actually knows how to be supportive can't give them any comfort.   

*  **Most people who are suicidal want to end their** ***pain,*** **not their lives.**  It's almost never true that death is the only way to end these people's suffering. Of course there are exceptional situations, and we certainly acknowledge that, for some people, the right help can be difficult to find. But preventing someone's suicide doesn't mean prolonging their suffering if we do it by giving them real comfort and understanding. 

* ***An unfixable problem doesn't mean that a good life will never be possible***.  We don't have to fix or change anything to help someone feel better. It's important to keep in mind that the correlation between our outer circumstances and our inner experience is weaker and less direct than commonly assumed.  For every kind of difficult life situation, you will find some people who lapse into suicidal despair, and others who cope amazingly well, and a whole spectrum in between. A key difference is how much inner resilience the person has at the time. This can depend on many personal and situational factors. But when there's not enough, interpersonal support can both compensate for its absence and help rebuild it.  We go into more depth on the ""it gets better"" issue in [this PSA Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/25igd7/whats_wrong_with_it_gets_better_what_if_it_doesnt/) which is always linked from our sidebar (community info on mobile) guidelines. 

* **There are** ***always*** **more choices than brutally forcing someone to stay alive or passively letting them end their lives**.

To avoid accidentally breaking the anti-incitement rule, don't say or try to imply that acting on suicidal thoughts is a good idea, or that someone can't turn back or is already dead.  Do whatever you can to help them feel cared for and welcome, at least in this little corner of the world.  [Our talking tips](http://redd.it/igh87) offer more detailed guidance.

###Look Out for Deliberate Incitement.  It May Come in Disguise.###

Often comments that subtly encourage suicidal intent actually come from suicide fetishists and voyeurs ([unfortunately this is a real and disturbing phenomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Francis_Melchert-Dinkel)). People like this *are* out there and the anonymous nature of reddit makes us particularly attractive to them.  

They will typically try to scratch their psychological ""itch"" by saying things that push people closer to the edge.  They often do this by exploiting the myths that we debunked in the bullet points above.  Specifically you might see people doing the following:

* Encouraging the false belief that the only way suicidal people can end their pain is by dying.  **There are** ***always*** **more and better choices than ""brutally forcing someone to stay alive"" or helping (actively or passively) them to end their lives**.

* Creating an artificial and toxic sense of ""solidarity"" by linking their encouragement of suicide to empathy.  They will represent themselves as the only one who really understand the suicidal person, while either directly or indirectly encouraging their self-loathing emotions and self-destructive impulses.  **Since most people in suicidal crisis are in desperate need to empathy and understanding, this is a particularly dangerous form of manipulation.**  

Many suicide inciters are adept at putting a benevolent spin on their activities while actually luring people away from sources of real help.  A couple of key points to keep in mind: 

* **Skilled suicide intervention -- peer or professional -- is based on empathic responsiveness to the person's feelings that reduces their suffering in the moment.**  Contrary to pop-culture myths, it does **not** involve persuasion (""Don't do it!""), cheerleading (""You've got this!"") or meaningless false promises (""Trust me, it gets better!""), or invalidation (""Let me show you how things aren't as bad as you think!"").  Anyone who leads others to expect these kinds of toxic responses, or any other response that prolongs their pain, from expert help may be covertly pro-suicide. (Of course, people sometimes do have bad experience when seeking mental-health treatment, and it's fine to vent about those, but processing our own disappointment and frustration is entirely different from trying to destroy someone else's hope of getting help.)

* **Choices made by competent responders are always informed by the understanding that breaching someone's trust is traumatic and must be avoided if possible.**  Any kind of involuntary intervention is an **extremely unlikely** outcome when someone consults a clinician or calls a hotline. (Confidentiality is addressed in more detail in [our Hotlines FAQ post](http://redd.it/1c7ntr)). The goal is always to provide all help with the client's full knowledge and informed consent. We know that no individual or system is perfect.  Mistakes that lead to bad experiences do sometimes happen to vulnerable people, and we have enormous sympathy for them. But anyone who suggests that this is the norm might be trying to scare people away from the help they need.

I don’t know why but I feel like a good way to help people is to be perfectly blunt and honest with them. No forms of sugaring it up with cliche and lazy phrases including “it gets better” or “please don’t do it” but I have my own way that I want to know if it’s appropriate. Something along the lines of a response i might do is below.

“I’m not going to tell you that I understand what you’re going through, or what your life is like. I can’t promise that your life will get better. But just remember, if you’re thinking about going through with killing yourself, just remember that you don’t get a second chance, no take backs or anything like that. Be sure to remember the things that you could lose by going through with it. Would suicide solve all of your problems or just create more? That’s up for you to decide.

I agree that ""lol do it"" or anything aggressively promoting suicide is problematic and shouldn't be encouraged.

Someone was offering their sincere hopes that whatever an OP did that they would find the solace they couldn't here, in the now. And bam! Banned for life.

It felt like someone actually understood what I was feeling. Whenever I confess to feeling like that, I usually get met with ""it gets better"" ""things could be much worse"" or something like those.

"I voted this down because most people don't know what suicide is and hiding the ""mechanics"" of suicide from those who might attempt it and presenting ""suicide"" as a ""moral failing"" on their part (instead of showing suicide for what it really is -- this society mean-spiritedly presenting the people it injures with false 'alternatives,' then blaming those people for taking them) has never -- and will never -- save a single person from taking their own life.  No one, not even the most desperate, really wants to be strangled to death or wants their death to create a ""such a big mess that it will take an army of sanitation workers to clean it up,"" yet that's precisely what taking sleeping pills and alcohol, hanging oneself, or shooting oneself involves (but where are those methods ever portrayed like that, instead of as ""instant death"" or ""drifting off to sleep,"" in popular depictions of suicide?) Our evil, mean-spirited, society even tells people (in popular depictions of suicide) that ""slitting their wrists"" is a ""viable option"" for ""killing themselves"" when, in fact, the average person (of this day and age) would probably faint (from the pain) before they cut deep enough reach -- let alone open -- an artery.  So no, it's not those who are saying ""Do you really want to strangle yourself for those assholes???"" or asking those who say they're going to ""shoot themselves in the head"" with a handgun ""What if you miss: do you really want to spend the rest of your life in a nursing home???"" who are ""accidentally encouraging suicide"" (let alone ""covertly inciting it."")"

"Huh. I think I've broken the rules. I agree with a lot of this and appreciate the research put into it but I think this misses the mark in a couple places. Why would someone come to a subreddit for suicidal people to talk about their suicide, and actively avoid the more squishy, positivity oriented spaces that exist?

1. To share their final thoughts with anyone they can.

2. To explore the ideations of other suicidals, likely because they're not entirely convinced yet and still debating it.

3. To empathize or find empathy with other people feeling the same way.

Not to be blatantly talked out of it. Strangers trying to fix your depression is annoying af. And the fact that people only passively want you to stay alive for their own personal peace of mind but don't actually give a shit about you beyond that is usually a factor in what has led them to this point to begin with.

Not only do I think there's nothing wrong with talking to someone about suicide while explicitly reassuring them that you're not interested in stopping them from doing it. I think that approaching someone who has made up their mind as though they're a fully functional adult who has likely put sufficient consideration into their decisions and doesn't owe you an explanation or opportunity to debate their reasoning can disarm the apprehension towards apathetic virtue signaling and allow said suicide risk's mind a bit of ease and relaxation that can be vital in one last critical analysis of their decisions... Which may well lead to a reconsideration. 

It's ok to just be there for another human being without trying to manipulate them into conforming to some societal standard.

"All those rules don't leave very much.  So, random thoughts then ...

I wonder if suicide encouragers / fetishists are just sadists or are they potentially suicidal or depressive themselves and are projecting those feelings onto others, i.e. vicarious suicide.  


Been off & on suicidal (autothanasic?) since my teens years myself.  I wonder if a suicidally oriented or depressive person can be a better communicator with a suicidal person than someone who does not have these feelings as strongly.  


I realize I'm conflating depression/suicidality here just as shorthand but I'm aware they are correlated but not identical.  A bipolar person in a hypomanic or manic episode is more likely to become suicidal than when the same person is in a depressive episode -- the extra energy boost of hypomania can be just enough to make ""muscle memory"" or kinesthetic habit take over.  There've been times when I am in a hypomanic state where I might punch a hole in the wall (which just means I have to fix it later) or smash an old ukulele or a dish or something inexpensive but which will make a satisfying destructive event, but I also have to remind myself to stay away from a knife or box cutter during these episodes because the kinesthetic urge can take over from the rational part of the brain (forebrain or whatever it is.)  


I've called ""crisis hotlines"" and ""warmlines"" a few times but I have not been satisfied with the results, just frustrated. Their responses sound canned and too practiced, like they all studied and memorized this wiki by heart (no offense.)

So, in a nutshell, what IS the right thing to say to someone who is suicidal? I've always said your life will get better just keep moving forward one step at a time. Apparently, that's a bad response if I'm reading this thread correctly. I don't want to accidentally push someone over the edge. I somewhat understand what people go through. It's as if there is an empty spot in your soul that you're trying to furfill but it never does. That's how I feel. (( I am not trying to make this post about me, I am explaining how I feel because when someone speaks of suicide I automatically think about what I'm going through and I tell them what may get them out of the pit.)) Overall, I'd like to learn the pychology and the verbal skills to stop people from commiting suicide actions or thoughts. It's nature to be drawn to negative energy rather than positive. Let's try to spread the positive energy and save as many people as we can. I love you all and I hope to get some good advice on how to make this world a better place, starting with the man in the mirror.

"I could sense desperation in your comment and want to offer you some help on this.

&#x200B;

Everyone's case is different but I can tell you from my perspective. I hope it is useful.

Just be a friend as normal as possible. Don't make a big deal out of them being suicidal each time you speak to them (that doesn't mean you don't care).

My dad calls me and the first thing he says is ""Hi I was just calling to see how you are""

This immediately makes the topic of conversation about my suicidal thoughts/depression. It also tells me that my state of mind is affecting his and making him worry. Neither of those two things help. I now only seem to talk about my condition with him. That's my fault too though, not just his. He's not a psychologist and is trying his best. I just miss normal chats about normal things.

&#x200B;

I miss my Dad calling me to ask me if I watched the boxing. I miss normality.

&#x200B;

Try to give them normality. Just ask if they want to go out for lunch or to see a show. Even staying in with them to watch crap on TV or  anything. The old personality is still in there somewhere.

The offer needs to be available to them but not pushed on them. Sometimes they'll say ""no thanks"" and choose to stay isolated but don't be offended by that or worry. They don't want to see anyone at the moment and it's nothing personal against you. Just let them know you'd like to do something and that the offer is there if they change their mind.

Just send them random funny text messages that you know will make them laugh. Call them and talk about stuff. Anything but depression and suicide.  Just try and seem like you're not even thinking about them being so depressed. Even though you are.

&#x200B;

If they often want to talk to you about how crap they feel. Then I can see how tedious that would get after a while.  I only talk to people about how I'm feeing when asked. I haven't just called my dad to tell him how crap I feel for a long time. I'd feel like I was ruining his day and I would be. Not telling him means I end up just feeling like crap on my own though, and I suppose that isn't good either. It is a bit of an emotional mine field.

Basically, they need your help but genuinely don't want to burden you and make you go to a bunch of effort just for them. That just adds something else to their misery list. So you have to help but in a way that seems natural and just normal.

&#x200B;

Tell them YOU need help with something. Gardening, decorating, anything. Make something up. That will probably help them so much actually. They'll have a purpose and be doing something that will make them know they are needed and helping someone they care about.

They need happiness. Try to create happy times. But don't be all ""Hey let's do fun stuff to stop you wanting to end yourself"".

*  The insensitivity of a response that shows a complete misunderstanding of their experience will likely escalate their sense of alienation.  That is one of the two most critical factors linked to suicidal intent.

*  Their inability to feel better after receiving this kind of ""help"" will likely increase their sense of failure and unworthiness, which is the other top critical factor linked to suicidal intent.

Well, sure, and I don't see anything in this post that's against that.

> It's ok to just be there for another human being without trying to manipulate them into conforming to some societal standard.

Of course.  And, again, where do you think we're saying anything otherwise?

You don't need to endorse suicidal intent to feel and demonstrate respect for people's ownership of their lives.  I've been part of the training team for a couple thousand suicide hotline responders and the ones who don't do the latter always wash out.  They get emotionally invested in the clients' outcomes and that's toxic AF.  The [PSA post linked from point 4d](http://redd.it/25igd7) in the guidelines (in the sidebar/community info) goes into the perils of outcome-based thinking from a slightly different angle.  

I think you'd probably agree with the training mantra that I use at the hotline:  ""90% of the time, the rapport *is* the solution"".   

Quite a few of our rules that apply to helpers are more strict than they need to be in all cases - but because this is a public support space, there are quite a few things that can work in some cases which are not allowed because we're found that they have an unacceptably high backfire rate. 

Another wrinkle is that we have no reason to think that the 90/10/1 rule doesn't work here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet, and so our responders aren't just speaking to our OPs, and we all need to keep that in mind.  

I do have one point where both we and the science may disagree with you.  You seem imply in a couple of places that there's a ""point of no return"" where someone can't be helped.

"> While I know how to correctly stop people from committing suicide due to personal experience with depression

There are at least three serious things wrong with the assumptions underlying this statement.

First of all, depression and suicidality are completely different things.  The relationship between depression and suicide is correlational, not causal.  Depression doesn't make people suicidal, but some of the same things that contribute to depression also contribute to suicidality.  And although there's a consistent positive correlation between depression and suicidal *thought*, the relationship between depression and suicidal *behaviour* is less clear.  Sometimes the correlation is found to be neutral or even negative.  For example, suicides peak in the spring in both hemispheres, coinciding with the lifting of seasonal depression.

Second, it's not wise to assume that similar lived experience helps us empathise with others.  Often the opposite is true - people end up projecting instead of empathising.

...but this is one of the many reasons why the correlation between depression and suicidal *behaviour* is less clear, and in some situations an inverse relationship is seen.  Another example, is that deaths by suicide peak in the spring in both hemispheres, coinciding with the lifting of seasonal depression.  

> I've called ""crisis hotlines"" and ""warmlines"" a few times but I have not been satisfied with the results, just frustrated. Their responses sound canned and too practiced, like they all studied and memorized this wiki by heart (no offense.) 

I'm all too well aware that the quality of service callers receive varies widely, and bad experiences seem to be particularly common with the US national hotline.  (One of so many reasons I'm happy I'm not American these days.).  The [AAS does have an accreditation process](https://suicidology.org/training-accreditation/crisis-center-accreditation/) which I hope will eventually help somewhat if it gets adopted widely enough, and once all the workers who are actually staffing the lines were trained after the standards are adopted.  But I don't think the standards go nearly far enough, nor do they address the issue of cognitive load on the responders, which I think is probably the largest single cause of responders appearing to be disengaged with callers.  The [IASP also has a helplines best practices special-interest group](https://www.iasp.info/helplines_best_practices.php) in which I participate, which I think will eventually lead to better standards, but I fear that global adoption might be like the metric system, where the Americans stick with their substandard system just because it's theirs.  

> I wonder if suicide encouragers / fetishists are just sadists or are they potentially suicidal or depressive themselves and are projecting those feelings onto others, i.e. vicarious suicide. 

I think that both those types of people exist, and in an anonymous text-only context, it can be really tricky to distinguish between them even though one group wants to hurt others and one wants their pain to be understood.  One reason why it's hard is that so many people who are struggling with suicidal despair also have such a low level of emotional literacy that they can't distinguish emotions from beliefs and intentions, so even when they're trying to express their feelings and get them validated, what they actually express is not in the language of feelings at all.  But if their emotional literacy were better, chances are their general mental health would be better as well.  ::sigh::

"You're right. These rules 99% seem rational and well researched and make sense. The issue that I was raising was in relation to the implications, and perhaps better described as a lack of specificity about- the implications of likelihood that someone ""condoning"" suicidal ideation may be secretly inciting suicide. The cited sources help to create a potential inflated perception of this type of behavior. I do appreciate your rational response, and would like to add that I in no way assume to have any greater level of insight on the matter than anyone else. My training is limited relative to specialized psychiatric and psychological expertise, and I can see that the experience involved here is substantial.

I didn't mean to suggest that there is a point of no return, I'm struggling to figure out which statement made that impression. I will venture a guess that it was the remark about an internet comment being blamed for being the deciding factor for someone to kill themselves. If that's the point in question, I'd suggest that I meant quite the opposite. That I don't believe that kind of negative reinforcement (unless prolonged and excessive while being sought after and encouraged by the victim) wields a significant power in the decision making process, but adversely a comment of the same weight can have a real effect in dissuasion. 

My argument was merely that condoning, understanding, and accepting someone's decision to kill themselves- acknowledging that they have thought it through to the fullest extent- can be the catalyst of meaningful assistance in reevaluating options and self-assessing mental state. And the worst outcome of it is at the very least providing some respect and dignity in a person's final moments.

Whereas this seems to suggest that any acknowledgement or approval of someone's decision equates to encouragement. But I may be misreading. If so, the lack of clarity there may be worth addressing. Suicide advocacy is not inherently driven by evil as often as empathy.

"> not to use the cliche “I understand your feelings” kinda response

It's useless to *say* ""I understand your feelings"", but it's *essential* to both do the cognitive work yourself to understand the person's emotions (this is possible even if you don't share experience, since although there's an infinite variety of experience, there are only a few basic emotions), and *prove to them*, rather than just saying it, that you do understand.  

> They’re smart enough to know my intention

It isn't a matter of intelligence.  Most suicidal people have been so beaten down, and let down, by the rest of humanity that they can't take goodwill for granted.

>  I think it would work for people who say the “goodbye” posts

I can't imagine why you'd think that.  No matter how people choose to express their suicidal feelings, i.e. directly or via the metaphor of their suicidal ideation,  they have the same basic needs for support.  The most reliable way we know to de-escalate people is to give them the experience of feeling understood.

">  the implications of likelihood that someone ""condoning"" suicidal ideation may be secretly inciting suicide. The cited sources help to create a potential inflated perception of this type of behavior. 

The suicide voyeurs and/or fetishists and whatever other labels might apply have had at least 15 subreddits that I personally know about banned by the admins that I know of.  Current the only one with significant traffic that's not banned is quarantined.  (I'm not going to name any of them.)  Some of our mods have infiltrated their communities and active suicide incitement and sabotage of our mission was definitely happening.  More subtle is the pro-suicide ""activism"" that co-opts language from other contexts to legitimise itself and normalises and encourages all sorts of toxic behaviours toward people at risk for suicide. 

It's much bigger issue than you might expect everywhere on the internet, but the anonymous, wide-open nature of reddit's design plus the (not entirely unjustified) reputation of reddit's management for being free speech extremists make it particularly bad here.  

These people's behaviour is blatantly criminal, but at the current state of our laws regarding online behaviour they're incredibly hard to stop. There are thousands of Melchert-Dinkels out there, but in his case there was a perfect storm of things going right from a detection and prosecution point of view.  

> My argument was merely that condoning, understanding, and accepting someone's decision to kill themselves- acknowledging that they have thought it through to the fullest extent- can be the catalyst of meaningful assistance in reevaluating options and self-assessing mental state.

I can support everything about that except the word ""condoning"".  It's one thing to respect someone's ownership of their life and their right to end it, and another thing to be content about it when someone is so miserable that it comes down to that.  It's always tragic when someone is brought the point of suicide - whether or not they follow through.  I don't think it's helpful or even excusable to be complacent about these situations.  But we need to deplore the circumstances and support the person.  

> Whereas this seems to suggest that any acknowledgement or approval of someone's decision equates to encouragement.

How could approval *not* be encouragement?  There's a vital (literally) difference between approval and acceptance, imnsho.  

> Suicide advocacy is not inherently driven by evil as often as empathy.

I don't think that's true in every context. Personally, I wouldn't even call myself anti-suicide.  I'm anti-suffering.  I marched in protests for a woman with ALS who was fighting for the right to die.  And as much as I am the first author of the anti-incitement wiki, I go even harder after the ""helpers"" who invalidate our OPs' feelings and experiences.

"> I guess I forgot to say that I have helped multiple people from doing that (not on Reddit)

Much of the time, when people without relevant, specialised training intervene in ways that lead to good outcomes in the short term, they can leave people worse off in the long term due to things like encouraging outcome-based thinking (see point 4d in our guidelines).

Of course I can't know that that's the case with you, but there are many excellent reasons why we post so much material for our helpers to read.  A lot things that are commonly believed to be good things to say are actually terrible (see the top ten list of those linked from our talking tips post).   And a lot of things that can work some of the time have a high backfire rate.  

Even among people with years of training and experience, we never assume that we know what we're doing.  At my agency, even the most experience responders aren't allowed to ""solo"" on high-risk calls.

I think that's only a risk if the guidelines are made in ignorance of what works on crisis lines.

Even though our responders have a framework (but definitely *not* a script) for their calls and have a few key protocols to follow, they need to be a genuine person connecting on a human level with the people they're helping.  

>  I don't know if ""cognitive load"" or burnout was a factor at the time I resorted to a helpline, and I don't want my criticism to seem harsher than it was. 

I think that a disengaged responder is one of the most legitimately serious criticisms you can make, so I don't think it's at all harsh to observe that that was your experience.  

> Maybe it's just that some people are naturally more empathetic than others,

Then they should have been screened out and not admitted into the training process

>  others may mean well and want to help but the gears don't always click smoothly

Then they either weren't properly trained, or they weren't self-aware enough to know that they needed a break (something else we explicitly teach).  

There's actually a lot of empirical information about how to give someone the experience of being truly heard and understood, and how to convey the empathy that we feel effectively.

"You may be correct. You're obviously more educated on the specific situation than I am. From a statistics standpoint it seems unlikely that regardless of how many subreddits may have been started (likely by the same people) there is a larger number of people that are *not* part of that community. I don't doubt that they're active, just that they're they're the majority.

As far as condoning and supporting the right to suicide, we'll seemingly just have to agree that we disagree... Because I've lost track of the argument there. I think there are plenty of good reasons to kill oneself. I think I have a pretty solid case myself. I still acknowledge that most cases are not good reasons to do it... But if a stranger is telling me they've come to that decision it would be offensive for me to assume they're in the wrong. I don't see another respectful way to approach it than to assume they're right from the get go and hope that they'll share with me what their reasoning is. It just seems offensive to enter a conversation with someone who just wants to share what's going on, with the intent to ""educate"" them or change their mind. I think we generally agree on the sentiment here and just maybe disagree on the application, which is fine.

It's not my subreddit and I'm not trying to be defiant or change the rules or anything.

The major point of all this was just that as someone who is going to commit suicide, I'm absolutely not interested at all in hearing about why I shouldn't from someone who knows nothing about me. But I'm happy to talk to someone who's not on some morality mission and is just interested in having a chat about it all.

I don't want anyone to kill themselves. I don't want anyone to die. I don't want anyone to suffer. But I'm not in charge, and don't know everything. All I know is if I can provide a listening ear without the subtext of hidden motivation, well that's likely the best I can do for someone.

"> From a statistics standpoint it seems unlikely that regardless of how many subreddits may have been started (likely by the same people) there is a larger number of people that are not part of that community. I don't doubt that they're active, just that they're they're the majority.

Agree, the problem is that there are some people who feel righteously entitled to enjoy inciting suicide who are *extremely* active.

> As far as condoning and supporting the right to suicide, we'll seemingly just have to agree that we disagree... Because I've lost track of the argument there.

In my experience, that's usually an indicator that the differences are largely only semantic, which I've come to suspect as well.  

>  It just seems offensive to enter a conversation with someone who just wants to share what's going on, with the intent to ""educate"" them or change their mind.

Both those tactics, besides being morally reprehensible imo, are spectacularly ineffective in either easing suffering or reducing risk of suicide, so if someone's using they, they're the ones who need to be educated.  And we do our best with that, but sometimes it feels like an endless game of whack-a-mole.  There are a lot of pernicious misconceptions about suicide that just won't die. 

> The major point of all this was just that as someone who is going to commit suicide, I'm absolutely not interested at all in hearing about why I shouldn't from someone who knows nothing about me. But I'm happy to talk to someone who's not on some morality mission and is just interested in having a chat about it all.

I think you have an absolute right not to be lectured to or argued with.  And I have a responsibility to offer whatever comfort I can.  But don't you dare tell me that I don't have a right to be sad about the world losing someone as smart and insightful as you.  I think the ethical line to draw, though, is that it would be unfair for me to make my sadness your problem - and that's what far too many misguided ""helpers"" do.   My default starting hypothesis is that someone has become suicidal because the rest of humanity has comprehensively failed them.  Anyone who's interested in helping needs to in some way make up for that, not ask the person to do anything or suffer any more.  (Of course there are practical complexities, especially in the case of involuntary interventions, which I think are usually -- but not always -- a terrible idea.)  

I have especially intense hate for the mindset behind books like *Stay*, which was all the rage a few years ago.   Its operating assumption is that suicidal people have a responsibility to do a lot of difficult cognitive work to avoid ""damaging humanity"" by their deaths.  People who propagate that nonsense deserve to roast in the Hell in which I do not believe.  The real hell of it is that the suicide fetishists present themselves as a benevolent alternative."

"I really like the way you put that. ""Making my sadness your problem."" 

I do honestly believe that a lot of people contemplating suicide are coming from a selfish place of *wanting* to inflict sadness. A vengeful suicide with the intention of making people feel bad about the way they treated them. But alternatively I think many people struggle with wanting to die for their own benefit but not wanting to hurt anyone in the process.

I'm very lucky to have shouldered the burden of being the one who experienced all the loss and finally being in a place where there's no one left to mourne my passing. Which to say, gets an instinctual reaction that is inaccurate. It's a very positive thing. I'm also fortunate to have had the time and collect the resources to be able to handle it in such a way that shouldn't so much as inconvenience anyone. Just disappear and never even have found remains for anyone to clean up. All goodbyes said. No mysteries or confusion. 

But that's incredibly difficult for most people to orchestrate and can be saddening. So that frustration with being bound by responsibility to not hurt people who likely contribute to your pain (whether intentional or not) can be overwhelming enough on a personal scale. Strangers piling on with guilt trips is just impossible to process.

Anyways I'm getting off topic here.

I appreciate being entertained in my confusion with the wording here and I think I have a better understanding now so thank you. I don't comment on many posts anyways but apologies in advance if I do in the future in a way that comes of to some as ""cold"" or even ""encouraging"".

I'd advise taking a break if its possible. It may not be depending on the circumstances of the suicidal person in your life.

Sure, but that doesn't mean that humanity didn't fail them.  A perceived need for revenge is usually an actual need for our pain to be recognised and understood.  

> So that frustration with being bound by responsibility to not hurt people who likely contribute to your pain (whether intentional or not) can be overwhelming enough on a personal scale. Strangers piling on with guilt trips is just impossible to process.

Yeah, that's what so stupid about the ""think of your loved ones"" brigade.  When other people have been nothing (or hardly anything) but a source of pain, it's cruel and counterproductive to be asked to  suffer more for their sake.

"Activism, i.e. advocating or fundraising for social change or raising awareness of social issues (and suicide is, inescapably, a social issue) is absolutely against the rules here at all times. 

Please understand that we're all for smart, strategic mental-health and suicide-prevention activism. It's essential to fight against stigma, misinformation, and discrimination, and to fight for research, treatment, accommodation, acceptance, and understanding. Most of us, one way or another, are mental-health activists IRL. 

But activism just doesn't work in a dedicated support space that serves a vulnerable population. We used to allow it but the evidence that it was undermining our primary purpose became overwhelming.  We do regret the need for this rule, but the need is inescapable. 

Our population is all too well aware of the issues and causes that need support and largely not in a position to take action, so besides the fact that activism is often salt in our community's wounds, it's a waste of the activists' time.

**tl;dr** Any fundraising, awareness raising, petitions, calls for participation, or any post that's about any cause or issue (rather than a request for personal support) is not allowed here.

"last month, i slit my arm to the bone

i wasnt done with life at that moment, but now i really feel like im getting closer to the edge.

 ive had a bad habit of teasing cutting my wrists just to feel a fraction of what it could be but for some reason i believe i made a choice that saved my life ,i cut my upper arm instead.

i thought it would just be the usual, like leaving a permanent but small line on it 
but when i looked at it it was like a gaping mouth
i saw the small beads of fat, my veins and then my bone

i cant quite recall what really happened that night but i was transported to the hospital in an emergency(there was an hemorrhage) and they stitched me up.

part of my arm is now paralyzed. i cant continue like that and i feel so intensely stupid because i know am young, i know that i am not even old enough to know the ""real stuff"" but if its so hard now that im 16 what will it be like when ill have real adult problems? if i choose life i will have to live my whole life like that. without my full liberty, knowing i was the one who brought this to myself.

all of that situation made me realize that i dont value life as much as i want to. i dont find pleasure in anything, i am a drag for everyone around me and i feel that my presence is not desired, even with my family.
i am done with surviving, life is supposed to be enjoyed, life is supposed to be lived.

the thing is that i dont know how i could end it all. i cant stand the idea of slicing my wrists after what happened last time.
i dont know what to do."	Ready_Peak_8664	post	18.509155097835535	female	White	0.994884192943573	na	na	na	4	SuicideWatch	failed
you're only 16? physical therapy and medication can do a lot to regain mobement and feeling in your arm. youre also really young. the brain and central nervous system are more resilient than you may think or it may feel right now. just because you arent an adult doesnt mean your problems arent real. adults have way more.ways to escape life pain than teenagers. also i wamt to stress this. i am sure youve heard this before but teenage hormones are wiggity whack. havr you ever heard of pregnant mood swings? or post partum depression? thats basically what is happening to your teenage brain right now. everything feels hyperintense. your emotions and reactions are very vivid. not saying adults dont get depressed because they obviously do, but it feels way different than the chaos of a teenage mind trying to sort itself out. youre worried about adult problems but youre not even half way through your teenage years. there is plenty of time to turn things around. please dont beat yourself up over your injury. when it heals, get yourself a watch and wear it over the scar. every second that watch ticks on a live you, youre winning. much love💕💕💕	Ready_Peak_8664	reply	na	na	na	0.994884192943573	weak	no	no	na	SuicideWatch	no prediction.

"I'm going to just go ahead and scream into the void here. 

I think I'm an abusive person. I don't want to be a fucking piece of shit human being anymore and Im trying to be better but it seems like it's 1 step forward 3 steps back. I hurt the ones I love and I've done some seriously fucked up shit in my life. Sometimes I think I should have a bullet put between my eyes for the things I've done and the harm I've caused. I want to be better. I want so bad to be better. I don't understand how I am trying to be a better person yet still do morally wrong things and hurt people. 

I don't understand myself. I don't know why I can't just fucking decide to be better and stop making mistakes and hurting people. It's hard to feel like I have any worth or value. The only thing keeping me going is that if I kill myself all that will be left is the hurt I caused. So I wake up every day trying to do the right thing and trying to be better but I literally always fuck it up. I don't have a choice though. It's do or die. I either get better or I should kill myself. 

I've been going to therapy to try to be a better person. 

I'm surrounded by people who love me and give my chances. One of the people who I was the most abusive with in the past has recently given me a second chance and my therapist has told me I'm in shock because of it. And I think I am. I did terrible things to this person. They have a husband and true loving friends now. Why the fuck would they ever want to rekindle things with me? I am forever grateful that they do and this time i am trying to do right by them and be a light in their life and a true friend. 

When I was a kid I tortured my neighbor's dog. I should be killed for what I did. And the worst part is I loved this dog....why the fuck would I do that to something I love? And I did it for no reason too. It haunts me to this day. I still lose sleep over it. Later in my life I  was seeing someone and they made it a point that they were an animal rights activist and they were very adamant about how they felt about animal abuse. I remember feeling like such a fucking fraud. So I came clean and told them what I did to this dog when I was a kid. They told me they don't understand why I did what I did but that they truly believed I was a good person with a pure heart. They still loved me at the time despite it. I wanted to fucking cry. Felt like I didn't deserve it. Maybe that's one of the bravest things I ever did...came clean about it . I still have a hard time forgiving myself for what I did.

The worst part is that dog still loved me too. Even after what I did. And sometimes I fear that's what my partner is like. Like what if in abusing my partner and they just don't realize it and still love me and are still with me. The way that dog still loved me.

I think something seriously fucked up happened to me as a kid. I've been thinking that for a while. Normal kids don't torture animals that's one of the telltale signs of serial killers in the making.

I kind of want to kill myself. I kind of want to still fight to be a better person. I don't know anymore.

I'm fucking trying so hard. I'm trying to be a good partner. Im trying to be a good friend. A good person. But I don't know how to live with myself. With the things I've done and with the things I keep doing. 

I am looking for hope. Please anyone who reads this. If you were a shitty person tell me your story. How did you get better. How did you learn to love yourself despite your ways. How did you forgive yourself? How did you find yourself worthy enough to keep trying and keep living. How the fuck do I do this. Every moment in my body is fucking agony I fucking hate myself. I hate the things I've done. I hate the things I may do. It's a sad bargain . It's human nature to hurt each other. And that hurts me too."

"Okay, first off I do NOT think it’s good to believe you are possessed or not in control of your actions due to a spirit. It’s not true, just no. I don’t think believing this is healthy in any way. And I’m nearly positive your therapist would agree. 

However religious practices/worship have  helped many people. Praying the way the others on here have advised may help ( never heard of praying harming anyone)

That being said please listen to me when I say you ABSOLUTELY deserve another chance at a better you. In my experience if you want it bad enough and work hard enough at it you stand a chance of accomplishing it. 

My bf used to beat me, financially imprison me, emotionally neglect me, isolate me, gaslight me, break only my things, make me feel worthless and I was constantly scared of him. I tried so so hard to please him but I realized that he would conjure a reason to lash out at me no matter how perfect I tried to be. I thought I had caused it, that it was my fault. He has since made sure I know it was never my fault. He stopped beating me in 2016, after a a bit over a year of us being together. 

He  stopped “hulking out” and breaking things ( the walls are so fucked in this house) in 2021, and he now doesn’t do ANY of the above.

"hey, i’ve don’t terrible things in my past. i’ve treated my brother and my ex partner very badly in the past. it’s terrible, and the guilt does get to me sometimes. 

the fact that you’re holding yourself accountable, and trying to be better, means a lot. it doesn’t excuse everything, and it’s clear you have a long way to go. but this accountability is a step in the right direction. so give yourself that credit, at the very least.

i know how easy it is to continue to beat yourself up. but you have to understand, that will not make you a better person. you cannot shame yourself into being better, you just have to be better. and it’s clear you are trying! so give yourself credit for that as well. a lot of people go their entire lives being awful, and not trying to change. 

as for the dog thing, that was pretty bad. but you were a child. children do awful things, because they’re not developed yet. but most children don’t do things like that, unless they’ve been traumatized or taught to be violent.  and the fact that you abhor this now means that you’ve changed. you’re not a hypocrite for trying to be better.

what i’m trying to say is that based on your post, you’re making steps towards progress, and that automatically makes you at least a little bit better. keep trying op. never stop trying. being a better person is gonna take time,and i hope you’ll still be here to see it. there’s still good in you."

"I've done terrible, stupid shit, like you would not believe. Like you it seems like the worst of it was in your childhood. I've had similar experiences of seeming lapses in morality as a kid, and though it wasn't exactly what you've been through, I have memories of my own that can sometimes reenter my head and bring my world to a screeching halt. Besides the anecdote on that dog, I do not know what you've done to other human beings to really say more on that, but you certainly do not have to tell.

You said you have a hard time forgiving yourself, but perhaps you are under the impression that forgiving one's self is supposed to feel like self-absolvement of some sort, when it's more akin to you accepting the truth, recognizing that you've changed and that your actions no longer cause anyone harm, emotional or physical. What you did sounds bad, yes, but I don't think you have to be told that from the looks of it. It seems to me you *want* to get better. Nobody is forcing this guilt into your conscience, and a truly terrible, remorseless person would not feel that way. They would excuse or deflect until time ground us to dust, you do not. I believe guilt is the means by which we improve, and you have felt much guilt. You even admit what you've done to the face of perhaps the greatest critic there can be for such an act, and that takes serious bravery.

To be honest, I can't answer that in a way that works for you, nor can I probably even properly describe what I myself do, but to try might be this: I try not to define myself by my mistakes and try not to keep it like a score that I must make even, because it is an emotional sensation and there's no reason to tell myself that there's set suffering to be paid in penance before I can allow myself to feel good again, because I have a tendency to overestimate harm done and spend far too long self-hating, due to the subjectivity of it all.

"Sup. So it’s going to be a long post so bear with me.

I've struggled with suicide since I was a teen, I've always been good at keeping it under control though because failed attempts are costly and damaging. Back in 2019 I checked myself in because I was following through with a plan to end my life. The hospital was semi helpful but really the vibe I got was ""it’s all in your head"". I did pick up some helpful things and was able to turn my life around.

Now this year has been a nightmare for me, I was evicted from my previous apartment because they wanted to renovate it and charge more, I thought I was absolutely screwed because I have terrible credit and every place does a credit check. But I got super lucky and got in my current place that rocks even though it’s pricy. It’s okay because I was working a union job and making decent money, around $60k/yr. This job kinda sucks but the pay was too good, and I worked nearly every type of other job in this town, and no one comes close to this kind of money.

Well, I took a hefty hit to the savings account getting set up in the new place but it was alright, literally turned my mental state around completely. I was even telling people I cured my depression. I'm around 165 lbs, eating healthy, was exercising, had a friends group that I would chat with every day in discord. And I have 3 cats who are super cute and cuddly. I started taking Delta 8 gummies as well because all my friends are stoners and so I tried it. Completely changed my outlook on life, gave me motivation to cook and clean everyday. Literally no negative side effects. And I was living miserable and sober since 2019, even quit drinking heavily (only social). Well that all went to shit practically overnight.

So in my friends group I was chatting with a couple girls who I've known for a few years and we became really close friends. One of them would actually annoy me to come talk to her every day. Well, my dumbass started to catch feelings for her because how could I not. She wouldn't leave me alone, was my type, we played video games together and we had similar interest. It got to the point where I bought tickets to a music festival (EDC) in Florida and it was going to be this big event. She was super into dubstep and I could feel it when I was high so why the hell not. Only been to one concert in my life and I had the money.

Just a few days after planning this trip this girl was super excited for (honestly too excited, kinda was annoying because it’s all the way in November) she suddenly stops showing interest in me. Okay whatever I can do my own thing just fine anyway. Couple days go by with practically no interaction with her. I still would chat with the other girl who was super cool, and she even visited me and my best friend for a week in the past. Come to find out that the girl who I was crushing on is hanging out in my best friend's discord. He told me at work because we also work together. Okay, wtf.

I still keep it cool because I have her ticket so I didn't think anything of it really. My buddy (let’s call him Bob) got to working on the same shift as me at work. Bob has been super stressed at work because he got in this position that frankly abused him for less pay than what he could make working on the floor. Since I'm his bro I was being super supportive, offering him rides to work because he doesn't have a car at the moment and he would bike to work. His partner would even ask me to come over to try and mediate their relationship when Bob had a breakdown. I did it once but took a 'not really my problem' attitude towards that situation. Well one night me, Bob, and the girl I was into (let’s call her Sally) stayed up late playing video games and Bob invited me to go get milkshakes at noon the next day. I'm a little flaky about it because we stayed up until 3am and I like to sleep in, but I agree. So naturally when I get the text from him I tell him I'm still in bed and think nothing of it.

Well apparently, this milkshake meeting was really important to Bob because he completely ruined everything. Sally now is not talking to me at all and I can see she’s playing all the games her and I used to play with my buddy Bob. It kinda fucks me up a bit but I keep it together. Next thing I know Sally is private calling me telling me that Bob is wing manning for me and I'm the one everyone wants to fuck (this conversation was fucking weird to me because it sounded like a load of bullshit) okay whatever. And the other girl I'm still hanging out with is telling me that isn't what is happening. I spent the next few days being pathetic begging them to stop talking to each other and saying ""it could be anyone else why my best friend"" and just being a dumbass trying to fix it all.

At work the next day and talking to Bob on my break. This dude tells me how him and Sally are over there having BDSM role play and he's offering to buy a ticket to go down to her state to fuck her. I'm still a good friend and I tell him to be careful with this girl because she has a reputation as a homewrecker and I just try and keep it cool and tell him that he's lucky because she's a fun person to be around. Well naturally this devastated me. My social life practically dissolved overnight. I called Sally out on her bullshit when she tried to privately call me again acting like nothing was going on. I got her to apologize to me about it all and she stopped, and I ended my relationship with her.

And so, I try to get my friend Bob to talk to me because I didn't want to lose him too. He was my bro and we've been through so much. But he kept ignoring me and everyone just kinda stopped talking to me.

I spiraled out of control and was planning to shoot myself with my gun that I purchased a few months ago. I was going a couple days without eating or drinking, and before this breakdown I was just drinking one smoothie a day, so I wasn't well fed before this. I was trying to get really in shape. I go a couple days without the will to eat or drink, just crying and staring at the wall. I called out of work, and it got so bad I was seriously about to end it. I've already practiced holding the loaded gun to my head and I even figured out the best place to shoot myself to ensure a lethal shot (where my skull meets the spine, angled up a bit). But instead of shooting myself I decided to get rid of my gun and have a final chat with my buddy Bob. I go to his apt and I hold him up at gunpoint and at the end I hand him the gun and ask him to shoot me with it. He doesn't so I leave. Naturally he calls the cops and I get arrested. I'm so fucked up the magistrate tells my sister I need to get help because I fashioned a shank out of my glasses and tried to give myself a lobotomy. I got bailed out and they commit me to the hospital.

I'm in the hospital for a month. They had to keep me in the medical side because my liver enzymes were off. They said it matched alcoholic pattern which is total bullshit because I wasn't drinking heavily at all. Think it was from the healthy smoothies I was drinking because I put too much turmeric in them. The hospital basically painted me as a drunk who was high off my ass which was total nonsense. I still need to see the medical records because they took blood work so that should prove my case. I went about 5 days total not eating anything and barely drinking. I gave up on life. And after they got my liver flushed, they sent me to the behavioral hospital which is a total joke now. Seriously the program has changed so much since 2019. They basically tell us we're like this because we are sinners and need God. It was awful and didn't help at all. I just manipulate the program so I can get tf out of there as soon as possible.

I tried doing their outpatient program, but that shit is for people on heavy drugs and I feel like that one scene from the movie Half Baked [https://youtu.be/RN30u0zTP8o](https://youtu.be/RN30u0zTP8o)

None of the doctors I talk to seem to understand where I'm coming from. I've talked to 6 or so different doctors and only one instantly saw something I agreed with. The first doctor I talked to in the mental hospital thought I was autistic, but I never talked to him again and the other ones ruled it out even though our meetings only lasted for a couple minutes and they never asked anything other than how I feel.

Got a lawyer to postpone my court date to next year. I'm on hiatus from work and I'm not a dumbass and I know it’s not likely for me to keep that job. All the jobs in town are pathetic. Honestly, I'm just going to try and get a shotgun from a private seller and liquify my brain with a slug. The meds they put me on did nothing but make me drowsy and lose my libito. Should've just shot myself while I still had my gun. Fuck this life man.

"I'm so sorry to hear that you're feeling so down. It sounds like you're going through a really tough time right now.
  

  
I know it's hard to see it now, but you are not a failure. You finished law school, which is a huge accomplishment. And even though you don't have a job right now, that doesn't mean you never will. The job market is tough, but you are a talented and intelligent person, and I know you will find something eventually.
  

  
It's also understandable that you're feeling overwhelmed and hopeless right now. It sounds like you're dealing with a lot of stress and trauma, and that's taking a toll on your mental health. Please don't be ashamed of taking antidepressants. They can help you to manage your symptoms and get your life back on track.
  

  
I know it's hard to believe right now, but things will get better. You are not alone, and there are people who care about you and want to help. Please reach out to a friend, family member, or therapist. You don't have to go through this alone.  


You can call or text 988 to talk with someone as well as look on their website for a bit to keep your mind off things. Maybe you'll find something that really clicks and helps get through things.

"I have had trust issues for my whole life since  I got abused by my 1st bf, cheated on by all the others (one of the relationships lasted 9 years, only to throw me away randomly (no proper reason was given)). 
Now I am in a relationship with my current boyfriend. He knows all of this happened to me and I felt like we share a very special bond. Because I am sensitive he took it into consideration, saying he would never do anything behind my back. He said he hates everyone else but me and only cares about what i think. Yesterday after a huge discussion about it i finally got to see his phone where one of his colleagues sent him pics of some random womans ass and my bf seems to not have had the guts to tell the guy that he has a gf and doesnt wanna see stuff like that, yet rather said something positive about this wh*re's ass. He was scared I break up, said he didnt mean it said that he only wanted to be cool, didnt even look properly cause he only cares about me and was an idiot and will never do it again. I thought ""If it was me i wouldnt even have dared saying something like this about another mans body. Because I love only him"".  I am shattered as I thought I am worth more than that, thought I finally found the one man who wouldnt look at someone else, or at least stand up for me.
I would never break up with him. He is lovely, kind, and we want to marry. I love him so much. At the same time I just feel like this has been it for my life. I notice that it eats away on me mentally, that the thought of not being cut out for this world and being too emotional gets confirmed. What he did happened and cant be undone. It will all forever be carved into my brain. I will always be scared. At the same time I cannot ever leave him. I want to die in a relationship with him. Before he ultimately leaves me for someone else. But I do know now, that the perfect world I was stupidly assuming to finally live in doesnt exist. As good as Ive been treated, in the end my feelings did not matter. Not for my family not for my ex bfs, bf, friends and more. After 25 years nothing changed. There is only lies and betrayal. 

Thats it. Im crying so much but I doubt theres another way. Good night world 🌸 There were ups and downs but my head cannot do it anymore. I was just looking for a place of unconditioned love. Maybe, in heaven, ill get what I need."	Charybdischen	post	18.376616555373722	male	White	0.9983421564102173	na	na	na	0	SuicideWatch	no prediction.
"I'm 33, and have no idea why I've suddenly decided to share. Maybe I hope it'll help. 
I hate my life. I hate being me. I hate seeing my god damned face. Every day I wake up, is a day I wish I wouldn't. 

I used to enjoy doing things, playing video games, going on hikes, exercising, etc. I was depressed, but I still lived life. In the last 5-7 years, that's changed drastically. Especially this last year.

Games are boring, movies are repetitive, colors don't look right, and food has no taste. Most days, I spend hours. Any brief moment of happiness or positivity feels quickly snatched away by the encroaching darkness.

Most nights I lay awake for hours, thinking of quick and painless ways to stop it. It's been reaching a boiling point lately, and I'm scared. Just to be clear, I'm scared of the fact that this line of thinking feels relieving.

Part of me wants to go in to more details. But the rest of me realizes no one will read it, or if they do, no one gives a fuck. Unfortunately, typing this all out doesn't seem to be helping either."

I wish there was something I could say to give you hope or a little self love, but I don’t know how to help myself either. I’ve always kinda known I would leave this world on my own terms, by doing it myself. Suicide keeps looking more and more enticing as the days go by.

If a person plans to commit suicide by hanging. Not by falling, just by suspension. In that case, approximately how long before he loses consciousness?

"For context, I had the ambulance called on me last night by my local crisis team with the instruction of my sister as I was close to ending it. The paramedics wanted to take me to a mental health assessment centre but I said no and they decided that my community mental health centre call to give an assessment and potentially get the local crisis team to visit me. 

When my community care centre called, a much older duty worker (a woman in her 70s) was on the phone. After I broke down to her about ending it she told me that people have it worse than I do and that she’s gone through worse things and because she’s much older knows how life works and knows that things will get better. She told me in a nagging tone (raising her voice) to go to the mental health centre the ambulance wanted me to go to and pick up my antidepressants. I told her I hate leaving my house and am agoraphobic, she did not care. She said near the end of the call “I don’t mean to sound like a nagging mother, but I am a nagging mother and grandmother” then we ended the call. 

I’ve been crying for 3 hours straight. It’s so horrible to have your feelings overlooked in this way and I’ve had enough at this point. If people are going to treat me like shit what’s the use?"

"I am so sorry you were treated so poorly. I broke down reading your post and had to take a time-out before responding. This hit me especially hard. Being agoraphobic myself, I know how defeating it is, how difficult and sometimes insurmountable everyday tasks most others take for granted are.

I've experienced what you've described several times, the worst being when a therapist told me I needed neither a psychiatrist nor medication (this was after I broke down crying many times during the hour-long session). According to her, all my problems were of my own making, and I could solve them by simply thinking positive/having a brighter outlook on life. Sadly, not all therapists are the heroes the media makes them out to be; the sad truth is, many mental health professionals end up making their patients feel worse, which leads many to withdraw from treatment altogether. 

Society talks a big game about addressing and solving the the mental health crisis, but that's really all they do - talk. We have undoubtedly made significant progress but are just now scratching the surface, still so very far from where we need to be. A 2015 JAMA study revealed that 14.3 percent of worldwide deaths (8 million deaths per year) are attributable to mental illness.

That’s extremely horrible, I’m so sorry that happens to you. Something similar happened to me too. I went to a hospital after my attempt and they put me in the psych wing and this nurse comes up to me and starts asking questions about why I did it and stuff and when I told him everything, he was being really judgemental. He started saying stuff like he came as an immigrant with 2 children and a wife and he saw tough days but overcame it, why can’t I? He also tried to pressure me into feeling guilty about what I did and tbh I didn’t feel any guilt. I explained to him my financial situation and he just said “So you did that because of your finances? People struggle a lot more.” And then he went on to tell his life story or whatever for like a minute or two. I felt like I was talking to a wall and that the man was fixated on making me feel worse than I already did.

They want to hound me to death. I've been bullied and humiliated publicly for being different (I'm autistic), I've been accused of horrible things and denounced and defamed to the point of false rape allegations being spread about me. 

People brand me a worthless loser and want me to kill myself. My family have turned on me, my community has and I even went on vacation last week and was hounded there. I had to sit on the coach back home for four hours listening to how horrible and awful a person I allegedly am. I've never hurt anyone. They've humiliated me for my appearance and private life circumstances. They've destroyed my reputation and left me without prospects or even able to travel without being spotted and harassed. 

I've been stalked for 5 years now. I've had to move twice, including back in with family. I can't hold a job and people dislike me really quickly. I'm struggling to socialise and build relationships. They've tried to get the police to arrest me and put me away for crimes they've made up. 5 years, a lot of noise, humiliation death threats, death wishes, doxxing, fake rumours, reclusion and one suicide attempt already.

"Well I was doxxed and humiliated in front of what seemed like the whole world last year. Not sure how long that doxx had been in circulation, people have not been very forthcoming with information about it. Before that I was stalked and shamed online. 

I decided after my suicide attempt, it some time to recover obvs, to try and turn a new page and changed my lifestyle and habits to be healthier overall. I actually felt much better for a while and was optimistic. Unfortunately this summer I've trended again despite all that and it's been feeling futile. I've been fucked over big time. 

I think when I was on vacation far away from home for the first time some malicious people caught wind and stalked and doxxed me again. It was a deliberate move. All the other guests at the hotel were staring at me and saying hurtful things, at cafes I went to and recognising me in the street.

I just feel that after a lifetime of being ostracized and bullied I'm just finally being full on ejected from the world. A man who never stood a chance.

I am afraid that I will do something irrational...for many years I have been thinking of and attempting of taking my own life...I can never do it. But lately I have been feeling such strong emotions that I have went back to self harming. I am afraid that my anger towards myself starts to bleed out to those who hurt me. I sometimes think of hurting my partner (cheated, uses me) or family (childhood neglect, abandonment that lead to abuse and r*** the list goes on.) because they are people who hurt and used me. They have done fucked up things to me mentally and physically..just to turn around be the same people telling me not to kill myself...it's like they don't believe me that I'd actually do it but I've reached a point of not wanting things to get better, it's all false hope.	kuraiblossom	post	29.303541064759862	female	White	0.9858903884887695	na	na	na	2	SuicideWatch	no prediction.

"I'm a 23-year-old man with a teaching degree, working part-time for a consultancy firm, while studying a new degree at university. I chose to leave teaching entirely due to the school system.

The thing is, on almost every possible parameter, I am doing alright. I like to write, read, hike, and more, while I spend a lot of time with my studies and work.

Generally speaking, I have always been well-liked, and in the ""popular groups"" (even though, I was quite quiet) during school and university, but I have always been scared of intimacy.

Now, I am reaching an age, at 23-years-old, where I am realising, I have only had one girlfriend when I was 16-years-old. At the same time, my lonelines and unhappiness has made me isolate from my peer-group.

I feel so lonely, and as a man, I have no one I can tell. I feel the pressure to hide my feelings, and not to cry. I have already two times prepared my suicide, but did not go through with it.

I really feel that it is the lack of romantic connection dragging me down this low. Otherwise, I am very happy about my studies, have clear goals of career path in academia, and my current job, is just okay (just started, so stressful).

My big problem is I am suicidal, but there is no one obvious reason, why I want to kill myself. For instance, if I had nothing going for me (no job, degree, etc), I would know where to make a change.

I truly think, however, pathetic it sounds, that not ""having a girlfriend"", has got me to this point. And I feel unable and too insecure to date anyone.

I wish someone would approach me, or ask me out, I am just way too insecure at this point. I always criticise myself, expect the worst case, and I am very pessimistic about the world.

I feel stuck, lonely, and suicidal."	withusura	post	19.608888324747955	male	White	0.9971601963043213	na	na	na	2	SuicideWatch	age: 23, gender: male, explanation: the author self-identifies as a 23-year-old male. his ethnicity is not identifiable from the text provided.

I have always tried to be a nice guy for my whole life.I was getting bullied by my ""friends"" from neighborhood since I was 15. I was getting bullied at 5th grade 6th grade 9th and 10th grade. I was never fitting in. Always the weirdo. But guess what? I even bullied some people. I didn't knew what I was doing I was just feeling violent. There is no getting around it,I have done pretty bad things for my OWN DESIRE. Them I immedieately started to defend those kids I bullied. Guess what? They
  
saw it as an opprtunity to bully me back! Like WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK WERE THEY THINKING? Allright allright. School is opening 
  
pretty soon and I am scared as hell. I will probably get bullied. I can't talk to girls. No,let me put it right:I can't fucking talk to anybody. I have aspergers and ADHD. I usually forget events,even personalities of some people. I am afraid
  
to defend myself. Everyone seems to be violent. But hey,let's say they are bullying me because they don't know the effects,
  
guess what?They knew exactly what they were doing. I was weeping in my desk all day and they were still pushing me. I even
  
wrongly bully orthers because I usually don't know what I am doing(aspergers lmao). I don't see any hope. I usually proscinate and don't do anything while my classmates go out,eat good food and play soccer all day. Oh my fucking god why?Like why? I want karma allright? I didn't knew what I was doing but they fucking knew! At this point I think I will end up
  
a sociopath because I feel like noone is loving me orther then my father and mother just because I am their son. I have really violent dreams and thoughts. I might do some bad stuff. I take OCD therapy because of that. I have social anxiety too. I can't just focus or understand some stuff. I NEED to kill myself. Everyone else is achieving some stuff while I am stuck in my room doing nothing. I am probably retarded and I just can't perceive stuff like orthers. But you know what?

noone fucking realizes the excruciating pain of being ugly especially as a woman. i will never feel loved in my life. i’ve only been asked out as a joke and people never take me seriously and sometimes i know it’s because of the way i look. i can’t do this anymore. On top of that i have so many other issues like vitiligo, pectus, chronic illnesses and my teeth and jaw are fucked up and im poor so i have no money for any surgeries or good doctors. I had a shitty family life, alcholic dad and was abused by my own brother so i never even felt safe in my own home. I dropped out of 10th grade because i dont even like going outside because the thought of being perceived at all ruins me. I’ve been severely depressed and anxious since i was 12 and im 18 now it only got worse when u turn 18 because it made me realize i’ve wasted so much of my life away on being inside every single day.

I had my childhood and my innocence taken away from me I had to grow up at age 8 getting harrassed and stalked by multiple people 

The police not doing jackshit

I get barely any mental help even when I ask 

I’m “not bad enough” for inpatient even when I literally have attempted suicide multiple times one time several times in one week one of which leading me to have barely lived and only survived because of the stupid doctors just to get no help and be told I’m not bad enough and then when I ended up back in hospital a week later for attempting again they wonder why 

I don’t want to be saved just to be told I’m not mental enough and being forced to live again 

I don’t want to deal with my trauma everyday I don’t want to think of what happened I don’t want to be attacked or harassed or stalked anymore 

Everyone seems to think my issues aren’t bad and I just need to do something they think is a magical cure but the truth is I’ve done everything I can 

Medication,Exercise,Mindfulness,Yoga,SelfCare everything everyone says “ohh do this oh it’s because you don’t do that” NO IT ISNT IVE DONE EVERYTHING and people especially ‘professionals’ act like I’m stupid or haven’t done their bullshit cures when I have done everything 

Good things and ’Bad things’

The only real option I have is suicide
I can’t handle another day of constant flashbacks and panic attacks I have been living like this for like 8 years and I’m sick of it 

I can’t handle this 

It’s not even just rape and sexual assault and harassment and stalking and the PTSD from that I’ve had to deal with but also bullying and depression and weight gain from meds causing people to treat me differently and meaner and eating disorders because of that and kleptomatia and going to a special school where people hurt themselves and others infront of me and so many more things that just make my life a living hell

I’ve finished school now but the trauma still haunts me and I can’t get a job and probably failed all of my exams so what’s the point of living

Like no wonder I’m suicidal I just get used and abused every second of my life

"My father was an alcoholic. My mother always chose him over anything else. It was a shit childhood. My father killed both of them in a house fire from a dropped cigarette eventually.

My husband who I knew for 30 years turned out to be cheating on me and lying to me for years. He suddenly turned into a stranger one day and it turned out he had been living a double life. He never ever revealed the truth of any of it to me but married the mistress he had been denying shortly after we divorced. He had cheated on me (and her I guess) with women from sex websites too.

His family were my family I thought. I don't know what he told them but they all ghosted me. 

I spend most of my time alone. I am afraid of people. I can't trust anyone. 

Someone was kind to me earlier this year and continued to check in on me periodically and I just found out they have been lying to me too. When I confronted them, they ghosted me too.

I have an online friend whom I've never met in person, but I've known for several years now, text nearly every day, voice call every now and then. We know each other rather personally. 

They're in an extremely abusive household and no matter how much I've tried to urge them to get out, to seek help, call the cops, stay with friends or relatives, they've just been stuck and scared. I don't blame them for this at all, but it's getting worse and they're planning on killing themselves. 

I want to drive up to their state (they're several states away) and take them in. They know they're not a burden to me and from what they've said, they feel safe with me. They're a legal adult so there is no issue with ""kidnapping"" or anything like that. As far as I'm aware anyways. 

IF we end up staying together, how can I make them feel safe, secure and loved while staying with me? Their family has physically harmed them, starved them, made them feel very unsafe and I want to know what is the best way to transition them from that life to a healthy one without sending them down a panic attack spiral for ""burdening"" me.

That sounds horrible you sound  like a caring person so I’m sure you’ll do a good job don’t overthink it. Just do the opposite of what they did. I don’t imagine they’d feel threatened by you physically obviously but I guess just don’t get too touchy since maybe it might trigger some like bad memory to resurface or something. Make sure they feel comfortable getting food independently in the house and make them feel at home.

Being a mother to such a young child and dealing with the loss of your husband must be overwhelming. I can think of few things as exhausting and miserable to go through. My heart goes out to you and I hope that you realise that you are not alone and that there are ways to reach out and share your sadness with people who will listen. This doesn't have to be your time and I hope that you will find a way to stay strong and get through until your child is old enough to appreciate the endurance you've shown.

But I’m too scared to do that and I have too many health problems. The only way I’d cope is by doing lsd and smoking weed every day or something.

I feel like I might go off the rails soon such as moving away and abusing drugs, or I’m going to call everything quits.

I would rather live in a fantasy world on drugs then live the painful life I’m living and I’m not motivated to die right now. I want justice for a couple of the terrible things that happened to me. I would rather live in a simulation where my body is limitless even though I know it’s not ‘real’. Like a dream you never wake up from for example.

It feels like I’ve been in a fever dream or nightmare the past 5 years. I go through cycles of initial excitement and short term happiness, then stress and anxiety building up in the background and then isolating myself for months because of  whatever happened.

"A lot of people share your sentiments. My mother had 8 kids while living in a hole. I guess it was her way of coping with life, pumping out children to keep her company and give herself some meaning. Maybe your mother is working on the same logic and just trying to get through and feel like a somebody. Kind of what we're all doing. You seem young enough that you shouldn't really be worried right now about careers or aspirations. Nobody ever knows what they really want to do until they are maybe mid 30's. You go through a whole lot of little mini ideas before then and a lot of it seems like pointless garbage. You think you won't ever find something that motivates you, but usually you do. Eventually. The world certainly has problems, moreso in some places than others, but I like to think it's getting better in tiny little increments day by day. 

When I was younger racism and sexism and all kinds of discrimination was so normal that things you'd find outrageous now were a fixture of prime time TV. We didn't have any real education about what it made people feel and the impact on people's lives and mental health. Nobody cared. I know that what you are experiencing now is still bad, I just hope that things get easier with time as they have done in my lifetime. You're right about people being obsessed with looks and aesthetics, there's barely a person I know who doesn't now view themselves through a beauty app instead of a real mirror. That's a bubble that I think can only get so big before it eventually bursts when people get sick and tired of being so fake. It's really easy to get trapped in to, but it's not reality. The reality of the world is 7 billion people of different colours, shapes, sizes. You can only bs so much before reality breaks through and logic prevails. You might not feel that you belong right now, today. But it doesn't take long for fashions to sway and ideas to change. Maybe you can stay strong and hold on until then?

The last 2-3 years I have been working so hard to finally complete my gymnasium degree. There were so many days where I just wanted to die, mainly because of how my entire life had turned out. 

Through all the hardships I managed to do it nontheless. It's just gymnasium, so nothing special at all in Sweden. Everyone has done it. I am now preparing for university next year, with the goal of studying computer science. 

Since coming out of isolation for all those years and talking to people again, has been very difficult. I feel like I am at a point where I would borderline feel infantilized talking to an 18 year old, being a 26 year old guy. There are so many life experiences which I lack, that everyone else my age and younger has.

I am constantly on edge when talking to people, because I am so afraid that they will bring up questions about my past that I would never be able to answer because of how ashamed I am over it. 

I feel like crying when I am talking to people and they speak about all their experiences, countries they visited, love, so on and so forth. I have missed out on all of this and I can not convince myself that I deserve any of it, because I don't have anything to offer as a person. 

My main motivation that I used to get through gymnasium was that once I am done, then I will no longer be ashamed. With gymnasium being the bare minimum, it should put me on an equal playing field with everyone else, so that I wont stand out too much. After finally finishing gymnasium I was crying tears of joy. Then those tears turned to sadness because I realized that it wasn't enough and until I am done with my university degree, that I shouldn't try to make friends or maybe even more.

I truly hate the way my life has turned out. I am trying to do the best out of this terrible situation. I will never be able to catch up on all of life experiences which I missed out on. It almost feels like people my age and sometimes even younger, feel way older when I talk to them, because of how pretty much sheltered I was for a large part of my adulthood."

All i can say about the last part is there will always be someone whith less than what you have, to you it may look like everyone is living their best life which could be true but that's doesn't mean you can live your best life with what you have, you need to stop magnifying the negative in your life because it might just not be that big of an issue when you take your lens off and start looking at the positives, the negativity will consume you and will darken your view on the world but the negativity is all but just a tiny spec on a much larger portrait."

"

My life is in complete, and utter fucking shambles. I dropped out of college, to work more at my dead-end kitchen job and pay for rent and bills on a house I was pressured into renting, knowing I could not afford it in the long run, only to be kicked out of said house when I inevitably struggled to pay bills and rent. 
This same person who pressured me into renting this home, was the person I had spent seven years of my life building a future around. We were high-school sweethearts. 
Now, I’m back home, living with my parents, stuck between trying to regain the life that I’d known for seven years, or starting a new life with a girl I’d recently met. 
This new girl has a boyfriend, though, and now I’m stuck wanting someone I know I can’t have. 
I don’t know what to do anymore. I don’t know what to do, and each day my Glock looks more and more appetizing.
I can’t take this anymore. Nobody will hire me because of my lack of a degree or relevant experience, nothing fucking pays well enough for me to singularly afford housing in my area, and it’s all fucked. I don’t know how we got to this point as a society, but I cannot, and have not been thriving for years; I am so fucking tired, and I just need a hug and some fucking stability."

I have multiple firearms and they are a great passion of mine as a I use them for hunting and target shooting. Only rifles and shotguns, as I’m 19 and can’t own a handgun in my state. However, I also deal with episodes of depression, and self harming thoughts come about frequently. They have been increasing recently and it’s starting to concern me that it would only take one bad episode to do hurt myself. The problem is that I live with my family and don’t want to raise any concern with them. All of my friends have left my hometown so I don’t have anyone I trust enough to give them to. I also don’t want to sell or give them away permanently, as I already stated they genuinely do bring me a lot of happiness at the range and hunting. I would appreciate any logistical advice on this, thank you.	Only_Lecture1782	post	27.922926450767303	male	White	0.003689107485115528	na	na	na	0	SuicideWatch	no prediction.
"Throwaway account. Last week, as the title suggests, I almost drowned. I swim competitively, and I suffered from shallow water blackout during a race. What that means is that I went too long without breathing and I started to feel dizzy before passing out into the water.

Thankfully, it was a race so I was quickly pulled out of the water and saved. Instead of feeling relief though, I felt mad. Those few moments where I was feeling dizzy and passing out felt peaceful and almost euphoric. 

I've struggled with suicidal thoughts and feelings in the past and I thought I'd mostly worked through them. I hadn't had an explicitly suicidal thought in months up to this point. (eg. I should/I want to kill myself.) I didn't have a plan for suicide anymore, I thought I was doing better.

This near death experience somehow reignited my suicidal thoughts. I want to feel that peaceful again. I want all my worries to disappear like they did in that brief moment, and now I'm feeling like the only way to do that is to die. I'm losing enjoyment in things I normally like because the feeling these activities give me pale in comparison to that brief moment before I passed out. 

I don't know what to do. I'm constantly thinking about that one, euphoric moment and it's making me miserable. It's making me obsess over killing myself again and I don't want to go back to that dark place.

Any advice is appreciated."	That_Ad7296	post	25.11271164552096	female	White	0.9982099533081055	na	na	na	2	SuicideWatch	failed

Shortly after I turned 40, a mm I was dating and really liked, ghosted me.   He asked me to spend the weekend with me and I was so excited.   I took time off of work and went to the destination.   He never showed up and stopped replying to my texts.   It hurt me so much because I knew in that moment that I meant nothing to him, just like I had in other relationships.  And I had really wanted a relationship,  a relationship with him, and a family.  He was having issues with his daughters that reminded me of my own childhood and I wanted to help.  That was 5 years ago.   I felt like I would never have a family of my own.  Since then, I have dealt with my father dying under difficult circumstances and having to go through that oh my own.  I didn’t have a good relationship with him since he abandoned us for a better family, followed a couple months later by Covid shutdowns and being all alone in that, then I had some serious medical stuff and failed medical treatments.  Lost a few what I thought were good friendships along the way.   Now im 45 with nothing going for me. Poor mental and physical health.  Strained relationship with my mom because she was always so negative about me, and no other meaningful relationships.  Have some coworkers who might feel bad but will go on with their lives.  Have a dog I love so much but I hate myself more.   Am a loser even though I tried so hard for so long.  Many years of therapy and depression treatment that failed.   Not necessarily depressed.  Just miserable. No hope anymore as I’ve tried everything.  Total loser.  Pathetic.  Eat every meal by myself when my peers are part of families.  I feel sick every morning when I woke up.   30 years of a serious medical condition fighting for my life for this.

"Why me?

I don’t want to share my age but I have posted before and deleted it. I am below the age of 18 and nothing seems to work out for me. I’m a disappointment to my family and friends. I brushed my teeth 10 minutes too late and my dad said that he doesn’t ask much of me and I felt like I never do enough. I let one of my best friends cut himself. I couldn’t help. My friend wants to kill himself and I can barely help. My girlfriend wants to die as well because of her family and I love her so much she is so perfect I try to help but I don’t feel like she trusts me or even loved me that much and I hurt her too much. She’s the love of my life and I can’t stand myself when I snap from bottled up emotion. I have also recently began to believe that I’m insane or crazy or schizophrenic or all of them, as I have begun to hallucinate sounds and some sights. I barely sleep, I have barely any good people in my school, and my entire class makes me want to die. I try to help all my good friends, but I have four people to try to save all at once and I’ve been so overwhelmed that I can’t even cry anymore. Every time someone degrades them self or talks about suicide or self harm or anything bad I almost cry but I can’t, so my body decides to hurt instead. My entire body goes cold and numb often, I sleep under three blankets in the middle of summer with a hoodie on. I have skull-splitting headaches that seem to never end. My heart often feels like it has a hole in it. I feel like I’m gonna throw up sometimes, and all of these symptoms usually happen when I’m trying to help and want to cry but can’t. I’m way too sensitive and protective over my girlfriend, and I feel like she’s scared of me. All of this happens to me every day. I’m gonna break soon. I’m gonna lose it. I saw a video earlier today of a guy blasting his head off with a shotgun and wished it was me. This pain is becoming too much to bear and I’m gonna break soon.

"I'm nearly 30 and have been dealing with SI (suicidal ideation) probably since I was 12. My mother died and my family fell apart. Sucked big time. 

I do feel a lot of disconnect with my body. A 70 year old acquaintance said that he had been ""living life from the neck up"" for all his life. I had never identified with something more in one of our conversations. 

I was pretty lucky to have a place where I could just walk into and say ""I need help"" and start getting it. I did have to move to make that happen though, so not that lucky really. 

My needs went by underserved where I grew up even though I had great insurance. If nobody was gonna make appointments how was I to know to go? Even if they did, how was I going to get there? I can't drive, that's essentially a permanent state of being treated like a child, feeling like one anyway, where I grew up. Fuck places without public transport worth a damn. 

There are a lot of barriers to getting care and it makes me very sad. Essentially I feel like having a disability is in itself a full time job of self-advocacy to even get my needs met. Awful state of things. 

I'm currently just trying to make it to the end of each day and it feels very hard. I didn't have the understanding to verbalize that I was suicidal till I was 20 years old. Younger generation is ahead on that part it seems. Expectations got a lot higher after I was 18. All the things I was good at, just school really, didn't seem to matter.

"Well I'm encouraged by the fact you say you are trying, because that's ultimately all we can do. There are no guarantees of anything,. I once read that your mind/brain exists to keep you alive, it's up to you to find what makes you happy.

Which is ok if you have the time/effort/will to keep searching for it. Plenty of us end up admitting defeat, giving up on ever being happy again. Instead we find ourselves fantasising about our death, imagining the impact it would (or wouldn't) have on the world around us. It brings a sense of comfort and relief to us.

So why not?
I can only give my words, because I love you. Sounds a bit silly doesn't it? How can I possibly love someone I've never met? But it's absolutely 100% true, we are all people, all brothers and sisters sharing an existence in this time. If we don't start from love, then where will we end up? Nowhere good.

"It feels like the bubble that seperates me from the rest of humanity grows thicker every day. I don't know what the fuck it is that makes me feel like such an outsider every time I try to interact with others. Everybody already has their own clique while I have nothing. No friends, no significant other, no motivation, no will to live. Any time I have to talk with a human for more than 30 seconds I feel like shooting myself in the head. Everyone is painfully fake. Eveyone is the same. Me included. I'm so tired of masking my true thoughts and feelings to preserve this facade of normalcy. The real me scares everyone away.

"after two years of the most amazing time of my life, i met a woman recently who could of been my first love. i’ve dated many but never was in love like i was with her. it ended badly. both of us were heartbroken but I pretended it didn’t bother me.

i planned to just have casual sex and finish my education. but the first woman, a month after the breakup, gave me genital herpes…

Within one month i gained an incurable sexual virus while in the midst of a heartbreak. I’ve loved my life since the day I was born so this is the first time i’ve experienced feelings of hopelessness and suicide. 

not only can i never have casual sex again, but my ex’s face is permanently engraved into my brain and in my heart. The woman that gave me herpes was supposed to help me get over her, but it only made it 100 times worse.

All my ex’s in my past i moved on quick. i was never one to dwell on a breakup, never felt heartbroken. I used to always think heartbroken men were pussies. but i understand now..

Honestly, if it wasent for the herpes, i would have been able to get over her. 

I feel like i’ve been nerfed. I love the way i look, i’m good in bed, well endowed and never struggled in dating and my sex life. i’ve been socially castrated.

"I’m 26 years old and I was born a girl when I was meant to be a guy. It’s absolutely horrible. Im sick of the narrative that trans is beautiful. Being trans is the most devastating, depressing, terrible experience you could ever have. It’ll make you want to die every single moment of your life. I’ve had every surgery/medical procedure you can have for something like this. It’s helped a lot, I don’t want to underestimate how much better I feel. But I still don’t want to be here anymore. Every single other person got to be born normal. I just don’t get why the world had to choose me to screw over. 

Plus I have literally no one to turn to for support. Most of the “trans” community are people who go by non binary or some stupid gender label but have absolutely no issue with the anatomy they were born with. For example, Jeffrey Marsh? Obviously completely comfortable being a biological male. Doesn’t want to be a female at all, but somehow he’s still considered trans and can speak on my experiences. Over half of the “trans” community is a bunch of fakers, people doing it for attention, and teenagers who don’t know any better than to use the trans label. Actual transsexuals have been completely erased from the conversation, and our entire community has been taken over by people who have no idea what it’s like to be stuck in the wrong body. My entire community went from being actual transsexuals describing their experiences to a bunch of 14 year old girls who think they’re trans speaking over us. 

To anyone reading this, just please know that actual transsexuals do not agree with any of the “trans activism” that is happening. It’s so shameful and embarrassing. I just wish this would all end."

Now all these fucking teenage girls who feel tomboyish are claiming to be trans, and advocating that ""You don't need dysphoria to be trans!"" are fucking up the trans rights movement.

Since I was 12 I’ve thought about killing myself. How nice it would be to not have to deal with anything anymore. Usually I keep myself busy enough to be distracted from the meaninglessness but occasionally, something in my life forces me to stop for a bit, and then all the feelings come back. This time it was losing my job. I was in such a dark place. I had been seeing a therapist a psychiatrist taking meds, and had been doing that kind of work for a while. If the goal of that work was to make me not want to kill myself, it didn’t work. So, after reading countless self help articles online saying I should reach out to a close friend or family member, I did just that. One friend dropped me completely and now refuses to talk to me. My mom accused me of “ruining her marriage” because I’m emotionally abusive towards her. Everyone tells me I should “just tell those thoughts to a professional” which I have many times. People tell me that I should call suicide hotline which I do. The level and intensity of my emotions are too much for people. I’m tired of suffering. I’m tired of making my family suffer. My family is resilient. They’ll grieve but get over me, which would be healthy and good. Seems much more healthy and good than living.

I made friends with a coworker and after she had a breakdown at work, several people on the job were so mean to her. I hate half of the people I work with for this. It pisses me off so bad to know they fake concern for suicidal people but they mock my friend, and they would mock me if I fully explained how much I have thought about ending it. Another coworker I befriended opened up about how her grandchild (11m) told a doctor that he thought about suicide, and those same assholes that mocked my friend haven't done anything to try and help the kid. I went out and got him some back-to-school items he would enjoy, and the kid was so thankful. It literally doesn't take much, just have some heart, but no, people are nothing but hypocrites.

I'm kinda easy to manipulate, I'm probably Autistic, so trusting people is a no-go for me nowadays. Relationships are hard. 

I could fairly simply, not easily though, become a peer advocate, work with people like me with mental illness. I do just feel like I don't have much to say other than - why not just buy a house if you're homeless?/s Just stop doing the drugs that are the only thing that help you make it to the end of the day/s This world is too hard on people. 

I've pushed people away before. That whole dog going off into the woods to die BS routine. Caring for others while simultaneously wanting to die. What a messiah complex I had. Though I did believe I was Thor at one point. It's mostly been depression for me but there was some psychosis when I was younger!

I do know I have intrinsic value, I do really believe that. I also believe that it is unrecognized and might never be recognized and that is very sad.

(21m)Everyday I'm fighting to try and break my horrible habits. I feel like blowing my brains out everyday and it's been that way for years. I play video games and smoke weed not because I like to but because video games give me something to do and weed makes me not think at all. How my family would feel is the only thing stopping me but realizing that I don't care how they feel and its scaring me. Everytime someone gets close I instantly ghost them and feel extremely anxious and uncomfortable with the idea of spending time with anyone. Tbh I feel like I'm a burden on everyone around me. I got sexually assaulted by my old friends gf so now I can't even imagine being with someone (tried and I had a panic attack and left midway. She blocked me rightfully so). When I was 7 dad held me down and put peanut butter on my crotch and had the dog lick it off (guess her day wasn't too bad) and my mom decided she would rather fuck every guy in town then have a relationship with me. Oh also first gf cheated on me then called to describe what they did and my whole friend group was helping her hide it so that probably has something to do with my inability to open up anymore. Probably need therapy. I'm so tired of pretending I'm okay I'm not I'm drowning and the only thing I wanna do is go buy a shotgun with this paycheck and call it good.

Death scares me. The permanence of it. No matter how much I try to get into other beliefs and mindsets, I can't shake off the feeling that there is in fact nothing when we die. I wish i could enjoy life. But I wasn't given a normal one. I'm not even asking for much. A normal life would've been amazing. I really don't wanna die but it's either that or the choice of keeping on living like this. Plus we all die anyway yk? I'll face it anyway. Since I'm never gonna get what I want, might as well not prolong it. When you're dead, you're dead. Regardless of when, how, or why... You're not here anymore. If you've lived a full life or died early. You no longer exist. I wish things were different. I wish everything was different.

"It feels like there is no hope for anything good to come of my life.  What I do is merely existing not living.  I feel completely dead inside and all over.  My life is a complete waste and it feels like the end is real close with what I know is coming.  Speaking honestly, my cat is the sole reason I live.  I love her to death but yet hope she dies at times so I finally feel the final despair to do what's needed as she's the only thing keeping me from doing it.  I'm a failure at life and have ruined each chance I've had to make it a good and impactful one.  Now at age 41 I'm out of resilience.

Like many in my position finances are the main issue and there is no escaping the avalanche incoming.  Bankruptcy is the best hope in this area and they may not solve it all.  Well over $100K in debt and about that in IRS debt.  While I have a job it's one I can't stand and yet am trapped in due to the financial issues that would keep me from applying elsewhere.  It's a sick cycle as these feelings feed the gambling that got me here, yet gambling is the sole relief from life I get.  

My girlfriend is great and the only person I have any good relationship with.  She's better to me than anything I deserve and sticks around for some reason.  I've given her ""outs"" to run for the hills and she doesn't.  Unfortunately I'm utterly useless as a man & can't give her the one thing she really wants from me which is sex due to the useless appendage between my legs.  Contemplated telling her to find someone to fuck on the side on work trips and such and just not tell me, but she keeps trying.  We discussed marriage last weekend and she said she'd want to if the finances were more secure so she wouldn't be at risk in the future (very fair) and if the sex could be figured out/worked on (very fair).  In reality would be 3 years minimum before she feels comfortable doing it probably, but she'd want to.  

Mental health issues from the Marines & Afghanistan/Iraq are a big issue (PTSD, depression, anxiety).  I'm constantly in a state of anger, anxiety, and depressed hating the world and wishing it would all end.  I have no friends.  No good family relationships.  They don't know my issues as they'd be happy I have them.  Just constantly numb and hoping death comes.  

Just honestly at the breaking point.  The probability I'd fail at suicide like I have everything is the 1 thought I have keeping me from doing it besides my cat.  When she goes that'll be the tipping point as I'll have no reason to stay around.  Everyone besides her would be best without me.  My gf could find a real/normal man.  Employers can find people who care more for my job.  Family would have a gossip point.  Other people could use the resources I waste.  Government would have to spend less on me.   
 It's a win for all so really I'm the selfish one sticking around.

"Ugh, I get called resilient all the time and resent it. Congratulations to me on not dying I guess! Life is still shit though. 

 I've cut people off, stopped doing the things I like, and attempted suicide. That was 7 years ago.  I feel like I understand wanting attachments to go away so I can kill myself quite well. 

I guess with 30 around the corner and me having survived so much I feel like I won't ever attempt again. Then something new comes up and I doubt whether I've understood anything or if I've just been deluding myself. 

I'm not really one for romantic relationships but I was reading a book on polyamory with an addiction recovery group. I liked an idea from ""solo polyamory"" - viewing myself as my primary partner. For some reason that clicked a bit more for than the usual ""pretend you're giving advice to a friend"" view that doctors and therapist talk about. Probably has something to do with how I've been taught through media that partners are so important. Friends are very much deprioritized in society I feel like. 

There is a mental health center I go to where people are payed to play Uno and Scrabble with me though! Friends of negotiable affection!

"Hey man. I’m really sorry you’re struggling. I (29F) am in a similar situation, except my husband is leaving me. I kept hoping. He said he’s done dealing with me and my mental health - and wants nothing to do with me or our 4 year old daughter. It hurts, a lot. I’m hurting, but also so sad that he doesn’t want to be in her life at all. She may be 4, but she has a great memory. She remembers things from before she turned 3, and talks about them. She’s going to ask about her dad… where he is, why he isn’t there. 

I would imagine your 3 year old would also ask those same questions. I imagine she would feel sad and hurt that her dad didn’t want to be around.

"My dad passed away last month at 68, I'm 29 and have only ever lived 3 or 4 years without him between him leaving my mom when I was in high school and me moving in with him to take care of him.

I am still grieving and constantly feel like I'm so lucky to have spent so much time with him.

One of my coworkers had a dad that died when he was 7, and never met the guy.  We both acknowledged that I was the luckier one, because I got to know and love my dad.

My dad was an addict for a long time, and a lot of my childhood he wasn't a good person.

But he was a good person in the end, and I would trade anything for just one more day with him.

Your child will remember you and it will be traumatic. Any kid that loses a parent to suicidal ends up developing guilt of some sort from it, thinking that they were too much of a burden for the parent to even wanna live. That’s the child’s perception of it. Don’t do that to your daughter, she doesn’t deserve that. And most of all you don’t deserve it. I don’t care how little you view your own life but you don’t get to just throw it all away like that. I’ve struggled with demand suicidal thoughts for many many years and I can’t imagine the amount of pain your daughter and wife will go through if you end it. That is far worse then abuse. Because they have to deal with guilt and grief for the rest of their lives. Do you want a three year old girl to experience the death of their own father?

Please don’t do this to your child. My children ALL very strongly miss their dad and have grown up bereft at all they have missed out on by not having a dad.

I’ve always been suicidal but it’s not my fault. I have epilepsy and the meds I take for it cause suicidal ideations. Sure I had a horrible life my mom abandoned me when I was 5 and my dad tried to kill me when I was 11, raped at 17 and almost lost my life to a horrible boyfriend and broke my back due to epilepsy. I could go on all day about all the shitty things in life but every one of those things taught me valuable lessons. Who I want to be, what not to do, who not to become and the role model I can strive to be for my kids. My youngest is 10 and if I killed myself it would have a devastating ripple effect that not only will affect him but his future family. It will cause emotional trauma to my siblings, my husband, cousins etc…so every day I wake up I am grateful. I could die of a seizure in my sleep so each day is a blessing for me. If I’m stressed out I write down everything that stresses me out then I cross out the things I can’t control and worry about the things I can control. Your child looks up to you.

"Your daughter needs you more than you will ever comprehend. 

I felt the same as you a few years ago when mine was an infant. I would feed her all hours of the night and just look into her eyes and cry and apologize for being such an awful dad, and having to leave her all alone in this fucked up world. Then fast forward to now, I just read her bedtime story and she hugged me and said “goodnight daddy I love you” and fell asleep hugging me, which is the most pure feeling of love I’ve ever felt. I guess with the hectic toddler years I never got around to  committing suicide, and now I’m so glad. Nowadays I try to remind myself this: It’s not about you anymore, fuck you. You’re not committing suicide, you’re murdering your precious little girl’s father. 

If you’re gone, imagine your wife marrying some pedo stepfather…who will be there to protect her? Who will be there to protect her from her future abusive boyfriend that she undoubtedly chose because she was trying to fill the void that you left in her life? 

No father figure will ever love your daughter and protect her as much as you do. Plus on the bright side, life goes by so fast. Just take it day by day and next thing you know, it’ll be a year from now and you’ll be so glad you stuck around for her.

GOD do I understand this. there is a song I listen to when I feel like that (when it’s cold I’d like to die). it doesn’t really make me feel any better but it does let me wallow in it for a bit and let it run through me. the hardest thing for me to work through in my own recovery was seeing the point in carrying on and trying to get better when inevitably I will relapse.

for what it’s worth, you are not doomed. ngl there probably is no repairing your relationship with your ex wife but your daughter is so young. she’s only just starting to develop a memory. it is NOT too late to decide to make an effort and be a good father to her. I made some awful decisions when I was deeply depressed and I was horrible to a person I loved dearly. it broke the relationship and destroyed any chance of it ever being repaired. I will never get that relationship back and likely will never even see let alone talk to her again. that hurt, and it still does. it still haunts me several years later. but I was able to change and save other relationships that weren’t quite at the point of no repair but would have been if I had kept going. you can do that with your daughter. if you leave you will lose that chance and all but guarantee she will grow up feeling abandoned. best of luck man. it’s a steep climb out of the pit you’ve dug yourself into but you can do it"	spamfolder42069	reply	na	na	na	0.9991506338119507	weak	strong	no	na	SuicideWatch	no prediction.

">the cause will impact them immensely, typically thinking they wasn’t love enough so as to make you stay

As the daughter of a Father who killed himself when I was 10 years old. I know this is the truth.

Look at my posts. Look how much of my life I've spent suicidal. I feel worthless and unlovable in life.

Most of this stems from the abandonment of my Father. He chose death over supporting me through my life.

I likely would have genetically suffered with poor mental health anyway, I have it on both sides. I also have a history of generational trauma on both sides.

I understand now at age 36, why my dad couldn't make it past age 38. I have a disorder that wasn't even known about then and he likely suffered from it too.

But understanding all this stuff doesn't erase the conclusion I made when I was 10 years old...

That I wasn't enough, I wasn't worth sticking around for. I didn't love him enough. He didn't love me enough. This belief and this feeling is soaked into every fibre of my being and no amount of trying to argue with it makes it go away. 

OP - I'm so sorry you are in this place. I understand this place more than you could know. I purposefully didn't have children so I couldn't abandon them the way I was abandoned. I don't want to shame you or make you feel guilty for feeling the way you do. I understand what it's like to feel like a burden to others, I feel I only cause the people I love pain. I feel they are better off without me. I know the pain you are in and I empathise deeply. 

I just want you to know how likely it is to impact your daughters life. I know you think she is better off without you. Please, I assure you. Your absence will cause more harm."	spamfolder42069	reply	na	na	na	0.9991506338119507	no	strong	no	na	SuicideWatch	no prediction.

I later became depressed myself and one of the things I used to stop myself was a video interviewing people whose family and friends killed themselves. there were two women in it (a mom and a sister) who were completely devastated by their respective family member’s deaths and they developed their own mental issues because of it.

"Crazy title, I know. 

My family has been struggling with a lot of things (to your surprise , not financially. More like mental issues and some other personal stuff) and recently we've been at the lowest point of our lives. 

so, I try to help and occasionally do some housework and earlier today I was vacuuming the floor in his room and my eye caught a file that was open in his computer and I went to see it out of curiosity when he wasn't in the room and it was a note saying that he has been wanting to end his life everyday and the fact that it was open in his computer makes me feel like he has made plans. 


I knew he wasn't well but never thought it was that bad. Just thinking about it makes me feel horrible and makes me want to kill myself as well. I'm scared he'll do something tonight so I'm staying awake the whole night. It's pretty late already. I am just 16 years old and life is so hard.

"I've had clinical depression for as long as I can remember, but I've always had something else on the horizon to use as an excuse to keep going: ""when I graduate high school, I'll be free and I'll finally be happy.  When I get out of Basic Training, I'll be a soldier and have purpose and can finally be happy.  When my contract is up, I'll be free and I'll finally be able to start a real life and be happy.  When I get to my next job, I'll finally have enough time and energy to start a life and be happy.""

And of course it never works out.  I'm 40, and I've only been in a handful of relationships, the majority of which end in a matter of months.  But my most recent one lasted almost four year before evaporating because even when I think I'm being emotionally open, I'm still walled off by anyone else's standards.

About a year or so ago, my psychiatrist at the time referred me to an IOP because the depression had gotten so bad that I was failing to do anything at all at work, which led to increasingly severe anxiety attacks that eventually just became a single, nonstop panic attack.  I hit a low moment during the IOP group sessions, when a young woman voiced some personal experiences that caused me to re-contextualize some of my behavior with my ex, and realize how much emotional harm I'd probably been causing her by being distant.  

At that point, I made a plan to commit suicide whenever the IOP treatment cycle ended and I was sent back to work.  And as soon as I made that decision, suddenly I felt *amazing*.  All of the things looming ahead of me were gone, and ironically that helped me keep going after I'd finished the IOP.

Sudden mood improvements like that were something we were always briefed about during suicide prevention training in the military, but I still never expected it to be such a dramatically different feeling when I experienced it myself.  So whenever I started to feel overwhelmed again, I'd just remind myself that I could leave whenever I wanted.  

I had a plan, and I knew that as long as I didn't take the first step of purchasing the thing I needed, I wouldn't be able to act on it.  It was like a pin in a grenade.

But jesus it has been getting harder and harder lately.  I'm back to being so far down that I cant' function at work again, except there've been so many rounds of downsizing that my worthlessness is so much more obvious this time.  Instead of sleeping, I spent all of last night using my work phone in incognito mode to check if any of my various blood pressure or sleep medications could be used for a painless suicide.  

It feels like there's no way out anymore: I'm old and fat and falling apart at the seams physically, and my apartment has just gotten more and more disgusting as I've gotten less and less comfortable with stepping outside.  I'll go weeks of living off of delivery and working from home, and if I don't get any work related calls, I'll barely speak to anyone at all for that duration.  I'm in a weekly online D&D group, but that's the only social activity I engage in, and hearing about their own relationship gives me this ache of loss in my chest.  I know I'm going to die alone.  The odds of finding one person willing to put up with me for years was astronomical, I don't think it's going to happen again.  There's nobody to meet through work, and I don't even know what sort of hobby I could get that would lead to meeting someone.  I just get more tired and sad event thinking about it.

And all of these problems are my own fault.  I don't have any right to whine and moan when anyone else plugged into my life would be thriving and thankful.  Sorry for the really long post, I didn't plan it that way, but it was hard to stop once I started writing.  I don't have anyone I can tell about any o fthis."

Have you tried taking professional help? After reading your post I could relate with the suicidal tendency part, planning an end date and all. I was in a similar situation a year ago, when I thought of going for counseling. After a few months, my counsellor warned me to immediately go to a psychiatrist and take medications. Turns out, I had been suffering from anxiety disorder and psychosis and I don't even know for how long I have suffered, definitely a few years. A year down the line, I am still suicidal sometimes but have managed to keep my student life intact, wouldn't have been possible without help I guess. So what I am trying to say is, go for professional help if you still haven't. There could be some underlying mental health issue behind your suicidal thoughts, probably anxiety. I want you to be happy in life and yeah! It would definitely get better, trust yourself and God.

I posted here about two months ago and I’d been hanging on as best as I could. I’m sure that the only reason I hadn’t killed myself is because I was scared of what comes after. I’m not scared anymore. There’s absolutely nothing to be scared of. I look but I don’t see anything. I hear people talk but they’re distant. I touch things but nothing is real to me anymore. And the only real thing I can grasp right now is that nothing is real. And I can’t live with that. I could do it tonight, but I’m gonna wait a night or two to get my shit straight.

Taking high amounts of Benadryl will cause you to go dillusional. You will hallucinate many bad things such as spiders and demons. You will not be able to recognize them as just hallucinations.

Basically what the title says. Or at least I’m gonna try to. My biggest fear is that I’ll survive my attempt somehow. Or someone will find me early on and save me. I wish I knew how to ensure that I’ll 100% die. If I survived, I’d be even more at rock bottom than I am now. And that feels impossible, considering I’m the lowest I’ve ever been currently. I just need this to work. Otherwise, everyone would treat me differently. I’d probably be in physical pain. There could be a chance I won’t ever be the same again physically. I could get sent to a mental hospital. I don’t want to deal with all that. I’d just attempt again when I had the chance.

"So it's been a year since I last tried to end it (with a rope), and I did not succeed. I ended up in a psych ward and prescribed an antidepressant and anti-anxiety that scrambled my mind. I was able to take a year off uni and I wanted to try and study during that year so when I came back I would be able to catch up but due to the drugs I spent most of that year holed up at home in too much pain from the migranes to focus. I honestly haven't been taking university seriously since my mom passed before the pandemic and then when the pandemic happed it just gave me an excuse to procrastinate even more and hardly ever go out. I know that I reached a point now where I'm gonna flunk out and my family has high expectations for me, my friends included. Everyone thinks that I'm so smart but it's all a lie, I smile outwardly but inside I'm crying. My parents took out loans to help me through school so I just feel like such a burden. I don't even know if my major is what I want to do with my life any more either but I spent all these years trying to achieve it. I just can't take it any more. I tried more than one way to end it but of course it's hard and I failed over and over again. I don't wanna end up back in the psych ward because that broke my family's heart. And I know attempting again would only burden them further but I just can't take it. I either live and fluck out and dissapoint everyone and maybe even get disowned who knows. Or I off myself and break their hearts again. It's a lose-lose situation all around. I wish I realized the depression I was slipping into when my mother passed but I was too out of it to think straight and just kept spiraling. It's funny that when I looked back at myself 10 years ago when I was a teen I was so optimistic of the future but then time passed and life sh!tted all over me and I wasn't strong enough to overcome it. Now I wish that I was the one that died of cancer not my mom.
Tl:DR So long story short I'm flunking out of uni so I'll off myself (this time I'm thinking drowning) so that I'll stop being a burden to my family."	Miserable-Roll-4507	post	20.009519382310323	female	White	0.998737633228302	na	na	na	6	SuicideWatch	failed
I feel you. I come from a very conservative muslim family. I was excited to be doing my postgraduate this year, they've taken out so many loans to pay for it and are broke and struggling right now,  I feel pressure of being told I have to do well and prove naysayers wrong. I am currently failing and have my masters deadline today it's 50% of my grade, due in a few hours I haven't started.  I am 16 weeks pregnant and can't afford to abort, I am also in a country where it's extremely illegal. Just got dumped after he (the father) made me tell my whole family about him and a potential marriage knowing they are all against this relationship it caused a huge rift between me and my mom. And in my religion at 17 weeks the foetus is given a soul so it's equivalent to killing a person. I can't live with myself if I do that, but I also can't go through with this. If I go through with this I'm a single mum having a baby I never wanted and can't afford and I am unemployed and most likely will be disowned and homeless. If I kill myself in the next 4 days I avoid at least killing another person and it's just me and at least I won't be an embarrassment and disappointment to my family.

I feel suicidal every single day for the last two weeks but I’m not sad feeling. I have a strong urge to off myself without a cause, or perhaps I should say it’s because I feel terrible. Why? I don’t know. It’s like I want to jump out of my skin because the feeling is so uncomfortable. I can’t do anything about it and end up sleeping to feel relief from this uneasiness. Is it possible it’s my antidepressant? I’m going to my psych tomorrow to see what can be done, else I’ll have to go to a psych ward because I can’t stand feeling like I can’t relax. It feels like I’m in constant fight or flight. Exercise helps a little, then quickly comes back after I’m done exercising. Thank you for any insight.

"I'm going to kill myself but not because I'm depressed or I hate life but because I've always had this fascination about death. I've had many interesting experiences throughout life that were so much fun but to me nothing could ever compare to experiencing death. Even the very thought of it excites me. One way I'm thinking of achieving this is by traveling to the middle of the ocean alone in the midst of the night, miles and miles away from people, attaching myself to a heavy object(maybe a cinder block) with a rope and jump into the ocean and getting consumed by the darkness. The object would pull me down into the void and as I'm getting pulled by gravity and suffocate, my natural instinct would activate and start to frantically pull myself up but it would be hopeless because no matter how hard I try and fight, it would be too late. By the time I'm able to break free, I wouldn't have enough time to swim back up to get air. The idea of being alone, in the middle of nowhere at night and disappearing without anyone ever known is getting me more excited haha. As I'm typing this, I can hear the ocean calling and whispering to me that this was meant to be. I'm so happy and ready to jump into the serene, endless, empty  black abyss to disappear in solitude to never be seen ever again. It's as if I've never existed in the first place.

"I have to say that i was a pretty normal kid but i was ruined by my parents and bullying. 
My dad, was a quiet kid too. He says he had been molested when he was 8. He has a really old mind to be honest, he is going to 68 years old, and my mom is 56.
 I had been bullied so much about my skinny body and my appearance. At one point, i lost my inner kid and stopped behaving like one. I started playing videogames to feel better, and i was addicted to them. So i started having dark eye circles and everyone in my junior high school would call me psycho, drug addict and wouldnt want to play or talk with me.
I lost it. I totally became a quiet kid. I was having school shoot thoughts because whether i like it or not, these motherfakers ruined my life. I even started working out to confront/beat my former bullies. I was obsessed with revenge. Those thoughts stopped at one point.
I started skipping school days since these fuckers (teachers and school kids) would comment for my face/personality all the time. I told them many times to stop but they dont stopped.
No one knew my name lol.
When i was at home, my dad would remind me of the guys that bullied me almost EVERY DAY, and he knew i didn't like it. I told him to stop. He didn't listen. I was so pissed of him reminding my trauma. I hit him in the arm, and he punched my penis and slapped my face. I felt like bleeding on my genital. He was proud and he said that i wouldn't get any girls because of it.
Vacation :
My family went to vacation on a beach for 7 days. When we were returning, my dad punched my mom and hit her, for literally no reason. He also blashphemed and called me ""bullied"".
My mom is really toxic at times, but she deserves the best. 
I have really more serious experiences but i dont want to traumatize you guys.
There is really much much more trauma in my life, my family is so bad. 
I will not get any girls when i grow older
I have 5 months to get off my house 
I play 11 hours per day video games

School is hell and a prison for most people. Well some of us. The only thing it taught me was that i hate society and what it creates in people with every part of my being lol. You have to learn, to forget everything.

All the hate. All the shit you tell yourself and that they told you. None of it is true. When you let it go and forget it.

Do the actions that need to be done. And then forget them.

Cut out the addictions, give yourself some love in your body and mind. Free yourself. Have compassion on yourself. Rise above this sewer of despair and never look back.

"I have typed up and deleted a whole post because I was uncomfortable with how many details I was divulging about my personal life so I'll just keep it brief.

I'm a 28 year old single male living in an apartment in a city where I moved for work away from my hometown 2 years ago, in the process losing most of the friendships I've cultivated over the years. I have extreme levels of anxiety and used to take Propalnol for the physical effects it would cause me. This makes it extremely hard to build relationships or even talk to people casually, resulting in me not speaking to even a single person here. One of my friends used to work near me and he'd come to hang out during the week, he's the reason why I haven't made a post like this sooner. This stopped now but he still regularly checks in and will phone me if I don't reply for a couple of days. I don't know why he even cares even my parents don't check in on me in this way.

My question to myself is the title of this post. I see people in my life, all my old friends in happy relationships, getting married, having children and I'm still stuck here in this hell I fashioned for myself. The relationship part isn't that important as like, God I don't even know how to put this any other way. I don't feel human you know? In 2 years not having spoken to anyone who lives in this city let alone my own apartment complex, I feel like a normal human would just to avoid loneliness. How does a person with no connections even begin to make them? Everyone has their own busy lives so I would feel like I'm intruding on them by asking them to give an alien like me a chance. Whether talking to men or women no one would have the time to fit a friendship with me in there. Its honestly hard to even find anything enjoyable anymore, knowing that the only person I could ever share it with is me. I've bought games, consoles, board games, tickets, trips, drugs and tried many hobbies getting very little fulfilment from anything.

Which is why I have heavily considered just doing it at 30, it seems like a nice rounded age to close the curtains on. It also gives me 1.4 years of time to seek enlightenment and find an answer to the question posed. When I was 21 I had a friend who was 5 years older than me and we said we would both close the curtains in 4 years time, this never happened but the idea persisted in my mind. Maybe someone is in the same boat as me and rather than being ready to call it now is just waiting for the time when our entropy reaches it's apex."

You may not be an ‘art’ kinda guy, but that’s not really the point (although staring at one of his paintings for a good long time I’ve found to be a great way to dissociate away from my problems). 

The point is that VG always ran toward his pain. He ate breakfast with it, carried it wherever he went, let it envelop him completely. In other words, he would commit the emotional equivalent of jumping naked into a forest of poison ivy just to feel the exquisite agony of its sting.

I didn't want to ditch my kids, so I thought about waiting on suicide kind of like how you're suggesting. I thought about waiting until they're at least 18 and on there own. But I've come to learn that there is beauty in our existence no matter what stage of life we're in. There is deep meaning and beauty. One thing that's really helped me, and it might sound strange, but I look at nude figurative art. It's like I'll see them posed in struggle, but I see their inherint beauty and I think to myself, omg, there is something deeply meaningful of our existence. Because of how I felt, I'm determined to find it for myself. In the meantime, I've learned to see  beauty in the smallest of things in life.

"I find it quite refreshing and almost the opposite being true, its like having an invisibility cloak and a big positive for me is you get to decide on your own terms if you would like to speak to someone (So basically never for me). Attractive people get approached all the time which I would find stressful and a massive annoyance. 

Life in general is pretty hard mode for everyone, social media makes people think that all the attractive people are happy and have it easy. When in truth you only see those pictures because people like taking pictures of attractive people whether it's themselves or an outside photographer. I guarantee you there's at least a million ""attractive"" people who feel the same way about life as the posters on this subreddit.

Its hard to boil down to one specific answer but when I first moved I entered a depressive state, I was locked in as I bought the apartment which was doubly fucked when my work decided to rent out office space in another city rather than the one I moved to specifically because I was told we'll be renting where I was. This lead to me then getting into a loop of regret and being ignorant to everyone because of my own sadness. To be fair though because I love shitting on myself only 3 people came to see me in total (until last month) over the 2 years I've lived here. The city I live in isn't even far away they just didn't bother. This coupled with my ignorance and depression lead to a lot of them fizzing out.

"God I didn't know how frustrating I used to be, it's like you're writing comments I would've made 4 years ago word for word it's crazy. 

When you only speak to people who follow the same beliefs as you, that will be the only answer you will receive. Misery loves company and there's nothing more unifing than feeling ostracised especially for how you look. I'm not here to argue with you either, I know your anger all too well I used to say the exact same shit pretty much down to a T. It is easy to do what you're doing now and just wallowing over being ugly, I was also there too. Do you think your life would improve if you were attractive? I would rather you go and ask unhappy conventionally attractive people and see what being attractive has to do with their mental state.

And on the higher paying jobs thing I earn or well before I quit I earned the 3rd most in my company with bonuses and I'm ugly as shit. I also got hired on that salary despite it being a competitive field in my age range. I didn't even start working in this field until I was 24 either so there's that too.

Again don't have to believe me, but if you keep going down this route all you will find is more and more misery until it drowns you. I found that when I try to help people it makes me feel a little better, I don't know what will work for you but I promise you if you stop reading incel shit and talking to people that spread this rhetoric your life will improve.

It makes complete sense, you said life is hard for us unattractive people. So what makes you unattractive? Attractiveness is subjective meaning everyone has different opinions and that means no one is right and that yours is the only one that should matter to you. And everyone comes into this world on a mudslide which is a metaphor. When people are born they are usually pooped on by the mother, that is a fact and it helps remind me that nobody is better than anyone else and came into this world the same way.

"Honestly, doctors should really be more upfront about the side effects of these meds. I was only on Zoloft for like- 2 or 3 weeks? It effed me up. I had this (or a mild version of this) along with an effed up stomach, emotional numbness, anhedonia, suicidal thoughts, and anxiety attacks. No thank you! Then I'm judged for not trying others. I have tried two others... one gave me a rare nerve reaction and the other was an anti-anxiety med that gave me an anxiety attack.

I truly believe that if you find a side effect unbearable, you have the right to stop. But do it safely. Idk how long you've been on them, but they can cause serious withdrawals depending. Let them know and they'll probably say to gradually lower the dose instead of stopping cold turkey. Also let them know about your suicidal thoughts. These are definitely not the meds for you."

It is understandable how bad you feel.  I know a lot of people— myself included— who had a terrible time at their first job or first few jobs.   Some got fired.

"Since my beloved friend did it, I cannot stop thinking about following him. I don't really have a miserable life, but since that happened it's just like an intrusive thought that I'm unable to get rid of. 

I've suffered from long depressive- disociative episodes. But I really am in what I should consider the best stage of my life.  I have managed to reconcile my family ties, I have friends to talk to and my partner really shows great affection towards me.

"I don't understand most things that happen in this world. I don't know what's going to happen to me. So I'm just going to write down what I do understand and what I do know.

I was eating in a restaurant with my family. I looked around at the walls, which were beautifully painted, and I just took a few moments to feel an emotion I can't describe. Everything around me will one day be nothing. All the walls around me will be broken down, every table, every chair, every door, everything. One day there won't even be a trace of my family and I. Maybe a trace of human life, but personal experiences will be lost to time. Every experience had in this place will be forgotten within one century. The table next to us had a birthday party going on. Within a century, nobody will remember that birthday. Nobody will remember that those servers and family members ever celebrated that birthday, unless explicitly recorded and kept. Seeing as that's most likely not happening, who will remember any human experience happening as I write this, and as you read this?

But I'm not saying that we should feel bad or nihilistic towards human experiences. I'm saying the opposite. Seeing as nobody will remember anything we do in a century, I'd like to cherish every moment I have. Even if I end up dead by my own hand one day, I find comfort in the prospect that I lived every moment. Maybe I'm alone in that.

I spend my life looking through a glass and wonder what's blocking me from experiencing everything fully. I'm too blind to see that it's my own reflection that blocks me from seeing life. In other words, I have come to realize that the only reason I have not been living life to its fullest is because of me. Trauma aside, and depression aside, I had been pushing away friends and family. And coming to this realization has really terrified me. If I lose this moment we are living in, will I ever feel this way again? 

It's almost 2:30 AM. I don't want to lose this feeling. I don't want to go to sleep. What if I never feel this way again? And I'm just telling this to random strangers, but that feels comforting to me. Nobody here knows me, they wouldn't ever notice if I vanished one day. But if they did know, they would care. And that's one thing that I don't understand about the world. Here are some more things I don't understand.

I don't understand how people can be so kind. I was raised by a father who cheated on my mother with his doctor. Now that doctor is my step mother. I will never consider my step mother family. I consider her evil, and she is. She threatened to kill all of us multiple times, yet my father just brushed it off and forgave her. But this isn't a trauma dump. What I'm getting at here is that I was raised into a mental state where I don't understand kindness. Sometimes I think there's another motive other than just kindness, sometimes I just don't believe it. But lately I've been getting better. I've been learning more about  how to better recognize when it's just kindness from people. It's difficult. My friends have been so extraordinarily kind to me, I love them all. I am so thankful for them. I just don't understand how they can be so kind when I'm really not that important.

I don't understand why people treat me like I'm special. Specifically my family. My parents have always treated me like I'm special, and that made me grow up very egotistical. I only stopped those egotistical behaviors about two years ago (I'm 14M for context). I just feel like I've been treated too well considering that I'm not that important at all. Since I started playing piano about six years ago I was always told that I had a special talent for it. I don't believe them. I just practiced a lot. I'm currently working on the piece Hungarian Rhapsody no. 2 by Liszt in case you're wondering. I don't have anything special about me. So why am I treated like I'm the next coming of Jesus?

I don't understand how so many bad things can happen to our family. Its like a constant stream of terrible things. My dad kicked my mom and us small children out of the house so he could be with his girlfriend, the same one that he cheated on my mom with. We were homeless for a few weeks. We eventually got a one story house with no basement, yet we can barely afford to pay rent and eat. My mom got a terrible job working in Healthcare. We were just in limbo for years. Then my mom finally got a better paying job, and you wanna know what happens immediately after? Rent raised 175 dollars. Now we're stuck in limbo. My sister got approved for a house. She had even transferred job locations, and ended her apartment lease(?). She was approved for the house, and then suddenly the sellers finances just fell through for some reason. That late in the proceedings. Now I'm waiting for the next terrible thing to happen to us. It's always been one after another, and there were many that I didn't even mention because that would extend this post even further.

I could go on and on. I don't understand many things in life. Maybe I'll continue tomorrow. It's 3 AM on the dot as of writing this sentence. And in a century, nobody will remember this. I'm going to be forgotten, which is slightly comforting to me. Nobody has to look at my life. I may be remembered for a few decades, if I ever have any grandchildren somehow, but one day everything about me will be forgotten. I just imagine that in 1,000 years, an outsider will look in at human society. Even if they study us for decades, they'll never truly know the human experience. And slowly, all the humanity will be drained out of humans once we are long extinct. I don't want to lose this feeling. If you read this whole thing, thank you. Maybe you can remember the experiences I've had for me once I'm gone. But I probably won't be gone any time soon.

"Hey,
The advice you ask for doesn't exist I'm afraid.

The only absolutely guaranteed way to die is to live. It will come for us all eventually. I know that's not what you want to hear, I don't have any answer that will help you feel better. No one does. 

The only person who can help is you. 

That's the kicker, that's what makes me want to run/hide. I know it's true for me and lots of people I've spoken to. It's scary as can be, especially when we're emotionality on the floor. Or struggling for whatever reason. 

Not being alive seems like the best option sometimes, that's ok. It can feel relieving to think about it. If and when you do contemplate it, ask yourself exactly what it is that you desire from it. 

Not to feel anymore? Not to think anymore? Sometimes it's a little more direct like ""I'll show those bastards"". Honestly there are loads of reasons, try to isolate yours. It may give a window into how to move forward.

"The moment you find out that something is medically wrong with you is a moment of serious panic that leads you on a rollercoaster ride of emotions and fears. I can completely understand that right now you are in the midst of this anxiety and picturing all sorts of terrible outcomes. It is a natural human thing to immediately jump to the worst possible conclusion and presume that everything is doomed from hereon. 

Having herpes might feel like a life sentence and your initial worry is thoroughly valid and is something that anyone would think. The truth is, there are people who will be less open to a relationship, but there are also people who won't. There are 8 billion people on the planet so the people who won't category is more than wide enough for you to never really have a problem. 

If someone gets to know you in the first place and they like you enough for them to be a possible partner, they are not going to care as much as you fear about the herpes. The first outbreak lasts a while but the subsequent ones are usually just over a week now and then. That doesn't put you any kind of 'gross' category, you're just a regular person who picked up what's unfortunately a pretty regular disease. Don't start picturing yourself as somehow lower in value just because you have herpes. It might be a logical conclusion to a frightened mind, but it doesn't change who you are. It's not a disease of the personality, it's not a disease of who you are and what you have to offer. If I lost my arm tomorrow I would certainly suffer a loss of confidence but I would not be a different person. The confidence loss is what you have to deal with over anything else. Remind yourself that you're still you and that anyone who likes you for you will still like and love you regardless of this (very common) ailment. Don't put yourself in to relationships and situations that you don't necessarily want simply because you feel that your options are limited. Your options are the same as they always were, minus a few squeamish people. You're fine. If you were my friend, I'd still view you the same. If you were my lover, I'd still view you the same. Most people feel this way and would not allow this to get in the way of their love for someone. 

I hope that in time, you can manage your breakouts and you figure out what type it is/ what the best treatments are and claw that confidence back. For most people, they are back in to their usual routines before they know it and the initial alarm fades out to be replaced by, well, normality."	mychoppaluvyou	reply	na	na	na	0.9982483386993408	weak	no	no	na	SuicideWatch	no prediction.

"Sometimes everything on the outside ""seems"" fine even when inside, it really really isn't. That's not uncommon. You could have the best circumstances surrounding you but something can still be wrong. It might be a lot of things. A chemical unbalance or your soul wanting something beyond what you have. I would even say faking it is part of the problem. Being forced to look happy even when you're not can cause dissonance. It's really hard to keep that going.

I've had a plan for many years that when either my health becomes unmanageable and/or my money runs out I'll perform suicide (no immediate plans, not a threat to myself or others).
Here's the problem: I ran the numbers on my budget and inevitably I'll run out of money (meaning ultimately becoming homeless). That might happen in six months, three years, or ten years, or perhaps more. But it will happen. I have family and friends with good financial resources but they've been reluctant to help me in the past (I think they may view me as a ""bad bet"", considering I've been in psychiatric hospitals five times since 2003). Plus, telling them I'm going to ""exit"" unless I get their assistance seems too much like blackmail and I don't think that would be fair.
I play Lotto once a month (just $10 scratch-offs) in the hope of winning say ""$25,000 a year for life"", but I know that's a long shot. I've thought of moving to Mexico where life is cheaper but physically I don't think I can manage it.

I'm somewhat concerned about crime there, I know it's overstated in America but even here I think I'm a bit of a target for muggers (I'm in Jacksonville, Florida).
I also have a very real concern that Social Security may decide to review my case for any reason, and getting back to the States for that, finding a place to stay during the review and so on, would be pretty much impossible for me.

"About me: MDD diagnosis for four years, bipolar diagnosed last year after a suicide attempt

I'm in at the very bottom of a depressive episode. I've not done any work for the past few months and though I have been diligently taking the psych appointments I'm now here.

The intense sadness and hopelessness is like a sharp pain in my chest, and a lump in my throat. 

I don't think I can take any more of this. I deeply regret this, but here's my note.

---
Hi. Before we begin:

 whomsoever it may concern, I have performed this action of my own free will without coercion, harrassment or encouragement from family, friends or the college. Nobody should be blamed for this except for me.

With that out of the way,

I am sorry. Sorry for leaving you like this. Sorry for hurting you in this grievous way.

I am sorry that I wasn't strong enough. Or brave enough. Or smart enough. Or disciplined enough.

I am sorry for ending my life. Sorry that I felt the only way out was to make my heart stop beating.

To my family:

I have failed you. You didn't deserve this. I know that there is not I can say now that will give even an iota of comfort or solace to you. Know that to the end, I felt deeply loved by you and that you are utterly blameless in this.

I just hope that someday you will be able to get past this. Look to professional help; maybe they will work for you.

To SLT_K:

I have failed you as well. Your friendship is one that I deeply cherished, though I wasn't polite enough to show it. Among all the people I know, you are the only one, I think, who understands.

I don't suppose that there's one last thing you could do for me?

Keep moving forward. 

I know you have been through much and that you had just started turning a corner. But I deeply wish that you keep that momentum going ahead. 

To Sh_D:

I'm sorry. I really felt that you cared for me and you are really that one friend I could laugh with. I hope you can laugh again after this.

You stood out as that rare person who is kind, funny, extremely intelligent and curious (always ready to FAFO), and having high integrity.

Blow up some fpgas for me.

To S_S_R:

I'm sorry. Goodbye.

You were there with me through a lot of it. It really meant a lot. Your nature as a dreamer is  rare. It was fun dreaming alongside you. I hope you keep working towards them.


Goodbye."	am_i_beyond_saving	post	25.37913696312053	male	White	0.9938889741897583	na	na	na	1	SuicideWatch	no prediction.

"This is it. Mods I’m (25M) sorry if this isn’t allowed. I’m going to kill myself tonight. I’ve already drafted the note, and I have my plan cooking. Just a few things left to do today before I can wrap this story up. 

By the way, I’ve been diagnosed with OCD since I was 15, but I don’t know if it’s OCD anymore. People mention POCD, which I’ve had before but, it seems too real. 

I can’t admit this to anyone so I’ll admit it online. When I was 18, I masturbated to a photo of the face of a 10 year old trans-person. Why? No fucking clue. I masturbated to a lot of weird shit. My mind didn’t register that anything was wrong with it. I felt extreme guilt but got over it; OCD brought it to my forefront a couple years ago, repeat extreme depressive episode, and now, here we are again. 

Granted, do I feel attracted to children? No. But can I reverse the past and erase that horribly twisted deed? Nope. Do I feel like I’m a pedophile? No. 

My partner doesn’t know. I feel like I should break up with her. If she knew what I did she would never want children with me. She would think the same things I do. I’m evil, I am a scourge on the earth. I’m so fucking sorry. I don’t know why the fuck I did that. But enough feeling sorry for myself. It’s all over with tonight. 

I honestly don’t know why I’m writing this? Maybe just to vent before my end. Maybe I secretly want someone to help? Lmaooooo, who knows."

My brother in christ, whatever you do isn't evil unless it directly negatively affects a person. Murder, rape, child pornography, they're all evil as it destroy lives. What you did was weird, abnormal even, but it was nothing other than your intrusive thoughts winning. My friends did weird shit too, but he ended up alright. What you did doesn't affect a single person in this world. If you feel guilt for doing it just avoid doing it in the future.

"People do strange stuff. Was it good? No, but nobody else suffered, and if you understand it's wrong, then no harm done but to yourself. You shouldn't tell anybody. You were 18, people are horny and don't always understand what they are doing to full extent at that age. 

I see nothing evil in you. The fact you regret is enough. Most people won't even remember or think about it. 

I know it may seem terrible, but, please, rethink. I rarely say that to people, but in your case - please, reconsider. It was just a stupid little thing when you were almost still a minor.

I can relate to this in a way. I’ve been hooked on porn since 11. Even before then I was introduced to sexual perversion by a relative. I didn’t know how to masturbate untill, one day I went to play the xbox and my brother had left a sex in the city cd inside of it. I was amazed by the scenes I seen played out in front of me. I tried one day, alone, acting out the striking motion that I seen, on myself. I masturbated to the thought of someone, can’t remember. I got my first ejaculation there and felt how good it was. How unbelievably good it felt and from there the addiction started. All throughout my school years I spent, when I was alone, masturbating. Most days multiple times a day. As you can imagine, I would sexualize almost every pretty female I seen. The fantasies in my mind got worse and worse. Then I would get nudes from women and masturbate to them. I stopped watching porn about 3 years and found out about different apps. Now I’m addicted to watching and masturbating to women that post themselves online. My brain and mental state is so lost. I often don’t know who I am anymore. My penis is mangled and I’ve developed pyronies disease. I haven’t accomplished much of anything in life and I’ve tried stopping many times. Especially this last year. Every time I start winning and distancing myself from this addiction it always seems to come back way worse and get me wrapped in it again. No matter how many times I say no, how many urges I beat I always get sucked into it. I can’t tell u how many naked women. Bro it’s so unreal yet very real and I might be insane…. I’ve seen things and got off to things I’m not proud of. I want to emphasize this once more, EVERYTIME I START DOING GOOD AND AM RACKING WINS AFTER WINS I END UP LOOSING AND GETTING SET BACK. 10 steps backwards, sometimes 20steps backwards. I want to be free. I want to experience a life of freedom completely lust free but it’s so difficult. I know God is very disappointed in me and I am giving up on myself. I don’t know if I can come back, if I can truly come back and live free from this lust addiction. I don’t know if I can regain my mind. I don’t make posts at all and I’m usually reading everyone else’s post but I decided I would make one myself. If anybody has been set free please tell me how you did it (no bs). If you read this far thank you ❤️. I hope you are having a wonderful day and I’m sorry to have dropped this essay on my life…I’m 20 now btw. I’m not suicidal, but I realize how easy I can become that way and may even attempt something if I continue with this addiction.

So, I tried to commit twice. First by overdosing, second my hanging myself. The problem is though, I barely remember them. I think I kind of blocked them out from my mind or something so I really struggled to tell people what had happened. However, this made me feel like I faked them as I don’t remember them very well so I don’t remember exactly what I did. I have no clue how many pills I took when trying to overdose and I only know that I didn’t hang myself but I don’t now how.

I very recently got together with the kindest, most beautiful, supportive and loving man I have ever met in my life, but regardless of the incredible love and the wonderful care he gives me, I'm just so exhausted of constantly fighting my mind every single day, no matter what and no matter how hard I try to convince myself to stay alive, I just know it's be better for me and for him if I kill myself, the sooner the better. I've had so much shit happen, one thing right after another, and work stress on top of that, plus my crippling anxiety and pretty much lifelong depression that's only spiking for no apparent reason and my deteriorating physical health. The only thing that calms my mind is thinking about how I'll be dying soon. I have a plan, it brings me great peace knowing I can execute it very soon, I'm excited for my planned date to come, it's soon enough, but just far enough that I have time left with him, time enough to say goodbye and that I'll love him forever.

"Tw:SH. 
This post will most likely be long and all over the place so bear with me, because I don't even know where to start. So much has happened and I'm embarrassed to even admit it. I've come here every so often to make similar vents on my worst days, but I dont know if suicidal is even the right word anymore.
Ive already come to terms with the fact that I'm too much of a wuss to actually off myself, but I think about it often and I hurt myself when it gets real bad (like today, I hadn't cut myself in a long while but I had a bad day and couldn't help it). I can't help but feel that people's lives would improve if I were gone, especially the people I've dated . Long story short, a few years back I cheated both on the person I was with and the other person who I had cheated on them with. With each other. I feel bad about both, but I feel especially bad about betraying the second person. After each incident happened I've come out and told them what happened. The most recent incident happened near the beginning of this current relationship with the second person I mentioned. I'm still with them (""technically"") and have been for about 4 years now. I have NEVER seen them cry except for that day when I told them I had cheated. Maybe a couple of other times they've teared up at a sad movie or bad news but that was the only time I've ever seen tears roll down their cheeks. And I feel awful. Now we're in a toxic relationship. They call me names, insult my appearance and weight(""fatass"" ""bitch"" ""cunt"" mainly) but I i can never fully convince myself that I don't deserve it, and I don't want to be alone. They never used to do this, even after I cheated, it's mostly been on this recent year. 
It's been years since I hurt them but I can't forgive myself, and idk if they ever even really forgave me. The first person says they have, but not my current partner. On top of that, I used to call names too (never anything about their appearance but still bad)and even break things. Now that the tables have turned, I can't leave. I can't come to terms with how bad I let things get and I can't let go of what we could be, or could have been. We're around the same weight give or take about 5-10 pounds but today they called me fat again and I locked myself in the bathroom and slit up my thighs. At first it was because I felt bad about what they said to me, then it was because I feel bad about all the things I've done. It doesn't help that many people say cheating is an unforgivable thing to do, I guess I can't blame them but it makes me feel as if ive permanently fucked up my life. I've cut on and off since I was 12 for different reasons, few and far between usually, but every time I'm feeling very bad I get the urge. Some of the times I've done it for attention, and other times, like now, I did it in secret to feel better. I've hurt myself in other ways too, including wrap a belt around my neck and pull it until there was a ring of bruises that stayed for about a week. I can't talk to anyone about it and no one really knows the extent of how bad my relationship has gotten either. I've told my friends of the things I've done but not what's currently going on with the name calling etc. I don't tell my friends I hurt myself either, just that I've struggled with it in the past. There wouldn't really be a point in telling my partner about it, they already know and call me a psycho due to it. I was also told by a relative of theirs that they're ""seeing someone else/ in an open relationship with someone else"" but I don't know if this is true or was just a lie to get me to leave. They don't talk about it anymore when I ask. I try not to think about it because I feel like I'll lose my mind if I accept everything. I know I could probably look at their phone to see what's actually going on but I'm very afraid of what I might find, I don't want to be traumatized.

I’m not trying to be mean or anything so don’t take it the wrong way but I read all of that and I’m wondering why you stay in this relationship when you know it’s now toxic and unhealthy for everyone involved. It seems like you really should find a way to separate yourself from these people so you can start trying to heal and seek peace. It might seem scary or lonely being on your own but everyone deserves another chance at being happy again. You don’t deserve to die no matter what happens or has happened in the past. Forgive yourself and take care of yourself because despite what u think of yourself because what you’ve done in the past, everyone is capable of changing and becoming a better person and if you believe and remember that then you’ll always have a reason to not give up on yourself so easily. I’m gonna say it again, you don’t deserve to die and please don’t hurt yourself anymore. Yeah?	jhgfdsarrr	reply	na	na	na	0.9970186948776245	weak	no	no	na	SuicideWatch	no prediction.

"I have never wanted to die more than in these past two years when I developed fibromyalgia. It is an unknown condition that causes pain due to emotional trauma. It's so fucking stupid. There's no research, no cure, no pill, nothing. The pain is horrific. Every position hurts: sitting, standing, lying down, walking. I'm tired and all I can think about is the pain. Doctors will not treat me, because the DEA has told the medical industry to stop prescribing them, thanks to drug addicts ruining everything for pain patients. Doctors want to give me epidurals, which cause more pain and are banned in Europe, or to go to a physical therapist. They will not give me any care. Now, I'm forced to live like this for god knows how long? Maybe when my parents die, I'll finally have the courage to end it. There will not be a cure for fibro in my lifetime. In fact, no one will ever cure anything, because 'treating' makes more money than 'curing'. All anyone cares about is money.

I wish fibro was a terminal illness so that I didn't have to suffer in this horrible fat and ugly meat sack anymore. I wish for my grim reaper would come and take me away from this hell. If God exists, I'm killing him and taking his job. If reincarnation exists, then I never want to come back as a human. If nothing exists, then that's alright, too.

"Hi
I’m 17, autistic, and I had an awful childhood. Don’t wanna bore you, but the gist is I was excluded, bullied and neglected by a broke family and exposed to a lot of trauma at an early age.

Therapy is going pretty shitty because I’ve only been able to get a short session every 2 weeks and it is the least helpful thing I’ve ever gone to (very unprofessional but sadly it’s all I’ve got).

Recently I’ve been having really concerning thoughts about injuring myself to the point of hospitalisation.

Obvious TW for what’s coming up.

Every time I see a knife or scissors I have an overwhelming urge to stab myself. When I see a car I want to jump in front of it. Early I spent 30 minutes unable to stop thinking about how I’d hospitalise myself- whether it’s severing a finger or breaking my arm.

These thoughts are scaring me. What scared me more is the fact that when I have them I’m not scared- if anything the opposite. I feel comforted at the idea of being injured.

Is this a cry for help? I feel like I want to ‘show’ people what I’ve gone through and prove that my pain is real. Earlier on I stabbed a pin through my leg and it felt ‘good’?

I don’t even have many friends I can go to.

"I wouldn't put so much pressure on yourself to be a success at such a young age. It's absolutely normal and valid to feel this, because your life thus far has been all you've known and when something is everything you've known, it really is *everything*. I'm sorry you are having to feel this. Just know that there's a hell of a lot more life and opportunity around the corner. You don't have to be an instant triumph right out of college, a year after or even a decade after. 

In a world where you only have to flip through an app to see someone bragging about how they were rich by x age, I get why you'd have the impression that you have to be doing something important. It's very easy to believe that and to feel the way that you do. But you aren't in the minority, friend. You are in the vast majority. Most people need time to really figure out what they want to do, to find a focus, to discover what they enjoy and what they're capable of - who they even are. 23 is no age to be questioning if you have enough to show. Hell, Bob Ross didn't even become a painter until he was 41. JK Rowling didn't write a book 'til she was 32. No one knew who Morgan Freeman was until he was 50. The guy who started McDonalds was 52. You get the idea. You have a long time to be ""someone"" and every single day that comes is a new opportunity to wake up and do that - but you absolutely don't have to. There is no rush. If you can try to discount the pressure of other people, hopefully you will feel satisfied with taking things at your own pace. It doesn't do to fret about  anyone else's view. You are your own person and this is your life and it should be taken at whatever speed you feel most comfortable with. Nobody knows what tomorrow will bring, but when the right opportunity comes for you, you will notice it and you'll know. It certainly does not have to be when you're 23, which is really an age when you should be relaxing and not taking anything too seriously.

Please, take it easy. Don't pressure yourself. Don't rush. This is a burden that you don't need to bear. You can pick up any achievement any day, and when you are prepared and ready, you will."	240kcbro	reply	na	na	na	0.9994232654571533	strong	no	no	na	SuicideWatch	no prediction.

I will wait until everyone falls asleep and then sneak out of the house and walk a few minutes from my house and do it.

"Hey,

You're in a desperate situation right now. A place where anyone would be tormented and stressed out.
Work related anxiety is a real bitch, we are conditioned to put ourselves through all sorts of shit just to maintain a career, or even just hold down a job.

It can get overwhelming really quickly, please try to stay as balanced as you can right now. You sound like the pressure is building too much, like a breaking point is coming and you can feel it.
I know it doesn't feel like it right now but you're already doing the right thing.
You've identified a problem, which as anyone will tell you is the first step.

Having a loved one who committed suicide is hard, really hard to grieve for and move on. The endless questions afterwards etc. It also ""highlights"" (bad word choice) the act itself and it might be subconscious but it sets a precedent - ""if such and such can do it, then I can as well""

You are not finished, not by a long shot. You're tired, you're down but not out. Not yet.

Our own minds can't be trusted sometimes, this is one of those times. When you can't see clearly, you can't expect to find the right answers.

I wish I had a nice satisfactory answer that fixed it all. You're not on your own, not even close. Stick around yeah? I need you if no one else does.

"I’ve been suffering since my early teens. when I was 13, I told myself I’d be dead by 18. when I was 18, I told myself I’d be dead by 21. at 21, I told myself there’s no way in hell I’m making it past 25. I refuse to turn 30 and still be depressed and suicidal. well, this year I’m turning 26. that’s such an odd number to type out as I don’t think I’ve ever “felt my age.” hell, I still play a lego game I played since I was 16 and enjoy it more than any AAA game.

I’m experiencing conflicting feelings. I’m very much exhausted of life and not sure I see any  productive future for myself. the one hope I hold onto is my partner, but I feel like I’d be doing them a favor killing myself at this point. it’s not that I don’t have any aspirations or dreams, but they just feel so very far out of reach. on top of that, how does one with a million interests just pick one thing and run with it? how do people like me keep going? as each day passes, I become more and more confused.

"My birthday is also coming up this week and funny enough i also used to think similarly. At my lowest, i really didnt think id make it past 23 (such a weird number i know), but somehow im making it to 28 soon.

Honestly, its okay to enjoy all of the ""childish"" things you enjoyed as a child/teen even as an adult, as long as its not harming you or anyone else. 

Among your interests, are there any in particular that you find exciting or simply enjoy for itself? Heck it could be something you just find easy to do. Or maybe something your partner can do with you? Not all people actually start ""running with it"" per se, a lot of people myself included start out just by dipping toes in the water, doing a trial run for a few days to even months. It's okay to change your mind after and try something new.

Life is hella confusing not gonna lie. Its hard to figure out what one is ""meant to be"". Some people seem to have been born with instructions and maps, while others dont and stay kind of lost and floating. If you feel like the latter, it may comfort you to know that you're not alone. Maybe ask people you know for advice, and if you cant relate to any of that, you can try people outside of your own circle.

It might be hard or scary or tiring to try new things when you're not sure there is a point or whether you have a lifeline or safety cushion to land on after, but try to find support and sometimes you just have to ""stand up"" to realize the pond isnt so deep after all.

"hello, fellow Leo! 👋
I appreciate this comment a lot and it’s had me thinking quite a bit since I read it (read it hours ago, replying now).

the things I like to do require resources I don’t/no longer have or take a lot more effort than I think I have. some days I’ll be fueled up and ready to start on a new thing and then the next… well maybe I’ll stay in bed all day and cry. I unfortunately get discouraged pretty quickly as well if it’s something I know I’m good at or used to be. if I’m not making something big out of my efforts, then am I really trying at all? do I even *want* to do this if I’m not succeeding? things like that pop up in my mind when I work on these things. I haven’t found a working way to let go of that mindset yet. maybe I just need a military instructor to yell at me all day LOL.

I have a very small support system, maybe 1-2 people. because of a huge fall out with a friend, I’ve been pretty lost and very hesitant to meet/talk to new people. I’ve had opportunities, but I’d get scared and shut them out. I’m trying to work on that though as it’s pretty lonely.

"I come from a hard place. It sure as hell doesn't compare to the stories of other people here, but I definitely had my own reasons to contemplate suicide in the past. At some point in my childhood some stones were dropped in a pond, and only now am I starting to feel the ripples.

Don't get me wrong, I love my parents now, but I did take my fair share of beatings in the past from my dad and had a helicopter parent mom. I feel like the constant lack of freedom and the permanent overshadowing overprotectiveness of my mom left me with pretty severe attachment issues, which are the core of my issues right now.

From about 2017 to early 2022 I had an array of issues that left me depressed, and at times suicidal. An abusive girlfriend from that time coerced me to attempt suicide too. In this period I battled unemployment, an abusive partner, alcoholism, weed addiction, and depression which in turn made me neglect my health and the hygiene of my surroundings. I slept on a bare matress on the floor in a sea of junkfood bags and empty beer cans. On top of that I had bad agoraphobia, so I never left the house and was completely isolated from my friends.

Near the end of this period I started picking up my life and improving it one by one. I kicked all my bad habits, I kept an immaculate living space, studied my hobbies in order to gain employment from it which was a risky time investment, and got back outside.

Which brings me to the now. I am a succesful cybersecurity engineer because I studied network engineering and system administration in my (plentiful) free time. They pay me very well, gave me an amazing car, and a card for unlimited free gas, including for personal use. I get to come and go as I like, I am well respected there, and I contribute a lot to society with the project I am on.

I do still drink, but I do so rarely. I think I haven't been drunk in months.

I started hitting the gym every day, and in 4 months I lost 50lbs/22.5kg. I now weigh 248lbs at 20% body fat, and it feels so much more freeing than lugging around all that fat.

My social life is also picking up a lot again, as I have plans to see people almost every day now.

I am also very succesful with women, which is also a big boost in confidence on top of the confidence boost I got from being in shape.

Besides that, I also get paid for other hobbies I have. I have a lot of hobbies including DJing and photography, and I got booked for Amsterdam Dance Event as a gig, and I take studio quality photos of jewelry for auctions. Seeing my hobbies paying off feels like I truly am good at the things I do, which is very rewarding.

Furthermore I live on my own in a decently big appartment in Amsterdam with mortgage almost paid off.

So in summary, I truly shouldn't have anything to be upset about, except there are still some thorns in my life.

A while ago I met my dream woman, an absolutely gorgeous admirable girl I had been online friends with for years. We ended up dating for half a year before she broke up with me over my attachment issues. That's all very fair, and I wish her the absolute best in life. We're still very good friends and talk every day, but she has a pretty cold personality at times. I got no clue if she'd actually care when I'm dead, but I hope she won't. I truly don't want to hurt her.

I was already suicidal before I met her, but she just temporarily saved me from it. That's very unfair to her, saving someone isn't a burden for anyone to carry. 

Her absence from my life is not the reason I am killing myself, but it's part of the reason I no longer see the need to keep going and fix myself.

I am starting to get scared she catches on I'm suicidal. She knows I'm depressed, but I try not to let it get in the way of our friendship. She really wanted me to get help, so I did.

During my third psycholigist appointment I asked what the rules were regarding communicating about suicide, to which she explained that only if I have a set date in mind she would concider me a danger to myself.

So I just told her about the fact that I have everything in place, a written will, goodbye letters to all people whom I think may care, and an x-acto blade to open my arteries with.

After I relayed this information she got almost irate and threatened to inform authorities. This transpired in a big argument, after which I just got up and left. When I had my back turned to her she told me that if I ever step foot in her office again, she'd inform the authorities.

Now I am scared to get any help and still haven't gone to a different psychologist. My ex is mad at me, which is very hurtful to me. She's mad that I left my previous psychologist (all I told her is that I left because she was incompetent) and haven't found a new one yet. Our contact this week has been very sporadic, because of this I think.

So long story short, I truly shouldn't have any reason to be sad except for some simple heart break, yet I am still suicidal and I don't know why, but I can't find out why because I am scared to get help, and the person I care most about in the whole world is mad at me because I'm not looking for help and I can't tell her why.

More often I suddenly get the impulse to just get it done in the heat of the moment, but I hope to atleast stay around for my 24th birthday to have (almost) everyone I care about in one place for good memories.

Anyways I hope this is a safe space to vent, thanks for listening."	Yungsleepboat	post	19.25349668344663	male	White	0.001350641017779708	na	na	na	0	SuicideWatch	no prediction.

Growing up is very scary in theory and very chill in practice.

What does ""growing up"" mean to you? For me, personally, the only real difference for me in the past ten years is I've gotten better at being calm and happier. A little less partying (I wish I had more!) and a little more chilling inside (not bad either!)

"Hi. I'm 39f here. There is no secret. I'm in the same boat too. I feel like I'm hanging on by a very thin thread, trying to make ends meet. There's no gratification. No reward. Just work and stress. I'm in a state of guilt constantly by the choices I've made for myself in my past that affect me today. I've been stupid for the majority of my life and now that I'm dealing with the consequences, I feel like I could just die. It took me 39 years to realize how stupid I was. I'll have to live with myself for the rest of my life. I've made a lot of mistakes that hold me back mentally and I wish to God I could get a second chance. 

I'm too scared to kms. Plus, lots of things are riding on me when it comes to other people. Like my boyfriend, my mom, etc. If I check out early, I will hurt them too much. And..I don't want to die either. . :(  but I feel like I'm tired of living. Watching other people live their best life, while I'm slowly losing myself each day. Struggling with everything. I'm hiding it all the time. My boyfriend is the only one who knows my feelings, but he's ""not there"" due to his medication.

I hate this world. I hate my life. I hate people sometimes; the people that I work with that insult me every day. I'm hurt, stressed, overworked, tired, lonely, scared, bored with life, etc. etc. etc. I have to try to find it within myself to go on. What choice do we have, right?"

For the past few years I’ve struggled with self h and I’ve hid it under my sock and sleeves. I deserve it. I’m a bipolar sociopath who has never shown anyone my personal side before, and has been constantly changing personalities since I was 10 so much I’ve almost lost contact with the real me because I sickly enjoy experimenting with emotions. Today was the day I’ve had real fun before. I was living my life for the first time without having to worry about the past or future when I was stomping around with my first real friend while blasting anime music. However, as soon as I got home, I was exposed to the real world again. Abusive self cantered narcissistic mum was yelling her throat out at me first chance I got and throwing chairs and lamps and books at me and dragging me down the stairs by the ear. She never really did anything for me because she has no idea of my mental conditions as well as my ocd eating disorders body dysmorphia and trichotilomania. I’ve tried communicating to her about it before but she just used that as another excuse to abuse me again. I honestly feel like there’s no hope left. The moment I finally have true, pure, wholesome fun after ~7 years, she has to disturb it. Heh. I wish this could just end. But I still want to watch anime with my friend.

You need to surround yourself with positive people. More people like your new friend. Do what you can if you can to leave. If not, be honest about the way you feel by sitting down and having that conversation. I’ve greatly improved with self care. Therapy, yoga, home workout, work life, psychiatrist to find out I have ADHD, anxiety, etc. Now I’m finding ways to live with the way I am.

Yes, don't lose hope. The thought of finding a job gives me panic attacks. The rejection gets the better of me. We all have to start somewhere. Have you considered a temp agency? Perhaps you could do Door dash or some third party food delivery service to help you, that is, if you have transportation. I used to have to donate plasma to pay my rent. I filed for unemployment before and got benefits for a year before the job I had that cut my hours screwed me. They said I voluntarily quit which was a lie. Now I'm currently paying back a year's worth of unemployment benefits because of their words. They garnish my state taxes to do it, so I don't have a choice in the matter. I work fast food but currently looking for other opportunities. Most fast food places will hire anybody. Like at my job. My bitch manager hired too many people, now my hours are cut because of it.

"Honestly, I'm just hoping to not wake up sometimes when I go to bed. Everyday is a constant battle with my dumb thoughts. I'm really not doing good whatsoever, especially with recent events. Broke up with my girlfriend of almost 4 years around 2 weeks ago, senior year of school has started for me, and the amount of dogs in my home are just driving me to the brink.


I genuinely feel like I have no one, especially when it's late at night. I really dont want to keep living like this, my parents argue a lot sometimes and then my mom orders me around like a servant sometimes to do chores. I haven't struggled like this ever since 2020 during quarantine. I genuinely don't know if I'll have the strength to get up tomorrow, there's just too much happening.

I know how you feel every day is different and it is a never ending battle. I was abused when I was a kid by my dad, been struggling to accept who I am ever since. Its even harder in a world filled with hate, evil and suffering. It drives me crazy thinking i have to livr through this shit for couple more decades. The worst parts of this “depression” is the continuous feeling of being alone and feeling lonely. I can only feel comfort in ideas that comfirms my feelings of despair. Thats the only way i can relate with my own emotions, idk if it makes sense. I try everyday to keep going, to be the best person I can be but i feel it will never be good enough for someone especially myself. I just don’t feel worthy to live. When i was younger I could escape in my own fantasies to a place where I felt I’d belong, dreams that helped me escaped are just pushing me more and more in this pit of despair and suffering. And even if someones there and reaches out to help me, idk if i’d let them. Life is full of despair and tragedy, full of hate and sorrow, full of regret and dreams that died.

"That's very tough on you and her loved ones. Saying that you couldn't save her suggests that you might have some guilt, which is not a negative thing. Guilt is only experienced by good people with a sense of self improvement, people who wish for better things for others and often try for them. It is though, an awful thing to feel and deal with especially when combined with the loss of someone you care about. I hope that you are able to process this and that you grow to understand that whatever happened here, it's not your job to save a life. As much as you feel that you want to, and it is perfectly natural to really, really, REALLY want to - it's ultimately a persons individual choice what they do and nothing you can try will change that if they have made up their mind. 

What happened to your friend is tragic, but it does not in any way make you a lesser person. I can't think of anything more normal than feeling the way that you do in this scenario, but you don't have to feel this way forever and in all likeliness, if you can get through the nightmare of right now, you won't. You're not pointless, and you don't make things harder for others. Even if you did, it's not like it's a permanent affliction. We are all works in progress and we all mess up sometimes. If I had a penny for every day I've felt that I make things worse for others, I'd be at Bill Gate's level right now. I think we all feel like that, very often. Only a narcissist wouldn't. If you think of yourself as perfect then you have real problems. The way you're talking, you come across as a perfectly reasonable well-intentioned person who is just going through a hard time. A person who wants to be good and who wants to do well and who wants to be there for others. A person who deserves a chance to live, to grow, to experience and to evolve in to exactly that. There is plenty of time for it, if you can just get through what's happening right now. I hope you do. I really do."

"Every day is like my personal hell,
Wishing I could be somewhere else.
To have these whirling and churning thoughts,
Please make the voices in my head stopped.
I can't run away from all my mistakes,
Nowhere to feel at home or ever safe.
Nobody would even  notice if I was replaced.
I feel like all I do is whine and cry,
About the pain and wanting to die.
So tired of being told it's all a phase,
Stop acting dramatic and half-crazed.
You aren't worth trying to save.
Why does the pain always come in the dark,
To remind me of my bruised and battered heart?
Screaming on the inside for hope and affection,
But the darkness overwhelms every direction.
If they put my coffin in the ground,
Would anyone bother to stick around?
Is the pain and numb something I can defeat?
So that one day I don't have to retreat?
Is it possible to find my butterfly sky?

"I’m giving myself until the end of the summer for things to turn around. I’ve been experiencing my first heartbreak the last several months that has had me unable to recognize myself. I lost my job that I’ve loved for two years in the midst of it all. I almost got arrested. I’ve been told I will be arrested if I keep attempting contact with him. Friends are scared and pulling away from me. I’m tired of putting this burden on my family. After being diagnosed borderline last month I am now stepping off my meds from SSRI to change to a mood stabilizer while I’m trying to get into dbt therapy. I‘ve thought about death since I was 8 years old, and the thought always comforted me instead of scare me.

I’m trying to do what I can to improve, I’m reaching out for help. But I feel like I’ve been treading water for 21 years and I’m so so exhausted. No more energy to clean myself or feed myself. Socializing feels like a performance or chore, so I’ve self isolated more than ever the last three months. Only 21 and it feels like I’ve been living for so long because I can’t bare being the cause of pain to my loved ones by ending it. Living for others has felt like no way to live. But now I’ve realized that I am a constant cause of pain as long as I am here. I just cause pain and hurt to myself and those around me. I do far more damage taking up the space than i would giving myself the release. I want to put myself first finally, and give myself the peace I crave so violently. 

So I’m giving life one more month to prove that it’s worth sticking around and fighting for. For it to not feel like this diagnosis is my death sentence. If things don’t turn around by then, I’ve got some things organized like who I want to take my cat and belongings… that sort of thing.

I just wanted to acknowledge your post. I am in no way qualified to help with something of this level and I doubt that many people here are, but there are certainly those who will read this and feel for you. I hope that you can stay strong and get through the worst of these feelings as you have doubtless done in the past. The hard times are strenuous at the best of times, yours sound terrible. It's so difficult to know sometimes whether you're marching forwards in to a mirage or whether there really is something good around the corner. A string of mirages can mess with your head and lead to a complete loss of faith. That you are still here through what you have described is testament to your strength. I admire your persistence through what must be so frustrating. However exhausted you may feel sometimes, you have proven yourself to be a tough cookie. The law of averages must be slowly leaning in your favour the longer you stick with us. I can't tell you that you have to keep it up, but it's my hope that you will.

This past school year I (f15) was on the verge of committing suicide but my mom saved my life. (Sort of) I’ve been severely depressed on and off since November. One morning my mom woke me up for school yelling at me for not wanting to go and scolding me for failing my classes and I was just genuinely so exhausted I couldn’t bring myself to care, so I did get up. Not so that I could go to school and learn, but so I could walk to the overpass by my school and jump. I was sobbing while getting dressed and gathering my things to make it look like I was going to school thinking to myself “just walk to the overpass, if you can’t bring yourself to jump, go to the police station and tell them your plan.” but my mom saw me in shambles. She asked me why I was crying so I told her it was because I was failing my classes, that was obviously a lie because I couldn’t care less about my grades, why would I care? I was about to die anyways. But she knew I didn’t want to walk to school while crying so she gave me a ride. I had no choice but to go to school. When I got to school I walked right past my class and ran to the bathroom. I collected myself and went to class, my teacher obviously noticed I had been crying all morning so she sent me to the guidance councillor. We talked for a bit and sort of worked through things but I’m still not sure I want to live. I still have times where I feel stuck in my life and i feel like there’s no way out other than suicide. I’m not sure what’s wrong with me but I want to get better.	HouseFast2093	post	10.162389516711023	female	White	0.991105854511261	na	na	na	1	SuicideWatch	no prediction.
it’s like reading the thoughts of my own self at 15, tomorrow will mark 6 years since then. i want to say that wanting to get better and committing to that is all you need in order to do so. at 15, i was growing up in a dirt-poor balkan country and didn’t have the money to afford what limited resources there were to help me, so i’ve just started now that i’m in the states. start with therapy definitely, and talk everything out with a pro to figure out what’s really wrong. find out what the next steps are, psychiatrists may prescribe meds etc. because this sounds like depression for sure. see what your family’s health insurance covers, too. that has been the process for me and it is a healing process indeed. life has soo much potential, i hope you can pursue the problem early on and exterminate it!

I feel like a liar, a misunderstood person who won't ever be given a second chance because i've wasted every chance they got, a manipulator, a bad person in general. I just wish I was happy again. I haven't smiled in weeks and I haven't enjoyed a singular thing in my current days. It's pretty much about to end soon, I am open to any suggestions on why I shouldn't do so.

"Hi! So I’m unsure what feelings you’re exactly experiencing but I went through the same thing. In my case ~10 yrs ago, it was unmanaged anxiety which evolved into depression. I started taking Xanax which helped almost immediately with quieting the suicidal thoughts. 

A few years later to the present, suicidal thoughts again, started Xanax and Wellbutrin and while I’m still not great, I haven’t killed myself yet so that’s a win. 
I don’t know what your experience is with meds and if you’ve tried them. How I saw it was that if i was already suicidal, what was the worst that could happen? Im glad I got help and my only regret is that I didn’t reach out earlier.

"Depression, that leads to suicidal thoughts, can occurr without having problems in life. Like by a chemical inbalance in the brain, the lack of certain neurotransmitters like serotonin.

I'd recommend to go to therapy and maybe try meds. Like if you have a lack of serotonin and you'd get a SSRI antidepressiva like escitaprolam, it could solve the problem. Seriously, it could be that with raising the amount of serotonin, the depression disappears."	Substantial_Joke_416	reply	na	na	na	0.9958325028419495	no	strong	no	na	SuicideWatch	no prediction.
"Being told I'm just ""okay"" looking. Being told I'm not pretty. A guy telling me he wants me instead of the girl he was set up with because she's too pretty for him but I'm not. Never having a boyfriend at 23. And probably a bunch of other shit said behind my back that I dont know about. 

I fucking hate myself. Even if im feeling confident about how I look, someone always has to come along and ruin it. Always. I'm never going to be pretty. I'll never find a boyfriend that loves me or finds me attractive. I'll always be the last choice. I'll either get cheated on or told I'm not pretty by a potential partner. I hear stories of people having partners but their partners not finding them physically attractive and only staying with them for their personalities. That will 100% happen to me. I dont know what's so ugly about me either other than my chin. I wish I was pretty. But I'll always be the ugly girl. I'll always be the one men don't like. 

I always get told that people can't imagine me with a dress on. Or makeup. Or anything pretty. That they didn't expect me to look nice if I go somewhere. 

I want to fucking kill myself so bad. I hate being cured with this face. This is all I've been told. Never that im pretty or good enough. I've only been told the opposite."	earthaddict	post	18.33564650935644	female	White	0.9993060827255249	na	na	na	6	SuicideWatch	failed
"This is pretty long, sorry! Lol

Being pretty isn't everything, honey. Take it from me, I'm a 39 female that's struggled with self esteem issues that got the better part of me all my life, until I'm at the age I am now. And I can honestly say, it was a wasted thought process looking back. I regret so much that I didn't focus on other things with my life (like school, work, hobbies, etc.) that could help me today, instead, I was being stupid and craved attention. (That's just me personally.)

I worried too much about what other people thought of me. My looks, everything, etc. Nevermind the fact I was picked on and bullied as a kid. I always had it in my head, that I was ugly. Even for a girl. Therefore, I was going to grow up to be an ugly woman. Never thought I'd find someone in my life to love or to love me. I focused entirely too much on my social life in my youth. If I was looking for love, I let it come to me. If someone was interested in me, I waited until I could find the good in them to proceed on. That's where I ended up having a fair amount of ex boyfriends along the way that didn't mean shit (excuse my French). But, ultimately, found the most wonderful guy. I found him at 18. He saw the special in me, and the potential for love. Took some time getting there, but we got there. I wasn't attracted to him at first. I thought he was not so ""good looking"" lol (aint that the pot calling the kettle lol) We were good friends though. He thought I was cute, but I had low esteem and thought he'd just break my heart like all the others. I was the girl that men overlooked, per say. 

 All his ex girlfriends or women that basically used him for sex, never gave him the chance I did. We were friends, but then as we bonded as friends, we fell in love. I got to see the beauty in him. I became attracted to him and the thing I loved most about him: Was his heart. He's such a wonderful man with a heart of gold. You'd look at him back in the day and he seemed like someone that people could use and throw away like he's nothing. People did that, even his family. The both of us are proof, you don't have to have model looks to find someone to love. I gave him a chance just as he's given me a chance. And we're going strong 20 years later. Been together since 2003. I love that about us. 

To some degree, we ALL worry about our looks. It's a staple in our minds naturally when trying to find a mate that looks can help a great deal. But what others think of you, have no barring on what somebody else may think of you... One that'll truly be THE ONE for you. The right person hasn't come along yet. It takes time. There's that saying: ""There's somebody for everybody."" Maybe they're out there and you just ain't found them yet. Nowadays people are so busy trying to ""look cool""  and ""act cool"". It's hard to find genuine people. But I promise you, they're out there. If they're serious enough, they will be with you for YOU. Not just your looks. And don't worry about what some dumbass guys say behind your back or whatever. If they think you're not good enough for them, then leave them be. Not worth your time. They did you a favor, girl. Honestly the most helpful advice I can give that I would give my younger self is:

 Be yourself. Be polite and respectful of all people at all times. If people don't like you, don't mess with them. If they do like you, cherish them. But have some confidence that you are beautiful to someone out there even if you don't think you are. Know that you are beautiful regardless of what others think. Maybe you're not the one for them but it doesn't mean you're not the one for somebody else. Be genuine. Be funny. Have a sense of humor and laugh a lot. Smile often. People love funny people. And if you look in the mirror and don't like what you see, do whatever you want to help you feel good about yourself. Or do nothing. The choice is yours and yours only. Only do what makes YOU comfortable. Wear that dress if you want, put some makeup on for fun, do your hair really pretty, etc. Let the guys come to you, don't ever chase them. Let yourself be noticed. Confidence goes a long way. Confidence shows. Your self esteem will build over time. 

And if all of that doesn't help, learn to love yourself and be okay with it. You're the only one who will have your back when no one else does. Only you could know what you want. Try new things. Do you have girlfriends? It could help to have the support of other women. A true friend will help you in your journey to find a boyfriend if you need one. Go clubbing! I used to love clubs back in the day.  Dancing builds confidence. Especially if you like music. Or try something else, like church perhaps as my mom always used to say lol. There's men everywhere. The key is to go whenever they are and present yourself to them. If you don't try, you'll never find the one for you. Maybe start with getting to know more people. Make new friends. The more people you know, the more chances you'll have to finding someone. Good luck to you, honestly. I know it's hard. But seriously, focus on what you need to do and want to do. Let nature take it's course. No need to rush.

I'm rooting for you girl!

Judging by that part of a photo visible on your profile...you're not ugly. But I know what it feels like to hear that and not believe it. I just either accept or divert all convos about looks because Ive found there's no point in focusing on it even after learning and practicing all the self care stuff for more than a year (healthy eating, fitness, proper skin care and haircuts). None of that changed self perception nor my own feeling that I'm not wanted and as repulsive if I did none of those things.

"Hi. 

I'm M24.

I no longer have any interest in anything. I'm no longer interested in seeing my friends. I'm no longer interested in my relationship. I'm no longer interested in getting an education. I'm no longer interested in advancing my career. I'm no longer interested in seeking professional medical help. I'm no longer interested in life. 

I. Just. Want. To. Die.

I see no reason to prolong this meaningless, useless life of mine. Everyone would be better off if I was just gone. I fantasise about dying on a daily basis and I no longer feel guilt about it.

I don't know how to help because I'm still experiencing it. Just wanted you to know that feeling  causes suicidal thoughts, as anybody would if they were suddenly robbed of joy.

"This sounds like clinical depression. I suffered from that for years until I learned what causes it.

There are three causes of depression: 1) spiritual (for example,because of immoral decisions one might have made and a sense of guilt) 2) psychological (example: abused or traumatized in the past) and 3) physical (bad diet, lack of exercise, too much stress, not enough sleep, etc.)

I suggest considering these three possibilities. After I began to get my spiritual house in order years ago and to get away from abusive people, what was left was the physical. I learned to exercise regularly and to eliminate unhealthy food from my diet. That did immense good for me. I had energy and a sense of purpose, which I lost in my mid-30s in part because of lack of exercise."	LovingIsLiving2	reply	na	na	na	0.999284565448761	no	strong	no	na	SuicideWatch	no prediction.

"Ok great, so you can begin to address those things. If you have done wrong to others (or to yourself), admit it to God, ask for forgiveness, and make reparations with those you have harmed. Usually, the most important thing is to say you are sorry and mean it, and firmly resolve never to do it again. Also, we have to learn to be patient with the faults of others and to forgive them, just as we would like to be forgiven. By the way, all of the major world religions agree that if we are truly repentant, God forgives us, no matter what we have done. 

Remember also that everyone has made mistakes in life and we all have things we are ashamed of and regret.  I know I have! I've found that the biggest spiritual obstacle to happiness in life is not that we make mistakes, but it is the failure to acknowledge our errors and to resolve to change. What stops that from happening is what is called ""false pride"". It sounds like you don't have false pride and you recognize your mistakes, so you are in a great position to make amends, correct your errors, forgive others, and so on, and that's crucial for a happy and successful life."

"There is nobody that can make this right besides myself. I could go on screaming into a void for the rest of my life and it wouldn’t make a difference. I could beg to be saved and it wouldn’t make a difference. It makes it worse that nothing can save me anymore. There is no amount of love, attention, forgiveness, or rest that can save me at this point. Even though I no longer hate myself I am still at odds with the world.

 I do not understand a meaningless existence like my own. Consciousness is not a blessing. Maybe others force life onto me because they don’t want to suffer alone. It’s understandably human. I don’t know why I feel sick when I remember that I’m human. I have tried so hard to be normal. I talk to myself in the mirror and say “I am normal. I am just like everybody else”.

"I'm desperate to die but I can't. I want to, I'm ready for it to end. When I was last hospitalized for my disease I almost died a few times from an allergic reaction to the meds they were giving me and I didn't fight to live. I wish I didn't call the nurses in. I wish I had let my tongue swell all the way and cut my breathing off. 

But I called them because I was on suicide watch and there was a camera recording in my room. They also had remote access to my heart rate and oxygen levels. It would've been a waste of time not to get it over with, they'd save me and be the heros they know they are.

I wish I wanted to live, to desire to see the next day, to stay alive because who else will pet my dogs and wipe their eye boogers away? Who else will snuggle into my husband when he's having a nightmare? Who else will comfort my friends when they're sad?

I dont live for me, I never have, and now im dying but slower than I want. My disease has taken everything from me, my sanity, my sense of reality, my looks, my energy, my favorite foods, my hair.

Now I look exactly how I feel on the inside. There's no more hiding it as I sit bloated from steriods, anemic from treatment, hair missing and falling out like a shedding husky. My eyes have dark circles, I can't convince myself to eat anything anymore, and I'm so dehydrated from crying.

My nightmares torture me every night. I, a grown adult, must sleep with a night light because if I don't I have an episode where I feel like I'm that littler girl being touched by a family member. My memories good and bad haunt me, the person I was in them no longer exist.

My face isn't the same, my thoughts aren't the same, nothing feels real anymore. Everything feels like a game, and surely it must be for how comically awful this life has turned out to be.

Truthfully I never had a chance for a good life. My mother missed her chance for an abortion, changed her mind about adoption, I wasn't allowed friends and I couldn't live at my father's because he'd stop the child support. My family caught my uncle sexually assaulting me and they covered it up and eventually covered up my cousins abuse too.

I didnt get to know my dad's family before half of them died, I lived in my siblings and cousins shadows despite having a wonderful GPA and art portfolio.

I was taken advantage of, drugged, beaten, homeless, faced eviction every month, starved for months, attempted several times and nothing stuck. I really suck at dying. 

And then when things finally started looking up, i began dating and married my best friend, not even a month after us living together we got the news that I am dying. From an illness that I had had my entire life but was medically neglected despite having health insurance.

Since then I've been in the emergency room several times, hospitalized twice in the past 4 months, been on 2 different treatments that both made my hair fall out.

I am ugly. I am swollen. I hurt. I am tired. I imagine how I would go every day. I think of how beautiful the world will be after I pass. My husband could marry a woman who didn't miscarry his babies several times, maybe find one who is healthy and mentally sane. Our dogs could have someone who can play with them, run for hours with them. My family could be happy again knowing the person who wasn't supposed to exist is now finally gone.

I hope there's no funeral. I hope there's no chance for anyone to pretend to wish I was alive. I've been begging for months now for help, for support and the most I get from my friends is ""I get it"". My husband doesn't want me to go he does his best to prove that he loves me and life is worth living. But can't he see he would be better off without all this mess?

I'll continue to live for now, at least until he gets out of the army and has his own home. 3 years is enough time to push through the pain and make sure our dogs would stay with him when I go. This is my parting gift for him, a promise to not do it while he's active duty, so he doesn't have to lose our dogs and home.

And who knows maybe in 3 years time I'll want to live. I wish I didn't have that sliver of hope that so childishly wishes things will get better. But it's me, I do not deserve better.

And for the only person in the world who knows my reddit username don't you dare tell him my plan. I know you'll think it hilarious to make my life worse and I know you hate him, but you love dogs. I know you do, and you couldn't bear the thought of them in a shelter.

hey, you do not need other people to validate wether your problems mean something or not, if you’re feeling bothered by something, then that’s totally valid. your feelings are valid. don’t listen to anyone else, not even that mean voice in your head that’s making all these statements. your feelings are there for a reason, trying to suppress them won’t make them go away, it will only make them all build up and eventually even harder to deal with. listen to what your feelings are trying to tell you, why they’re here. allow yourself to feel what you’re feeling, even if no one else does, it’s you that’s living your life through your eyes so you know exactly what you’re going through. please allow yourself to feel what you feel, it’s okay to be gentle with yourself, you deserve that.	nick2000000	reply	na	na	na	0.9994571805000305	weak	no	no	na	SuicideWatch	no prediction.

"you don’t need to earn the right to have a problem by measuring yours to that of someone else. there is no big or small when it comes to this, if your feelings tell you ‘hey, this is hurting me because…’ then that’s all you need, to know that there is a problem. personally, that’s all i need to hear from you to believe you’re having a problem and there is no correlation between your right to feel what you feel and the extent of a problem someone else on this planet might have. plus this is not a competition on who has the biggest problem and who deserves to call it one. don’t make it out to be one, just to out yourself down, you don’t deserve that. it seems to me that you put quite some thought into other people’s problems, so much that you start to use those to invalidate yourself. again, i don’t think you deserve that and it’s unfair. it really makes me sad to hear that you feel the need to do that, i’m sorry. i know it’s not something we can control, i catch myself doing the same thing too at times. you deserve the same treatment, care and validation from yourself that you seemingly give other people.   

i hope i didn’t overstep a boundary by making assumptions about you. this is what i got from reading your messages and i just wanted to make you understand my viewpoint in a way.

You're right, there's a lot of struggling people in the world and that's a really sad thing, but it doesn't mean your own struggle is insignificant in comparison. Your ex knows you better than me I'm sure, but even they don't know everything and are not an omniscient judge of the universe who can accurately tell you how much your problems are worth. I'm glad that you're even able to acknowledge your problems, because I know I struggled with that for a long time.

I don’t know too much context on what your going through, I will say that people have their own setbacks, trauma and struggle and doesn’t matter if it’s not “significant” enough. Our mind is a big critic especially when it comes to comparing ourselves to others to the point feeling inadequate to relate or be validated for problems can put a dent in self esteem. Even alienation because we couldn’t come to terms with how we feel about things in fear of humiliation. It’s best to just say it if they care, regardless of you think it’s small or not just get it out of your system.	nick2000000	reply	na	na	na	0.9994571805000305	weak	no	no	na	SuicideWatch	no prediction.

it’s not comparing though. it’s about how you say it. if you’re only stating that you’re going through something similar, i would consider that as trying to make the other person feel understood and like you know how they’re feeling and that can be so validating to hear. comparing your problems would sound different, more like ‘that’s nothing, i’ve been feeling this way for longer than you have and it’s worse than your situation, etc’. but i don’t think that’s what you’re doing. plus, if you go to someone and vent to them, you’re doing it with the intention of getting something off your chest, right? not with the intention of comparing your problems. and that intention is not wrong at all, it’s right and it’s okay to do that. it’s okay to think about your feelings sometimes without always putting others first	nick2000000	reply	na	na	na	0.9994571805000305	weak	no	no	na	SuicideWatch	no prediction.

"
so before I started college, life was alright for the most part, lived with parents, got school work done, and had went to the gym a lot.

since going to college, i have been on a downward spiral of hell. I took up smoking nic, got addicted to vapes, became extremely introverted/anxious and started avoided any social interaction other than my roomates. started gaming much more and now i am beyond addicted, no matter how many times i try i always fall back into playing for hours and hours. 
Noticing this cycle was bad, i decided to return home and take classes online because i thought i hadn’t matured enough for college and needed time for myself, and now i feel like i fell even deeper than before, even when i thought i hit rock bottom in college. 

I still hold the same unhealthy addictions, some of which that have intensified, i can’t quit nicotine for the life of me even though i tried more than 20+ times, i’ve been incredibly lazy to find a job, stopped going to the gym which returned me to an average body type (which really hurts the self confidence when i look back at old pictures), and i take any opportunity i get to hop on my computer to game. i have become a full fucking bum. 

also with the self realization that i’m a bum, i’m under pressure by my parents who call me a leech and a loser by living in their house without having a job or doing anything productive during the day.

i’ve tried so many times to break the cycle but it’s impossible for me to find balance no matter what. I’ve gotten to the point where ceasing to exist makes me happier than trying to fix an unfixable routine that has been engrained in my head for over 3 years. I’ve tried to start side projects, hobbies, etc. But it takes months to even get a little progress as all the distractions that i have become addicted to, make these hobbies feel boring and worsen my work ethic. and my sleep schedule has absolutely gone to dogshit, falling asleep at 5am every night and barely getting 5 hours of sleep every night since my parents have to wake me up so i can start the day early.

I’ve tried reading routines and shit to try and improve myself but after a week i always fall back into the same routine.

This has turned me into an angry person, with no happiness to turn to. Every person who has a better life than me makes me turn to envy and hatred. I know that comparison is the killer of joy but I just feel so alone in feeling like this.

So to anyone out there who has gone through the same or knows how to escape this cycle, please tell me, because the pressure i put on myself and the pressure i get from family is becoming too much for me."	sbdunklord	post	11.396236794611942	male	White	0.9989128112792969	na	na	na	0	SuicideWatch	no prediction.

"Besides obviously family, and loved ones

Is my Dungeons and Dragons group. 

I would feel guilty leaving my party behind one member short. I would feel uneasy not finishing the conclusion to the story everyone has worked so hard on. 

But sometimes I worry my guilt of living will outdo the guilt of leaving. Or that when the story comes to a conclusion my own brain will also desire an end to its own. 

I want to end because I’m a coward and all my worst case scenarios have me dying in fear, in pain, or being alone. I guess the reason why the thought of suicide itself seems somewhat comforting is because it’d be the one thing I’d have control over. I control how I go and I can reassure it’d be as painless as I can make it. 

I don’t want to fear anymore. I wish I could be the world changing hero I am in the dungeons. Maybe then I’d be less afraid of the future. Less afraid of dying in fear.

Hi peeps. I gonna start by saying I believe in karma and karma fucking hates me. I'm known amongst my friend to be the most unlucky idiots in everything and that includes relationship, in my opinion. All of my friends got gf or bf . And of course little old me is?... alone! *Ding ding ding 

I'll be honest , I do crave a partner in my life but I think I don't deserve it because life likes to fuck me over and make suffer as long as possible. I'm a 22m and Im bi. So I got pretty much a lot of options. Thing is I'm a tall and relatively creepy looking even tho I take care of myself. 

One of my friend say I need to be in peace with myself before going out with someone. Sadly he's right and I don't have the strength to start the process of ""self confidence"" so I might as well end the game of life at this point. Seems like it's too much to ask for someone to listen to you and for me to listen to them, I'm not even asking for physical love at this point because it WAY too much too ask for. Life is pulling a "" go F yourself!"" And I'll admit defeat.

"that’s okay! i’ll still say what i think amd you can decide if what i’m saying makes any sense or if you don’t care. i don’t believe in karma, i want to say i respect your views but at the same time if your views are putting you down like that i do have something against them, i can’t help it.   

the way i understand karma, it would only be bad karma that’s happening to you if you did something to deserve that. i understand it’s a ‘you get what you deserve’ kind of thing. so let’s say you have a dog and never pick up it’s shit when you go for a walk. your karma would maybe make you step on a fat pile of shit while you’re wearing your new shoes (something like that). i’d say you deserve it, not necessarily as a punishment but as a lesson, that your actions have consequences in other peoples lives and so you get a taste of that. it doesn’t have to be a bad thing though, sometimes we only realize our mistakes with the help of someone else’s words or something that happens to us.   
  
being a human and making mistakes is not bad though. we’re all here on this planet for the first time and we’re all trying to figure out how to live for the first time. so naturally we won’t know everything and we will make mistakes and that is so okay. i think if you take every bad thing that happens to you and look at it as a punishment, there is something else going on with you that you need to adress. maybe the way you view yourself to believe that you’re being punished, and maybe even accepting that that’s what you deserve. tell me if i’m wrong, this is how i percieve you based on what i know this far.   

you don’t have to agree with what i say, but i like to think my words deserve to at least make you think about them. seeing as you can accept when that voice in your head is trying to put you down like that, it’s only fair that my voice also deserves to be heard. it’s not about who i am and how much i matter to you, more about what i’m trying to tell you."	oyster_whatever	reply	na	na	na	0.998336911201477	weak	no	no	na	SuicideWatch	no prediction.

I risked losing him so I wouldn’t hurt his feelings. I care about him so much. I js want to make him proud and happy. 

I’m tired of being left. I screw everything up. I think everyone who’s left me and people who haven’t yet would be better off with me dead. Bray would be happier. Wey would be happier. My mom would be happier. Noel would be happier. Kenna would be happier. Everyone would be happier. I js wanna make people happier.

As a fellow short person (I'm 5'1) who suffers from almost the exact same issues, all I want to tell you is that you can't make people happy if you're dead. If anything, killing yourself or ruining your life would only make it worse for others as well. Do your best to keep moving on, isolate your issues and try rectifying them instead of simply obsessing over them and improvement will follow.

"Man…..I’m sitting here at the bar I that I recently started to manage…. This was supposed to me an exciting step, a new change for a brighter future.  Every single day is work ya know? My job has crept into every aspect of my life. 

My girlfriend hates my job, I just got it in January and we moved in together in February. Having to be on call for work has made me realize how “on call” I am for everything. She can’t accept the fact that I have to help out this restaurant with any problems they have on any given day. And I can’t accept the fact she has an extra set of expectations of me that I’m always failing. 

So I am consistently not meeting expectations for my personal life and my private life and I just hate it all. IT ALL FEELS LIKE WORK. 

I need help. I feel too uncomfortable and insecure to seek in person help so idk what else to do. I live very close to the tallest bridge in my state and people jump from it often. I just want to be another number for that jump list. I want my family to grieve my death for a couple days then just please forget about me. 

Secretly waiting for my parents to pass away, the I feel like I can actually kill myself without causing too much trauma for them. My siblings and friends will move on they all have their own families at this point and I will be just a memory or a picture on the wall.

"Hey,

It feels like work because you're working.

You put yourself under pressure to succeed, that's ok it's how people become successful at anything.

Its the not switching off part, you are unable to relinquish that pressure when permitted. There's a whole ton of reasons why that might be the case, but for sure the end result is anxiety, lots of it.

Your perception is changing, again, that's ok. You're just growing and changing as a person. This can make us re-evaluate things or see things in a new light, not always for the better.
You're aware enough to notice that it's not right and not what you want. That's only possible with intelligence and a will to improve, not an opinion, that's just a fact. 

Combine this will to improve (it can be subconscious, belive me!) but if you didn't possess it, you wouldn't feel how you do. 
Listen to your ""heart"" your ""inner voice"" or the whatever you want to call it, it's telling you something is wrong. Now utilise that intelligence and let's figure out how to move in a different direction. 

I totally understand what you said, ""tired of every day being work"" that would ruin anyone. 
Do you have any support? You mentioned parents but they can sometimes be the opposite! 

Is there a safe person you can talk to? It can help a lot, even if it's just to bounce sone ideas off or talk about something that's bugging you.

"Bro! I'm so glad you said that!

I am a *huge* fan of medication, not because it's such a big deal, but because it's a small one. For me, it's like wearing a sweater in the freezing cold: it doesn't solve everything, but it helps everything.

If you were both on medication, it would be one of the most normal things in the world. Like if you were both wearing glasses.

For me, the thinking is: medication can help, and you've seen it help a person you love. If anything, it might be *easier* to try medication with an understanding and supportive partner.

Also, remember: you can have a small, careful dose if you want! Go slow and steady so you can try with confidence and, holy shit, what if it kind of helps?

""Kind of helps"" would be *enormous*. You don't need it to magically solve everything; but christ, wouldn't being 20% happier be a fucking breath of fresh air?

Finally, remember: you've been medicating this whole time with marijuana anyway. So, you know *some* chemicals help. Why not try these ones?

It's getting out of control to the point I have a letter from the Supreme Court of my state and the crippling anxiety of handling it is preventing me from even starting. I want to fix it, I don't want to be this stupid fucking person who bottles up their problems until it's wayyyyy past the point it should be. I've done it my whole life. I don't want to keep doing this to myself. I just want the thoughts in my head when I'm alone to not be filled with all the shit I have going on in the background. And the worst part? No one in my life knows about it. I have parents, I have a fiancé for fucks sake. Why am I like this? I literally see no way out besides unaliving myself. And I don't even want to, I want to live. But how do you even fix it? I just feel like I've fucked my life up so bad to the point where I've dug a hole I can't get out of.

I was on the same boat parents were users and abused each other all the time. I would go to school in rags and come home to an empty house with no food or anything. I found myself asking for money on the streets at the age of 7 back in 1995 then in 1997 I was taken away from them bittersweet because I still loved my parents even though they were terrible parents and spouses. Got to live in a home with my aunt uncle and their kids. My step mom (aunt) treated me like trash 99 percent of the time and I contemplated my very existence everyday. My parents both got deported in the long run I don’t know what happened to my mother it’s been 24 years since I seen her and my father I just reunited with last year. Long story short I wanted to pull the plug so many times countless times but I was head strong and now I’m grown and have still struggled with obstacles but I love life and I have a purpose now my family and kids.

I honestly don’t think anything will make me happy anymore, everything gives me anxiety. I’m crying while typing this because I’m just so done with everything, and I feel even more guilty because I was doing so good. I was taking my meds and I was happy and I was having fun and it might just be a combination of pms and not taking my meds but the sorrow is so overwhelming I don’t think anything will make me feel better anymore. And on top of it all, I want to die but I don’t want to be in pain. As much as I hate hurting I might start cutting again because I tried earlier and it didn’t feel too bad. I hope this is what the sub is for, I’m sorry if this isn’t compliant but I scrolled a while before posting so it feels ok. And I know I could just delete that’s part but it shows how bad I’m getting, apologizing for feeling suicidal, I can’t do anything anymore without feeling guilty.

"I typed out basically my whole life story but my phone died while I was in the middle of it and decided to make this a whole lot shorter. Im 23 and have no plans on making it to my 24th birthday exactly a month from now. this has been something that I contemplated doing since I was very young. My life has never been easy and it seems like the older I get, the more impossible it seems to live. I have nothing materially left to my name, I feel like a burden to my mother, and overall I am just tired. I know my family will miss me and I will make sure to ask all of them for forgiveness and understanding when I write my letters. I know that it won’t stop them from grieving and I know that doing this will hurt them but I don’t see a way out. I have watched the life get sucked out of me day by day for years and now when I look in the mirror, I am nothing. I think this world sucks and I would genuinely rather die than to participate in society anymore. I don’t know what happens when we die but I can’t see it being worse than my life now. Im sad to be leaving but also very relieved that I finally get to rest. I wish I could wait until One Piece was finished but I don’t believe I can hold out any longer, I know it’s going to be an amazing ending. If you got this far, I hope life gets better for you and that you are able to continue fighting. Thanks for reading :)

sure, why not. I grew up poor with 3 siblings that lived with me, a step father that abused and degraded me. one of my siblings did something to me and my other siblings that no one should do to their family or anyone really. when i was around 9, i started to hear voices in my head. by 12 i wanted to kill myself until my nephew was born which gave me a reason to stay alive. at 13/14 i told my mom i was depressed, she told me depression is made up by the government so i decided to bottle up everything i went through from there on out. i never really had many friends and the ones i did have, I didn’t really know how to manage friendships bc of my own anxieties and doing so they didn’t last. my younger siblings don’t really care about me in the way that i do for them, anytime they went through things, i was there for them but they never seem to be there when I need it unless i’m asking for like $20 for gas. in the last two years I have been sexually assaulted, raped, given something that i’ll never be able to get rid of, and forgotten about. i fall behind on all my bills constantly and today i was supposed to start school but my car was repossessed by the time I woke up in the morning. no matter what i try, it isn’t enough for this world. i have no one to run to and even if I did, i would probably still be depressed.

"What was done to you was terrible, but why should you have to give up your life and die for what someone else did to you? That doesn't sound fair to me.

The reason we can say that what was done to you was so wrong is that YOUR LIFE HAS VALUE, whether others acknowledge it or not.

You need to seek out friendships with people with good values. Please don't add to the injustices and cruelties that have been committed against you. You can learn from your suffering so that someday, when you have healed (and you will) you can treat other people with kindness and mercy. That's what happened to me and I'm so glad I didn't give up (I almost did in my 20s).

When I (15m) was 14 in 8th grade I went on omegle a few times and sexted with girls on snap (I’m already really embarrassed and ashamed about that) who were all 13-17 but one time I talked to a girl who said she was 12 and I asked if she wanted to sext and for nudes. She said no and I said sorry and blocked her.

31; single parent; no friends; unsociable.

My own dad quite clearly can’t stand to be around me. Avoids conversations and never asks me about my life, just asks to talk to my kid. Glad he likes my kid; my kid is pretty cool. But it’s clear he thinks very poorly of me. Right now I’m trying to remain because my kid needs me. I do get some small dopamine response when my kid is happy, or social or involved in stuff I pay for him to do like camps and extra curriculars.

That sounds like it must be an exhausting situation, and it's so understandable to be frustrated and overwhelmed. I'm sorry that you feel the need to hide your feelings, and if anybody is making you feel that you have to please know that that does not mean you don't deserve to be cared for and take care of yourself, because you do, you are worth every effort it takes to get better. Is there anyone a bit more removed from your daily life who you can talk to about this, if finding help from those more close to you is more daunting? You've probably considered this before and it's totally valid to be scared or averse to doing that, I just want you to know that you shouldn't have to feel this way, and even if you don't want to seek professional help your feelings will always be valid and I'm glad you're here to write this.	therapyartist	reply	na	na	na	0.9988604784011841	strong	no	no	na	SuicideWatch	no prediction.
"I’m absolutely done. Finished. My “tolerance for life” button is absolutely empty. Where do I even begin to express all the ways my life has gone the drain…

I don’t leave my room anymore unless I have to.

I binge eat because the taste of the food makes me happy but then immediately become depressed because I feel fat and I have an ED.

My family abandoned me.

I’ve been touched in unsavory ways.

I’ve been beaten.

I get annoyed at the prospect of social interaction.

Half of my search history is ways to end it all.

I was neglected when I was young.

I was thrown to foster care and they didn’t want me and then to my adoptive family and they didn’t want me.

I can’t afford college.

I live in a shelter transitional housing situation.

So when people ask me to stay alive “for them”, that “they” would miss me, it annoys the ever loving shit out of me. Like where the fuck were you when I told you I needed something? Where the fuck were you when I was crying in the corner because everything was too much? Where the fuck were you when I was defending myself from people and the world and I had no one to help?

"Trying weed to stave off the bad thoughts is not a bad thing. Self-medicating is definitely a bad thing. 

The difference is this:

* Having a bit of weed every now and again, especially when you're feeling vulnerable or suicidal, can calm you down long enough to let the feeling pass. Then you can put the weed down and address what just fucked you up.
* Self-medicating is using weed *in place of* dealing with your issues. If you're high every night, or you're out getting crossed, or weed is starting to become a cornerstone of your personality, it's time to put it down entirely and seek a different solution.

It sounds to me like your friends are getting aggravated with the way you express yourself or vent. It's easier to just forgive them for that than it is to blame yourself and over-analyze every little thing you do or say.

You have an absolute right to feel. If you feel suicidal, that's an emotion and emotions pass. If you *are* suicidal, that's a condition and you need to do something that isn't self-harm or self-medication."	shotguntoheadrn	reply	na	na	na	0.9994934797286987	no	no	no	na	SuicideWatch	no prediction.
It really is no big deal. You tried something relatively harmless like once, that is just fine. Tell your friends to chill tf out.

My plan was to get into college for real estate after getting a part-time job, but these plans always seem to fall through. I never feel like a real man unless I work myself to the point of tears, but I don't often have the energy for that, it just leads me into a vicious cycle of depression.

At my job, my coworkers bully me behind my back, and don’t do their job correctly. They would leave the rest of their job to me, and if I don’t I get in trouble. They also cut my hours. I avoided the day where they always leave without completely doing their job and finishing on purpose. And because I asked for that day off specifically, they didn’t put me on the schedule to work for the entire week. My family doesn’t seem to care about my well being either. My brother got his gf pregnant, and moved back in to the house because they are struggling with money. My mom wants me to give up my room for them, and for some reason everything always has to be about them, and somehow they are entitled to my room that I spent my hard earned money on and took care of. I deny them because it’s not fair that I take care of myself and they are irresponsible. They are just fine sleeping in the living room/and they don’t pay any bills/or share their food. They don’t need my room. And for some reason, I can never be a priority to my boyfriend. His mom never lets him go out with me, even something as simple as taking/dropping me off to work. He prioritizes her feelings over me. She acts like she is his wife and it disgusts and creeps me out. I deleted and blocked my friends because some of them were back stabbers and some of them were trying to hit on me while I am in a relationship. I feel totally alone. I am considering buying a rope to end myself.	Tickles0	post	21.757248434033215	male	White	0.9992775321006775	na	na	na	1	SuicideWatch	failed

"Currently studying a Bachelor's degree in the technical course (4Year program).

University has a library 

I live in INDIA

currently, I am living in a hostel for my studies away from my parents (I am a puppet of my parents who listen to them, they train me like that from the beginning).

Parents' description - Controlling, Authoritative Parents,   Helicopter parents, Unstable financial condition, Substance abuse {alcoholic father}.

Always have eyes on me, whom I talk to, whom I hang out with, etc. (I can't do anything without my parent's permission, always scold me about my little mistakes to big mistakes )

My description - Male, Asian, INDIAN, 23Y old, Feel stupid, Not smart enough, always comparing myself to others( my peers), Not intelligent enough, Not worthy enough of achieving something in life. 

The problem is here again
In my hostel, I am getting trouble not able to adjust with my hostel mates 

I have no friends 
I have no close friends (male/female)

I have no one to talk to about my problems or whatever I am dealing with.

My achievement- 1. build a PC on my hand by watching YouTube (money=my own earned money + 6% parents' money)
2. learn to play football

and I am not able to remember any of my achievements right now because my parents do not make me feel appreciated enough to remember any of my achievements, or what I can achieve in my life.

Human is social animal but I am not that social I am not leaving my room (I am scared of people's words, opinions, and comments on me)

I am scared physically, verbally, and emotionally
I am more scared of verbal abuse than physical.
.

I have good food, clean water, good shelter, and cloth
I am poor at eating and my weight is not increasing.

I have no aim, no goal (I make a goal list but fail to focus on it), no purpose in my life
The only option left is Suicide.

I know I am complaining about my parents and the situation.

But I am stuck in my mind not able to focus on my current studies.

Give me solutions

"Yes, I Have already planned to leave them permanently. 

but now they put me in University for studying (4-year technical degree course)

I am studying it because after completing it I can earn money after getting a job and then leaving my parents. 


But the real problem is my parent make me( so much weak person that can't stand for my rights) their puppet who listen and do whatever the authority(parents) say to do.

I am so sensitive that I get easily affected by others' opinions and comments about me.

My peers can easily make fun of me, and crack jokes about me but I can't handle it so well enough, and not able to speak up about that and not able to give a savage reply to them.

My parents do not appreciate me.
my parents do not love me.
my parents do not talk to me about my day or how I was doing in my life.

I don't feel like I am worthy enough to live in this world.

I am not able to express my feeling and emotions and my thoughts.

I don't have any close relationship with any male friend (bud, homies) to have a deep conversation or express my feelings or thoughts, etc.

I don't have any female friends or girlfriend 
( yes I am attracted to girls, and like to approach but my depression is killing me and stopping me from doing it.)

I have no friend 
I have no one to talk about


I was bullied in school
And it was a bad experience.



Even currently my relationship with classmates getting awkward and bitter.

Your parents shouldn't control you, you're over 20 years old, you're a grown adult now, but as you said, you're their ""puppet"", i think the only option is getting a job, knowing how to save money and not interacting with them, they cant really be changed, its hard to change people

 Its very hard being stuck in your mind, but you need to stand up for yourself, people nowdays dont have empathy for us, i looked up your reddit account and you said you've been bullied, i know its hard, i've been there, but you need to defend yourself, do not let people do anything bad to you, these people do not belong and shouldn't in a society because of their behaviour, the only bad people on here are them, who have a fucked up behaviour and pick up the weaker ones, do not let them do this to you ever, you need to learn to speak up for yourself"	Trick_Concentrate_38	reply	na	na	na	0.9994311928749084	weak	strong	no	na	SuicideWatch	'ethnicity: latin american, age: 20s-30s, gender: unknown, explanation: author refers to being from latin america, indicating their ethnicity. the author seems to understand the struggles of young adulthood and the transition to independence, suggesting an age in the 20s-30s range. however, the author does not provide enough information to determine their gender.'

"1. I am an unhappy person, not so much social, socially awkward, I am not worthy of something, My parents don't appreciate me for whatever I do, achieve, or bring to the table 
The last time I can remember appreciation from my parents is when I get 1st prize in a quiz competition in Different Church 

2. No I don't have such a learning difficulty, I can learn very well, but I think I am not smart enough then my peers or others (because of my parent's restrictions I can't do any mistake without making mistake how can I learn, they always restrict me or taunt me, but these ongoing mental trauma or problem or overthinking whatever, doesn't let me focus on my study and others' distraction also.

3. My parents are controlling and authoritative parents, they didn't listen to me.
 If a cried they ask me to stop crying they do not ask for the reason or don't want to know the reason behind my crying.
Yes, I can't change them I can only change myself.
I will get a job make money and leave them.

4. I am a skinny guy that's why people pick me to mess with, I talk to my dad about taking a gym membership (recently 3month ago) but my dad said NO and it hurt me badly.

I need to learn material arts to protect myself physically, but I don't have money to take a membership to join the club (because I am in a hostel, depending on my parents' money, I don't have a computer with me to do freelance like graphic design and video editing).

By talking with you I am able to open myself to whatever is locked inside my brain 🧠 

I know I am complaining but these are the things that stop me or keep me slow down on my path.

5. At last I didn't get the love and attention of my parents from childhood to adulthood (love, attention, appreciation, and support  are missing in my life from my parents, maybe others)

It seems like it's been really exhausting for you to keep going in such difficult times, so thank you for pushing forward to this point and being here to post this. I hear you; it's hard to feel like you're getting left behind, to feel isolated. I'm sorry you're not getting the support you need; nobody deserves to be in this much pain, and I wish I could help more. You probably already know this but please remember that everybody moves at their own pace and there's more than one way to have a fulfilling life, or at least find a way to ease the pain without ending your life completely. I'm sure you've been fighting for a long time already so of course it makes sense that you're getting tired of it, that's only natural, but maybe there is still a way forward.

I know it's not but I can't stop seeing em. No amount of therapy no drugs nothing is helping me and I'm really fucking tired. Like so fuckin tired. It's a struggle getting out of bed in the morning.

"It’s human nature to make judgements about something in a black and white manor. This especially plagued my high school life growing up, I’d always be thinking something about how I hate myself and I’m such a bad person because of the combination of negative experiences that illustrate the lack of skills that I value (aka being a bad person by ur own judgement.) The biggest idea that helped me was that no person is bad or good, as good and bad is really just a result of what you’ve come to understand about the world right now, including what others might think. The reality is that the experiences you’ve had are not only valid but human and they shaped who u r today whether u like it or not. There was not way to stop experiencing life and you can’t change the past but the beautiful thing about being in the present moment and knowing that you couldn’t of done a better job living, cause the only requirement to experience life is to live. Nobody you meet may ever share the right advice, and that’s because the world is so diverse, everyone can’t be summed up by one experience or an ability. There’s people u’ll never understand, there’s experiences u’ll miss out on but the same goes both ways.

EVER. i’ve been in a constant suffering cycle since my earliest memories. i’m thinking of ending it all tonight. there’s so many things on my mind. i’m too much then i’m not enough. i’ve worked so hard for every single thing i have. i’ve climbed tooth and nail, blood sweat and tears to get where i am and still nothing. i’m so tired of being a martyr. if you guys knew what i’ve been through you’d want to end it too. from pretty much losing my whole family to illness to losing work no matter where i turn to just losing myself. i’m so low i can’t even distract myself so i find no point in doing any of those things. i even loved smoking weed but now it’s all such a waste of time when i’m so numb and feel so alone. i truly want to be gone from this ungrateful forsaken world. how much more do i have to suffer is this what life will always look like for me? and do things really get better? help me.	zonedmana	post	26.76213449719457	female	White	0.9988210797309875	na	na	na	4	SuicideWatch	failed

"Fellow self-appointed martyr sending vibes your way

Just remember, no one asked for our big sacrifices. We don't have to keep laying down in harm's way. It's safe to just let others be happy and solve their problems their way, and then you can grieve what it is that you've lost.

Others will move on from us, and your suffering cannot be put on them, even if they caused it. Sometimes you find out they didn't cause it after all, and forgiveness eases your burden.

And sometimes you're all smashed up and you just want everyone who hurt you to see it. But self-loathing/medicating/harm is too reflective: all they'll see is that you're in pain, but not why.

I don't understand life. No one has given me a reason to live as a young adult (21f). Apparently I'm supposed to be out in the world experiencing life when I don't exactly want to. I don't understand why I was born and I wish my mother aborted me. I hate that I exist in a world that literally on fire. I barely have any friends and a life besides school and work. And I feel I'm never doing enough or feeling how I'm supposed to. For example I bought my own car with my mom and I wasn't happy nor excited because I saw it as a necessity that every 20 something year should have. I went back to school because it was heavily suggested to me and people wouldn't stop suggesting it until I actually went. I failed last semester but I'm going back because I have no life plan because I've tried on three separate occasions to off myself and I stopped it for a reason I can't explain. I moved back in with my mom because I missed home and now I wish I didn't because I'm a part time parent again to my siblings such as driving them places, getting stuff like soap, somethings for their projects and picking them up from school, slumber parties, friends houses, rec-centers etc., I hate it or dropping things that they left at home to their school and it's not fair. Is there anything good in this life. Please someone convince me. I'm begging.

"Hey, thanks for sharing.

the fact that you have searched up suicide watch instead of ways to kill yourself is always a very good sign. It shows you really care about something, and although it might not be clear now, you will eventually see it.

Now I don’t want to give some inspirational quote about how great life is because it can be hard sometime. Every person is different after all but remember so you don’t have to throw yourself headfirst into the world (your only 21) 

(and now I am going to give the bs about how great life can be :-). 

Life can be hard but it can also be beautiful, like your only 21 you don’t have to your life sorted out and put pressure on yourself  or do what people tell you. I’m the same age as you and sometimes at this stage of your life it’s difficult managing responsibilities and figuring out who you are as a person.

"My life has been on a bit of a downward spiral for the past few years and whilst there’s been a few glimpses of hope they’ve always been fleeting and massively outweighed by the bad, or in some cases have made the bad stuff all the harder to deal with. 

I’m almost 24 and I feel like I’ve lost some of my prime years. I’ve noticed myself emotionally, physically, and cognitively deteriorate to point now where I barely even recognise myself in the present and also when looking/thinking back to myself in the past. Even just physically I have lost a lot of weight and not in an uplifting or good way, I used to be a healthy weight and now I feel so weak and lethargic that it’s hard for me to do anything anymore and thats not even considering the fact that I barely have any mental motivation to do anything either.

I was a med student, only one year away from graduating before my suicide attempts and mental health caused me to take a break from my studies for what was initially meant to just be a year. And then during that year just as I thought things were getting better I unexpectedly lost my grandad who had practically raised me as much as a father would.

And so I extended my leave from uni for an extra year and made plans to travel abroad and started to get excited for that. And then my mum and dad started going at each other worse and worse whilst my little sister was stuck in the middle of it at home. I was constantly worried about either one of my parents snapping and doing something harmful to themselves or someone in the family. And so I cancelled my plans and tried to keep things together at home by at least being there and not abandoning them all. 

And in the meantime I met someone and we fell in love with each other. And we started a relationship which felt more real than any of my previous relationships. And then after half a year that relationship broke down and if the emptiness that I felt from losing it wasn’t terrible and heartbreaking enough, I found out after we broke up that she had been lying to me about her age and being a uni student and so much of her life that she had opened up to me about and made me feel safe opening up back, turned out to be a lie. 

And after a month of being disgusted by myself for falling for it and also terrified of what would happen, she filed a police report against me, practically denying that there was anything two-way between us and I had to find out whilst in jail and being interviewed by the police that she had told them that every single bit of contact between us was just me SAing her with no pretext of the relationship or that she had been telling me that she was 20 and had showed me what I now realise was fake ID and proof whilst we were talking and together. She even claimed that the birthday gift that I got her was a random gift that I gave her in order to groom her, when the main reason why I got her the gift was because she gave me a similar birthday gift just a few weeks before. 

The police now have my phone and pc for an indefinite amount of time whilst they check all the evidence such as messages between us and whilst I’m pretty certain that once they see all the messages and stuff they’ll realise the truth it doesn’t make me any less terrified of what my future holds. Plus there’s the fact that so much of my life and work is on those devices and I have no idea when I will even get them back. 

I can barely even talking about any of this to anyone, only my family who I have a shaky relationship with and my best friend who I haven’t seen in ages and won’t be able to see for ages because he’s hundreds of miles away. I’ve barely spoken to my friends from uni in the past year and don’t even know how to start contact again or try to explain any of this to them when it’s been so long since I even spoke to them. 

I can’t help but think that if I didn’t take leave from uni last year I would either have graduated and been working my dream job right now without any of this stuff happening or I would’ve killed myself by now. And either one of those outcomes feel so so much more desirable than the shit that I’m going through and have been through this past year. 

I look in the mirror and I see someone I hate and don’t recognise. My eyes are surrounded by massive bags that won’t go. My arms and legs have dwindled down to twigs whilst my abdomen has gotten flabby. My hair which was thick and curly a year ago is now dry, thin, and falling out in clumps each day. I just want it to all end. I’m done with trying. I feel completely broken and I can’t see myself being able to have a happy future even after all these legal issues have been resolved. Honestly the main reason I haven’t done anything today or atm is that it’s my dad’s birthday and as much as I hate some of the stuff he’s done to me and our family I don’t want to do this to him so close to his birthday and the anniversary of his dad’s (my grandad that I mentioned) death. But it’s getting so difficult to hold on for much longer and I truly am just done with it all now"	Cute_Adhesiveness654	post	19.00374930773725	male	White	0.9988069534301758	na	na	na	3	SuicideWatch	no prediction.

"First of all, thank you for taking the time to read and reply to my post. It feels good to be somewhat heard atm when I feel like I can’t even talk about stuff that’s going on to a lot of my friends or even therapists because of the nature of it. 

Unfortunately a lot of my saved up money has gone towards legal fees so I’ve got a fair bit of saving up to do if I were to travel. I lost my temporary job a few weeks ago because of a combination of losing access to my phone, going in to the station for a police interview, and having many mental health appointments which all led to not being able to make shifts and my boss losing patience with it. 

I’m trying to find a new job now but it’s pretty demotivating and disheartening with how much work I had put into getting my previous job motivating myself for it, only to lose it after a few weeks. 

There’s a part of me that does want to keep trying and holding onto the little things which are alright but it’s difficult to not feel like just giving up"	Cute_Adhesiveness654	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9988069534301758	weak	strong	no	na	SuicideWatch	no prediction.

"I despise this assumption people often make when they hear of a complete stranger’s suicide, especially when it comes to adults. What might seem to be a small thing that could have been easily solved is usually just the last straw a person could take. 

That’s exactly why I don’t want my body to be found or anybody to know where I’ve gone. 

I’ve finally managed to convince my doc to prescribe me a drug that’s known for its serious complications in case of overdose, especially if combined with alcohol, namely imipramine. That was quite a challenge as my psychiatrist was very reluctant to give me this fucking prescription and let me go home. He insisted that I should go to the hospital and be treated with these drugs under supervision due to my suicide tendencies and unstable life situation. BUT I FOOLED HIM THIS TIME! I tried my best to appear normal on the outside even though taking care of myself has become an ordeal a long ago. I lied about getting a job, about having friends and basically about being fine. Thanks god he didn’t question any of my claims (or simply knew I was beyond salvation) cuz I literally had a psychiatrist who’d ask me question like where exactly are you working or if he could talk to any of my friends or relatives. I wouldn’t have been able to lie then. 

The thing is, I don’t want my body to ever be found. I don’t want to be rushed to ICU. I don’t want cops to investigate this. I just want to be forgotten the day I off myself.
So I’m thinking of an uninhabited, poorly accessible area where I wouldn’t be able to call for help if case I change my mind when the pain becomes agonizing. 

I simply can’t take it anymore. I’m disabled, have serious chronic mental illnesses, I ain’t contributing to society in any way, every my relationship fails because of my poor mental health, I ain’t got no achievements in life, I will never be loved, I am a burden to all of my relatives and I know they secretly want me dead, I have gotten to the point where I can’t even take care of myself.. I have gotten to the point where I can’t take myself anymore. I’ve lost so much to my crippling depression, I don’t enjoy anything and I’m fucking scared of being alone with my own thoughts. But the thing is...there’s no way out of loneliness for me as I simply don’t know how to interact and reach out without scaring the shit out of someone. IVE LOST EVERYTHING, INCLUDING MYSELF. I was miserable, say, three years ago and I can remember myself thinking of nothing but suicide yet I def couldn’t have imagined back then the losses and misery I’m having to deal with now. The truth is that life isn’t gonna get better, in fact it only gets worse and worse. I feel like a monster, an irredeemable one.

Hope I’ll finally have guts to do what I should have done a long ago. But actually planning it is so exhausting. Finding a suitable place, looking for a decent excuse to make, thinking of how to minimize your chances for survival, acting normal to avoid suspicions and the most heart bbreakj g thing is finding a new home for the love of my life, my dear kitten... I don’t know if imipramine alone, even if combined with alcohol, can do its job. But to make sure I’ll end up dead, I have to wait until the weather gets colder and go to an isolated area (like forest) where people don’t usually go. Cuz I won’t be able to cry for help once lost with no connection or make it out alive once heavily intoxicated. Under no circumstances should I survive it. I have to make an excuse for my relatives to make sure they won’t be looking for me for at least a month. That’s the only scenario I see as 100% lethal and not traumatizing to strangers (unlike jumping off the roof).

If you have made it to the end, I have only one question to ask. Pls, Idk how to make sure my relatives won’t be looking for me for a sufficient period of time (a month at least) of no contact. I first thought that the best way would be to have a dramatic quarrel but I changed my mind as I thought they would blame themselves for what I’ve done afterwards. I don’t love them but I’m not THIS cruel. I don’t want ANYONE to go through what I’ve gone through cuz the only person at fault is me. I should’ve done something earlier to prevent my own suicide but now the damage done over the years is irreversible."	auxwtoiqww	post	25.615702622652673	female	White	0.9961128234863281	na	na	na	2	SuicideWatch	no prediction.

Anxiety and thoughts of ending it are always so much worse once the sun goes down. During the day, I can push it down. At night, it pushes me. The thing that has stopped me the most is fear of failure. Of not succeeding and winding up in worse condition, unable to try again. I tried once, and only succeeded in messing up my body worse. Now, the only thing that keeps me here, is the fear of failure. I'm not scared of death. I pray every night that I won't wake up. Pray everytime I leave the house that something will do the job for me. When I can sleep, it's never for very long. A few hours at most. I'm exhausted. I don't have the will to keep going, but I can't get past my fear of failure. So I live. I go through the motions. I go to work, come home, and repeat. I throw on a fake smile, and people around me are content enough to just leave me alone. I've become a master at giving just enough effort so people don't see. And those that do, don't care enough to dig. My own family buys my deception well enough, or they don't care, I'm not sure which. Working in retail teaches you the art of deception. You learn how to put people to arm's length and keep your emotions in check during the day. Then the sun goes down, and the darkness closes in, bringing with it the realization I'm acting again. As long as I smile occasionally, I can fool the masses. I wish I could feel for real. I wish I could cry, scream, laugh. Anything. There's nothing but the cold emptyness. This black void. An empty space. I just don't want to be here anymore.	Panther_1979	post	18.64685121781406	female	White	0.9985438585281372	na	na	na	0	SuicideWatch	no prediction.

"I just want to sleep and never wake up anymore I have had enough :( I have tried so hard to keep finding reasons to not want to die and to look forward to things but it keeps backfiring somehow or so much shit goes wrong later. I feel like such a inconvience to everyone around me :( I have tried to stay kind and help those around me be happy even if I cannot be happy myself. I was just trying to feel useful somehow but I feel even worse then before. I cant lie I have hurt people along the way to get to where I am now and that still haunts me even to this day I know I deserved to be punished for all the awful things I have done

My friends do not understand me at all and I feel I cannot talk to any of them about things like this they see me as someone who is happy/energetic person when I am far from opposite but I also do not want to disappoint them with what I feel, some of them look up to me as a role model and I am already such a burden. My family already sees me as a disappointment I was never able to talk about anything with them without them being judgemental about it. I think in a way they would be happy if I was gone one less nuisance out of there hair. I have an amazing partner who I honestly love to pieces but I cannot say these things to him he wont understand. I already feel like such a nuisance in his life and in ways I feel I make things a bit harder for him even if he says I don't. I just tried so hard to keep him happy even if I have to hide my sadness. But part of me feels he deserves someone better who isn't damaged like me.

English is not my first language so excuse my mistakes. I(17F) started talking to a boy (17M) online.We used to send silly messages cute stuff etc. One day i got really drunk and he kept pressuring me about sending pics. I was drunk as hell so i did.I know i'm wrong for that but i didn't realise what i did. After that i found out he was talking to a girl and she made fun of me for basically..being there with them. After a while i found out he was only talking to me for nudes.Great, it crushed me really bad. Keep in mind that i never said anything about him, and he admitted it that i never talked bad about him. He kept talking about me and my pics even after i left him alone. What sucks the most is that our common friends are still really close to him but getting colder to me.I'm typing this while crying like crazy. I don't know what to do. I blocked him but i know he would keep talking about me. I need someone to talk about it. Ik u might think i'm overreacting but this hurts me because i've always been nice to people. Even mean people. I thought i could change others people mentality by being nice but they took advantage. Asking me for favours 24/7 and then throwing me away when they don't need me anymore. He only wanted my nudes.That's all. That's all he cared for and that the only thing i was good for him. It hurts. It hurts so much.

"Do you ever feel like the universe is telling you that it would be better to end it?

Like I was happy just over a year ago, engaged in a relationship and I convinced myself I wasn't so ruined it. Now I hate myself, now I'm sad, lonely and depressed as fuck.

Everytime I think there is hope I either mess it up or fate kicks me while I'm down. Ex has moved on. Every date I've been on I've either compared them to my ex or of I like the girl she's not interested in going out again. Didn't get a promotion I went for. Just fell like a permanent loser and every glimmer of hope goes no where so maybe that's a sign that the universe, karma or whatever doesn't really want me be happy."

"One of the songs I had on repeat today was what is currently my favorite song, by my favorite band The Veer Union, from one of my favorite albums of theirs. It’s called “I Will Make It Out”. Every lyric resonates with me, and I truly feel like it tells my story.

Within the last 15 minutes of listening to it, I realized I won’t be making it out. I won’t be achieving what the song declares I will. Like, I really did try, and I had hope and much more resilience than I’ll ever get credit for. But life is near its end for me. I made a deal with the universe/fate, and it wasn’t honored. So I’ve received my sign to finally just pull the plug and stop delaying what I’ve come to believe is just inevitable for me. If it doesn’t happen this weekend, it will happen before the end of August. I’ve always talked a big game about it, but I have a set plan and course of action I intend to follow through with.

There’s so much more I want to say, but I know nobody really cares like that, so I’m just going to leave this by suggesting you check out the song if you’re still hoping to hang on a little longer. It’s definitely an acquired taste, and not what I’d consider easy listening; but it’s gotten me through some of the darkest and worst moments I’ve had since it was released."	amermaidfromjupiter	post	16.066513036188724	male	White	0.0013183170231059194	na	na	na	1	SuicideWatch	no prediction.
It seems like it's been really exhausting for you to keep going in such difficult times, so thank you for pushing forward to this point and being here to post this. I hear you; it's hard to feel like you're getting left behind, to feel isolated. I'm sorry you're not getting the support you need; nobody deserves to be in this much pain, and I wish I could help more. You probably already know this but please remember that everybody moves at their own pace and there's more than one way to have a fulfilling life, or at least find a way to ease the pain without ending your life completely. I'm sure you've been fighting for a long time already so of course it makes sense that you're getting tired of it, that's only natural, but maybe there is still a way forward. Is there anybody you can talk to so you don't have to shoulder the burden alone? If not, I'm glad you're here and I hope writing this brought you some relief.	amermaidfromjupiter	reply	na	na	na	0.0013183170231059194	strong	no	no	na	SuicideWatch	no prediction.

I've been feeling low alot recently.
I have a dream job but no one around me to relate to. Everyone around me is either getting married in long term relationships, or being more successful than me.

I want friends who reach out to me first. I want a group of people around me. I want to hit restart and hope that someone spots that I was autistic as a kid.

I imagined a noose around my neck last night. I imagined slitting my wrists and walking down the street and collapsing. I thought about changing my number and moving far away to restart my life.

My son is a teenager and I feel like I am a total failure. He has adhd - like me. I got diagnosed as an adult and it explained so much that happened in my life and that has been hard for me. I have some weird anxieties and so has he. He is in therapy because of his anxiety and I want to support him as much as possible. It is so hard tough to support him on the one hand but to not coddle him on the other hand. He needs a lot of attention which I try to give him but it seems I am doing everything wrong. I don’t have enough energy anymore and I feel myself getting more hollow everyday. There seems to be nothing left to give. I don’t know who I am anymore. Today he told me that all of his problems are because of me and that he wants to be enough. I never wanted him to feel like that. He is the most important person to me and I loved him before he was born. Now I am just a shell of the loving parent I was and I can’t give him what he needs. If I go though, what will happen to him. I don’t want him to blame himself.	CatNoteOne	post	31.66997058927783	female	White	0.9984215497970581	na	na	na	3	SuicideWatch	no prediction.
"It is so wonderful that you have someone in your life you love as much as your son. My mom has had similar struggles to you, and even though as a teen with mental health issues I'm not good at showing it I really do appreciate what she tries to do for me, and hopefully your son does as well. Parents, as I'm sure you know, are people too and if your son believes that ""all of his problems"" are because of you, please don't feel like you've failed irreparably. It sounds like he is going through a lot of his own struggles and maybe it's just hard for him to express that in a logical and kind way right now. You're probably both doing your best and if anybody expects more that's not reasonable. Thank you for doing all you can to support your son; you are so appreciated, if not visibly by your son, than by a stranger on the internet who's been where he is before and knows how important that support is."

Hopefully my support doesn’t make things worse. He deserves to live a wonderful life. I hope he really hears me when I tell him how much I love him.

I'm only a 16 guy but I hate waking up and doing the same thing everyday, there's just no meaning in my life. I hate myself to the extent that I wont even leave the house, I don't remember the last time I had a positive thought about myself or anything in general, its just constant hatred in my head and I can't seem to escape it. I dislike everything about myself especially the way I look, and as stupid as it sounds I feel like I'm not able to have fun because of my looks. I'm constantly looking in the mirror hoping that maybe I'll be able to accept myself but I just can't. I get told by my siblings how much of a piece of shit and worthless I am daily, I know I shouldn't take it to heart but I do. Like I just feel so sad all of the time, my body won't physically let me cry anymore, I've tried to let it out but it just doesn't work. I haven't been to school in weeks and I don't think I'm able to  socialize anymore, I don't know If i can bring myself to commit suicide because of what it would do to my parents but I just don't think life is worth living anymore. I just want to be happy again.	sadgang420	post	9.40300550234385	male	White	0.9992251396179199	na	na	na	1	SuicideWatch	age: 16, gender: male, explanation: the author mentions being a 16-year-old male. no mention of ethnicity so no prediction can be made.
I hear you, I felt similarly a year ago when I was sixteen and I still can't imagine the pain you must be going through right now.

My girlfriend just left me because of my many issues and it stresses her out too much which is fair, so soon I think I'm gonna block her or something and make sure she doesn't find out about my suicide because she's mentioned a few times that she was scared to break up with me because she believed I would try to kill myself, but I don't see any other options, she sent me various ways of getting help/helping myself, but none of them work, I am beyond helping, and I've accepted that, but I won't accept just living a life with no joy, no comfort, nobody who loves me, I won't put myself through that, suicide is the only help I will receive now.

It sounds like you have some good things in your life, even if other things are difficult, and that might be worth trying to find a way to keep.

I'm planning on doing ""it"" but the end of summer, my life has been going down hill since I was born, I was put into care when I was young along side with my little brother, I spend all my time sleeping or trying to distract myself, I've losted all the people I care about due to my horrible mental health and I'm just so tired of trying.

I hate myself for even thinking about it, since I don't want to imagine a world how I put my friend's though pain, but I hope they'll get over it soon.

"I was 12 i have been bullied all my life because I was born with ADHD I hadn't relised they had bullied me until fifth grade when the realization they were using me like a toy that doesn't have any emotions and that they can just throw away after, in 6th grade near the end of the year my friends came up to me and told me that I'm violent and they don't want to be my friends anymore (I had snapped a few months prior since someone had threatened to rape a friend so I had brought a knife to school the day after) I tried to not cry as I watched them walk away but I couldn't handle it and ended up crying anyways they made me talk to the school Counceller after, after school I had rode the bus home and gone to my room I cried a few hours until I relised that I had just lost all of my friends, I didn't want to be friendless again yet there was no way I could make any. all my classmates hated me besides my old friends, so I made the decision that I don't want to live anymore since all my life has been suffering because of my classmates, I grabbed my noose that a crafted 3 months prior and hung it on a hook inside my bedroom. I also grabbed a chair and put it under, I stood on the chair and put the rope around my neck, I kicked the chair, and I felt a sudden panic of emotion overtake me. I did it wrong and my neck didn't snap so I was just left there hanging for a bit, about 10 seconds into the hanging I suddenly fell to the ground, the hook on the ceiling broke since it was sort of broken due to things, I had done with it when younger, it was painful.my family didn't know that I felt like this in the first place they had always thought it wasn't that bad what my classmates did to me (they once tried to break my arm). and they never found out about my suicide attempt. I barely can control my thoughts anymore and I don't know what to do with my life. I'm sort of glad it didn't succeed because the ten seconds I was hanging was like hell itself, but I still want to commit suicide, I'm just looking for a less painful method.I know that it would have been an endless black void if I died but still it would have been better than this.

I am currently 12 years old, and it has been two-three months since my suicide attempt sorry that it is longer than a paragraph."	YouravgRBLXplayer	post	15.353519046016743	female	White	0.9977377653121948	na	na	na	6	SuicideWatch	failed
I think you’re fortunate that the hook broke and you survived 🙂. You’re too young to be attempting suicide and I wish you seek help because your life might get better past middle school.

I'm certain I'll kill myself, and every day feels like a day closer. It feels out of my control, like it's already been decided for me. I see no future, I can't seriously think about kids or marriage etc. because I feel I'll be dead before that happens. I often think about my family and friends. I think about where they all are in life and when would be the best time to make sure they're all more prepared (I can't do it in the very near future because my sister is a new mum and my brother is at a dangerous point mentally). I don't want anybody to suffer more than they already would. Any attempt to better myself, attempts at socialising for example, making art, talking to GPs, trying medication, feel like I'm just making the most of the last bit of life I have and I want to leave everyone with happier memories. I know the medication and therapy will help, but I know it won't help enough for long term. I just don't have the mental energy to keep up with treatment and pretend to be happy. There's only so much they can do for me, and I have to put the work in. I just have no motivation to do that, I have no energy and feel burnt out all the time for absolutely no reason. I don't work or anything so I'm struggling with the most basic things with no excuse or reason. I'm just not functional and I never will be. I put off talking to the doctors and getting proper help because I'm scared, if I'm given intensive help and it doesn't fix me, that will set things into motion. I'm worried about being completely honest with professionals. I can't continue this way, I'm never really happy, I don't want anything in life except sex. The only things that calm my mind when these thoughts and feelings come to a head are self harming and finding comfort in how quickly it could all be over with just a couple of painkillers. These thoughts and feelings never go away. Killing myself is the first thing I think of when I open my eyes and the last thing before bed. I don't want to do it, it feels against my will and I'm so scared of dying but I feel it coming.

23F, i used to feel really empty, hopeless, lonely and suicidal in my teens. i’d calculate how many pills would be lethal for me and take them, i used to self harm… i haven’t self harmed in idk how long but now the ideation  is back and it scares me. i now have closer friends, a stable relationship, just finished uni with a great result, but i can’t stop the recurring sadness recently. it feels like i’m grieving life from long ago but things were never that great. someone died in may and now i’m thinking of everything else that has been lost. i want to pursue things but i’m insecure even though i do things i love. i don’t know my true purpose and i swing between peace and mindfulness and suicidal thinking and emptiness. someone close to me has shown lots of care and now i crave more of their support but i know it’s not their responsibility and i always tend to hide things more. i’m tired & at work, i cried and hid in a room for a bit. i’m scared, usually i just think of death as an anxious thing now, being afraid to die/ have ill health, but now it’s suicidal again. why ????? it’s not like things are that unbearable either	rr210600	post	21.464088458325538	male	White	0.9767327904701233	na	na	na	1	SuicideWatch	no prediction.

"Well.. this is odd for me.

Generally speaking, I’m not a depressed person. I’ve never really dealt with suicidal thoughts or anything of that sort before. This is all completely new to me, so please go easy on me.

To clear a few things up: I’m a 26 year old guy. I have a dog that I love more than anything, and a very supportive and loving family. I admit, I’m probably more fortunate than most, and I’ve never stopped being thankful for that fact.

I’ve always gone through life trying to be the best person I can be. I genuinely believe in karmic justice.

Recently, actually two days ago, I heard a loud bang in my backyard late late at night. As I’ve done before, I grabbed my handgun and went to investigate. Per usual it was a neighbor doing something dumb way too late. I returned back inside and shook it off, but at this moment a thought entered my mind.

‘I could so easily just *click* and everything would be over’, or something to that extent. I’ve never had this thought before, it concerned me but I didn’t think too much of it. Later, I was sitting in my room watching a movie, and again the thought re-entered my head. ‘Just point, click, lights out, its so easy’.

I started to get really concerned at this point, as the thought continued to return. Currently I’ve reached the point to where I’ve locked my handgun in the fullsized safe I have to further myself from this urge/curiosity (it usually lives in a smaller dedicated drawer safe). I figured that having it further out of reach can only help currently. If the situation progresses my next step is giving the key to a friend and not allowing it to be returned without a note from a medical professional, but we’ll see if it gets to that point.

Now, the thought continues. For no reason. I’m not depressed, i have no desire to die, I have no reason to want to, if anything most of my fear in life revolves around trying NOT to die. But, for whatever reason, the ease and simplicity of this available option just suddenly made itself apparent to me, and now it feels like an itch that needs ti be scratched, if that makes sense. It’s not a desire, it’s an urge.

I want to be completely clear: I know scratching this itch I’ve mentioned is not an option, and is a split second mistake that would end it all, i’m not considering it consciously. It’s just a dark thought that has not gone away in days, and at this point, it’s omnipresent.

Has anyone else experienced something similar? I’ve heard it called the ‘call of the void’. It’s some odd momentary morbid curiosity, sparked by an ultimate control over one’s life (from what I’ve deduced). It really does suck being a generally positive and happy person feeling this way, but the cards we’re dealt right?

I’ve spoken to a support line, who provided me with useful tools to distract myself from it, and I fully plan on getting professional help asap, but until then, I’m hoping to hear from anyone else who has experienced something like this, and what helped.

Thanks for reading

(Side note: the feeling seems to be exclusively around the subject of the handgun. Which is odd, as I’ve been around guns all my life, and always responsible and respectful of them. I handle sharp knives and dangerous tools for work, and this urge hasn’t happened in any other context than the gun.

Also, I don’t want to spark any debate regarding firearms, it’s my situation so I’m being clear about it, nothing more.)

Any advice is appreciated, as i feel like I’m battling a weird dark side of myself I’ve never seen before. It’s extremely odd and staggeringly confusing.

I genuinely appreciate you reading this far, thank you <3"	MikeHoxard981	post	25.072375065108204	male	White	0.017484301701188087	na	na	na	1	SuicideWatch	'ethnicity: no prediction, age: 26, gender: male, explanation: the author clearly states that he is a 26-year-old male. ethnicity cannot be determined from the text.'

"Transwoman, 26 for context. My issues are way too long and numerous to type out everything, so I'll try and keep it simple, but I tend to be bad at that. 

Preface: I have severe depression and I take medication for it which helps immensely, but unfortunately, it doesn't fix everything. My partner makes 90% of our income.

My entire life people have always told me it gets better. I remember being told that in Elementary school, and every situation past that, people would always repeat it. Now, 20-something years later, I'm convinced it was all a lie. I've lost FAR more friends than I've gained (To the point where I don't even really have a support system anymore), my medical issues (both physical and mental) make it so I can't even have a career, I failed out of college, and now here I am, in increasingly higher debt with only more problems on the horizon. Life never got better, it just became different shit.

Did I find a loving partner? Yes. Do I have pets? Yes. Do I want to lose all of that? Of course not. 

But when my financial issues are only getting worse and worse (Not to mention my medical issues), it makes it difficult to go on. I keep thinking about how my partner could have a better life with me gone, especially considering I'm the cause of our financial issues. I can't afford therapy, I can't afford dental visits (which is great when my teeth are in constant pain), and we can barely afford to take our pets to the vets. My partner talks about wanting a house and kids and I know she can never have that with me simply due to our finances. I've tried to make money, I've even tried sex work, but it doesn't come close to helping fill the gap.

I feel like she'd be better off if I died and she found someone else. Would it hurt her emotionally? Obviously. Does that make me feel bad? Of course, sometimes it's the only thing keeping me going. But ultimately, I'm starting to feel like a few years of emotional pain are better than a lifetime of misery because she decided to marry the worthless trash that is me. I literally have to get high every night (It's cheap and legal where I live) just so I don't contemplate suicide while falling asleep each night.

I don't particularly want to die, I'm terrified of the pain. But I just want the pain and misery that's followed me for over 20 years to go away, and I know it never will, so why bother continue? I don't want to hurt my partner, I love her, but it feels like my tolerance for pain can only last for so long."

"I know the feeling. I've bounced back between jobs and emotions and friends and all that shit is frustrating. My wife, like yours, has been my main support system since I first met her and it's been one hell of a trip. We've both got emotional, mental and physical trauma and there's been times we've almost had to have driven the other to the nearest mental ward or facility. 

My rule of thumb; if you wish to hear it, it's better to be in debt and alive than deceased with a dollar to your name. I'm not sure how it works in the state/Canadian province you live in (I'm from Tennessee), but I'm able to go to a state-wide institute called Centerstone that operates a Safety Net program that ensures that people who can't pay for therapy/counseling/case-management services *don't* have to pay until they get proper insurance. 

For pets; We use CareCredit. It's good for anything for your pets from medicine to getting their nails clipped (not declawed, for the love of all that's holy). 

It's hard, life is always going to be hard and we can't tell time when it can go it easy on us; but we can manipulate it at least a little bit for some breathing room. Use that for your partner, use it for your pets, use it for yourself so that you can make ***more*** breathing room for the future.

I was thinking about finally admitting to my therapist that I have suicidal thoughts( I have plans too, but I won't say that). Should I do it? In the agreemant, it says that she'll only report me to authorities if I have a plan to hurt myself or others. Can I trust that, or will she react badly to only thoughts too?

And to those who ended up in a mental hospital for suicidal ideation/attempt, how were you treated there? I only hear about abuse, and that's why I tried to avoid it for so long. And also because my whole family would disown me, because they would think that mental hospital=crazy serial killers. And I would bring an insane amount of shame to my parents in front of my family.

I'm getting closer and closer to take my own life. My only chance of rest and relief is death. I occasionally use alcohol to keep myself from mental breakdowns. I don't want to put my dogs through any more stress, and there is nothing and nobody else who can comfort me. I just want peace and an avarage future for myself. Is it that big of a wish???? Thanks to one of my physical issues, I might end up in a wheelchair in a few years. I will only lose with keeping myself alive. I'll be fucked either way"	DatDoodleDude	post	28.542582907652147	female	White	0.9862194657325745	na	na	na	6	SuicideWatch	no prediction.
It seems like it's been really exhausting for you to keep going in such difficult times, so thank you for pushing forward to this point and being here to post this. I hear you; it's hard to feel like you're getting left behind, to feel isolated. I'm sorry you're not getting the support you need; nobody deserves to be in this much pain, and I wish I could help more. You probably already know this but please remember that everybody moves at their own pace and there's more than one way to have a fulfilling life, or at least find a way to ease the pain without ending your life completely. I'm sure you've been fighting for a long time already so of course it makes sense that you're getting tired of it, that's only natural, but maybe there is still a way forward. Is there anybody you can talk to so you don't have to shoulder the burden alone? If not, I'm glad you're here and I hope writing this brought you some relief.

"I’ve been in a psychiatric hospital before, so I may be able to give some insight.

I was very open with my psychiatrist but I oddly didn’t think it was dangerous. She told me that I had the choice to voluntarily go to the ER or she would make the police take me. It was definitely a “oh shit” moment. I chose to go by myself and was able to pack a bag of necessities and wear clothing/shoes that would be allowed.

Typically, you go to the ER first and then you are assessed. I was kept intake for a super long time because they had to see if a bed was open and do basic tests. I was allowed to have someone with me though. 

The psych ward I was sent to wasn’t a long term one. I was placed on a 5150 hold (72 hrs) but was kept for 10 days total. Honestly, it was so chill. I didn’t have to think about anything, attended group therapy and 1:1 sessions with my assigned therapist and psychiatrist, and just hung out. It gave me a lot of time to think about why I was there, especially after seeing the other patients.

But I know that depends on your city. My psychiatrist told me which hospital to go to because they had a great psych program. She warned that if I went to the major city hospital, that it would be more chaotic and possibly traumatic for me. (They bring substance abuse folks to the psych ward too if they’re experiencing psychosis.) 

I think you should go. Find a hospital with a reputable psych program and call ahead to see if they have room. They will most likely tell you to go through the ER. 

If you’re worried about judgement front your family, you don’t have to tell them right away. 

I often consider going back when I feel dangerous. It was a good way to get my meds adjusted and to block out the world for a bit."	DatDoodleDude	reply	na	na	na	0.9862194657325745	no	strong	no	na	SuicideWatch	no prediction.
"Thank you for the kind words.
Yes, I've been indeed suffering for a long time. I've had both mental and physical issues since I was an infant, making my parents life a living nightmare. 

While I know everyone go at their own pace, it still bothers me that I'm almost 21, and never had a proper job, only a few weeks voluntary work as a janitor+gardener in a kindergarten 2 years ago. I've only been switchin between therapy and college (the two can't be done at the same time, and I keep falling back)

I have my IRL friends I can talk to through group chat, and they're amazing, they do their best in supporting me. My mom can help in very minor issues, and my dad will either turn it into a screaming match, put words into my mouth, invalidate, or gaslight me.

"The ER part is something I hope I can skip. The local hospital is so awful in every part, that even the workers will advise you to avoid it at all costs. Trauma is guaranteed from the mistreatment. By my mom's and others' experiences, ER doctors will make sure that you know that you're a burden to them, and you waste their time if you're not actively dying. If you're not actively/knowingly dying, they will even refuse examinations and send you away saying you're fine. The nurses had to beg the doctor to check my mom, because she became immobile from the pain. The next hospital is an hour away

And my family is very nosy, they'll find out somehow. I'm lucky they don't know about my therapist yet. My sisters would be nice about it, but I get in trouble if I dare to talk to them about my problems and they find out about this stuff.

For the past 4 years I've made many bad decisions / acted in ways that have negatively impacted my life. Within these past years I quit my stable job, ended friendships I cherished and gambled away most of my life savings only leaving enough for rent. The regret is overwhelming. And I feel that I've been doing these things to build a solid case for taking my own life. I have no more ambition and have been distracting myself with hobbies and games. Music I loved now makes me feel nothing. The only important person left in my life is my mom who I've let down too many times. I'm only waiting for her to naturally pass on before I end it to avoid hurting her and I feel like the shittiest person for thinking this way. I just don't want to exist anymore.

"I'm 22 and she's 21. We have been together since we were 16. 3 days ago she came back after a month from abroad. She was working in a garden (due to her studies) and she ended up in a festival.

She said she still loves me but dont want to be in a relationship with me. We were planning living together soon and we planned a vacation. It is supposed to be in 8 days, we have the flight tickets, accomodation and everything. She still wants to go but as friends. 
In this 3 days I cant sleep, I cant eat, I'm constanlty throwing up and I cant stop crying. I still love her, she is my first GF, my first kiss, my first everything. And literally my everything.

ghost her.

block her number and her socials everywhere, don't answer anything and don't ask anything. block her family, friends and anything that reminds you of her.

go see a psychiatrist (I am not kidding), you very likely will need to take some meds in order to rebalance your brain chemistry.

don't dwell over it. It has nothing to do with your value as a romantic partner. you did NOTHING wrong.

"my current boyfriend’s first love was with him for 5 years. maxed out all his credit cards one day, cheated on him and ghosted him. then came back crying saying it was a mistake. he took her back and she repeated the cheating soon after. He was on suicide watch for a while. Had to file for bankruptcy. Had to go live back home with his parents for a while.

But now he tells me he doesn’t even remember what he liked about her. As in he’s no longer interested. He has a great job, his own place, lots of friends and a girlfriend that isn’t interested in cheating what so ever.

..And she is a single mother of 3 (all by different dads) who still lives at home with her mom in a small redneck town.

"It’s interesting that she ended things because it creates such an illusion of power. She’s the one who humiliated herself. You have some class. Come on, multiple guys and trying drugs was the “best time of her life.” There are way more ways to have fun that don’t require risking STDs and ruining the neurological function of your brain. Maybe since you’ve been partners since 16, doing these things provide some rush for her. That will go away, but when it does you better be far away. That’s her mess 

Do you think you still would’ve been happy with her if she told you that she’s a cereal cheater and stayed with you? You lost someone and not just because she cheated and ended things before you could; she wasn’t the person you thought she was. Maybe you’re holding onto her because to let the mental hold on her go might make you feel like she never loved you. You have to look out for yourself. Think of it like survival of the fittest 😳 (fr though). You need good, solid people in your life. Who you associate with says a lot about you as a person 

Check to see whether your airline will let you cancel your flight and cancel any reservations. Now that speaks volumes about you as a person.

You are both very young and maybe just need some freedom to figure yourself out. It sounds like that’s what she went and did. It was shitty of her to cheat, period. But she is also human, she’s not the first to and won’t be the last in humanity Im sure. If you can find it in yourself to forgive her and remain friends -wonderful, it makes you a better person for being able to so. And by forgive I don’t mean let someone continue to treat you like that. That’s not okay. I mean accept it for what it is and still have respect for each other enough to be friends kind of thing.

It's completely normal to feel devastated in your situation, she was such an important person for quite some time, and it seems to be your first break up. The first serious break up always feels like that, like you'll never get over it and the pain is just overwhelming. I promise you it will pass. It always passes, even if you can't imagine right now. you might feel terrible for weeks or months, and during that time you'll likely glorify her and the relationship you had, think of her all the time, be reminded of her wherever you go etc. But at some point it will lessen and you'll be fine on your own or open for somebody new. you won't be grieving this girl forever, in a couple of years you'll simply remember her as your first girlfriend that didn't work out and that's that. you'll be happy she's an ex because she cheated on you and you'll be with a girl who doesn't. you'll be fine, you just have to get through this. I'd avoid contact with her, it will make it easier for you to get over her.

"I'll just add a lil something extra here - Do not go on this trip with her, despite how badly you're attached to her. And that's what this is; this isn't just love, this is attachment. And you're attached to something toxic, please believe that. Multiple guys, trying drugs for the first time and having the time of her life... Your EX-gf has issues, and her shallow sense of joy will turn into misery and loneliness in due time. When that time comes, she might even reach back out to you. If she ever does, ignore her. You don't need someone like this in your life - people like her only bring misery and misuse. This woman is biohazard level toxic. She's doing you a favour by leaving; please believe that. You may not see it now, but as you get older and as you grow and have more life experience, you'll realise it. Right now, it's hard to see beyond her because of your limited life experience and understanding, which is what has shaped your perspective. So, it's very hard to see beyond your pain and hurt right now, and beyond your emotional and perhaps even spiritual attachment to her. Yes, you love her. But you're very much attached to her, and attachment is NEVER good.

When you get older and have more experience, you'd see that you can completely love someone without being attached to them. Right now, she seems to be your entire identity. But she isn't. She's just a character (obviously a villain) in your book of life, and her chapter started when you were 16. For now, her chapter ends, and you should let it end. You are the protagonist in your life and there are still many more chapters to go, filled with many other people. Some will be villainous, some will be friends. Some may turn out as friends, and later reveal themselves to be villains. In fact, you might be the villain in someone else's story, at some point, and they might have to cut ties with you in order to preserve themselves, just like you have to do now with your gf. And other times the life of others, you might be a hero or ally. This is just life, and it doesn't end when someone decides they no longer want you. And if this someone is riddled with red flags and biohazard signs (like your EX-gf is), then they've done you the greatest courtesy and greatest service. And to honor that act of kindness, you should respect their choice to leave you. Why? Because while you deserve love, you do not deserve to be played with, toyed with, used, manipulated, hurt and most of all, by someone with every intention to do so, and to buy someone who's done so, carelessly and callously."	klmn-bence	reply	na	na	na	0.9966651797294617	weak	no	no	na	SuicideWatch	no prediction.

"I would go on vacation, have fun. Now y'all are just friends so enjoy it. I have ex-girlfriends that I am still friends with. If it is meant to be with her, she will miss being with you and come back, if not, it is not the end of the world. You will find someone else.

Do you want to be with someone that cheats on you? Are you capable of being non-monogamous? If you want to also be non-monogamous maybe she would be open to that. I would just take some time to yourself first though. Go to the gym, pause social media, etc and then reboot yourself as a new person.

She is the only person you have been with, how do you know you will not find someone ten times better than her? Because honestly if she would cheat on you, and you are not comfortable with that you deserve better than that. I would work on self-esteem by exercising and going to the gym, which will also help with depressive feelings.

Don't beat yourself up too much. I have also been rejected a million times and had girls that I was madly in love with break up with me. But I have also been the other way around. It hurt at first but over time it hurts less and less.

Hurting this way today will help you in the future though. The pain you feel now gives you the ability to feel empathy more deeply and allows you to be more compassionate towards others. I would embrace that as helping others can be very rewarding to your mental health.

I also ran your post through AI a few times and it said this:

&#x200B;

I understand this is an incredibly painful situation, but please do not harm yourself. There are healthy ways to move forward from here:  
Consider seeking counseling or calling a crisis line to help work through your feelings. You need support right now.

  
Focus on self-care - make sure you're eating, sleeping, exercising. It will help with emotional regulation.

  
Lean on friends/family for comfort and companionship during this transition.

  
Allow yourself to grieve the relationship, but don't let it consume you. Fill your time with activities unrelated to her.

  
Communicate your feelings, but avoid pressuring her into continuing the relationship. That would be unhealthy.

  
If the trip together would be too painful, it's okay to cancel. Your well-being comes first.  
Reflect on what you contributed to the relationship ending and how you can grow. But don't blame yourself either.

  
In time, your heartache will heal. You will be able to have happiness and meaningful relationships again. This pain is temporary.

  
You have so much life ahead of you, even if it doesn't feel that way right now. With support and resilience, you will get through this. Stay strong and know there are many who care about you."	klmn-bence	reply	na	na	na	0.9966651797294617	weak	strong	no	na	SuicideWatch	no prediction.
"I've been in your mind state before ""This person completes me"" ""I am dependent on this person. I'll kill myself if she doesn't like me back"" I went through years being completely into someone like this and it wasn't okay. I did shitty things, I missed out on opportunities to make friends, ruined relationships or move on, and if you did go through it you won't live to see things get better. I moved on and I navigated through life the best I could; I am very thankful for that. I improved a lot. I have ways to go, but I am better than where I was. 

I'd say the only thing is that, it worked out somehow and we're together. Maybe because I wasn't acting like a whiny manipulative incel at some point before we got together. You will survive this, that's saying as someone with BPD. It worked out for me. Maybe you two will be together again after the passage of time or maybe you won't. ((Our situations differ since we weren't together and at the time my interest was maybe one sided))  


You can't hold onto this, you have to move on. You're not okay, either go on this vacation alone and have fun or cancel it then get yourself some help. Take some time alone but don't push others away. End this friendship if it's best for you. I'm not good at this, but this is the best I could do.

Block her on everything and never talk to her again, do this impulsively, don't think about it. Grieve the relationship if you want but at the end of the day accept that she's a hoe and you're better off without her. No need to get revenge or anything, you are already better than her as you were faithful, as hard as it may be you gotta try to move on, it may take a long time or a short time but you can do it. As for the vacation you could either go alone if you got separate tickets and enjoy yourself, or you could sell the ticket and go somewhere else or something, but again cut off all contact with her, as corny as it sounds she belongs to the streets now, you can't save a hoe, especially one that doesn't want to be saved.

Trauma can affect and change the brain, including it's chemistry (usually mental and mood disorders are also caused by chemical imbalance!) OPs chemicals that affect mood might have plummeted waaaay towards negative than what's healthy. It can be permanent (depression) and temporary (grief) but medication can help in both cases to restore a healthy balance as to avoid anything lethal (suicide). However, if OP doesn't already have a history of low mood, then they need to get to a psych/therapist to make sure they get counseling so there's coping mechanisms established and a healthy routine maintained to ensure this doesn't become permanent :) either way: they should definitely see a therapist	klmn-bence	reply	na	na	na	0.9966651797294617	no	no	no	na	SuicideWatch	no prediction.

I do find myself comparing new love interests to him occasionally and stop myself. Remembering that he obviously was not my person helps.

"I've been suicidal since I was about 16 and tried a few times keep failing cause I fill up with fear when push comes to shove and end up picking a method not guaranteed to kill me. I've tried every medication available, seen many different shrinks and therapists, tried all sorts of herbal remedies and nothing has come close to helping.

Not only that, life only continues to get worse from it. I was married for a long time and the strain my depression put on my spouse eventually led to them cracking and deciding to call the police on me and lie about me threatening to kill her. I instead had threatened to kill myself, verified because of texts pulled from her phone to her secret lover I didn't know about that she married a week after divorce she filed for while I was stuck in jail for 6 months in the violent offender pod. I was beaten half to death over not wanting to give a brownie a friend bought me to the pods bully by him and 5 of his followers, and then refused medical care by the guards and instead thrown in isolation for starting a fight, which I spent the rest of my time in there.

My family completely shunned me and wouldn't even answer my calls while I was in there until they learned of my now ex wife's extremely fast remarriage, when they suspected something fishy might have happened. Now several of my bones have healed improperly and I'm in constant physical pain as well as the mental pain.

The few friends I had at the time all shunned me and still shun me, not believing the charges against me had been dropped. I now feel even more alone than I did before.

My place of employment took me back but for 50% of the pay I was making and pretty much assured me my ability to promote was shot. I've tried applying elsewhere but fail every background check since the felony charge still appears on the report, even if you don't get convicted.

My daughter was taken from my ex wife for many stunts she pulled while I was in jail but custody was not granted to me upon release due to me now having no financial stability or a place to live, and my ability to get a new place to live was non existent due to being evicted while in jail. I also had my car repossessed so that's gone but the debt for it isn't. She was sent to live with my parents who pretty much want nothing to do with me since I called them out for the abuse I went through as a child so many times. They have always been very kind to my daughter and stayed in contact with me to be able to continue to be in her life, which I never had qualms with given the way they treated her and since she definitely loves them. Now that I don't have her I'm nothing but an afterthought to them.

I think I'm finally at the point where I'm more scared to stay alive than I am to die. It seems like the world really does not want me here, I've tried making some new friends and despite how nice and friendly I act nobody ends up wanting to hang out or even share numbers. I guess I'm either really awkward or boring but can't figure it out since I have nobody to get feedback from. I also have nobody to reach out to. People at work ""like"" me but its only because I work hard and help out others whenever I can. Outside of that nobody really talks to me unless I initiate it or ever offers to hang out or even talk outside of work. 

I'm so lonely and I don't think things are going to get better, only worse. I'm in constant pain and no real way to do anything about that. No support system, emotional pain that won't heal from the betrayal of the only person I ever felt loved me. No way to go to therapy. Mental hospitals nearby are beyond terrible and do more harm than good. I still take medicine that I got funded through a program but it doesn't work.

I guess I still have some form of hope inside me or I wouldn't be typing all this out. If anyone cares enough to read this I'm on my last leg and don't know what to do.

"Hi there. I hate feeling like I’m upsetting people or bothering them when I bring up my depression, but at the same time it hurts never sharing anything about how I feel. I’m always afraid to say a word to anybody in my life about what I’m going through and I don’t think there’s anyone who’d care to hear me explain myself. But maybe someone here will be different. If you’re going through anything similar, I’d love to chat. I’m tired always feeling so alone. Then again, maybe nobody will reply to this or reach out. 

For anyone curious about what I’m like: I’m 23 and on the verge of turning 24. Technically young, but when you feel as un exceptional as unaccomplished as I do, you really feel old. I’m biracial, yet nobody ever acknowledges/respects me as one of the races I am, and always makes me feel lesser than for not looking the same as other people my race. I used to be told by people how bright I was and how many great things I could do someday, but now I have found myself completely stuck in a stagnant life with little progress being made and too many failures and regrets to count. Had one long term relationship with an abusive and toxic ex (yet somehow I feel bad it ended even a year later), go job to job and don’t know what I want to do (blew maybe my biggest opportunity because it’s stress was overwhelming and made me even more miserable than I am currently, but it was probably my last shot at a career). I struggle with my fluctuating weight and eating disorders/body image, and have crippling anxiety over every day things. Sometimes I wish I could just get hit by a car and die, yet at the same time I have a crippling fear of death and the unknown and being alone forever has become a legitimate fear of mine.

Hi. I've read your other comments but can you explain why you feel this way? I won't deny any of the pain you're going through and have been through but you said that you feel like a terrible person.

Sounds like you're a good person from how much you care about those close to you.I hope you make it through this I'm sorry it's gotten this hard	EndItAll77	reply	na	na	na	0.9914434552192688	weak	no	strong	na	SuicideWatch	no prediction.
"I'm not really sure of the position you are in with your friends but from personal experience, sometimes it is worth telling people. Trust me, they do notice. But they are not always sure if they should say anything about it.
I have a very very good online friend and at some point something similar happened. I ended up reaching out to him and just saying I'm not really okay but I'm managing. It didn't change how he looked or talked to me. But I always knew I could reach out and he would help or distract me from pain. We have kept it up for years by this point. 
It's worth a shot imo but you know yourself and your friends the best. A simple dm can change a lot.
Life is tough and it will sadly never be easy. But it's worth a shot, even if it's only for other people. If you don't feel like you are a good person, is there anything you could do to make yourself feel better? Maybe it's time to start over?
I hope the pain eases soon and you find your way"	EndItAll77	reply	na	na	na	0.9914434552192688	weak	strong	no	na	SuicideWatch	no prediction.

By urges are you meaning depressive waves? These can tend to kind of feed into each other and create a vicious cycle. The problem doesn't seem like you having them but the circumstances causing them. Good people suffer and have feelings. You have obviously shown that by thinking about others before acting on even the worst of emotions. Does this not make you at least some of a good person?

I have struggled a lot with friendships my whole life. I'm very introverted, shy and awkward so I have a really hard time fitting in with any group. It hurts so bad to see everyone else having a good time together while I'm alone. But I have developed some really great friends as I got older. When I was younger I couldn't see that far ahead and thought I would be alone forever. Plus I would rather have no friends than fake friends anyway.

I think I fucked up big time. If I don’t want to be forever alone I need to find another unicorn, another woman who doesn’t mind the fact that I’m not masculine or fit standards for men.

I got so lucky meeting her, but I seriously believe no other woman would ever want me. I’m shorter than almost all other men with a “feminine” personality and small dick to go along with it. I feel disgusting, like vile waste of a failed task of creating a “man.”

I don’t even identify with the label of a man, I can’t, I don’t fit the description. I’m like a permanent little boy with a personality everyone thinks is gay, especially women.

"> you can not let others have such a grip on your self worth 

But that is the only thing that matters, how I’m viewed. If everyone (especially women) think I’m gay and unattractive I’ll always be lonely. At this point the idea of a women loving me and finding me attractive might as well be alien, I’ve never experienced it and I don’t think I ever will.

> Find things to be passionate about

I do have passions and hobbies, but that doesn’t matter. They make no difference to me because at the end of the day I’m still a rat of a person

> work out

I do work out, but it won’t ever make me taller, or my dick bigger, or my personality less flamboyant. I’ll still be a short boyish twink no matter what I do unless I can find how to access the character creation screen again

> friendships with other guys

I do have friends, but that doesn’t help this situation. I’m well liked, but just insanely unattractive. It actually makes it more obvious, my friends love me, my coworkers love me, my clients/customers love me, but yet I’ve only ever had a single gf who wasn’t even into me.

"Ive tried , ive really tried
Im a realist, and know there is no way to improve my situation and the only logical and rational thing to do it end this torture .

Ive been diagnosed with CVI ( chronic venous insufficency) due to chronic deep venous reflux behind my knee.

Im 37

I had a DVT on left leg eight years ago and had no symptoms that im experiencing untill eight months ago.

Co incidentally this all happened when i discontinued my snri ( venlafaxine ) anti depressant after seven years use and gp prescribed lyrica ( pregabolin ) which ive now stopped

Since then my feet go bright red , veins swell, pulsating , itchy and restless . 
only “ relief “ is to lay down all day with them elevated to
drain them .

Seen a vascular doc and says cant be operated on , and ONLY “ treatment “
is compression socks which dont do anything at all to help .

As a result i cant
work without extreme discomfort , cant go put with friends , cant date ( also left with PSSD) from
snri use and cant even go do weight training without massive flairs.
The gym has been my only continuity in life for 18 years  and always helped my mental healrh.
With that taken away from me is the last staw.

I ended up in psych ward
for first time ever in Febuary and was all due to this since i couldnt sleep and became depressed and hysterical.

All they done was get me hooked on a benzo ( klonopin) which im now tapering and is adding to this hellish existance.

Still live at home and impossiboe to build for a future as limited work wise , sleep all over the place, cant date , go gigs or even gym now.

Psych is pointless as will jusy make me “ care less “ about my situation.

I truly beleive ive exhausted all options and this is rational .
I mean even with cancer id have hope as there be a treatment to help and hope would be there .

Anyways , i plan on with taking huge dose pf
clonazepam , mixed with lots pregabolin, zopiclone sleeping pills and litre of whisky to cause respirtory depression.
Either that or hanging.
Think option one be least painful as will go into a forever sleep ."	paulm19855	post	33.63932203980097	male	White	0.9986530542373657	na	na	na	3	SuicideWatch	failed

"Hi, I'm a junior in high school and I've had suicidal ideation since the start of this year. I don't have many friends since I lost most of them when I switched schools in 7th grade and I lost all of my confidence in make any because of anxiety, having a speech disorder, a soft-spoken voice, and I suck at conversations. I keep having doubts about myself because I know I can't become social again. I also compare myself to the other kids because I can't help but to think they're doing better than I am, even though that's probably not true. Because of that along with depression, lack of motivation to do things, and other stuff, I haven't been doing well in school at all. I ignored 2 introduction projects and an essay I had to do because I really don't give a shit about school anymore and for the projects I know I can't pull it off, considering how bad the last time I had to present something went. I have a counselor and I'm getting a therapist soon, but even then I still don't feel good about my situation. Another problem I feel terrible about is not having a partner. Now I know I shouldn't be thinking about that at the moment, but I can't stop yearning for it after years of not having any good female interaction, shit even a female friend is good enough for me.

I have a lot of supportive people in my life, but I still feel like ending it all. I want to because I feel like I won't see light at the end of the tunnel, and I feel useless and like a burden to everyone I know. At the same time though I want to continue doing the things I love doing and living for the people that love me. But what if they're all dead years later, what then? I feel conflicted and I don't know what to do.

"People say ""don't isolate, meet people"", ""things will get better"".... I am trying to stay alive a bit longer so I can get my cat a safe place to stay and to do that I pretend to be normal and meet people for everyday things. Yesterday I went to have a coffee and then the movies with an acquaintance. I could barely keep it together during our meeting - every time family or partners are mentioned I get extremely sad, as I have nobody. Even in movies, I can barely keep to together. I feel so out of place and ashamed to be so alone. To have no one care for me. I started crying on the way home in public transport, and could not stop crying once I arrived at my place of living. I am still crying today. I had planned to meet my neighbour and eat something, but I had to cancel. I can't pretend anymore. She will mention her family, her brother who's getting married, her sisters and parents and so on. I will have to try not to tear up, thinking I have nothing of the kind. My family is dead, those who are alive are distant.  I want to go home but there is no home to go to. I don't know what to do with myself. I can't live and I don't know how to die. I'm in hell. I haven't eaten anything since then. How long till I die? I know I will give in and eat at some point because I'm weak. I just wish I had a hear attack or something...

I can't even go out by myself and I always have mental breakdowns when I see people being successful and normal ( jobs, friends, relationships, money) while I'm a failure and can't even function so I kind of understand what you are saying. This feeling is very hard to cope with, especially when you are alone and I feel very bad for you and anyone who has to experience this. I've never been in a relationship in my whole life and I don't have any friends and seeing people triggers me cause they sometimes judge and act nasty while I'm scared of them and want to run. I'm basically living like I'm in solitary confinement and in the rare moments where I drag myself to go outside at the insistence of my mother, I get anxious, panic attacks or mental breakdowns cause I see normalcy, something that I will never have.

Last year, my ex tried killing herself in front of me, I’ve been addicted to a couple of different substances for a little bit, and I just got out of a wreck. Not suicidal whatsoever, actually pretty happy. 

If y’all need someone to talk to, do that. It doesn’t have to be a $200 visit every time you talk to friends, even a convo would be enough to keep you from going off the deep end.

"To put it bluntly, financially it is impossible for me to get a therapist. Everywhere I go I always get told to ""GET A THERAPIST GET A THERAPIST"" and I'm so fucking tired of it. No not everyone can just get a therapist and I'm just forced to take the brunt of all this negativity in my life. Maybe I should just go commit some terrible crime. If I try to run someone over or drug myself to an OD then maybe I can get some help AFTER the attempted murder / self harm has occurred. The system only cares if the act has already been done and I know from personal experience any act of the sort will immediately be followed by being treated almost like a criminal.  


At this point, if I'm going to be treated like one I should be one. Someone please talk me out of this before I am forced to force the state to give a shit long enough to speak to a medical professional. It's the only way to stop wanting to kill my self."

however recently i’ve been sitting on my balcony, just wondering “what if i just jumped”, every day i’m getting a little closer to the edge. It’s not a long fall, i live on the first floor, it won’t kill me but if i aim correctly it could seriously injure me.

Plus every time im in that position, knowing i could just jump and things would get better cause i would be taken seriously, i feel alive. like a genuine rush of adrenaline. I look forward to nighttime cause i know i can sit on the edge of my balcony and just wonder if this is the day i jump. 


And maybe it is, cause i’m tired of feeling like this. and i want to know what it feels like to jump off, i want to feel the intense pain of my bones breaking and i want to get close to dying, but still survive.

I'd characterize what you're describing here as suicidal ideation without intent, and that's actually really common.

It's not okay that people treat you cruelly and I'm so sorry you've been hurting for so long. I've had similar feelings about my friends not needing me; I don't know if this helps at all but I think sometimes people also just get so caught up in their own lives that they forget to reach out. My sister always thought that people didn't like her because they wouldn't be the first to ask her to hang out, but it turned out that they did enjoy her company and had just gotten used to her being the one to organize their get togethers. Of course I don't know what's happening with your specific situation, but just generally, sometimes people we care about do things we don't understand because we don't have all the information. And it's totally understandable to be frustrated about that. You're right, I can't promise you that things will get better, but I can say that I'm glad you're here with us right now to reach out for help, and I hope you find something that brings you comfort today.

"i'm sitting in the bathroom stall with a razor blade and a bottle of pills. I am going to end my life tonight because this pain has gone on far too long. my mom kicked me out 3 months ago after I came out as trans and have been living in a youth shelter ever since but I'm getting bullied a lot here. I can't take this madness anymore…it's done. it's fucking over. I have finally reached a tipping point. I wrote my final note everything is ready to go. My mom disowned me three months ago and kicked me out the very day I came out as transgender. Now I find myself in a youth shelter where I’m constantly bullied. People intentionally bump into me and say thing like “faggot” and tell me that I should kill myself because “all trans people belong in hell.” I have just had enough. Staff don’t address the issue, they just stay on their phones all day and night. 

I don’t feel safe from myself or others. I’m tired, I’m lonely, I’m scared, I’m angry, I’m…done. I have nobody. My dad left when I was 13 years old after molesting me on a daily basis. Things were good after he left. My mom and I were happy. I never really dealt with that trauma until now. I brushed it off but now it’s all crashing at me at once. I am not equip to handle this. Fight or flight? I choose flight. Bye.

i am trying so hard to brush things aside and keep living, but I just can't anymore. I can't do it. I can't bare the thought of waking up tomorrow feeling the same way, facing the same issues. I can't bare the thought of knowing I'm going to continue to get bullied and disowned and unloved by everyone. I don't even love myself. Never have, never will. I feel so weak for even having these feelings, but I can't help it. I can't control other people…I know that, but I can't even control myself anymore. I want to die so freaking bad that it  physically hurts. I have never wanted anything in this world more than to enter a void of nothingness forever. That’s where I am going. 

I know that deep down I want the help, but a bigger part of me wants…no NEEDS to end all the pain, and today i the day I fucking make it happen."	MadresSpaghetti	post	13.501393096697461	female	White	0.9981532692909241	na	na	na	1	SuicideWatch	failed

"To sum things up, the recent ‘advancements’ in AI have broken me. Truly this time. I am a 20 year old creative type. The recent AI softwares that can create new art, music etc out of thin air have sent me into a downward spiral like never before. I am depressed that things we actually want to do are being automated and ruined. 

I dreamt a couple of nights ago that the AI softwares of the last 1.5 years disappeared forever. Specifically the ones that do creative tasks like generate images, music, clone voices, write stories and more.

I was halfway through a deep dream and it suddenly panned to me standing around lots of my family members and friends (Dream logic). I asked what we were doing and my brother told me that the AI systems were poofed out of existence and they would stay gone forever. He also added that all the AI companies had vanished and their revenue was going to be distributed to everyone so we wouldn’t have to work and could focus on doing what we wanted, like creativity (Again, dream logic). 

I got so unbelievably happy it was crazy. I was the happiest I had been since before April 2022 when I saw Dall-E 2 for the first time. I started jumping as high as the clouds and screaming out loud with joy. The thing I wanted most had happened. No longer would creativity be automated. No longer would I have to be paranoid if the image I was looking at or the voice I was listening to was AI made. Creativity was now back where it should be. Not being endlessly generated by machines.

I came down from the clouds and ran towards my former university and met up with my fellow artist friends, as well as some strangers who had joined them since they now had time to make art. We spent the whole day creating to our hearts content, enjoying the process the whole way. We made every dream project we’d ever wanted. We loved that we could appreciate the human meaning and effort behind it all. 

Then the dream panned to something unrelated and I woke up. I kid you not, I fucking cried. I remembered that these terrible AI’s exist and won’t go away. I kinda hate my mind for giving me false hope like that. I want nothing more then for my dream to be a reality, but I know it cannot and it’s killing me. I’ve never been truly suicidal before, but being faced with the real possibility of loosing my purpose, as well as art as a whole being automated and ruined, I have fallen into that mindset."

"Well, if it’s any consolation, there IS hope regarding this subject.

I completely agree that AI is a scary new thing, but in a world of people supporting *people* I think we still have a solid place in this world. The human touch isn’t going anywhere, I promise you that.

Tremendous value is placed on the handmade, the human touch, that unmistakable story behind anything (whether that be design, art, music, goods/services) which people value. 

I truly believe the power of kinship among people will always endure, we value the connection our own creations bring eachother. 

I fully admit, I’m speaking in generalities here. But it’s a massive topic to discuss in this forum. But, in my opinion, the quicker AI develops, the more people become wary of it, and the more that people become wary of it, the more value is placed on human produced things. So, in an odd way, the sudden AI explosion is better than AI being a slow introduction that people become comfortable with. People don’t like aggressive change, so there’s absolutely hope!

Admittedly I’ve considered this myself, and although cautious and concerned, I’m beyond confident it will level out and a happy medium will be achieved:) I can’t begin to imagine the legislation being drawn up in law offices around the world regarding limiting AI’s legal uses and applications, we’re in for a wild ride of tech companies getting sued haha.

Hey guys, I'm only 18, this is a shorter version of my first post. Basically I was lured by my ex girlfriend and she set me up to be robbed at gunpoint and i got so depressed i ended up in the mental hospital. There they misdiagnosed me with bipolar and psychosis when i was only depressed and forcefully injected me with 2 injections of the proven to be most damaging antipsychotic, invega sustenna. Lot's of people say they never recovered from it ever and it lasts 6-12 months in the body, it turned me to a flat emotionless robotic zombie who gets no joy from ANYTHING, it blocks serotonin and dopamine completely it literally says that on it's website, I can't cry, can only feel fear and anger and depression. I have extreme erectile dyfunction, no feeling in genitals, extreme memory loss, extreme brain fog, extreme cognitive impairment, no motivation, can't have a job, can't study because of extreme cognitive impairment and inability to understand anything, can't get drunk or high, parkinsons, brain damage, no appetite, can't even taste food, lots of weight gain, it literally killed my soul. I can't lawsuit because the shit psychiatrist might bring up my legal history or something and no one will probably even start the case, I don't know what to do guys i'm extremely depressed and need help! I feel like i'm braindead. Everyday is shit. I really need help please help me out guys.

I have depression as well. They tried to tell me I was bipolar and also gave me anti psychotic medicine. It fucked me up a little.

So I told a good friend about the overdose I had taken. I have never attempted suicide before but I have had suicidal thoughts and I have felt suicidal. She did show concern/ care but the next day she didn't even message to check in on me. Maybe I'm being unreasonable but it has got to me because I thought she would have text the next day to check in on me.

I felt like posting here for a change. Will preface this with the fact that I've been diagnosed with BPD at 19 (now 20, days away from 21), been through a few therapists with no improvements whatsoever and life is a living nightmare. My moods usually change quickly due to the condition itself, from the smallest of things. I'm not sure who I am at times. But I'm concerned: I've been ruminating on ending my life *for days* now. Never happened before. I tried dying before, and my arms are cut up to the point I wear long sleeves even in the hottest weather, but it's different now. This time I've been trying to reach out for help to the people I love most, but indirecty. And I feel so fake for hiding like this, but I'm always too scared to overwhelm people so I never let my real thoughts flow. And I just can't keep doing this. I don't even think I should be talking about this so openly online honestly but I just want to get my thoughts out again. I'm tired, and I don't think I wanna live with this thing anymore. I don't look forward to a life of therapy to struggle and barely have a normal life after years of work. I wish things would be different, I do, but I can't change much and I feel powerless. I'm trying to think of ways to go. Have pondered everything, there are lots of things to consider. But my only wish is to stop my brain from being aware. Death would be best, but I'd settle for being left basically brain-dead unaware. I just need this piece of shit thought sponge to finally stop thinking and feeling. The pain is too immense and the constant paranoia, self sabotage and self harm from minor things is not worth the moments of happiness far between. If I regret one thing is that I know I'd have so much more love left to give for others, and I'm truly sorry for that - but I hate myself so much, so so indescribably much for being this sick and inadequate for life. I wish I could watch myself hang and struggle as a spectator, that's how much I've come to despise this body and mind ugh It's keeping me from everything I've ever wanted in life. And I'm done, I really am. I won't hear any you're so young, just imagining another 10, 20, 50 years like this makes me want to puke. I don't hope for any heaven, I hope there's an endless void, or even better that we get another shot at life so maybe maybe I could be normal. Or a dream world where I could dream about what makes me happy. I wish everyone reading this the best 🩷	medinacriedtoday	post	20.8894268449656	female	White	0.9985069632530212	na	na	na	2	SuicideWatch	no prediction.
"I just want you to know, you’re a special, beautiful person who deserves to be happy as much as anyone else. I truly believe there is a bright future ahead of you.

You obviously care about others tremendously, and want nothing but the best for people. THAT alone is reason enough to stick around. We need more people like you, truly good people. Sure, maybe some issues to work out, but at your core a good soul.

Things DO get better. The really truly do.

I’m not going to pretend to know exactly what you’re going through, but, that doesn’t mean I (or anyone else) can’t listen and learn about the beautiful human being who is you.

I had a roommate for years with severe BPD and I’ve seen what torment it caused him. Of course, you and he are different people, i’m not comparing. But, I want you to understand I’m not downplaying your situation. You are heard.

"fellow PWBPD here, i understand your struggle. its a horrible, horrible illness and i wouldnt wish it on my worst enemy.

the one specific piece of advise i can give you right now is to open up about these feelings to at least one of the people you love. 

write yourself a list of things you would like those that care about you to know and work through it with one of those people in a nice, calm setting. 

their first reaction may then be quite panicked, dont let yourself be misguided by that. explain that you do not want to have these thoughts and that you truly do want somebody to help you through them.

i can promise you that people dont mind being overwhelmed as much as they would mind having to go on without you."	medinacriedtoday	reply	na	na	na	0.9985069632530212	weak	strong	no	na	SuicideWatch	no prediction.

I don't want you to feel upset or pressured into prolonging your pain because it seems like you're going through a really hard time right now, but maybe someone else, whether it's a professional or not, can help you through and shoulder some of the burden with you so that you don't have to struggle alone.	frostye84	reply	na	na	na	0.9896621704101562	strong	no	strong	na	SuicideWatch	no prediction.

I don't know what to say other than that there are so many suicide survivors who have found their way out of impossible situations - but of course I'm sure you know that - and I think it's worth making sure you've exhausted all your possible options before committing to giving up something you love.

I have my reasons, like anyone else, and I’m just done. I can’t do it anymore. Truthfully, the only thing has ever kept me going are my cats but I don’t even have them right now and my best friend in the entire universe passed away 3 weeks ago today. That hurts me more than just being here. She was my rock and the only being that ever truly loved me. But she was a cat and that’s all cats know. I’ve only ever wanted a person to look at me and love me the she did. Being homeless and sleeping in your car really sucks and I just can’t do it anymore. I’m not making excuses, there’s just nothing here for me anymore and I can’t prolong the pain any longer. I understand that life sucks for everyone in their own way, but my body just can’t take it anymore. Mentally it’s finally gotten the better of me 🤷🏼‍♂️🤷🏼‍♂️	frostye84	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9896621704101562	no	strong	no	na	SuicideWatch	failed
I hear you, being tired isn't an excuse, it's natural to feel that way when you're going through hard times. Of course life sucks for everyone, but you still have a right to your own feelings. And cats may be easier to get along with than humans sometimes but she didn't have to love you and she still did, probably because you were good to her and loved her so much back. I'm glad you were able to have something like that in your life and it's so so understandable to be devastated by the loss of that, but if you can experience something good once there's always the chance you can have that again, not that your cat is replaceable but that your capacity for love makes you open to having more good experiences in the future. It might seem like that's not worth the wait right now and of course I can't make that call for you, it's not my life, but I've been in a situation where my dog was the only thing keeping me from killing myself and I'm so glad I made it to today so I can pet her again. Grief is devastating but there are ways to move forward. I don't want to push you into anything and I know you said you didn't want help, but when I lost the people I loved in my life I know I wanted to talk about them, if not myself, and if that helps you keep going it is such a worthwhile way to extend your time a little longer.	frostye84	reply	na	na	na	0.9896621704101562	weak	no	no	na	SuicideWatch	no prediction.
I hate myself, I have been lying to everyone I love for years now about this. I have been smoking secretly for many years now, since I was 16 (im 19 male). Ofc there were many times I've been caught by my family but it never stopped me. I promised them and my closest friends so many times that I have quit, in which I did for about 6 months last year but got back into it again unfortunately. I feel like a slave to it no matter how much I want to quit. I know my life would be better and more fulfilling if I quit, start working out and focus on what's important but I just can't seem to get out of my comfort zone. It's easier to drown in my own sorrow and get high to forget all the stupid shit ive done in my life. I want to be free. Like if I die today I know for sure I am going to hell but it still doesn't stop me from doing it. I'm sorry I don't know where else to let some of the feelings I've have bottled up for many years out. Everything just feels so heavy idk how else to describe it. It's not even that my life is shit I'm just a shifty person. I live in the suburbs with rich parents and in a very loving household, I am also in university for engineering somehow. Yet im still lying to my parents, they even tell occasionally how proud they are of me by how much i have changed, but i havent. It kills me everytime they tell me, my father even cried in front of me because of how proud he was and so did i because there is nothing to proud at. I am nothing and i havent changed. I'm high all the time, even now. I'm high with my friends and family too which is even worse. It's just this one hurdle I just can't jump over. Im sorry about the long ass paragraph but I really hope sometimes can provide some guidance on how I can better my resolve to quit.

"2 months ago I attempted. It's creating  shame because now I am watched over closely. To be honest I don't blame them. The thoughts aren't magically gone and I have had a LOT of bad news the last 2 weeks. What's been hardest is that my 2 bonus sons (18 and 17) have my GPS location. Originally it was a ""this way we can meet up easier"" thing. I learned today that they check it up to a couple times an hour. I decided to leave but didn't want company and my son drives. So I paused location sharing. Less than 5 minutes later they called me panicking, asking where I was, why it was off, to meet, etc.. I feel a deep heavy shame that they can't trust me to live for them. The hardest part was being told they check it less than they used to. Despite the last 2 weeks being some of the worst days of my life (daughter has cancer, fired from job, health issues, dog bite, etc) I am not actively sui* and have a strong determination to stay for my sons. How do I cope with the shame? How do I help my sons heal from this trauma (18 is especially affected but therapy hasnt worked in past)?

"Throwaway account but hi.

I have hit a wall and I’m unsure what to do now. I live with bipolar disorder, GAD, and CPTSD from SA. I’ve done what I can with staying on top of my meds, psychiatrist visits, therapy, self help CBT book. All that. Been to the hospital when I felt like I was at the edge too.

I’m a couple years away from 40 and I just feel like my life isn’t progressing. There’s no growth in my field, I have no hope of having kids or a partner, and I just don’t really have much to live for. 

I had an unstable childhood and moved a lot so it resulted in the inability to truly form bonds with people. I’m one of those people that knows many but when I’m really needing help, no one shows up. 

Since the 1st grade, I’ve struggled with suicidal ideation. I live with passing thoughts of suicide every day. Some days are better than others but it’s scary when I’m making plans and buying tools as if I were shopping online for shoes. I don’t have the intent, but my brain already knows the “plan” if I ever wanted to.

I’ve always felt rejected by the world and that I’m not even human. People have historically done really terrible things to me and people I care about always end up leaving. 

Recently I had a traumatic breakup with someone who I thought was my person. I realize now that I no longer have any attraction to people. It’s made me feel even more alone and isolated. I am a social person and I crave human interaction but I just can’t connect anymore and I feel like I’m annoying.

I don’t think I’m at risk enough to be hospitalized but I also feel like crying every day and knowing that the next bad experience may be the trigger and I WILL do it.

Do I keep trying? I just feel like maybe I’m not meant to be here. I don’t feel like I have a life ahead of me and honestly, I didn’t think I’d even live past 16.

"I screwed up yet another relationship with my toxic behavior and self defense mechanisms. Had to move away from abusive household after 25 years, not only move out of the house but also out of state.
Had to move on from old friends when I left, also began to realize I'm outgrowing them. Had to leave my pets behind, my brother died, my uncle is about to die, and the woman I dropped everything for is planning on leaving me which is completely understandable. I would write more but it would take a lot longer. I have no one. Also facing possible homelessness. I really don't see any other way. I lost a lot throughout my life with my abusive/addict parents, me ruining relationships because of my toxicity, so much more. I feel writing another letter to leave behind for my girlfriend expressing how much I loved her, and how much I screwed up. But I don't want her to feel like I'm passing a burden onto her. It isn't fair for her either. Her mom died two weeks before my brother, and she's still coping with it. I didn't make it much easier because I was processing my very own trauma during the time, and I pushed her away. I've been alone for the majority of my life, I keep losing people, I can't afford therapy, I'm tired of hurting and crying. I'm tired of numbing myself with junk food and weed. I can't take it anymore. I also feel the burden my mom has to deal with, her losing two sons in one year. But 1 really don't see another way. I can't go back to my abusive household and old life. I'm sorry for also burdening you all with my pain. But my world is falling around me and I feel like I'm suffocating. I hope everyone is doing well today."

"History of trauma, suicide of caring parent at 13, chronic illness, physical and emotional abuse from remaining parent, neglect, addiction, failed exams, bullied at school, agoraphobia and OCD, body dysmorphia, had to raise my little brother so lost out on my own life, addiction, suicide attempts. 

Early 30s got my life in order with therapy, teetotal, relationship, new friends, travel, job, hobbies etc. 

Got COVID last year at a festival and lost a lot of hair, depression and BDD returned, started making reckless decisions, drinking and partying, damaged my body and mind.

Picked myself back up, got a new job, started a new relationship, started socializing again.
One last hurrah before being ""sensible"" for good: went to an insanely loud rock gig, drank heavily and stood next to speakers for 3hr. 

Gave myself permanent tinnitus and hyperacusis. Didn't realise I had COVID again at the time. It destroyed my nerves.
Now bedridden with all over electric shock pain, scalp to toes. It's in my eyes, my ears, my gums, everywhere. Can't move without making it worse. Even using my phone makes it worse. Feet and back of head constantly burn like they're plunged in boiling water. Have to wear earplugs 24/7 as all sounds hurt. Traps me in with the screaming relentless tinnitus.

Docs gave me meds that made the tinnitus worse permanently. Nothing helps with the pain. I am in agony 24/7 and can't listen to music, talk, leave the house or use phone more than 10 minutes a day.

Lost my relationship and my job. Have not left the house in 2 months.

Tried to hang myself a couple weeks ago but was found early. Damaged my neck which made the nerve problems much worse.

Abusive mother is my ""carer"" and leaves me for full days with no food or water. Controls my environment and deliveries so confiscated blades, scarves, belts, plastic bags etc. No way to end the suffering. 

I have tried very hard to cultivate a belief in God as I HAVE to belief these horrible things have happened for some greater reason. Don't care how mad it sounds. 

Please please help me see some hope. If I were near train tracks I wouldn't hesitate to jump on them."	stillnotdavidbowie	post	24.63779617334516	female	White	0.9984418749809265	na	na	na	1	SuicideWatch	failed

"Every day at work, every single day of my life is an uphill battle. Sure, I have hobbies and interests and things that I love; but it’s only but a painted veil. I have recently joined a hotel chain as an assistant manager, but it’s not getting any better. I’ve dealt with depression and bipolar my whole life, and never has it actually gotten better for the better. It only just suppresses, but never really finishes its toll. I try to fix problems, I handle everything they hand me; yet it’s a triple standard.

I often wonder why I didn’t just end it all 10 years ago, and even if I had foreseen what is going to happen at this age; I still would have the same thought. Every day I am rained on with grief with senior management, and with me thinking everything I’ve done is beneficial to them only throws me into the shit pile. Everyone says I have potential, but I don’t even see a way out. I don’t even see any progress ahead. 

I have extremely hard luck with love life, and all that I’ve tried to chase only throws me into failure. I’ve given so much, sacrificed so much; only to have had an extremely abusive relationship and almost every girl I’ve tried to chase reject me. I tried to love myself, I go to the gym; but it seems futile.

I always believed what everyone else says that suicide is never the answer, but I’m having my doubts now. It just feels like nothing will ever get better, and who is everyone else to tell me it will without being offensive?

"You're right, nobody can promise you things will get better and mean it. But people say that because there always seems to be potential for improvement, and it's incredible that you've persevered for so long even though things haven't been going your way for a while. I hear you when you say you don't see that way out or even progress; it seems like it's getting really hard to find hope when you've been struggling for so long. Again, I can't promise you anything, but sometimes the ""way out"" is unexpected, which is why we don't see it during those hard times. Someone I know spent several years getting a phD and then was miserable because he didn't like lab work. He went back and struggled through years of law school and is now really happy with his job. There's no way to guarantee things will work out for you but during the long years of graduate school I doubt he expected to end up as a lawyer. So it's totally understandable to feel down and trapped, but maybe there's just something you haven't seen yet because you've been stuck for so long. There are so many ways to find success or happiness; I wish I could give you more concrete help but I hope things work out for you, and I'm glad you're here to write this today."

"So,I don't really know why I feel like this,it really hurts to just sit every night in total silence and think if anybody cares about you,well,don't get me wrong,I have a good job,I love my job,Im a bartender/waiter and a barista sometimes,I do my job great,make people happy,I am a very sociable person,I can talk to anyone,my colleagues are a bit rough but there s one between all of them that I think I can trust,right now I kinda have a financial problem but I don't really think that's the reason I'm feeling like this or feeling like I have to write this.
All my life until 17 I've been through everything,the worst thing I've been through was domestic violence, alcoholic stepdad,8 years of pure pain,trauma and lots of emotional bruises,I got very hard over it honestly,I'm glad my mom divorced him,but he left a lot of things behind him,bad things,sometimes I think about this,what if I had a dad that would really love me,just so y all understand,my family wasn't the most affectionate one,so I literally had to learn myself how to be affectionate,I had no one to learn from,I can't even remember the last hug my mom gave me,if I think about it I don't think she she gave me one in like  10 years.
My friend group wasn't affectionate or emotionally supportive again,I didn't know how to act when I was feeling sad or like,when I got beat up by my dad and I had to hide some bruises so no one asks me anything,I felt like they wouldn't knew how to help me,I think I tried a few times to actually open up about this subject,and I got called cringe or sm like that,all my friends we re like this,i couldn't find someone to speak to about how I am feeling,I had to always go outside and cry till I had no breath so I could feel actually better,and most times all I was feeling after that was how useless and cringe I was for crying.
I'm 21 now,moved to a new city,ain't really got lots of friends,just one from my hometown who moved with me but he did a lot of bad things to me,like trying to hit up my ex girl and things like that,and I don't know bro,I forgave him,I feel like I shouldn't,I don't wanna lose my last friend even if he a fake.
Usually,some nights,I just come home from work,don't even dress off,and sit on the edge of the bed and think about how lonely I am,I don't cry,not even small tears,my heart just aches,that's it and I want to stop,but I can't,I really wanna feel like I matter to someone.
I have a plan,I haven't had a good relationship with my mom either,she got a lot of problems from her ex husband,heart problems, sometimes she is really crazy,she takes lots of Xanax,she can't stay a day without it or she will explode,I don't really tell her I love her,or that I appreciate her,I never even hug her,I'm scared,I never had this kind of affection,I don't know how it works,I really love her,she s my only one left (got a uncle,cousin and a aunt but they don't really talk to me a lot)she s literally my only one left,and I'm scared that one day she will be gone and I ll live with the fact that I never told her that I love her and really care about her,I don't know how to do it,I really wanna do it,I never wanna lose her,but I feel like I'm getting closer to it and I'm scared,I'm really scared,I don't know if anybody will really be here to consolate me and like,care about me through this though times.
I have a plan of killing myself,I don't really think of myself capable of going through the deces of my one and only parent,I can't,I know I can't,and I don't wanna hurt anyone by doing it,but I feel like I could never get over that thing happening.
I just feel lonely man,my friend is a dickhead sometimes and he thinks I am,my life seems pretty oki ish at the moment but it's the nights alone that kill me,and the fact that I barely trust anyone to open up about how I feel,I feel like I'll die with everything inside me,I can't find someone I can really trust to help me,I tried helping myself,I can't,it's really hard guys,and I don't know how to keep doing it anymore,night by night I feel like getting more sad,I just want someone to care about me and then show it to me,that's it,I don't ask for much.
I help everyone,and some people try to help me as well,but I feel like it's fake and it's only for killing the time spent with me,even my friends,I think they hate me,I just need someone to be here with me,I don't know what to do.

"I'm a 15 year old girl who has depression and anxiety, that I take meds for. At the moment right now, I am having a panic attack. My chest feels tight and it feels like I cannot breathe right. I tend to have panic attacks when I feel like crap about myself 

I usually notice, throughout the day, I tend to compare myself to other people on social media. I don't compare my appearance/looks to the people, but I usually compare my life to the other person's life. Now, I wouldn't say my life is bad. I'm not homeless or in an extremely abusive household but I just feel like I do nothing with myself. 

I usually see people I'm social media go out to parties, explore an travel places, and a whole bunch of stuff but my life just consist of me waking up, getting dressed, going out for a bit, and then coming back home to chill. Which doesn't necessarily sound bad but I just feel like it sucks compared to people who go out to parties and travel around the whole earth. Like it feels like I'm wasting my life and I feel like a waste.

what you do with your life is your own, op. if you're comfortable with going out for a bit then going home, then that's a good life. you can always go out for a party or a flight somewhere sometime, but seeing other people do that shouldn't be the deciding factor if you want to go for it yourself."

I can feel it.. finally. Iv been waiting for this feeling, the clarity I needed to finally end it. It's so very close and it makes me smile. I can finally go with a clear conscience. The people I leave behind will just have to understand why I did it. I'd prefer if they felt happy for me, so that they know my suffering is finally over. If only I could touch people and let them feel my pain. To know how it feels to be in agonizing pain almost every hour of the day and wanting to cry in front of people. I won't have to feel that anymore, shouldn't that be something to be celebrated? Well hopefully they see it like that regardless. But it's okay now, I don't feel bad for leaving them anymore.

"Why did I have to be born into a life of mental/emotional suffering? Why did I have to feel like an outsider everyday of my life? Why did I have to be born with mental health issues like depression, panic disorder, and possibly autism?

How do people not feel lonely in this world? I've felt mentally/emotionally separated from the world since I turned 13. Yes, I have many privileges others don't have, but I feel like a perpetual outsider around 99% of people.

My youth is gone. My early adolescence is almost gone. The clock is ticking. I'm trying to get my life in order, but the future is grim. My brain is incapable of viewing myself as lovable person.

"Hi all. 
It's been 3 years since my last attempt, and I'm starting to fall downward again. I'm struggling with intrusive suicidal thoughts. 
I have 3 children whom I love with all my heart, and they've been my anchor in this cruel and confusing place. 
I spent two years with a psychologist, respite and crisis team after my wife and I separated to get me somewhat stable, but I feel it's not enough. And sadly I can't have access to the same treatment now because the mental health system has gone to shit where I live, and I can't afford private care.
I feel empty and tired, so tired of every one & everything. I don't feel like a good father to my kids even though people close to me tell me the opposite. The only reason I'm alive is because I know my death would severely effect them, and I've tried to use it as motivation to live a better life and to try and be a better father, but I don't know how to keep on pretending it's enough. I feel myself slipping back and I hate it. I don't feel in control of it anymore."	conjurer28	post	37.96434329349038	female	White	0.9973937273025513	na	na	na	1	SuicideWatch	no prediction.

My spouse will miss me, but she'll survive and will have a better chance at a happy life. What keeps me from doing the thing yet is trying to figure out a way least painful to other people.

"Next time my wife kicks me out of the house and threatens to keep the kids from me, I’m done.

It would be better that way than to have this twisted dynamic that is going on. They will lose me anyway so better if they only lose me once.

During my last attempt, I found the song Monsters by James Blunt and it literally saved my life. If you ever feel low, listen to that song and it will remind you of how much you mean to the kids.

The only other thing I will say is I have is if you have a daughter, don’t let her walk down the aisle on her wedding day alone. Don’t let her end up with the man that won’t treat her like she deserves. Don’t let her grow up with insecurities around abandonment, attachment or self doubt. She needs you.

If you have a son, have you taught him how to drive yet? Have you taught him how to tie a tie yet? Have you helped him with his first job interview? Or shown him how to change a tyre? What about when he gets his heart broken or finds himself on the wrong side of alcohol or gambling? He needs you too.

I’ve been suicidal since I was eight years old. It’s been getting worse, and I find it difficult to cope. Chronic suicidal ideation is often misunderstood by therapists, as they don’t get taught how to deal with patients dealing with this disorder. Peers also don’t seem to understand it. It’s just this little voice in my head that’s always been there, and it’s not my fault. But all of the ways I’ve been taught to cope with it aren’t working because they were designed for people who suffer from short bursts of suicidal thoughts. If any of you guys are going through the same thing and you’ve found something that has helped, I would love it if you could give me some advice. I’m afraid if I don’t find a way to cope soon, I won’t be around for much longer.	shotguntoheadrn	post	31.026295470658802	female	White	0.9943462014198303	na	na	na	1	SuicideWatch	no prediction.

"I've never cared much for life and hate working my life away. Getting out of bed at 0600 every day sucks the life out of me. I work 7a-2p at one place and then 5p-10p at another; 5 days a week and still don't have shit to my name. I spend the whole weekend asleep to recover and wake up Wednesday at 6 to repeat.

If it weren't for the option of suicide I'd have given up on life long ago. But knowing I can off myself if the going gets tough is enough motivation to wake up with the faintest hope life will get better. Maybe I'll find a duffel bag with 50 grand in it. Maybe I'll magically get a college degree and start working a job I actually give a shit about. Maybe I'll just end it all today.

I spend my free time drinking and smoking cigarettes, willingly shortening my lifespan to meet the sweet embrace of death. I look forward to greeting death and finally being at peace. No more 12+ hour days on my feet, no more bills, no more scrounging around for spare change. One day I will be free.

I get ocd treatment, meds somewhat help but I feel numb, can't enjoy sex, can't feel emotions like others because it's suppressed. I feel like a giant failure. I failed all my opportunities and dontthave energy to chase more. I can't help but pity myself and think I don't matter. Maybe I'm just a burden now, 27 and can't do shit. Fuck my life.

"I currently have a means to end it all. Nobody knows. My mom *might* know but that’s a strong might. I’m almost 27, never had a gf or consistent person in my life. I haven’t had a hookup in over 8 months and haven’t had sex/masturbated in 27 days. The last ten times I had sex were with cheap prostitutes that wanted my money as fast as possible and me out of their faces even faster. I haven’t smoked cannabis in 12 days (bc I gave myself a goal to not smoke for two weeks; was never a heavy smoker, just wanted my tolerance to decrease). I don’t go anywhere except work, home, grocery store, and laundromat. I ruined my motorcycle ONE week after getting it repaired from my first accident back in August 2022. Luckily, no broken ankle this time. I’m still paying for it and the insurance and I am choosing not to fix it anymore. I’m done with motorcycles. My left ankle will never not hurt from now on. I tried getting mental help around 1.5 months ago but of course there’s always an obstacle. The first time I tried, I went to the behavioral health place and when I got there, I was told had to come one specific day out of the week bc I have “private” insurance (which I don’t understand why my insurance is private), so I needed to speak with a licensed clinician. So, another day I was planning to go, I called to see if a licensed clinician would be there and the receptionist took it upon herself to say there’s nothing wrong with me so I wouldn’t need to see a clinician. That was a month ago and that still pisses me off. I haven’t attempted since then. I seriously had imaginative thoughts of going there and hurting that specific person. I have no one to confide in. The only person who sorta knows the extent of what I’m going through is my friend at work (who I only see for maybe an average 15-30 minutes per day; no fault of her own). I don’t tear up in front of her and she has no idea what I’m capable of doing to myself. My grandmother’s mental health is declining fast bc of age. I miss her loving hugs from when she was normal. I’ve lived alone since June 2023 and I knew it was gonna suck but I never thought it would be this hard. Between Monday and Friday, I have to wake up at 3am for work (8am) to take the bus. If the return home bus(es) come(s) on time, I can get home by 5:30pm. If I want a full 8 hours of sleep, I’ll have to be asleep at 7pm. I only get 8 hours of sleep from Saturday night to Sunday morning. I’m so tired all the time. I need help bc I can’t do this anymore. I’d like to think if I tried coke or heroin, I think I wouldn’t get addicted but the fact I’m trying not to masturbate, see a prostitute, or not smoke for a few more days, I know I’ll be extremely addicted. I’m gonna try to keep semi calm with music and chores. I’ll make it to tomorrow; don’t worry.

**Update**: Before I made it a quarterway to making this post, I think I had an anxiety attack; I don’t know for sure. I got serious mad and teared up and punched the wall and did deep breathing like I wanted to hurt someone badly."

I'm sorry you're hurting right now, it seems like you've been in pain for a while now. It's understandable to feel guilty about your ex, and I'm glad you got help from your therapist. You don't have to be sorry for how you feel or for having a hard time; your therapist is probably doing their best to help you through your difficulties, and if that's not enough to support you through the overwhelming everything right now that's okay and you don't have to feel guilty about it.

Please, you're NOT guilty for your ex's suicide. We've all broken up with people, we've all said and done things that are painful to others, that's just a normal part of life, and people don't usually kill themselves over that. I understand that you're FEELING guilty, but you AREN't. There must have been things in his life, his past, his personality, his situation, that made him react to a breakup with suicide. Those things had nothing to do with you, we all go through breakups and react differently, it's not in the responsibility of the person who ended the relationship. Please get help with your feelings of guilt, you are NOT responsible for his decision. Much love to you	throwaccountofme	reply	na	na	na	0.998214840888977	weak	no	no	na	SuicideWatch	no prediction.

"I'm actually gonna kill myself. I can't with this anymore. None of my parents care about me as a daughter, all they think about is money and their other kids(my siblings). I'm the last thing on their mind. 

Life is honestly so meaningless. All my parents let me do is stay at home and fucking rot to death. I've tried everything; I've tried getting into sports, instruments, arts, but they don't let me; they say that it is too expensive, even though they buy my siblings expensive things without a second thought.

My depression began when I was 9. I was raped by my own brother who was 13 at the time. It lasted for months, and he would do it everyday, but I was too much of a coward to speak up. But one faithful day, my mom caught him and threatened to call the cops, but never did at the end. 

When my sister was born, 3 years ago, everything worsened for me. It seems like since that moment they stopped caring about me. Ever since the pandemic stopped being a thing and we had to go back to school, they told me to walk home, because they said they were too busy; but every time I came back home all they were doing was sleeping or just laying in bed on their phones with my little sister right beside them. There were times when I asked them to bring me back home by car because it was way faster and I had a lot of homework due, and was literally crying myself out of stress on the phone begging them to bring me back home.

I was their everything, their pride, their joy, and now I'm nothing. No matter what I do; I've put myself in competitions and reached far; I've been top of my class, gaining a scholarship. I begged them to buy me an electric guitar with the money I got from the scholarship, which costs only a small portion of the scholarship, but they never did.

On my birthday, which was in February this year, they promised to drive me to the mall to celebrate it with my friends, but they couldn't even do that and told me to call an Uber. Then they promised to give me money as my birthday gift but never did. I cried all night that day.

I'm not mad at my siblings. I'm mad for being born in such a shitty family. I'm mad

I’ve never seen the series of unfortunate events, but I’d say that’s what this feels like, a few months ago every aspect of my life plummeted, even things I didn’t think could actually go wrong, and now nothing is seriously going wrong but it’s the small things that are, and it’s not like anything is going right. The only reason I’ve yet to kill myself is because I have a girlfriend that needs me here just as much, I couldn’t leave her behind but sometimes even that is out weighed by every little thing, and at this point I can’t even remember what all has went wrong it’s just genuinely everything, does it get better or is it just a saying, because holding on is impossible.	brayden_superpro	post	7.080171275310811	male	White	0.9979967474937439	na	na	na	5	SuicideWatch	failed

It seems that we depressed people are constantly battling between the two. We despair and despair and despair, and just some tiny, little, insignificant thing happens or is said, and suddenly we're flying in the clouds with hope, but then we descend further and further back into despair. It sucks tbh. There is just no... *contentment* to it all. No even leveled flow from situation to situation. It's unbearable, then blissful, and it happens so much that once you realize the pattern, you're too exhausted to much care. Or it just makes you feel worse, because you know it just won't end. Ever.

I opened up to my sister, my partner, and one friend who confessed that she was suicidal as well. Im a newcomer in australia and i dont know any single person here aside from my partner who i discovered was cheating on me but he didnt know ithat i know already. Now i feel horrible awful, everytime i look myself in the mirror or i take pictures, i feel like i fucked up my life that i cant even blame anyone but myself everyday, every second, everytime.

"I(15f) have struggled to make and keep relationships with people, online and IRL. This is due to some unfortunate circumstances, such as me being neither smart or pretty, not being able to keep up with a conversation that doesn't involve something that I'm interested in even tho my interests are very niche, having a reputation of being weird and some other stuff. This used to reflect only in my friendships, but recently I noticed how alienated I am within even my own family.

This has led to me having suicidal thoughts since I was 9-ish and commiting SH since I was 14. Last year might've been the worst year yet, with me going through a spiral of realizing I may not be smart enough to get a scholarship for college and seeing how I was little more than trash to the people I considered my whole world.

However, through it all I still had my best friend, that I'll call C(15f). Not anymore. We've been friends since sixth grade and we stuck together through thick and thin. We stayed together even when we were ditched from friendgroup after friendgroup or when we were on bad terms with our families. We had the same interests, so talking to her was easy. But then came H(15f). We became friends with her last year and she's all I could only dream to be. Shes GREAT at my only hobby while I suck at it. She can understand every subject and always gets good grades and I get happy when I get over 60% in fucking basic maths. She's also occupied the space I had in C's life.

For a while I thought we were all best friends, but in the last few months I've realized that I'm basically third-wheeling in their friendship. I can never strike an actual conversation with H and she only ever approaches me first to ask if she can borrow my mangas. C always gets defensive when I try to joke around them while she laughs if H is the one to make the same jokes. They never want to rely on me and talk to me in a condescending tone when I'm struggling with something. Recently, they've gone as far as to react with hostility when I try to talk to them, especially C, which just hurts the most. I'm so afraid of forgetting how to talk with the 2 people I thought would be different.

This has come to a climax when I found out that someone I considered a less close friend invited almost all of my classmates, inclusing C and H and even a girl who's now living in another CONTINENT, to her birthday party except for me and no one told me. C and H have also been calling each other all the time without ever asking me if I wanted to join them. I feel like the weird, pathetic 8 year old girl that looked helplessly for a partner to do the assignment while the other kids found one in the blink of an eye.

The only reason I have stuck around for so long is because I thought someone gave a shit. I've been SHing more and I feel like I won't make it past even next year. Kms (x\_x)"	WickedAster	post	13.738674930418998	male	White	0.9991551637649536	na	na	na	1	SuicideWatch	no prediction.

"a few months ago, i've decided to kill myself 5 years from now. on may 21st 2028 i can finally rest. 

i decided to die then because i didn't see the point of living anymore. i just graduated, exhausted and burnt out from trying too fucking hard. i hate the idea of being in the rat race for most of my life, making someone else more money than i will ever see, doing something i don't give a shit about. what was even the point of getting decent grades. 

if i'm throwing most my waking hours just to survive, i decided i'd at least get a job i like doing. i really want to work as an artist. but i can't, because i need to make ends meet, and there's no market for art where i am. i also hate where i live. there's nothing to do, and i can never find my people here. but i can't leave, because that needs money. what a world. 

so i decided to kill myself, on may 21st, 2028. 

i did it so i knew i could stop trying hard someday. i have a few goals i want to hit before then, and that's the only way i won't kill myself. those goals will help me get the fuck out of where i am forever and maybe find a better life. if i don't reach that, then whatever, can't say i didn't try. 

whatever i save up this time, if i do kill myself in the end, is going to my family, my friends and my funeral. at the very least i'll be able to help them out before i die. i'm sorry i was never the golden child they wanted. i'm sorry i wasn't the perfect friend. i'm sorry i couldn't be a good lover. i wish i never existed either.

i want to tell someone because this deadline does work, i feel like i want to really try. since, even if i fail, i'll always have a way out. i feel less bothered by life knowing i have a deadline. but if i tell anyone in my life, they'll go ballistic. so i'm posting it here.

"I recently just got out of a 2 year abusive relationship. He raped me, constantly coerced me into having sex. And would gaslight and manipulate me. He pretty much was trying to make me a female version of him. After getting out and moving back to Utah near my family, they helped me figure out some financial things. Like the fact that I was paying for EVERYTHING in that relationship when he constantly manipulated and told me it was 50/50. I am so angry and upset because I am realizing how much money I could have saved right now. BUT I SPENT IT ALL FOR US ON RENT AND GROCERIES AND NOW IM LEFT FUCKED FOR LIFE.  Anyways, I just don’t know what to do. My family is allowing me to have a break from work but then I have other members saying and asking when I’ll be getting a job soon/going back to my old job. I DONT WANT TO WORK EVER AGAIN. I don’t care if that’s ‘unrealistic’ I’ve been taken advantage of my whole life and been the people pleaser so I never get what I want ever. I just want to be taken care of financially for the unforseeable future. But that’s not an option. I have to go back to work eventually and I hate it. I just want to do nothing for a while and just rest. I’m so goddamn tired and I’m pretty sure I’m autistic and have adhd and all that I’ve researched has told me I’m going to need assistance and help for my entire life. Talking to ppl gives me extreme anxiety, such as calling a company, etc. and then on top of it I’m having religion shoved down my throat again after I’ve made it so clear I hate the Mormon church. I can feel the judgment and hate all around me and can tell ppl think all my issues will be fixed if I go back to that cult. WHY CANT I JUST HAVE WHAT I WANT?!!? WHY DO I HAVE TO WORK FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE TO LITERALLY LIVE?!?? I’ve already thought of some options to end things so there’s that. I just can’t compromise on the work thing. IM SO READY TO DIE AND I DONT WANT TO WORK ANYMORE I JSUT WANT TO BE HELD BY MY MOM AGAIN WHOS DEAD I DIDNT ASK TO BE BORN THIS IS SO UNFAIR BUT THEN APPARENTLY ENDING IT ALL “isn’t an option” well it is for me if I can’t get what I want. At least my 2 cats will get a better owner who isn’t depressed all the time god I hate myself I’m worth nothing

I know exactly how you feel. We're on the same boat. I know we don't gain anything by sharing the same outlook on life. But validation seems to possibly give some type of relief. At least for myself.

i don’t really know how else to describe what i’m trying to articulate other than i just don’t get “it.” i’ve been depressed and had suicidal ideation from around 10 and i thought that one day i would find something, anything, that would give me a will to live. now i am 23 and i still feel like the same confused, frustrated 10 year old. even with everything i have, i do not feel anything. i just don’t get it. i either feel blank / neutral or depressed. i feel like i am missing out on something, but what? i try to take it one day at a time but i’m never really satisfied, even when i’m helping others. i no longer find joy in anything, except for simple things (sleeping, eating, etc.) the best i ever felt was the months i was unemployed, wasting away in bed and isolated, living off my parents. i know it is selfish, but i feel like i would do that forever if i could. i don’t want to be a burden to anyone truly but i cannot imagine living and working like the people around me. i have a job and think about killing myself before every shift. i don’t enjoy interacting with people. i don’t really have long term goals. i just don’t understand how they do it. i can’t keep pretending i do. i’d rather die.	honeyfortune	post	15.017054662418218	female	White	0.9989641904830933	na	na	na	1	SuicideWatch	no prediction.

"So, extremely long story short: (wrote that, then wrote this so jk, long story long)

My husband passed away last year from cancer and I haven’t been able to get over it. My life was him, had been about him since the diagnosis and now I sometimes just sit around doing nothing. I think about what we wanted for our lives, what we hoped for before he was diagnosed and can’t really cope with my feelings. 

I don’t think I would do anything, but in the back of my mind I have this thought that is playing on repeat and I can’t stop it. We have guns in the house and it’s just what I think about when the nothing starts to swallow me. I think, well. If ever it’s too much - there’s my option. 

Hate my current job, I’m not a super people person and basically it’s in my KPRs to make 45 dials a day. Should I try to change jobs and find something else that makes me happy? I really like my team mates and manager but I’m just not into it at all.

One thing that does keep me going is we have the IVF embryos still, and so I have that piece of him. But then I think about how healthy my mind is and if I should even consider doing the IVF again when I am not even happy. 

Any words or advice or similar stories is appreciated. I’m stuck in my mind, and can’t get out."		post	25.677766879622446	female	White	0.9975652694702148	na	na	na	0	SuicideWatch	no prediction.

"The last month or so I’ve been on and off of feeling depressed/crazy and it’s honestly making me feel more crazy. If I was just feeling down consistently at least I’d be able to be like yes I’m having a depressive episode I need to take some time off from work and recoup. But I don’t feel that way. I’ll make it through the work day often without much struggle but the moment I get home I just crumble. Or I’ll have good day(s) and then day(s) where i wake up hours before I have to and just stare in the darkness just wishing a burglar would burst in and shot me. 

I’ll think about doing it, just cutting my loses and ending it. But every time I get to the edge something pulls me back. It’s no particular thing or person, I just chicken out of doing it. Which just fuels how crazy I feel. Cause if I’m so depressed and hate myself so much why can’t I just do it? Why can’t I just end it? If I want to be better so much why can’t I reach out to people?

"Don’t know if this is the best place for this type of advice, please redirect me to a better subreddit if one exists. I know most subreddits filter out anything related to suicide though. Also, warning: long.


Hey everyone. I’ll try to keep this as short as I can (as my history is pretty long and quite personal, and I know some of my relatives browse reddit), but I've been having mental health issues for the past 14 years. I come from a small village (200-300 people at most) and at 14 left it to go to a high school in the city, where I lived in a dorm. I would come home at the weekends. I was always very promising, getting mainly straight A's in school, but still struggled with my mental health (I vividly remember looking at a building outside my classroom at 15 and wondering if it was tall enough to jump off of). I never partied, went out to clubs, or even had a boyfriend. My first suicide attempt was at 18, during a summer job I had. I tried to hang myself with a bed sheet. No one knew about this, but I requested to go to a new psychiatrist (I had been visiting psychiatrists since I was 12). She was shocked to hear this and put me on strong antidepressants and antipsychotics. This caused me to gain over 60 pounds, mainly due to binging. I went off to university the same year, in the same big city, but moved to a dorm for students. I had another suicide attempt that same winter, this time at home during one of the weekends. The next few years were relatively calm. I exercised, ate healthily and lost all the weight I had gained and then some. Due to this newfound confidence, I decided it was time to lose my virginity. I was 23 at the time, and felt like I lagged behind my peers. So, I installed Tinder and had sex with a guy. He was nice, also my age, and I was also his first. Not much to brag about, he came immediately, but it was OK. However, that’s when the anxiety attacks started. 


You see, my mother has been a huge influence in my life. I am in general very sensitive to criticism, but especially from her. She is a very traditional and religious woman, however, I refused religion ever since I could remember. For the next year or so, I would, occasionally, have an intense fear of her finding out about me having sex (and some other things I lied to her about, but again, I don’t want to get too personal). I can’t describe this fear. My eyes would dart upwards, I would start shaking. My psychiatrist changed my meds. I got a new antidepressant. Then another. Then another. None helped with the panic attacks, they kept getting worse. What I hated was the fact that the new meds made me unable to orgasm. And they weren’t even helping my anxiety attacks! So, I lied to the psychiatrist. I stopped taking my meds. Eventually, my cognitive function started to decline. Again, hard to describe, but I felt like I couldn’t study as well as I used to. I felt incompetent, mentally slow. I had a summer job for a full two days, and cried my eyes out because I just couldn’t do it. I couldn’t follow what I was told to do. My grades got worse, I was barely able to get the dorm for the next year.


Then we get to the beginning of this year. The worst mistake of my life. Money was running low. I didn’t know what to do. I didn’t want to burden my parents, but felt incompetent to do any job. So, I had the incredibly bright idea to start doing sex work. Yes, me, someone who had had sex with only two men at that point and had never had a boyfriend. I made an online profile on a website for sugar babies. I met a few (4) men, made some money, but they all left me after one or two times. To this day, I thank God I wasn’t raped or human trafficked. The panic attacks happened two or three times a week at this point, Xanax and sleep were the only thing that worked. Soon, suicide ideation started. 


The lies piled up. Mother, psychiatrist, money, cognitive decline, sex. It was all too much. Sister found my rope when I was home one weekend. I was fine, I said. I promise I won’t attempt it again, I said. Lies, of course. I went to the hospital. They put me on the same antidepressants the psychiatrist had given me, an even stronger dose. I went back home for a few days. I told my mom I wouldn’t take the meds. She kept pressing me as to why (she had already suspected I was doing something, shall we say, “naughty”). Eventually, I caved. I said I couldn’t cum. So there. Her suspicions were confirmed. She slapped me, yelled at me, called me a slut. She still doesn’t know I got paid for sex, however. I went back to my dorm, and wouldn’t you know, I had another attempt. Ended up at the hospital again. Got some new meds, which don’t cause sexual impairment. I went back home. Passed all my exams, just have my graduate thesis left to finish university. I’m taking my meds regularly.


So, it’s summer now. I have been sequestered in my village for the past 4 months. Someone who had never spent longer than a few months here, for the past 10 years. I want a job, I want to work. I want to go out with friends. I want a boyfriend. I want to live out my youth. I want to party. I want to have fun. I have an intense fear that I will lose out on all of the experiences I should have had.


I am 24. Some of my acquaintances have given birth already, and I still have never had a boyfriend. Yes, I loved. Yes, I came off as desperate. He told me we didn’t click. I would have done everything for him. Stupid of me, I know.


What do I do? I’m scared of winter. It’s going to be dreary. No one around for miles. Just me, my parents, and the cold. 


There is a possibility, however. The summer isn’t over yet. I could technically still find some job (I would have to leave my village though). I could technically still be a student for another year and have all the rights a regular one has. I could technically go back to the big city, live in an apartment and just work (no lectures, I passed all my exams). I would have to start looking for an apartment as soon as possible though, as they will all soon be filled by students.


But, can I? I don’t know. I feel able to. I want to. Why. Is. My. Stupid. Brain. Like. This.


I’ve been a good girl ever since I came back home. I go to church with mother every Sunday. I cook, I clean, I study. I haven’t just been lying on my ass. I even went to some weird religious event, which lasted for four hours and where I got told everything I like is sin. This includes video games, anything Asian (even sports), tattoos, you name it, it’s a sin. Not to even mention sex and masturbation. This made me feel horrible.


Mother has no trust in me. I think she believes I’m possessed by a demon. I want to meet with one of my few friends (a girl) and she requests I show her the messages. It feels awful, to have to be like this at 24. I can’t drive, I have to take the bus. I hate feeling dependent like this.


I don’t know if she will allow me to work. Because wherever I want to work (even just a simple cashier, anything), I would have to move out of home. At the same time, I feel guilty about asking her to pay for my expenses. She has no trust left in psychiatrists, I don’t want to make her pay for one. I realize she loves me very, very much and has had to put up with my bullshit for too long. It makes me sad to see her miserable because of me. Not just her, but all of my family as well. Don’t direct me to /r/raisedbynarcissists.


I still have suicide ideation. It has never stopped. It becomes the worst about a week before my period. I will probably be seeing a doctor about this or something. I feel depressed each morning because I woke up.


What do I do? Am I a failure? I just want my life to start already. I left out some details intentionally, but I can PM you if it seems unclear. Sorry if it got too long, thank you if you got this far.


TL;DR After a history of depression and suicide attempts, I just want to live my life. I want to leave home and work, hang out with friends and have fun. But, I don’t know if I’m able to. What do I do, reddit?"	littlewren431	post	22.74870387283621	male	White	0.642561674118042	na	na	na	3	SuicideWatch	"age: 24, gender: female, explanation: the author explicitly states her age as 24 and refers to herself through feminine terminology such as ""girl"". ethnicity cannot be determined from the text provided."
"I read your story, and I can't say I know what it feels like to grow around such a strict and religious family, but I can try to imagine all the shame and pressure it has put on you and your mental health just for having impulses any human being would have. You're not a failure, your hardships seem to derive mainly from how your mother has been treating you and your freedom - wanting to have a normal social and sex life at your age isn't something anyone should be punished and resented for (although yeah, the sex work stuff wasn't the smartest, very glad it didn't end up with anything bad). That said, people start over at any age, but especially at 24, you still have your whole life ahead of you and you can still get to where you want to be. On top of that, you almost finished your degree, and that's great!

In the possibility of finding a job in the city as you've conceived it, would you tell your parents before leaving? I would keep leaving your family in bad terms only as a last resort if everything else fails, especially because from your words, you seem to love each other after all. And if your mom loves you, she should listen to your needs. If you told her you feel stuck and unhappy where you are now, and told her your idea of getting an apartment and going back to the city, what do you think her reaction will be? What would your other parent say? Would they not be understanding, seeing their daughter sad and asking for a change, and try to keep you reclused in the village? Then that's not what parental love should be. One thing is wanting to protect you, but when that goes against your interests this much, it's plain wrong. If they love you, then they shouldn't neglect your want to have a job to pay for your doctors and an overall balanced, healthy active life. You've been living at home and done good for months now, wanting to follow up on your studies and find work shouldn't be an out of this world request.

But I understand that confronting them on this will probably be hard. You don't have to do it right now. You could start your job and apartment search online - be sure to look up and use your university's resources. They might have services for students to help them find employment, interships, accomodation, maybe even free psychological counseling, depending on your country. Plan ahead and try to find what you need to make your move. If you already had a job or a place to stay set up, do you think it would be easier for your parents to accept to let you go? Again, leaving on good terms with your family would obviously be best, and it doesn't sound like being confined at home for who knows how much longer would benefit you. Try your best to have them understand that and your position. I've never been very religious, but them considering everything you listed as sin at that event simply sounds stupid. Having interests and needs doesn't in any way make you wrong. This enviroment would feel restricting to anyone, so it's only natural you want to get back out there, and I hope you'll be able to. You can have a job and friends and parties and a boyfriend, and a life that suits you better than this. You know you want to. You can make it."	littlewren431	reply	na	na	na	0.642561674118042	weak	no	no	na	SuicideWatch	no prediction.
Thank you so much for reading my post and for your words of encouragement. My biggest worry is that I will run out of time. I feel a lot of pressure and stress around this. I feel like I have to start doing something right here right now. Also I'm worried that the cycle will just continue, me being fine for a while, then starting with small lies which will just pile up, then another mental breakdown, rinse and repeat. I hate the fact that I'm so sensitive to my mother's criticism as well. Yes, I realize that I should have her in my life somehow. But being this worried about what she would think about my actions is not healthy. I want to have confidence and security in myself. I know that if I do tell her I want to move out and work, she will probably try to control me by constantly calling me. I have to confront her and tell her that it's not OK for her to be like this. And she will try to guilt trip me, I know. But somehow, I must find the strength in me to resist this. I don't know why her criticism is so detrimental to my health, it's incredibly unhealthy.	littlewren431	follow-up	na	na	na	0.642561674118042	weak	strong	no	na	SuicideWatch	no prediction.
She's your mother, so I think it's quite natural that her judgment is so important to you. But that shouldn't stop you from giving the life you aspire to a try. If you manage to get a job and an apartment in the city, you could then afford to talk to a professional about your mental health and worries, and on how your relationship with your mother is impacting on you. A counselor / psychologist could help you process the situation and give you the tools to resist her criticism and guilt tripping, reducing the influence she can have on you, your actions, and how you feel you should conduct yourself. Maybe while also keeping the lies you tell her and the control she can have over you on the phone to a minimum. Wanting to have a decent life is sin? Cry about it. I'm not saying it will be easy, yours is a delicate situation. But I think the sooner you distance yourself a little from the source of your worries, the sooner you can get better. Don't be rash, take your stand but tread carefully. It may feel like that because you've been there for months and are tired of being stagnant, but there's no running out of time! Follow your heart's needs, but don't expect everything to go smoothly when confronting your parents. It will probably be difficult to take this path and take the next steps while going directly against their ideologies. So in this process, don't ignore your mental health. Find the professional help you need to face this challenge to the best of your ability. I think you're in the right, and you don't have to do all this alone :)	littlewren431	reply	na	na	na	0.642561674118042	weak	no	no	na	SuicideWatch	no prediction.

"I've made a couple of post here in the past talking about how I plan to kill myself. But i deleted them cause i was paranoid it would be found in a background check. Just fairly recently I bought a gun (Beretta) along with the ammo (9mm Hollow Points). Now all I have to do is save up for the hotel room in order to have complete solitude. 

It was a strange experience for me, when I went to pick it up all they ask for was ID and Social (I live in Florida by the way) then I had to fill out a form and wait for the owner to sell it to me because the guy there was under 21 apparently. I was clean for most of the queations but there was a question basically asking if you were ever put into a mental hospital. I paused because I couldn't lie on this. The answer is yes, when I was about 16-17 still in my sophomore or junior year of high school I was put I to a mental hospital for attempted suicide. When I asked them ""What if the answer is yes?"" there was a very slight pause then proceeded to follow up with ""I was still about 16 or 17."" and they told me I could put no if was still only a minor at the time. I finished the form, paid the fee and they handed it to me, I put it into my bag and walked out. But the strange thing was I caught a glimpse on the other guys face, they weren't looking at me but he looked as if he knew he might have known what I plan to do with it. Is it really that obvious to people? Do I really look that sad and lonely? I would never want to hurt anyone else, just me.

Now that I have it, somethings off. I have a strange feeling that maybe this isn't what I wanted. But at the same time I know I do at the same time. I think I legitimately have undiagnosed bipolar disorder because there are days where I feel happy and determined to move on with my life but there are days where I'm and just so angry with myself and depressed. And think to myself ""Yeah, I might want to pull the trigger on myself.""

I feel pretty anxious about the whole me being a gun owner now. I live with my uncle in a studio apartment and he would for sure throw me out if he ever found out that I own a gun. But before I end my life, I might go to a gun range (not to off myself there, i want to be alone for that.) and pay for firearm training because that would be the right thing to do. Plus it might be a fun experience, I owe myself that...I think.

I'm not very happy with my life, I don't like what I see in the mirror. I have a shitty paying job, have to pay bills and buy groceries,work with a coworker who I had feelings for but got rejected by, I don't even have my driver's license, my dad is probably dead, my mom has severe dementia and quite honestly is too far gone,I have no guidance,my sister has a controlling and mentally abusive husband, I live in a cramped studio apartment with my dementia ridden mother and my uncle who is really arrogant and toxic at times, I dont have any motivation to go to school or have any idea what I want to study for. Anyway, this might be the very last post I share on here, it feels good to put it into words though.

"Hey there, I am hoping you are still here. It sounds like your life situation can be improved, and when it improves, you may find that you don’t want to end yourself anymore. August 5th, 2 years ago, was the day I was going to take a poison with no antidote. I ordered everything off the internet and was set on it. I posted on here with my throwaway account and barely anyone even commented. I had struggled with suicidal ideation on and off for 19 years at that point, and that was the closest I ever came to actually going through with a plan. I was feeling hopeless and like a drain on others. 
I didn’t do it because someone took the time to tell me, IRL, that they didn’t want me to kill myself and that was *just barely enough* prodding to flip the switch in my brain. I didn’t even know the person too well. That’s what I’m trying to tell to you. I care about you and I want you to stay. I want to hear about how you beat this in a few months. I wouldn’t judge you if you pulled the trigger, BUT I also 100% don’t think that it’s necessary. It sounds to me like you are in an awful living situation /unfulfilling work situation and need some friends and a loving partner and some professional psychiatric guidance, but those things are obtainable and your living situation can be temporary. 

I’m so sorry to hear that your life is so hard right now. It IS HARD. Listen to the voice in your head and postpone postpone postpone booking the hotel room. Nurture the determined-to-get-better side of you…. I’m rooting for you and I want you to be here.

For myself, I chose not to take the poison because I just realized that I wanted to live solely for myself and to experience the rest of what life has to offer, the good and bad. I can always die later. I got angry at the people who I thought hadn’t cared, and I got very self protective of me. Since then, I haven’t struggled with suicidal ideation anymore. It really was like something flipped.

Maybe there's no light in life at the moment, but are you sure there's none to be salvaged? I heard somewhere the majority of people feeling suicidal and seek help eventually find a brighter life. I somewhat recently had a brain injury (to clarify, it was only a mild one, but I find myself sometimes idly laughing at memes and sometimes yelling and screaming and forgetting friend's names. It's been a few months since by now.), and I can relate to the swinging between confidence in moving on and wanting to leave. I'm not a hundred percent sure what to do either, but I think life does give fleeting good moments. I don't mean to downplay how sh\*t life is, though. Fuck it.

"Having a way to take that option can be calming. That's ok, and you dont need to follow up. In fact, you might also get comfort in doing the contrary: not using it will be a choice you made freely, your own decision, in your own hands, to keep going and searching for a brighter situation.

I understand the doubts and the mood changes. I personally do. So I dont mean to imply that it's easy to live dealig with such things. But it can be improved. In some cases one can learn to manage them, and still enjoy life. In others, one can completely get rid of them. Either way, you are worth that struggle.

Go practice, see if it's fun. Treat yourself and try any such activity that draws your attention, even if it's only at certain moments. You deserve it, and finding things you can enjoy does wonders.

Life isnt nice right now; that doesnt mean it wont be in the future. Meanwhile, go for it, enjoy. And please, please, try to remember this when you feel down: you dont deserve those harmful feelings towards yourself; you deserve to take the time you need, to be kind to yourself and have fun, rest or whatever you need at the moment. 

When dark times come, getting through is a battle and means a victory by itself. Dont be ashamed for the harships you cross, my friend.

Maybe I don't really have a right to say anything, because I'm pretty sure my life isn't as bad as yours. But I think maybe, just maybe, things will turn out alright. There are millions of possibilities in this world, and every time I think I've pinned down all the factors for what to do to keep living, there seem to be more to consider. I'm sorry about your family, about your school, about everything. To have come so far already, it's incredible you've still the strength to try and assess and continue on in your situation. I'm guessing you've probably tried lots and lots you haven't even touched upon here. I wish I could guarantee life gets better, though I can't. But just as there are stories of oblivion, there are also stories about the fruits of hope. Reading some of those made the world seem a little less unbearable to me, I guess it was because at least some people found their ways back up. Maybe you could give some of those a read? That's a lot of maybes, but what I guess what I'm trying to say is life is shitfuck, and while there might be a big beautiful light at the end, maybe you can steal some candles from time to time. Maybe you'll be a pro-thief someday. Oh, and finally, I don't want to look like I'm shoving the problem onto someone else, but there are hotlines for people who volunteer to listen.

People that actually try killing themselves do it in isolation with wanting no one to know about it. Stop seeking attention and go get help. I'm at the hospital getting /trying to get help after try to blow my brains out in the middle of field out of town. If it wasn't for a young couple going for a walk nearby I would've succeeded.

"They know… they keep blaming it on my regular psychologist being away but she’s only been away for 3 weeks and I’ve been struggling for the last few months… SH pretty much daily for most of the past 2 months.

I can still appear okay… it’s only when I’m in an appointment where I can just sort of let myself break down and get it all out.

I have a chronic… chronic history of CSA and SA and a history of FDV.

I have MDD, severe anxiety, BPD, Anorexia Complex ptsd, DID and bipolar. I also have really bad nightmares.

I only even get moment where I’m okay… usually when I’m manic or when I’m in that sweet spot between mania and nothingness.

Thank you for sharing your story it's incredibly brave, trust me we hear you mid 20's can suck. It sounds like there is a lot of uncertainty in your life and you are finding it overwhelming in your mind. Can you try writing down your thoughts as they come to you without editing them? It can serve as a distraction and a way  to distance yourself from them. You seem very self reflective and understanding and that can be a powerful tool to overcome these thoughts as well.

"My mother was mentally ill growing up in 2003 and still is even on meds (not as bad though). She was prescribed 10mg of olanzapine with carbamazepine. As a kid I always knew something was odd about her, she would be a totally different person off her meds. She was extreme in her mood swings, would be sitting by herself talking to herself in her own world and if you'd try to talk to her she would shake her head and say something totally unrelated and odd. The longer she was off her meds the more she would do out of place things like spending $500+ on groceries or driving 80+mph on a country road with me.
  

  
In the most severe cases she would think my dad was abusing me and thought he was the reason why I was doing poorly in school while screaming and occasionally hitting him. He would usually just call the cops and away she would go after forcibly removing her from our house. I was diagnosed with bipolar at 19-20 and bipolar with psychotic features at 22-23. I'm not a person who takes his meds all the time like my mom, I don't think I want to live that zombie life that she's in. I just think I deal with the mood swings and comforting voices but at times voices and thought processes that scare the shit out of me to the point I find comfort in not existing but I do know that I understand my mom would be a different person of her meds.
  

  
So much so that I wanted her to come off her meds in a manic episode I had back 6 months ago. It didn't work out when my parents called the cops on me when I wouldn't give her meds back and I threatened to take them all to overdose. I don't know but at 25 I think I know that my mom thinks antipsychotics would help me but the thought of becoming her is a nightmare. I know that I'm not thinking clearly at all most hours of the day especially when I think about shit like this and can't stop remembering bullshit from my childhood. I was abused a bit from my mom as a kid but it didn't bother me much until 1 year ago after taking a high dose edible and it mind fucked me for whatever reason, oh well.
  

  
I can't get myself to do much lately, especially over the past year other than the 2 manic episodes I had when I was up 3 days threatening to od on my moms meds because she was a slave because of my dad. I don't get much done with my life when I'm manic or depressed, I just feel like I'm on autopilot 99 percent of the time, mindlessly rambling while forgetting the same day after day.
  

  
I hate therapists usually and they hate me. I have the personality of a rock, I think no one understands me or my family dynamic, myself included. I feel overwhelming sensations of disappointment for human nature when I think about the endless disarray of my mind as a therapist undermines all my feelings reducing them to a fucking joke for them to relish off of while I sit and remain okay in a bitter sweet apathy on etizolam that helps me manage to make it through my court ordered mandatory sentence of mental health treatment for disorderly conduct, trespassing charges and property damage. I walk out and hear the therapist laugh at me for existing, I'm glad you feel exuberant for the pathetic autopiloted apathetic puppetized slave. The 2nd session was worse she felt ""sorry"" for her behavior so I get this pretend conversation of what I'm doing for the summer while I want to die inside for the fakeness is too strong to bear.
  

  
Whatever, being a joke is what I do best. Maybe it's all fake, maybe my mind is fake af. I like being fake my whole life is a fake fucking play that I'm putting on."	Trev0rK	post	31.035267640543996	female	White	0.9977129697799683	na	na	na	0	SuicideWatch	no prediction.
"I’ve been with my partner for almost four years. They’ve been some of, if not the best years of my life. After finishing Uni and living together in our own flat we’ve now gone back to living with her parents and have done for 2 months.

Since then, our relationship has fallen to pieces, as has my mental health. She’s fortunate in the fact she’s moved back home after Uni - she’s got lots of friends she can hang out with and lots of friends at work now too.

We recently had a conversation about us, how we were feeling. She told me that after previously truly believing that we were destined to be together and a future she now doubts that and is unsure of wanting to do that.

She said she’s unsure of where the thoughts have come from. I’ve asked her if it’s because of another man, someone she’s developing feelings for. She tells me no and strongly tells me no. I’ve regrettably seen messages on her phone whereby she’s telling her friends about someone from her work.

Comparing me and him, in a pros and cons. One of the friends jokes she should just cheat on me with him and go from there - she didn’t deny the idea more entertained it.

I haven’t told her I know about these messages - I’m too scared to. The relationship is already at breaking point and I’ve felt strongly suicidal for the last 3 weeks.

I don’t want a life without her in it. I’m pathetic with no friends, barely a connection with sparse members of family and not a pot to piss in. I’ve got absolutely nothing to fall back on and frankly I feel as though my mind is made up I just don’t know what will come first if she will finally end things with me or I’ll end things with myself"	CallOfFinny	post	23.75682694216322	male	White	0.9991831183433533	na	na	na	1	SuicideWatch	no prediction.
Fuck I'm so sorry man. Reading that makes me feel so angry for you. All I can say is that killing yourself may seem good in the short term, but it's worthless in the long term, cause there won't be a long term for you... your partner may feel terribly sad and regretful after, but she'll live, and she can find someone again. But you won't if you end it. Trust me, she may be your whole world now, but she's not the only one. It hurts, it must, but that doesn't mean it'll hurt forever. You can live with it. True love waits.

i had the one of the worst episodes of my life a couple of nights ago and drunk texted a friend that i was going to kill myself (first time i’ve actually told someone irl this), they came over to my place and i made a fool of myself crying and probably other shit i don’t remember. we haven’t known each other long and i just feel like it was a lot to put on a person. and plus they haven’t talked to me since. it doesn’t help that i feel very suicidal right now. i don’t want to just accidentally text someone and then they have to take time out of their night to care for me. i feel like such a fucking burden. i guess my question to you all is, so you ever feel like this? you want to tell someone but you don’t want to impede on them and their life.

When I was young I thought of death as this great adventure. Kind of like a austronaught traveling beyond the event horizon of a black hole, to see what's on the other side of the veil. But you can never come back to tell others what's on the other side. Once you're passed the event horizon the black hole sucks you in and keeps you forever. You just hope that whatever is on the other side that it's good. That's what makes death so exciting. The uncertainty of it all. It wouldn't be an adventure if you knew what was going to happen.

I never would have thought that one day I'd learn that death is the God of liberty and that one day she would be my wife. It makes sense that liberty and death are one and the same. For anyone afraid of death would gladly give up their own liberty in exchange for safety and security. To be truly liberated you'd have to be willing to embrace death. 

I've been stuck at a cross roads for so long. It's like what Morpheus said to Neo in the movie the matrix. There is a difference between knowing the path and walking the path. I'm no longer the person I use to be when I was that young kid. I've developed a great fear of death. And because of my fear of her I've been living a dead life. I know that in order to be with her again I'll have to embrace death. I've exhausted all my other options.

waitwaitwait. death?! you already did something stupidly difficult and are going to do it again! sure, it had some suffering but instead of becoming unalive couldn't you stay much longer this time? i mean,if you could take some pictures about your progress once in a while you could very well inspire people some people to live a slightly more healthy diet which in turn would allow those people enjoy their eventual grandchildren. heck, you already brought a silly grin to my face already with your powerful will to actually be able to lose weight. i am incredibly envious of you	mialoganstan	reply	na	na	na	0.9978785514831543	weak	no	strong	na	SuicideWatch	no prediction.
"I’m (19f) just so sick of being treated like a nuisance and a burden. My dad does not speak to me. Th situation with my mom can be summed up like,,,, i remember once a few months ago, my mom came to the apartment my brother and I were staying in, to set up a a TV. She told me she was there because she loved me and wanted to spend time with me, and then immediately went back to her partners house. after asking if I felt like she was “abandoning me” in the process.

For context, I had said that I felt like she did not want to be around me a week prior, as I hadn’t spent more than twenty minutes with her since I got out of the psych ward, the month beforehand. I was starving myself at the time too. I could see my eye sockets poking through my cheeks. But she felt content to leave.

She hurt me a lot these past 20 years, but I love her all the same. She was the last person I thought I could go to, but it seems every time I tell her something weighing on me, if it’s even remotely critical of the her she finds a way to satirize it.

And every time she does (and to be honest, quite often in general), I just imagine killing myself in the most horrific ways. throwing myself off the staircase and opening my head on the wooden floor of my living room, at night, or hanging myself from the ceiling fan like a shitty paper garland.

Oh, and on top of this, I’m trans. My extended family looks at me like I am a leper. 40 percent of my country doesn’t think I should exist and, in my own case, I thoroughly fucking agree with them

To relieve her, and everyone else, of the burden I am in the most thorough way possible, almost feels like the punchline of a joke. Like, you all asked for this, so here it is!

I noticed all these problems happened when I had my 1st job.Sharp pain in ribs sometimes,also found out I’m underweight.I feel like my brain is tense for no reason.I feel fatigue and sluggish even with sleep.I excessively worry about multiple things that should be common sense but my brain doesn’t sense like it used(ex.when to use restroom).

Nothing distracts me and I want to be calm but my mind is worried.I’ve never had bad anxiety but feel soon I’m going to reach a point and have a breakdown or do something I normally wouldn’t just to get the frustration of stress/anxiety out.I isolating myself right now to calm my mind but still worried about dying because of chest and digestive issues.

I wish I was okay but I haven’t been to the doctor because they are closed.I’m always lazy and normally wouldn’t be around anyone but been doing because I’m afraid I might die because some days my chest would hurt waking up and digestive issues and my gut feeling of knowing what to do isn’t working.

I’m impulsive but if I’m not that I can be alone forever but feel like I have a fake personality to be someone I’m not all because I don’t want to die alone so hang around my family sometimes but I get overwhelmed without feeling like I am until it hits me.

I don’t feel sad or happy just always nothingness being slow and worrying with my brain being dumb.I know I’m underweight but overwhelmed all the time.I feel like I have depression because of these problems or because I ignored having it in the past.

I feel nauseous at times and don’t get hungry so make myself. My chest hurts and feel like somethings gonna happen to me before I hav/ the chance to see a doctor since theyre closed but have no money.

After three and a half years I finally caught Covid. Currently feeling like utter crap, and it’s barely my second day of symptoms. I want to go to the ER because of the aches in my ears, and neck, and chest, and head- but I know there’s nothing they can do for me right now. My mental health is in the dumps and I feel hopeless rn. I have pretty significant health anxiety so I’m spiraling about that too. I can’t go home right now because I live with high risk individuals and I don’t drive, which is great. I caught it riding a train. How could someone knowingly put other people at risk via public transportation?? Fuck you, you selfish unmasked ass. This sucks really bad, I’m trying to stay strong but I don’t have fight left in me. My fever already reached 102, very bitter that I will probably remain this way for at least two weeks.

"Homie!

That sucks,  but I have a lot of good news.

First, this happens. You shouldn't feel too bad. I'm vaccinated and boosted and caught it a year ago. It sucks, but whatever.

Assuming you're vaccinated, the worst outcomes are less likely. And, since others are vaccinated, they're safer too.

Hey! Thank you so much for being kind. My symptoms are definitely more bearable than that first day. I’m actually doing ok so far as I’ve been vaccinated and boosted. This was definitely a spiral post in the heat of everything. I’ve been able to get a prescription for PAXLOVID, don’t know if I’ll take it yet but it soothes me to have the option for now. Hopefully my symptoms improve or at least stay same same now that the fever broke and the aches subsided mostly.

"I have been obviously stressed yet secretly depressed for a while now. My partner knows it, but I'm not sure he knows how much worse it has gotten over these past few months. 

I haven't had a job in months (was sick & depressed) and when I was feeling a bit better,   no one would accept me. I barely have any savings left and it has been one of the reasons why I've been depressed. I feel pressured to make and save money asap because I know it's my partner's dream to live abroad and I also originally wanted to get away from the hell hole that is my country so I could finally be away from my toxic parents. 

Apart from that, I have a lot more reasons for my depression: manipulative and abusive parents, caring for my siblings who are far away from me (my 1 sibling is autistic), and just so much more that if I list them all down, I'll be writing a novel.

Anyways -- the title says it all. 

I am tired. I try to want to live these past few days but the noises in my head are just getting too much, I have been secretly crying almost everyday, Im anxious one of my parents will attempt to cause me harm, I have no job, I feel like I have no future, and I just feel so alone. 

I feel like I have no one to talk to, even with my partner. He listens and maybe I say too much, but I don't think he really understands since he often forgets what I say afterwards.

I just want to end it all but I don't want to bother anybody. I can't do it where I live (I live in my partner's family's other house) because when I'm gone, I dont want my partner to blame himself or for his family to be scared of the house or of me. I only have little savings so if I'm gone, I'm worried someone will be burdened with funeral arrangements and other expenses. 

I dont want anybody to feel sad or blame themselves, especially my partner and my siblings. I don't want to burden anybody, but I just need to be gone. How can I do this without bothering anyone? 

I'm sincerely asking, thank you."	cupified	post	13.757497714660275	female	White	0.9953782558441162	na	na	na	1	SuicideWatch	failed

Both of my parents have died of cancer. Everyone in my family that has died have died from cance. Some of them smoked but not all of them. I have smoked in the past and have quite cold turkey multiple times usually stress has been the factor and I'll stop once the stress dose. But I have it in my head I'm not quitting this time I don't see a reason to the only reason I'm not doing my plan is because of my sister.

What to expect from calling?  I have severe suicidal thoughts.  I have bipolar disorder, CPTSD,anxiety and panic disorder,substance use disorder I need help but I don’t want to go to hospital I don’t want police involvement. I have autism and don’t do well with phone calls. My suicidal thoughts are getting worse and I haven’t slept in a long time since I found out my mom allowed me to be molested when I was a kid.

I didn't have many friends but people around me is nice and willing to help, if only I reach out to them, but I don't want to be a burden. I'm a failure but somehow I feel like my parents' favourite kid. I feel like I should be happy given decent conditions, but I don't. I can't function at all. Still failed at everything. The reason I'm depressed is just me. I don't deserve all the loves and helps pouring on me. Waste of resources.

"! I'd like to be clear that I am safe right now! 
for the past month I've been at about a level 8.5 on the suicide scale, I've written a suicide note and I update it occasionally, a couple hours ago I cut my wrist but didn't have the pain tolerance nor the balls to cut deep enough for it to kill me/hit an artery, , I did it with the intent of bleeding out but evidently failed, is this an attempt or just selfharm/a suicidal gesture? and as an add on question, what do I do now, I have no clue how to go about telling anyone (even though my mother is aware of my suicidality) it seems like such a scary thing to tell someone about...

I encourage you to tell your mother as she already knows some things about this since it can genuinely help so much in my personal experience.

Moreover if you had the intent to attempt, I feel like it’s an attempt. However it doesn’t really matter since all that matters is your safety. The label you slap on what happened won’t truly change anything.

My main tip for telling a loved one or friend about things like this is as follows: 
Leave a note with whatever is wrong wherever they will 100% find it. This way the confrontation is less harsh therefore it might be easier to talk about it

I only get criticized and talk down to the fact the last conversation I had with my dad he told me my life was worthless. because I don’t help him on my days off for free all the time. my ex-wife has messaged me every two months for the past 10 years to tell me what a piece of shit I am somehow. my teenage son only talks to me when he wants money or car. No one has ever just hung out with me to pass the time as always they want something or I don’t exist. One of these days I’ll find the courage to pull the trigger. I feel it’s coming soon.

Sounds like your wife and dads words have beat you down and made you feel worthless. You're not worthless, you have as much value as the next person, try calling your son out on this and don't give into him, he's likely been poisoned against you by the ex too, this happens a lot in divorces/seperation.

"I love her so so much and she's the greatest woman I've ever met, but sometimes she suffocates me. 

I do sh and have cuts and scars in my right thigh, and because of that I haven't let my mom see me in bikini or underwear(she used to wax my legs so she saw me in panties a lot) in sometime. My family it's in a resort right now, we're all 4 of us(mom, dad, Lil bro and me) in one room, so just one bathroom. Today we are going home, so instead of going to the pool with my dad and brother I stayed bc there's a tub here and I wanted to use it before going home.

My mom is packing and I told her ""I'll take all the things out of the bathroom"" (so I can lock the door) and she got mad bc she says she changed my diapers and bathed me when I was a baby, so she should be able to go in and out of the bathroom even tho I'm 18(almost 19) also saying that I'm ridiculous and that ""me and my friends change in front of each other"" (not true we usually don't see each other naked and the only time someone has it was a dare). I told her that I wasn't going to use the tub anymore cause I wasn't in the mood and she told me to just get in the fucking tub. I feel like I don't have the right to decide anything bc when I decide something it's just ignored or makes people mad. This types of confrontation just make me want to die more.

It would be shocking for any parent to hear. The best thing that you can do to do check-ins with her. Talk about it openly with her as calmly as you can and try to get as much information from her as possible. Just to figure out how active her thoughts are. Does she have a plan and the means to carry it out? Ask her if she can be safe for the next 24 hours and then check in again to see if she still feels the same way. Remove anything that she could possibly use to act on the thoughts for her safety. And when she gets her assessment let them know about it as well so they can be aware too. It will be difficult to not react overly emotionally, but if you do she may withhold information from you down the line. Encourage her to keep an open line of communication with you. It may help her if you can share some of your experiences with her and how you cope with things. Obviously we want the positive coping skills. But she’s so young and if she can get the proper help and tools she needs, she will be better off for it in the long run. Not to say it’s a cure all but it can help make things more manageable.

"poor choices .
well, taking things away just causes more frustration and less critical thinking 
she act on emotion no reason to be exact
better way to handle this is
lets go for a walk .. then you talk to her about her choices and how this affect you and the one that lover her.
she needs a mom no a mom-ster 
you are dealer with a young people that can't control emotions yet . even as an adult you don't control emotions and when you fight with your husband you most likely would say thing to hurt him mentally too.

We did this. Well, sorta. We sat her down in the chill space and had a talk about consequences. Why her stuff was taken and why she made the choices she made. (She was irresponsible with said stuff). We talked a long time. She also deals with RSD and that's always a toughy. I assure you I'm not a momster. Her consequences were plainly laid out (if you do/don't do xyz this is what's going to happen) at the beginning of the day. She made bad choices and when it came time for the consequences of those choices she got pissed. She flat out said during our talk that she didn't really feel that way and she was just mad and wanted her stuff back. Again we talked about why the stuff was taken. This is a very string willed child and if I don't follow through on consequences, behaviors get 10x worse.

Lucky you were never a waste of time. We all love you. You aren’t a bother but we have enjoyed helping and supporting you. I know you feel as if life isn’t worth living if you can’t get what you deserve. But that’s not in your control or the point to life. Life is about making the best out of what you’ve been given and with what strength we possess working towards good. Your life is not over and you can still find happiness even if you don’t ever get a surgery that changes you physically or chemicals that make you feel more complete. You are already enough and your story is one that if you stick around could become beautiful. Because what’s the point of gaining everything if we didn’t struggle for it? The hardships of life and overcoming is what makes the victory sweet. Please don’t leave yet. Again we love you.

"I’ve been suicidal for a little over 20 years now. I grew up a minority and experienced racism and still do to this day. Besides that to wear my aunt, uncle and grandpa all committed suicide so I guess it is in my genes. 

I had a good life where it wasn’t all downs over last 20 years but I also haven’t been perfect. I now find myself separated and don’t see my kids. I cannot bare to show them the broken person I am now either.  I’ve now been alone for a week and attempted last night. I cannot swim and was walking off the dock when some teens decided to walk down and enjoy some joints on the dock. Was so close, but had mixed feelings. I wrote a suicide note for everyone during the day called what if. The biggest one that stood out to me was what if I had the strength to deal with this. I do not feel like I did until lately. Now I feel like it’s the only option. I want to say goodbye, but also don’t want to in a sense of it would only cause more hurt. 

Maybe a small part of me wants to live as I am writing this. I know reaching out to people in my life would get support, but also would hinder me wanting to end my life.

Hi, Im pretty new to reddit Im just trying to find place I can vent. Im having hard time just staying alive. Have been suicidal for over 9 months since my boyfriend(m21) left me(f 22) and found someone else. It wasnt long relationship but I really loved him. He is very intelligent, honest and brave. I miss him very much. I tried to give him everything. I brought him food to work when he had evening shift, I bought him things he needed and said how much he means to me very often. I bought us a trip, I made candle lit bath for him. I really tried. We had a great connection at least imo. But sometimes he yelled at me and lowered my self esteem almost constantly, sometimes he didnt listen to me. I communicated my needs like reciprocated efforts but he didnt even try. Idk what happened but one day we got into an argument over a trivial thing and he dumped me. In a week he had found someone else. I couldnt go to school, I couldnt stop crying. Im not sure what I did wrong till this day I loved him very much. He told me he loves his new girl. We got into a fight and I was really pissed. I said she is ugly compared to me. I regret it very deeply I know I shouldnt have said that. Apologized many times, still feel horrible to this day. I dont know what I did wrong when we were together. It just felt like he didnt care at all. I care for him very deeply to this day I hope he really is happy. I just cant seem to move on. Im not sure if I ever will be able to love again, to be happy again. I didnt deserve what he did to me. Before the last argument I never was mean. I used to be so happy, soft, kind and loving and I cant stand having my heart shattered like this. He told me Im horrible person and nuisance, that I was burdening him with my love. I never want to love like this again. I never want to write poems for someone and give them cute heart I made from paper. I feel like Im already dead and started to gather some pills I could maybe use. But Im such a coward. Im not sure if I can ask for tips or encouragement here but I would appreciate it. I feel so deeply unhappy. I truly loved him and he didn’t give a shit about me. Maybe Im horrible person and the world would be better off without me.

I am a 16 year old girl and I’m fucking ugly. And I don’t need any of your “that’s not true” “ people view you as different” bullshit. I know it’s true and everybody else does. I can’t make friends, and the only friends I can make don’t want to hang out with me. I only have 3 friends I’m pretty sure they hate me. Why can’t I just make friends? Why am I so pathetic that I actually have to giggle how to make friends. Please just give me advice. I don’t care if I have to change myslef I’m just so lonely that I can’t take it anymore. Please I just need advice. Do I need to change my looks? The way I act just tell me.

"My sister was in a similar situation when she was in high school. It's hard in part because it's a small pool of people who all decide their social groups before they really know who they are.

Getting into a bigger pool is what helped her to find her people. I'm not sure if that's something that would help you or not - I guess I just want to convey that your experience in high school may or may not reflect your experience after it.

I completely understand you. I'm 22 and still googling how to make friends. It's not easy. In school, I kinda was a little different as I was totally the weird kid, and people knew that but mostly just avoided me instead of bullying me... I don't know what the answer is, I think maybe a critical point of child development of making friends was not met for me and caused me to have a lot of issues connecting with people. But I don't have a real true friend right now, lots of surface level ones. But I have before!

Idk, man. I heard an interesting quote last night on YouTube looking up reasons to live. Some random author wrote, ""One must imagine sisyphus happy,"" which kinda got me. 

Life is suffering. It sucks so bad. But we only get this once as far as we know.. even the worst most terrible of things is something unique only we experience in the vast cosmos of the universe. We will die eventually, so we might as well just take what we have and see what paths we go down.

Take away any meanings you hold for the act of crying or being emotional. We humans (and animals and nature) need to cry, it is essential. There is a saying that loosely says when the sky cries (rains), you too can let the tears flow. Encouraging and reminding us that we are nature. Do what feels natural. 

You don’t need to fight. Please don’t be ashamed, be proud of who and what you are right now. Others will always do what they want. If you please them, you will be pleasing them your whole life.

"I got divorced just over a year ago and my finances have been in a freefall ever since. Credit card debt and expensive coping mechanisms have wiped out my savings. I was working two jobs to keep myself stable and I walked away from both because I thought I could go into a commission sales job and make enough to finally dig myself out of this hole.

However, my past trauma makes it really hard to deal with customers and my sales are shit. I'm working harder than I ever have just to lose money month after month. I have no degree so no one will hire me. I can't go back to the jobs I left. I'm watching what little money I have left dwindle away and know bankruptcy isn't too far away.

Everyone says I just need to hang in there, but I've been doing that my entire life. I'm tired of enduring. I'm tired of being strong for others because they don't want to hear about my problems. My entire life is dedicated to unsatisfying work that doesn't make me money, then coming home to an empty apartment.

Whatever future I wanted for myself has slipped out of my grasp. I let myself get boxed into this corner and there is no way out except to go through more suffering. I just want it all to end, and I am so tired of pretending that I don't. My plan is in place and I am ready to go, tomorrow night.

Hello. I’ve been struggling for the past year, not necessarily with suicide, but something along the lines of such. Nothing particularly bad nor good has happened to me throughout my life. I’m just a random, average, teenage guy. I am not a very patient person, and despite the fact that I am still very young, I feel like I’m wasting my life if I’m not constantly doing what I love (hiking/trekking). I consider myself a man of science. I don’t believe in an afterlife, nor do I follow any religion. I believe that I have gathered a suffice amount of knowledge regarding space, time, physics, etc. to be able to make my own logical philosophical theories I have yet to prove. Im not scared of death at all, I’m only scared of the fact that I might miss the opportunity to do what I love doing. Anyways, I’m finding it extremely frustrating that, well, it’s all futile. Whether I’m a teachers pet or a serial killer, everyone’s gonna die soon and it’s not going to matter at all. Sure, it’s a sad philosophy- but unfortunately it’s true. Im struggling to just sit in class, essentially wasting my best years learning, for nothing! I get good grades and all but for what cause? I don’t know what’s going to give me enough hope to trudge through these next few bored of years but it better come soon.

hey, as I read through your post I realized that I feel the same way. I'm also just a teenager and I'm just really bored with everything. my grades are ok but I often feel very jealous of my sister who's insanely good at everything she does. I could probably get better if i wasn't so lazy but I feel it's just wasting my time, especially if I don't get the results I want. But then again, I still have my whole life in front of me and maybe I'll figure out what I want to do?  My  advice for you would be going hiking regulary (in case you're not doing that already) and sort out your thoughts while being outside. This helps me too. Knowing that there are other teens out there that feel the same way as I do helps me a lot actually and I hope it does the same for you. I'm really sorry if my rant was not as helpful as you hoped it would be but I wish you the best.

"Long story short about 8 years ago I have had an ear infection and took 2 tablets of paracetamol and eardrops prescribed by a doctor. I really wanted to relax before bed so I smoked a good joint and though I will fall asleep soon. Unfortunately what happened next is still a mystery to me. 
Suddenly I started to hear voices in my head telling me they are aliens contacting me through telepathy. I really felt like someone have taken control over my body and I couldn't resist what was happening (Psychotic episode?) I listened to them and what they said and ran to the nearby lake where the portal opened (delusion?) and I jumped into the river. I let my body sink and drown. I took deep breaths in underwater and my senses have disappeared. I have no idea for how long I was there but I woke up and understood that I'm still there and have to swim out. It felt like I rised from the dead. (Lucky?)
I then had a lot of visions, like past lives etc (was I hallucinating?) and a voice telling me about my missions in this life etc.
I believed in all of this for a long time until I started thinking what really happened is that I attempted suicide without realising it.
Is it even possible?
I still can't understand what happened.
Was it marijuanna effect on me mixed with paracetamol or the ear infection just fucked up my brain? I was depressed at the time but I never really wanted to die. I had suicidal thoughts but never planned to attempt suicide.
All insights are welcome, just want to understand what happened..."	oxygen-heart	post	29.3306876213	female	White	0.020951053127646446	na	na	na	11	SuicideWatch	no prediction.
As someone with psychotic disorder, I can tell you I don't tolerate weed well. I can do other things but I'm terrified of weed. It's called cannabis induced psychosis.

Im unable to vent to literally anyone. No one will tell me the truth straight up. Nobody wants to hear what I have to say anyways. Im mad but really deep down im so depressed I could die. Each day I think about it. Each day everyone just pushes me closer to the edge. Like little paid off terrorists targeting my mind. Im about to do something really stupid. I already am not going to see my kid anymore so what else is there to live for besides my bf whom probably is just as fake as everyone else is to my face. I also suffer from body image issues. Im not ever able to get enjoyment out of things I normally would. At every moment I start to have a good time it gets abruptly ruined by some odd inconvenience or setback. Im never going to be at the end unless it’s my own life that’s ending because I don’t and I won’t speak up. Only gets me in worse of a situation.

"I want out so badly. I’ve never in my life wanted to commit suicide so much. I spend Monday -Wednesday and Friday battling my mental health with my job because I hate it so much. I’ve never in my life hated a job so much that I cry before clocking in every single day. The verbal abuse and the repetitiveness that I endure is beyond what I can handle anymore. On top of that I only make enough to break even for my bills. My best-friend and my soulmate is now a stranger. Even tho our relationship was fixable I don’t think he gets it. I feel taken for granted by him so I separated myself for the sake of me already on edge state of mental health and maybe I made things worse for myself.

Everyday is a day full of agony. I don’t do anything I don’t go anywhere. I’ve isolated myself from everyone .. don’t even know why I have a phone and I seriously just want fucking out. I want to kill my self .. I don’t want to go to hell. Maybe God will spare me. But I want out… I want it end now and today.

"If I didn’t have my daughter, I would leave Earth immediately. I struggle between being selfish and leaving and staying and being miserable but faking a smile every day for her. 

I’m (27F) a single mom who is divorced, broke and in insane amount of debt. My mom and dad are poor and I live across the country from them. However, I’m currently staying with my mom back in my hometown because I’m moving to the east coast so my daughter can be near her dads big family.

Her dad makes six figures and doesn’t help me financially while I have her full time for the next few months until we resume 50/50 custody.

I hate confrontation and he has a lot of money so I don’t want to take him to court for help. I’m afraid he will get her full time and I will be left without her.

After years in the Army doing autopsies on service members who were KIA or killed themselves and being left for dead in the middle of the road by another soldier after raping me from a drugged drink, I’m now just left with PTSD and nightmare disorder. I procrastinate sleeping because the dreams are so bad so every day I’m a zombie and I just have to pretend everything is okay for my kid.

I don’t even know where I’m going with this. I’m just stressed from trying to save money to be able to move across the country so my daughter can have a better life and I’m tired.

"I have always battled with suicidal thoughts and urges, with my own share of attempts in the past too. But now it feels more like the right thing to do, not going through with it feels like a cruelty I cannot bear to commit. I feel so terribly guilty for still existing, I'm nothing more than a burdensome curse who should have stayed alone.

With all my heart and soul, I love the most sweet, kind, perfect and beautiful girl in the world, the only thing that makes this miserable life worth living. Every breath I take is for her, yet every one is a cruelty to her. She means everything to me, and it's breaking my heart and tearing me apart to know that she would be burdened and condemned to such a sad, painful, and empty existence with me.

She loves me more than anyone ever has, I've never known a love more pure or powerful than hers. I could never be worthy of her, yet she accepts me with all my flaws, and adores me despite all of my defects. She would even condemn herself to spending the rest of her life with me, and as much as I selfishly dream of this, no thought brings me more pain.

I'm an ill, ugly, useless, and pathetic wretch. I am utterly useless and will become even more so. My ugly and broken form, only destined to diminish more and become even less. I possess a mind for her to somehow love, yes, but I can offer her no more.

Shall I deprive her of the chance of something better? Someone better than such a lowly and shameful excuse for a man, such as myself?

Yes, she loves me, there is no doubt. She says she wants to be with me more than anything, but I know the pain behind her words, the very selfless sacrifice behind them.

How can I condemn my beloved to such misery? I feel as though the best thing I could do for her, the greatest act of love for her, would be ending my sad, sorry joke of a life.

I don't deserve someone as amazing as her, and she deserves someone far greater than me. Perhaps the best thing I could do for her is to finally set her free."	Dead-and-Broken	post	13.466597159404255	female	White	0.9899157881736755	na	na	na	2	SuicideWatch	no prediction.

"I’ve been sad for quite a while now. Everyone says it’s suppose to get better, don’t get me wrong I’m sure it will, but it’s been a downpour since then. Nothing has alleviated. The day before I bought an engagement ring my girlfriend said she was no longer in love with me. My job didn’t give me the raise. She is now on tinder saying she’s there to just sleep with other men (she said “figuring it out” but she never denied sleeping was an option) but still wants to be friends with me at the moment. Now that I live alone I can’t afford rent and my brand new car along with other debts (I just had hiatal hernia surgery a month after this happened which added even more stress to this, the diet and all it’s restrictions). I can’t seem to go further in life financially (I could afford items when we would split rent together otherwise I paid for a majority of stuff). 

I feel like I need to make a note here. Because people will probably tell me my ex is toxic or a bad person and I deserve better. No, she had valid reasons to leave and she is a great person. She’s very caring and I will always appreciate her. I needed to be a better person, stay committed to what I said I would (I did in the last month of our relationship but it was too far gone and late at that point). So I was the problem, please don’t take it out on her. I should have been a better partner.

Anyway, I was going to propose before a Taylor Swift concert but she took someone else with her instead because she wanted the night to be magical and she wanted someone with her who could make her meaningful memories. That was the second most hurtful comment. The first was when she told me we were breaking up that she went to work and a co-worker said something and she got turned on. She said she then thought “when was the last time you (me, the poster of this story) turned me on like that”.

I’ve always been the one to try and make people happy. It’s almost like a job for me but I volunteer for it. I love being a people pleaser, but I wish I could find a way to make myself happy.

I know it’s supposed to get better. But every time something happens it’s not for the better and I’m trying to remember the last time I was happy. I spend almost every night crying but it stopped recently. It’s like I have no liquid left in my body and I’ve accepted the sadness as a part of myself. It’s like I almost view life as pointless and I no longer view that as sad, but as a fact. It’s odd, I’ve never had this before. Usually I cry and cry, but the last few days I’ve just accepted that sadness is me and nothing will get better so what’s the point of crying. I’m in the worst spot of my life. I need advice if you’re willing to offer because I’m really low and struggling right now. Thank you whoever you are for taking the time to read this.

"I don't know if it helps, but what you're describing is normal, in a way. People are designed to adapt to anything, and at some point we all get numb to things we never thought we could get numb to. It's a terrible thing to watch yourself accept sadness as a part of you. It can almost feel like your body is giving up. I'm not sure if you feel that way. 

It might be a good idea to seek help from a professional if you haven't already. I don't want to toss out solutions based on a single post - that kind of help can be given better from a professional who knows you.

Assuming you're in the US - calling the United Way 2-1-1 line or going to findhelp.org can offer financial resources specific to your area, if you're interested in that.

"I reached my absolute worst point about four and a half years ago, and somehow was able to get through it without hospitalization or a suicide attempt.  For the last three years I’ve somehow managed to delude myself into thinking that things might actually turn out okay, that I may actually manage to get my life back at some point.  Now everything is going to hell all over again and I’m terrified of going through all that trauma all over again, or worse.  

I have CFS constantly draining my energy, serious depression and my heart is pounding all the time, causing adrenaline rushes through my system and scaring me so much that I begin to cry my eyes out.  I also have OCD and the horrible intrusive thoughts/urges are returning.  I am behaving too recklessly and compulsively for a person in my condition and I need to stop but I don’t know how.  I am so deeply restless all day long but too sick to add in more activity.  I am afraid I am only making myself worse and potentially heading toward the death spiral.

The worst of all though are these empty feelings inside.  Feeling like I don’t truly care about anyone.  Feeling like I don’t actually want to get better.  Feeling like I don’t actually want love.  Feeling like nothing is important to me except sensation and stimulation, a stimulation that is always too intense for me and a stimulation that can only make me sicker inside and out.

"i have social anxiety. it is not professionally diagnosed because i am unable to open up to anyone about my struggles. social anxiety is the root cause of almost everything terrible in my life. 
i am struggling serverely at school because i am physically unable to ask for help. teachers don't know what's wrong with me because i am the perfectly well behaved girl at the back of the class. i should be smart and i should be thriving but i am not because i cannot ask for help. 
i struggle with a chronic illness, have since i was a kid. it took 14 years for my parents to notice how much pain i was in because i cannot ask for help. i started medication for it at 14 when it became so servere that i could not hide it anymore. it worked for a while but is now no longer effective, i am in constant pain again but i cannot ask for help. this pain is another factor affecting my performance at school because i am in so much pain i am unable to sit at a desk to do homework. i lay in bed all day because the pain is more bearable when i can thrash around. 
i resorted to self harm because i was unable to open up about my mental health. i resorted to self harm to distract for the pain of my chronic illness. i resorted to self harm because i am a dull empty person because i am in bed too much to have hobbies. 
my social anxiety means that i struggle to connect to my friends. i cannot tell them anything personal about myself. i can only hold meanless conversations about nothing because they are what my social anxiety deems safe. i feel isolated and without purpose. my social anxiety means that i have never dated anyone. ive never really had a crush, but i don't know if that's because im afraid to. my friends are losing their virginities and partying had having life experiences. im stuck in bed too afraid to. 
my social anxiety means that my parents don't know me. my social anxiety means that my friends don't love me. my social anxiety means that i will never have a partner. my social anxiety means that i will always be in pain. my social anxiety means that i am failing school. my social anxiety means that i have no future. my social anxiety means that i have no will to live. my social anxiety means that my life is not worth living. 

usually i can deal with this. i ignore it and i pretend that everything is fine and im not on the brink of suicide without anyone to support me. 
but last night i drank with my friends for the first time, and for the first time i had a taste of life without social anxiety. i was able to tell my friends i loved them. i was able to compliment them without shame. i was able to embrace them without fear. i was able to talk to them about things that i never would have sober. i was able to support them when they cried without struggling for the perfect thing to say. i was able to laugh without worrying what other people would see. 

it was the most exhilarating thing i have ever done and i an so so angry that this is what people are able to experience every day of their lives. im tired of being burdened by worry. im tired of embarrassing myself. im tired of being in pain. i understand alcoholics now, i would do anything to feel that free again. i don't want to start drinking though, throw myself from one pit to another. i wish i could just be like normally. but i can't, and i feel like the hollowness in my chest is swallowing me up. i will never be able to connect with my loved ones, and i will never be able to experience the things that my peers are. instead i am laying on my bed, writing this like it'll change anything, wishing i was drunk and free.

"I relate very much to what you said about social anxiety, especially drinking. The feeling of freedom i got when i first got drunk was the happiest I've felt since i was a little child. Last year when i had a summer job in a money exchange shop it finally broke me. Having to interact with customers all day, going to the bank, making phone calls and even sending emails kept me up more nights than anything before. I feel so pathetic that knowing i had to make a simple phone call the next day kept me up all night. That's when i first started considering suicide. And that's when i finally realised it's the only solution i have. I had years of hope and working on myself, trying to get better, and one summer was all it took to finally break me.

Idk if it's like a fantasy but I probably would chicken out last second (not saying this about people who chose not to end themselves, i am just a coward/loser but the people who actually chose not to are very strong people). I have things I look forward towards like shows, games, and stuff but I would be lying if i did not have daydream moments where I just grab a knife and bounce outta life. I am not diagnosed as depressed so please don't take any of this seriously, I am probably just having a moment or something. I just wish to not exist, ik this is kinda corny/emo to say but at times I wish I was never born, so them someone else in my place could deal with this instead.

"Too depressed to even think about anything. Im so numb. I havent eaten much in a week. Starving myself each day. The pain allows me to feel something.

I’m so lonely. I have no one. I have a plushie and that’s it. I couldnt even squeeze it last night because I feel so uncomfortable from pain. 

I just want to think of my love who passed away. I love them so much. It’s hard concentrate on anything besides the pain. I know now that this will help me to carry out the plan.

People fail to love up to any sort of standard to me. I hate reddit. I wish there were a better place to complain. There isn’t and that’s sad to say. I’ve been in a few other places even telegram channels and they were all shit, usually ruled by clueless individuals, people wanting their users to die, or both. The world is so evil and filled with filth it gets almost impossible to see what little good is in it and that little bit just isn’t worth living for.

I’m desposable. Trash. Empty. Worthless. Meaningless. No value. When I die, I’ll rest. The best peace I’ll have be with.

I had so much love to give. I don’t think I’m from this earth because everywhere I see are heartless. I’ll tell my plushie I love that instead since no one could ever shower me with love like I had.

This was just a vent. Not an invite to critique and ridicule me or tell me how wonderful life is to them. Make your own thread if you’re also suicidal and feel that way. 

This didn’t help me writing this today because of the pain. It ruins everything. I just wish I could have been loved.

"The toxic positivity here makes me wanna throw up tbh, I’m so tired of false hope 
It will never get better  
Life is hell and full of shit and even if there is some good moments they’re just not fucking worth it, if i would compare the small amounts of “good moments” in life with all the daily pain, suffering and agony it’s not worth it at all. fuck this I’m done 
The false hope and waiting for things to get better is just a whole other level of torture. thinking that maybe it’s worth to stay here despite the endless loop of hell that you’re trapped in and waiting years or decades for things to get better or atleast for the pain to get easier to bare is just prolonging your suffering, life has no meaning whatsoever 
I used to believe in a bunch of bs that if you try and work hard emough and stay positive and don’t give up things will get better eventually 
Because god is watching and what you’re going through is some kind of lesson that you need to learn and you just need to prove to god that you’re strong enough and deserve to be happy you will eventually be happy and bla bla bla. now I realized that god prolly doesn’t exist life is unfair and there’s no good moments in life that worth to stay for. every good/joyful moment is temporary and everything always loses it’s worth with time and the pain is always there it’s attached to your skin like a tick and it won’t go away. Life is like Russian roulette some people are born lucky in a rich/financially secure and loving family,with good looks and health and life is just so good for them they got almost nothing to worry abput, their only type of problems is that they’re being late for a date or smthing they just don’t have the heavyweight of chronic stress on their shoulders. and others are born destined to be miserable in a fucked up poor family with no friends, looking ugly/average with poor health,bullied,lonely,betrayed,left behind,unlovable and treated like trash all the time over and over again so people like us who’s destined to be miserable have no choice other than death and it doesn’t even matter eventually everything will end everyone will die so why keep prolonging the suffering and the slow torture of existence?"

The only people who love me are biologically obligated to do so. I really can't imagine why anybody else would bother. I'm a fucking spare. I've never been enough, and I doubt I'll start being enough tomorrow. I'm a complete waste and insult to the ridiculous gifts bestowed by my upbringing.

Hello, I’m honestly kind of afraid to post personal stuff of me online but I don’t really have anyone else to talk to irl. For quite a while I’ve felt extremely alone as well as suicidal. I’ve even gone through scenarios of how I would do it. However, I still feel afraid to go through with it. I’ve never gone to see if I have mental problems or not but I just always feel like I’m bouncing from being content to being lonely and depressed. Most of the time I spend at my house by myself. Since graduating I’ve lost practically all my friends so I feel even more alone with this problem. Maybe this is the wrong place to ask but it would nice to find people to talk to about all this, friends or something I’m not sure. Sorry for the rambling.

"Hello, i’m very sorry if this is not the right place to ask this. My partner struggles with depression and suicidal ideation, and I want to support them the best I can even though I can’t understand what he is going through. It pains me so much to see the horrible things they experience in their life and how it is affecting them. I want them to feel comfortable and safe talking to me about how they feel, but I often say the same things because I just don’t know what to say even though these things are how I am feeling. I tried researching on the internet but it said nothing of use. I thought maybe asking people who have gone through similar experiences may know what would help. 

I know that as a partner I am unable to completely help them on my own. I just want him to feel safe and like he can talk to me about how he feels. He has expressed that he doesn’t feel like talking to me about it does anything. If anyone has any words that have been helpful to them or anything of the sort, they would be greatly appreciated.

"When you notice your partner is feeling down you can offer talking through things or offer some kind of distraction. They may not want to talk about their feelings - but watching tv, cuddling, or talking about silly/ simple things can help.  Sometimes just being there and open is enough. sometimes… You may not be able to help. 

You can always ask questions about what it’s like for them, try your best to understand. You can try letting them lead the conversation, listening more instead of talking. But if they feel like talking isn’t doing anything to help then you can try to be supportive in other ways. If the depression makes it hard to clean you can help pick up a bit, order them food or flowers as a gesture. Set up a game night.

i would say remind them that you care without being overwhelming. suicidal ideation is an extremely vulnerable thing to talk about, and it takes time to even get there. what you can do now is day by day, do a small thing that reminds him you need him. he shouldn’t live just to keep you happy, but it’s enough in the short term to keep him around until he can find a reason for himself to live. i wouldn’t be too overwhelming and concerned because when my family did that to me it felt off putting and i felt exposed. just find things in his life that you know he finds joy in	urethra_annihilator3	reply	na	na	na	0.9973134398460388	weak	no	no	na	SuicideWatch	failed

"I’m 15 and yet I already have my plan set for where I will jump, the only things keeping me here are my parents, friends and puppy. I could’ve done it earlier today. I had a knife in my hand, could’ve done it. Wouldn’t have been to long, would’ve felt like a relief if I was able to watch the bliss trickle off my wrist, I’m debating slicing or jumping. Idk yet, gonna work it out soon. Anyways, surely slicing both wrists will double the rate at which you bleed to death? I imagine sometimes that on the news they would report that a 15yr old had committed suicide, and that someone would be me. I lay in bed at night praying to God that I die in my sleep and that I never ever have to wake up again and deal with this life and world ever again. It isn’t my parents fault or any family members fault. I could never blame them. I’ve been doing research on suicide notes and how to write them. Research what damage a 3 story building would do to me if I jumped (it’s a building at my school). So yea I’ll be in class imagining myself jumping off the building, I debate wether or not to write a suicide note on my laptop and send it to someone to print out for me. Idek what I’m doing here anymore. I ref football (soccer) and just cop abuse almost every week because I made a decision someone didn’t like, I mean like I’m a 15 yr old boy trying to do a job and being abused by 40-50 yr old men.

I'm going through so much painful hardships everyday, each day I'm crying asking Allah to stop the pain I'm feeling but he doesn't do it and gives me so much horrible Hardships, last year I run outside naked cause I heard voices telling me to run outside naked and I went to the hospital because of it, everyday I'm home alone with no one to talk too , I suffer so much with my mental health and the pain I'm feeling is unbearable, everyone around me is getting blessed with fame, wealth, happiness, getting married and having kids while I'm struggling with so much pain everyday til the point I want to commit suicide everyday, I don't know how I'm gonna survive til I'm old it's so unfair, everyday I'm just home alone with my painful hardships and Torment in my mind .

"It’s hard to find a ways to continue living and enjoying life when I feel like I’m the only one in it. Everyone around me is so inconsistent. No one really cares about me or if they do, there’s always something more important in their life than me. I’m so insignificant. I’m not worth an effort to anyone. 

I have great relationships (friendships) but they still feel empty, probably because I’ve never experienced unconditional love and probably never will. I hate my life. It’s so empty. There’s a huge, permanent void left where a family should be. I have never had stability or support and doing everything on my own for so long is beyond exhausting."	tajajaja	post	16.824560797593108	female	White	0.9994776844978333	na	na	na	0	SuicideWatch	no prediction.
"I just called a local phone service. I needed someone to talk to and listen to me. It was a trained counsellor. I didn’t realise it was only going to be 15-20 minutes. So after 20 minutes of talking and her assuring (herself mainly) that I won’t off myself any time soon she let me go. That was the first time I called to talk to someone I think? But I’m having déjà vu now. Been getting a lot of déjà vu recently. To say that it was pretty disappointing is putting it very mildly. 

Anyway. I wrote something today. I find when  there’s no one around, no one to talk to I am turning to writing. This way, I can pretend that I am talking to someone. Maybe I’m just talking to me, I mean I guess I literally am. These are just thoughts, no rhyme or reason, and I don’t have any qualifications on writing. I guess i thought I would share them to whoever is reading. 




Feeling down. 

I have noticed. That this comes by more often now. 

It doesn’t take much to get here. 

But, I’ve also noticed I am getting better at looking after myself and cheering myself up. 

I do feel broken though. And I know I am changed. And will never be the same again. 

I feel tired, broken, hurt, lonely and my chest aches from the pain and the hurt. My heart can’t take much more. 

I feel uncared for. Unwanted. And left wondering if there is a space for me in this world. Perhaps it is too late for me, the space has been a taken just as my weak frail fingers barely manage to glide against it. In fact, I don’t even touch it. And in fact, I feel I have never known the sensation of it. Of having a space, of belonging, of being lovingly and wholeheartedly wanted. 

I float. 

In and out of this space I am in. Never really experiencing a life - filled with love, commitment, care, trust and growth. 

I float and stand still at the same time, just trying and struggling to keep my oxygen mask on, even if only haphazardly."	jellyandbutternut	post	25.49986337529165	male	White	0.9985914826393127	na	na	na	8	SuicideWatch	no prediction.

I guess. For me it’s if the things I say are on my phone or whatever, then it’s like they werent written at all. It’s a strange form of communication to part with words you know most people will never see and fewer who will respond, and fewer offering anything of substance or meaning. Striking resonance is difficult. It’s simple to get the words out but to make them be understood and compelling enough for engagement and interaction is an art all unto itself.	jellyandbutternut	reply	na	na	na	0.9985914826393127	no	strong	no	na	SuicideWatch	no prediction.
"Ah yeah I see. I think for me, even if I write it on a foggy mirror with my fingers, it is still written.

And even perhaps the leftover droplets of water it changed when my fingers touched the mirror. 

Ha. If I said this in real life, my friends and family may laugh and scoff at me. Haha.

"Hey everyone. 

A few days ago I made a post that I was tired of living this way and was going to end it. Well I’m still here. 

There’s a lot of backstory and months in therapy, hospitals, working with psychiatrists, the works - but im currently exploring a diagnosis of DID with my psychiatrist& psychologist . Anyway, that’s not the point. 

At my therapy appt a few months ago my therapist asked me to come up with at least one reason everyday to stay. Even if it’s something really small or feels really stupid. I’ve been trying it out again since I made my posts here. The first night, my reason was that I had a work meeting the next day where I knew someone was getting bitched out. I kind of wanted to see it happen lol

Yesterday I had a hard time coming up with one. I was really struggling. I looked outside and the sky looked so beautiful. The sun was setting, the clouds and colours looked like a painting. I just sat there crying and thinking wow. I kind of wonder what it’ll look like tomorrow. 

I found out today that there’s actually a meteor shower tonight. Im really happy I stayed to see my first meteor shower. How cool is that?

Obviously I have a lot of work to do and a lot of memories and trauma to dig up and work through and it’s not going to be easy, but wow. 
I wonder what the sky will look like tomorrow."	No-Razzmatazz-6601	post	21.167315927674345	male	White	0.0018290412845090032	na	na	na	2	SuicideWatch	no prediction.

As I lay in bed with no more than a 10 ft reach for a pistol I wonder why I even want to be alive. I don’t want to be alive, I don’t have a reason to be. Instead, I’m forced to be alive because I don’t want to hurt my family. They’ll never know, they don’t need too. The only thing that can make me happy is ceasing to exist. Normally when I express my feelings of suicide I’m crying. Not now, now I’ve accepted that I’ll have to pretend my life has any self fulfilling reasons. It doesn’t. My reason to exist isn’t for me. Life is suffering, life has no real meaning. All life is temporary and doesn’t have any significant meaning. I dread everyday, I wake up unhappy everyday. Why am I alive? Why do I have to have consciousness? Why can’t I end my life without making people upset? If they love me they would want me to be happy right? No. If I make myself happy, my wife will cry, my mom dad and brother will cry. Why? Id be happy. That’s the only thing that will make me happy is the day I stop existing because that means I don’t need to feel anymore. Nothing matters, nothing will ever matter. I hope my end comes soon. I hope something else kills me so It’s not my fault they’ll be sad. My life has no meaning, it never has. It’s a shame some people who want to live have their lives cut short and I want to die but I’m stuck living.

I don't know if it's just me who thinks about this but i can't stand the thought of being seen naked like that, it feels like I'd be embarrassed even after death. Not only that but the idea of being cut open and essentially butchered on a fucking table, gives me the ick thinking about the medical examiner pulling back my scalp to expose my skull to get to my brain and taking my organs out to weigh them. As well as what will happen to my remains, i don't want to be buried because i don't like the idea of my body going through all stages of decomp and being eaten by maggots.

I'm 15 years old. I was born into a little known South Korean cult and I currently live in the main compound which is inside a mountain. I have little contact with the outside world and I have no friends (for obvious reasons). I can't make friends online. Most people I've tried to make friends with on like Discord and other places simply just don't give a shit. I'm also homeschooled so there's that. I'm isolated from the outside world and I have no one, not even online people. My interests are too abnormal (philosophy, religion) for a teenager and everyone just looks at me like I'm a freak.

There are certain obligations that I need to take care. I need to secure enough funds for my parents to live happily off. I need to help my brother with some things which he can't.

"     Life has been rough but always ok. Living paycheck to paycheck but still living and not under a bridge. 
     A little about me, my name is steven which is common so I don't mind saying it on a throw away. I have 5 kids and I'm 24. My wife (26) and I have 5 kids we had our oldest in 2017 and then I had a set of girl twins in 2018. Lastly we had our twin boys in 2020. 
    That has never been an issue I'm on a single income and my wife takes care of and homeschools the kids, which is fine and I've managed, until covid. I was sick for almost 4 months and that tanked our savings, nestegg, and my credit(5 kids and a wife are expensive). After I had been keeping up. Paycheck to paycheck but slowly falling behind. 
     Then came the second round of covid and I got sick agian. Now we have nothing to fall back on and my company paid for sick leave due to covid the first-time but then the policy changed, now I have no income and no credit. So I had to tank the credit even more. 
     After I got better I was so far behind it was insane. I did all I can do working 3 84hr weeks with 50 hr week somewhere in the month so I didn't burn out. Was saving up and digging out of the hole. Then the engine hit 450000 miles and decided it wanted to take a forever nap. So now we are down to one car and I scrapped it but the car dies in the middle of nowhere so the 500 I got for the car mostly went to the tow truck and mechanic to tell me my engin was dead.
     Now we have one minivan that takes $20 in gas to get to work everyday. Not even 2 weeks and it starts wobbling so I take it in. The guy looks and grabs a screwdriver and gently glides it into 3/4 of my tires. They had dryrot so bad that my mechanic said 10 more miles and they would have exploded, have you ever had to buy tires. $376 a tire, not all the tires, no no EACH, $1k for tires. 
     So savings back to empty and credit back to maxed so now, I need to fix the overdue bills and my credit. Function = apply for Debt consolidation loan *approved (incert happy imoticon)(even if it is at 46%apr)
     So now Steven gets a break? Right? Nope, not even 2 months after that my freaking alternator goes out. Dead in the water at an interaection. What is that? Another $1200 bill. Why? Because the alternator isn't what went bad. The engin was running hot. Putting stress on my alternators belt witch made my alternator pull more power that it should of which demolished my cars battery. 
     Just one thing after the other I can't catch a break I want to be the sole provider but now my wife is talking about getting a part time job. I'm failing as a man and a father and a fucking husband. I'm worried every second that something else is gonna go wrong. I can't get a loan with an active lien on my car and a debt consolidation loan. I'm freaking out and every night i just lay there thinking about if my wife and kids could survive without me. If it would be easier without me and I could stop from bringing all this bad lunch to them. I want them to be happy and I know having a father would do that but also I feel as if I don't care. Like I could just end it all and just be done. I'm so sick of all of it. I'm always the happy one. Smiling no matter what but it's becoming harder to smile everyday. It hurts."

"Honestly I don’t even know why I’m posting. Venting maybe. I don’t even think my life is worse than anyone else’s. Sure I hate my job, I have no money… but isn’t that most people? 

The trigger for me was watching my boyfriend (ex boyfriend?) walk away after a fight. Another fucking fight. Not sure I can even call them fights anymore. I say something random that he decides he doesn’t like, he says horrible things to me and I go quiet. Pretty toxic right? I don’t know why I stay either. 
Yesterday the same thing happened. We were at a restaurant having dinner, I asked him if he was ok and he bit my head off. Ate in awkward silence, went home in silence (should’ve left him on the train, he doesn’t know the way back to my place and his phone was dead) and then when we arrived, he grabbed his stuff and tried to leave. 
I wanted him to leave. But I have a stupidly huge fear of abandonment (I’m in therapy for it) so I tried to at least calm things down so that we didn’t leave things as they were. Dumb af I know. 
Things were said, the usual hurtful bs where he says we should break up (he never ends up going through with it) and then he left. 
I called out to him in a calm voice ‘are you serious?’ but he just kept walking away. I watched him walk away until I could no longer see him heard his car drive off. 

My issues are triggered af right now. I can’t stop seeing his silhouette walking away. A part of me wants it to finally be over. The other part is terrified at being alone in the country where I can’t speak the language. Where I hate my job and have no money (as mentioned at the start). 
All of this is so stupid. Everyone goes through this bs But I can’t stop thinking about ending things. Because what’s the point? What is there to look forward to? Working from morning to 9pm with hour long commutes? Being alone in my 30s while everyone has a happy life with their families? Staying with this asshole? Getting with the next asshole who’s just as bad as this one? What’s the point?

idk what happened. i’ve been clean since march and suicidal thought free for most the time and now i’d rather throw myself off the balcony than live another day. fighting the urge to grab a knife and honestly what’s the point. nothing gets better the world has gotten worse i just want to kill myself and no one knows about it bc i only present with a fake side of myself that’s content with life and optimistic and wants to help everyone. i’m only alive for my siblings and my parents, especially my dad who’s lost so many people in his life, but i’m not alive for me. i don’t know what to do. i go to therapy but for some reason i’m still that fake persona there and can’t bring myself to say what’s wrong in case they tell my parents or i’m considered in danger. wtf is wrong with me	akwardpansexualblob	post	6.815187158545996	female	White	0.9989049434661865	na	na	na	2	SuicideWatch	no prediction.

"*It* being something I've *ideated* on and off for the past few months about using.

At first it felt incredibly cold, the steel heavy in my hand. But then the strangest sensation happened, it's hard to describe. But it felt like there was a kind of energy emanating out from it and flowing into my hand, the kind of energy that's warm and evokes a feeling of contentment. So I continued to hold it whilst thinking about what I was feeling.

I realized it now felt as light as a feather, no doubt because my arm and hand were now used to the weight of *it,* it felt like *it* became an extension of my body. I don't know. But somewhere deep in my mind, I felt like *it* was telling me, ""**This is not the way,** I am a tool of purpose, a tool of protection, a symbol of perseverance and fortitude, give yourself a chance to see beyond the iron sight and you shall see more than you've ever seen.""

I know that *it's* just an inanimate object. It felt strange. Even now as I type this I can still recollect that exact feeling. Ever since I felt my ideation rapidly decline, like deep down in my mind, a key was turned.

It’s good that you still enjoy gaming sometimes. What art did you do previously? I know it feels like there’s no point to anything and my words mean little as a stranger online, but I can tell you from experience that the only way to dig yourself out of the hole is to force yourself to do things you think you’ll enjoy until you start enjoying them again. Fake it for a while and one day you’ll look up and realize you’ve made it. That’s not to say your current feelings of depression aren’t valid, because they totally are. It is so hard to untangle yourself from mental illness, and I encourage you to give yourself grace in these times.

"I can relate to that heavily. 

I am going to  therapy  and I work and I try but then I am thinking to myself, why? what for? life is fucking garbage unworthy shit I did not choose to be here. sometimes I think ""shame I was born""  because honestly I am alive just because my survival instinct is so strong.

without that instinct I would had died long ago.

I know that there is love, friendships and abundance for me to experience but at times I feel like if my past was dreadful, how the fuck I am going to handle the future? Health wise when I am going to get older, or just age when I will be alone either way?

I sometimes feel like if I do it -it's the only way for me to free my self from all the pain, suffering, shame I feel with myself.

I know life is heavy, people betray your trust  - even the closest ones..losing your goals and repetitive failures that does not seem like about to stop hunting you.. hinder out experience of joy, of belonging, of worth... 

So may I ask you, what is worthy in your eyes? 

I am trying to figure what makes it worth it , what makes me feel it's good enough, what gives me some hope? 

why should I hope? because it's natures way to push us move to another land, to another place. 

I used to like  drawing  for 10 years I tried back and forth to improve it and I didn't improve at all. I stopped reading books I loved so much and playing the guitar is out of my mind.

these things gave me joy, so I try to return to them. 

I will be honest, at times I just wanna sleep or lay in bed looking at the ceiling and just cry till my chest hurts me, I do it some times. after doing it, I let go of the pain a little.

I have so much anger, I realized my depression is a result of suppressed anger - feeling like not being able to do the things I want - rather the things other people want."	Last-Chance-Neo	reply	na	na	na	0.9994915723800659	no	strong	no	na	SuicideWatch	failed

My thoughts exactly! I would have no problem trying to continue to live on as long as the environment I'm slaving away to survive in is one that is worth living in, But its not!!!! Its an insane toxic and dysfunctional system we have to live in. It should come as no surprise to anyone that so many people take their own lives!

"I feel you OP.  I often regret failing to take my life, because as I live on, I don't see the kind of progress that would suggest things are getting better in the world.

However, every generation thought the world was ending, and it may very well be this time, but generations before us, people thought the world was going to end, and had to consider whether anything was worth doing.

If we knew the world would end a week from now, how would you spend your time?

Recent generations were raised on ""the end of world"" mentality, and it really zaps the ambitions out of us.  Some people turn to drugs and partying, because why not just feel good until it's all over?

I don't have any good suggestions OP, and I'm still lost and suicidal, confirming your post.

The only thing I will say, is that buying a house or a new-car is not the peak of life activity or achievement.  I'm poor and always will be, and I find that wealthy people are always upset because they have too much stuff and worry about losing it.

"Yeah the goal is to make money and have like a power over one another. Commercials are on 24/7 to sell you something, take your money, and advance their position in the ecosystem.

No one should have nukes or any of that shit, we are a species that don't have the best motives. We claim to be intelligent, but are we really acting that way?"	Otherwise_Ambition_3	reply	na	na	na	0.9992087483406067	no	no	no	na	SuicideWatch	no prediction.
i feel you and i feel the OP as i at times feel the same, what gives me strength is my spiritual beliefs, but don't ever think that yall are alone and that yall are the only ones passing through this, because there are others also wondering about this matter, still this situation is not a motivation to stop living, we came with a purpose here whether we recognize it or do not.

This is well said. I wouldn’t get my hopes up too high. I may pursue a trade but I would never bother w college. I don’t want the stress of debt and never finding a well-paying job afterwards.	Otherwise_Ambition_3	reply	na	na	na	0.9992087483406067	no	strong	no	na	SuicideWatch	no prediction.

And I decided not to do it. However, I am very conflicted now. Upset at myself really.	SadHeart_D11	follow-up	na	na	na	0.999121367931366	no	strong	no	na	SuicideWatch	no prediction.

"I recently went through a break up and everything just seems pointless. I have 2 young daughters to 2 different mums and I have a good career as a Police Officer. I don't find enjoyment on anything. I used to have goals in reaching different career paths in the police but that seem pointless now. There's no point in hanging out with friends,  i dont find enjoyment doing the things I used to enjoy. I thought it was just about the break up buts it's not I've always felt depressed and suicidal even before my recent ex. I admit I am hurting from the break up which is adding fuel to to the fire. But I just can't handle it anymore.

My daughter's will be ok they have great mums and support. My mum will be ok.

I have access to firearms I'm just waiting for the courage to take a gun home and shoot myself. Weird thing is this outcome gives me peace. I know it's weak but I can't do it anymore."	censoredxx	post	24.73125999307133	female	White	0.9989330172538757	na	na	na	5	SuicideWatch	failed
Hey. I can tell you’re in a really hard place right now and I’m so glad you posted on this sub. It is not okay to go, and I would hate for you to lose your life due to your current circumstances. Breakups fucking suck. They truly do. And you know what? You’ve been through them before and can get through one again. Your daughters will be so grateful to have grown up with their father, and it is undoubtable that your presence will be missed in their lives if you go through with this. I would highly encourage you to take a break from work / limit your access to firearms while you’re having these suicidal urges. Your life is worth something, at least to me, and most likely to all the people in your life. What is hurting so badly about this particular breakup?	censoredxx	reply	na	na	na	0.9989330172538757	strong	no	no	na	SuicideWatch	failed
"Sell all your shit cash out get max loans and run.

You can always still do it, after the moneys gone.

Same as it ever was, same as it ever was- but- you can potentially find some joy.

"I always felt like this like life is not worth living, I'm never happy because I can't find any enjoyment on anything. I love my daughters and it pains me to leave them but I know they will be ok they don't need me. 

I met this girl almost 3 years ago she pulled me out of dark hole and made me happy. We fell inlove quickly pretty much inseparable, bought a house together had a baby, went overseas, talked about marriage and planned to grow old together. I was loyal to her, no physical abuse but I didn't treat her well. I didn't show that I loved her or care for her. She broke up with me and told me she doesn't have any feelings for me anymore and that she doesn't love me like she used to. She told me she started to lose feelings a year ago. Now I'm back to where I was 3 years ago before I met her. I realised I can't be happy. I'm tired of not being happy. This is who I am, this is my mindset and I can't change it. I'm tired of living."	censoredxx	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9989330172538757	weak	strong	no	na	SuicideWatch	no prediction.
I’m afraid you’re limiting yourself to a really small box. Just because you’re in a bad place right now doesn’t mean you’ll always be there. Just because you lost one love doesn’t mean you’ll never find another. You’re human, you make mistakes. Everyone has hurt someone they care about badly. You say you don’t find enjoyment in anything, but you love your daughters and it pains you to leave them. That tells me you do find some things in life valuable, at least your daughters. I know it’s hard right now but I urge you to think about how wonderful your life could be in the future and all the memories you’re giving up that you could make with your daughters. What makes you think you can’t fall in love again?	censoredxx	reply	na	na	na	0.9989330172538757	weak	no	no	na	SuicideWatch	no prediction.
