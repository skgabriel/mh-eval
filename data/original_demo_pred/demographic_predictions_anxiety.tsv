I am new to this thread. I had anxiety as a teenager but thought I had moved on from that part of my life. After being diagnosed with a Chronic Illness & the mess that was Novid (you know what I mean) I have developed an extreme health anxiety. I can‚Äôt even take antibiotics without worrying I‚Äôll have some sort of allergic reaction to them. I tried taking one last night and ended up puking it up from fear. Now I‚Äôm experiencing anxiety about things I rationally know I used to love. I‚Äôve landed myself in the hospital twice for these panic attacks with tremors and chest pain. I feel like I want to give up, I want to go back to normal, but I don‚Äôt know how. I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôm starting to develop depression because I can‚Äôt even get out of bed most days (thank god for WFH) I am having constant nightmares, and things I previously enjoyed now cause panic. I‚Äôm in therapy, and i think it‚Äôs helping, but I just don‚Äôt want to feel this way any more. I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôll lose my job and my family if I can‚Äôt get my sh!t together. I hope writing this out helps.	AutoModerator	reply	na	na	na	0.0011869458248838782	no	strong	no	na	anxiety	no prediction.
I have been struggling with anxiety for several years. I talked to a therapist once but she ended up leaving the practice and never started again. Recently, it‚Äôs been worse and worse. I am a loud person who has an issue of not thinking before I speak which leads to high anxiety later on. I always think about conversations and think everyone hates me or pretends to like me.

I‚Äôm struggling a lot this month. I started a new job, in a completely new field, and I‚Äôm working from home for the first time ever. I think it is a good thing in the long run, but all the adjustments and changes have been a lot for my mind and body. Every morning before I start working, I feel so anxious that I feel sick. I‚Äôm so scared of doing something wrong at work- even though I‚Äôve been through training and have learned a lot. I also have a lot of old trauma that has come up for me lately so processing that on top of everything has been really difficult. I don‚Äôt know how to transition into this job while not having a breakdown. Every day feels like a panic attack waiting to happen and I just want to cry each morning. Feels like I‚Äôm in one of my bad anxious cycles again and I hate that.	AutoModerator	reply	na	na	na	0.0011869458248838782	weak	strong	no	na	anxiety	no prediction.
"Last June, after experiencing a cluster of emotional and mental stressors, I decided to take some time out of work, to tend to myself and get the help I needed. I started individual DBT therapy and group therapy. I began feeling so much better! 

However, recently, I went back to work and found myself in a really stressful environment. I decided to quit, as I feared having a relapse in my mental health.

Right now, I‚Äôm feeling very optimistic, but also a little nervous, because I left a well paying position that could‚Äôve turned into an excellent career for me. While I understand that I did it for my mental health, I‚Äôm struggling with the decision I made. 

Today I have an interview for a new position and I‚Äôm hoping it goes well. I think this is exactly the job I need right now.

I don't get along with my roomates. I tr to stay out of their sight most of the time, but i need to use the kitchen for food so I can't hide all the time. They don't like me using the kitchen, or the washer, or taking showers, and keep yelling at me about stuff. I'm becoming more and more scared to leave my room.

So, after a few months of taking escitalopram, my hives had disappeared and I was feeling calm, so I started drinking coffee again. Well, a month later, my hives are coming back  now, and I've noticed, I've been losing my temper a bit. Drinking two cups of coffee a day might be the culprit.

Hello, I‚Äôm new to this thread.. Lately i feel like i‚Äôm having a major crisis. I‚Äôve never felt this feeling or aniexty and dread before in my life. The last 3 weeks have been hell to put it plainly. I‚Äôve suffered my first panic attacks. I‚Äôve had Insomnia and just overall my mental health is bad. I don‚Äôt have insurance and the mental health resources in my city are all booked up/ out of budget. i‚Äôm not really sure what to do anymore. it‚Äôs hard when you feel like your going crazy and you‚Äôre scared to tell anyone because you don‚Äôt think anything will change. Work is stressful and i hate my job. Though this last week i‚Äôve had a bit of a break through using the app ‚ÄòDare‚Äô. I just think I probably need to be medicated at this point.

I‚Äôm new here and have recently been very anxious. Some back story, my husband and I were in an awful vehicle accident four years ago and I‚Äôve been anxious ever since. It‚Äôs usually situational (being in a vehicle, of course), but I‚Äôve noticed it getting worse, more frequent, occurring in situations that I haven‚Äôt previously experienced anxiety. Currently there is a situation with my neighbor and the dog they adopted. This poor dog needs to be returned and adopted by someone else but the neighbor refuses to return the dog and I can‚Äôt stop thinking about it. It wakes me up in the middle of the night and I can‚Äôt go back to sleep. I‚Äôll lay there for hours and my heart will race thinking about it, not to mention it just makes me sad.

These past six months have been hell in a hand basket. I had a panic attack and realized that I mentally was doing well and they got worse until I got on meds. I stopped hanging out with friends because it became too stressful and felt alone and frustrated with myself and with God. For the first time in a long time, two weeks ago, I walked around a huge and crowded space without anyone but myself and I had little to no anxiety l. I felt so free and I feel like I have a purpose again, to help people like me and to get back to a healthy version of me. It's still lonely sometimes, but I am thankful for my anxiety because this is the most healthy I've been mentally in a while.

"Ive been dealing with this anxiety for at least a year now but it started when i moved and wanted the people in my new class to like me but they were all very different from me and how ive been living where i came from

So i tried to change but the inly thing i did was give up on all the things i liked and anytime i do them now i get this really bad feeling of not being how i should be

A year ago my puberphonia got really bad but i though it was just social anxiety so i tried to be a lot more social (even though im very introverted) but i ended up being even more of a people pleaser than i already was which really upset me because ive always had problem with this a d si ce than i cant really diference from people just asking me for a favour or using me and im always so hostile and negative when people ask me for something but i still do it and feel so used than even if i know they just asked me for a favour

now my voice is better but i still live with that stress factor of feeling used or laughed at by freinds and sometimes they really do it and i feel so under stress because everyone else can really enjoy everything normally like talking to each other or girls but i cant and i always feel so threatend when there is a group of peers 

Also i feel so unimportant whenevery im out with friends because i dobt talk mich and cant really defend myself if they make fun of me so always when im out  now and they make just a small joke about me iget this really uncomftorable feeling like i always did when d
they made fun of me 

but today it was really bad but now it suddenly got better when i finally was able to convince myself that all that just comes form me making assumptions and my thoughs thinking so negative but it happened really often that i find soemthing to blame this on but later i just fall back into this negative feeling and i think that yeah i just though that was it. but it really isnt so now im really sure that thats it because it makes a lot of sense and explains my feelings but im scared that when the slightest thing hapoens i will get this bad feeling back and go back to this misetable thinking so im trying to figure out how to stick to this explanatikn"	AutoModerator	reply	na	na	na	0.0011869458248838782	no	strong	no	na	anxiety	failed

"So, my girlfriend and I recently hit the 8 month milestone in our relationship. Things are great, and she's amazing. Occasionally though I go through periods of intense anxiety where my thoughts fixate on the fact that she's friends with a guy that she hooked up with a couple times with before me. (They were friends first and share extra curricular activities/a friend group before anything ever happenned)

I want to make it clear that her having a history doesn't bother me, and I'm not deluded into thinking she's never been attracted to anyone before me. But knowing that every once in a while she is going to hang out or spend time with said friend group, which includes him, just makes me uncomfortable and it's hard to explain why that is. I trust her, and to try and make me more comfortable - she's voluntarily scaled back how much time she sees/interacts with him and has said that if they ever did say or do anything that crossed a line, she'd cut them out. I've never asked her to cut them out or anything, but I have been upfront about how I feel about it. 

Anyway, ever since I found out about this whole thing, I find  I bounce between being able to not let it effect me too much, and then I have days where something causes me to think about it and next thing I know - it's predominantly on my mind. 

I've talked to others about my situation and they agree that while it is a bit of a tough situation, they think it's one that's worth working through and that it CAN be worked through. And she is 100 percent worth it. She's everything I could want in a partner and so my conclusion is that I need to find a way to try and combat how these thoughts, and the situation itself, effects me. Because I don't want it to effect the relationship at large.

I've been trying to find methods to do so, and am turning here partially just to get these thoughts off my chest as well as to see if anyone here has advice on how they manage with fixated thoughts."	AutoModerator	reply	na	na	na	0.0011869458248838782	no	strong	no	na	anxiety	failed

"Issues at work over the last few months finally broke me about 10 days ago.  Life sucked out of me as I realized the people in charge were doubling-down on hiding all the problems at the work site instead of staring upper management in the eye and getting our equipment and software much needed and promised improvements.  Before day's end, I walked out of the office, and I just never returned.  

I left due to conflicting feelings on the company attitude, and just no longer wanted to be there.  Once I was home, I had zero desire to return.  I left mid-day to avoid a meltdown and panic attack on the job.  Panic attack happened the next day as I was thinking about whether to return to try to rest up.  This went on for three days, and I decided to never return. 

For a week I've still had bouts with panic attacks and extreme stress/anxiety from the situation that happened at work.  I had hoped that by being home I'd relax more and not keep having panic attacks - but it's been difficult.

Today - for the first time in almost two weeks, I felt the day went very well, I accomplished more than one goal, didn't have a panic attack, and felt rather confident about what I was doing and how I handled it all.

"I completely understand how you feel. As a teenager, I experience bouts of anxiety, but I didn‚Äôt know what they were at that time. My episodes would resolve quickly, and I have decent coping skills. Again, I have no idea what any of that was, but I kept finding ways for myself to be okay. 

As an adult, I began to experience anxiety again. I researched it heavily and everything that I would read just incited more fear. I have health anxiety, agoraphobia, social anxiety, and just a general fear of losing control. So‚Ä¶ I can tell you I completely understand.

I prayed every day for this anxiety to go away but it hasn‚Äôt. What it has done is force me to deal with it in a different way. I am  learning to accept that I have this anxiety. I am learning to be happy in spite of it. I am learning to find joy in spite of it I am learning to find peace in spite of it. All of these things have help me to design a better relationship with my anxiety.

It‚Äôs not going anywhere. It has laid a foundation in my mind and built a beautiful house on top of it. I allow it to live there. I just have learned to let it be. We are co-existing and as much as I do struggle, some days, I remind myself that it‚Äôs here to keep me safe. I just continue to do the work in therapy and pat myself on the back every moment I overcome it.

Don‚Äôt get me wrong I‚Äôm struggling, but with every day gets a little bit better.

"I understand where you‚Äôre coming from. My anxiety also leads me to have cognitive distortions, but with therapy I am learning that they are exactly that. Sure there are cases where someone  pretends to like us, but it cannot be the truth in every case. Your job is to see it.

Sometimes our anxiety can make us think what things are worse than they are. My anxiety tells me that I am unworthy, not beautiful enough, and have so much work to do. Some of these things can‚Äôt be true. 

I want you to feel encouraged today. Please reach out to a therapist. Take it a day at a time. It took me years to find a good therapist, but I‚Äôm so glad that I finally have found one. She doesn‚Äôt give me any of the answers, but she asks good questions which lead me on a path to discover the answers for myself, and I find that so rewarding. I didn‚Äôt feel that way initially.

"Your post spoke to me. I recently started a new job that required a lot of me right away. Training was going super fast and I felt like I couldn‚Äôt keep up and was on the verge of spiraling. I decided to leave the job, as management wasn‚Äôt particularly kind, and I experienced a lot of anxiety as a result of it.

I am now looking for a work from home job. Right now, I‚Äôll even do some thing that allows me more space to attend to my mental health.

While you have the amazing privilege of working from home, I want to outline some of the ways that you might be able to make a more seamless transition into your new work life: 

1) Wake up earlier
2) Meditate
3) Set your intentions for the day
4) Have a good breakfast
5) Sit down and write out all of your feelings, your apprehensions, your worries, and then the solution
6) listen to a song that settles you into an amazing mood
7) Remind yourself of how capable you are
8) Log in for work 
9) Pause to meditate or journal anytime you experience distress during your workday
10) Take a moment to smile! 

I know some of the solutions I‚Äôm offering you might sound a little hokey, but as someone who deals with generalized anxiety disorder, I can assure you they have been my saving grace more often than not.

As someone also new to this thread, your post resonated with me a lot. I also had my first ever panic attack about 4 weeks ago and I have been suffering from serious bouts of anxiety ever since. I just started a new job and relocated to a new city so I don‚Äôt know anyone here & feel foreign to the area. On top of this I‚Äôve had some pretty bad dpdr which has also made it hard to feel connected to anything. I totally get what you mean when you say you feel like you‚Äôre going crazy. I‚Äôm constantly fighting intrusive thoughts that are trying to affirm that I am indeed losing my mind. You are not alone in those feelings.

"I have always had health anxiety (and anxiety in general) since I was... I wanna say 11 or 12 years old. But recently it's centered on heart attacks in particular. I'd say for the past year it's become one of the only things on my mind, especially at night.
It's gotten to the point where I've stopped taking medication like Advil because of the risks (that are extremely minimal as someone who's never had any heart issues) and I've gotten extremely picky with foods that I eat because I'm worried about my heart health and every time I get chest pain I panic like I've got two seconds to live. 

The funny part is, when I spoke about this with my therapist, I was saying things like ""I know it won't happen, I sound so stupid explaining it, the risk of that happening to me is extremely small, etc."" And then she tells me that it's good that I'm so self aware, and sort of just leaves it there. I don't know why I say that when I'm talking about it. I don't know why I can't just say ""I'm scared out of my damn mind about heart attacks,"" without following it up with ""I know it won't happen though!!!"". Like... you idiot, you don't know anything. You're constantly worried about it happening. I always undermine the anxiety and then I end up getting no help.

"I have this fear since my father died from it, I started to believe it was genetic, so it would happen to me too when I least expected it. More than once I've been rushed to urgent care being sure that I was having a heart attack. I'd arrive there all pale, trembling and feeling all the symptoms, only to find out that everything was normal and it was a panic attack. Luckily where I live I don't need to pay for it and I was also lucky the doctors were always understanding and kind, because I always feel so embarrassed and bad.

Now, the new addition is the fear of being diabetic... Even though my blood sugar levels are normal in my current exams, I'm always afraid that it will suddenly and quickly progress to diabetes, no matter what I do. Last night was one example, where I felt like I was having all the symptoms and spent almost the whole night awake, having a panic attack.

"I have the same kind of fears, all stemming from panic attacks due to marijuana use. My panic attacks would feel like legitimate heart attacks, and I‚Äôd think I was dying. Nowadays, I‚Äôm clean off weed, but each and every time my heart skips a beat or I feel a random pain in my chest or left side, I feel like it‚Äôll come on back. I went to the doctor, they saw nothing wrong with the ol‚Äô ticker, so I have to chalk it up to simply panic. 

One thing I can suggest though is physical activity‚Äîif you run in place for a bit, dance around, whatever you can to naturally raise your heart rate, it‚Äôll naturally slow back down if you feel like it‚Äôs getting too high. This way, I‚Äôve found, it calms myself down because now I have a reason for the heart rate increasing, and with it coming back down, the anxieties release themself a bit.

Make an appointment with a cardiologist and be honest about any lifestyle factors, including anxiety, that are on your mind.  Not wanting to have a heart attack is a thought shared by almost everyone and if getting cardio checkups early will help the intrusive thoughts then do it.  Best case scenario you just have anxiety and you get the all-clear which will hopefully help you with that anxiety and worst case you catch something early and start treatment.	hellteachernube	reply	na	na	na	0.9988579750061035	no	no	no	na	anxiety	no prediction.

"Week to week I feel my heart and sometimes it just feels ever so slightly off. Slight beating out of what I would expect. Maybe a kind of tension in my chest. And I have a lot of the feelings you describe. 

Like you, I know nothing is likely wrong. And I have been to doctors for related and unrelated things. None of them have ever hinted that anything was wrong and every time I am sitting there waiting for them to say there is something wrong with my heart. 

After working with my therapist for something completely unrelated, I am now starting to realize a couple thing that are a general pattern for me.

1. Anxiety can cause physical symptoms with the heart and practically any part of the body.
2. My concerns about my heart and the sensations I have with it often seem to correlate when there is something else going on with my life that is stressful.

So, when I am having all sorts of bodily sensations that make me nervous, I am learning to give it some time before I start planning how to get to the hospital. Maybe wait 30 minutes or 10 minutes. And in that time, give myself free reign to do other things. I am also starting to look at my life in the moment and ask myself if there is anything else going on. If there is anything else going on, I try and focus on why that would stress me out, and recognize it is probably the cause of my feelings. 

And all in all, if you have been having sensations or worries about your body since you were 11, also recognize that it's possible that those sensations are just how your body works. People aren't told the wide range of things the body can naturally feel day to day. we all assume it should be running perfectly sensationless unless something is actually wrong. 

That is a big lie. Our bodies ache, they pulse, they swell, they shrink, they get tired, they get low appetites, and all sorts of things just day to day. And each person may be different. So, if it has been happening for a long time, maybe it is worth taking note of what something feels like in the moment and the next time something unnerving happens, think back to the last time and how you were just fine afterwards."	hellteachernube	reply	na	na	na	0.9988579750061035	weak	strong	no	na	anxiety	failed

His friends & fam have all been asking how, why and his sister finally sent an email in which the doctor explained that at any time during your life, your heart can stop.

I am currently having the same problem. There is a channel called The Anxiety Guy on Youtube, his videos are helpful. I used to run and lift every single day for the past two years until March this year when I had a panic attack during my run. My HR was high and thats what triggered it. Since this event I went to two different cardiologists, did 2 ECGs, 1 Holter ECG 24h monitor, 2 Echo ECGs and both doctors said there is nothing wrong with my heart and that I should see a psychiatrists. Im on meds for 3 months now and first two months I had wrongly adjusted meds, which I switched. Now I am doing a bit better, I can go on longer hikes alone. I gave up running and lifting for now because it is too stressful for me. From what I know from cardiologists, my sister who studies medicine and people with real heart problems it is not anything bad to feel your heartbeat passively, thats just how some of us are. Heart issues are usually really easy to detect, it is the most important organ and it doesnt hide symptoms or give just light ones like a few palpitations few times a week. That is how a healthy heart behaves. The thing is anxiety makes us hyper aware of bodily symptoms. We probably had them for all our life but we started misinterpreting them.

"This is something I‚Äôve always struggled with but recently it‚Äôs been noticeably worse. Take right now for example, it‚Äôs half 9 at night so it‚Äôs my time to just chill, I have nothing else to do tonight other than go to sleep when I get tired, so I should just be at peace right now chilling on my phone all comfy in bed, but I‚Äôm not chilled.

I‚Äôm scrolling through videos and I‚Äôm on absolute edge just feeling like I can‚Äôt even watch them. This is really difficult to put into words and explain what I mean.. I‚Äôm struggling to make it make sense. I just feel like I‚Äôm on the verge of panicking, my heart is racing and I‚Äôm restless and irritated and feel like I can‚Äôt concentrate on one thing. I‚Äôm chilling watching videos, have nothing better to do right now as that‚Äôs what I want to do, but my brain is telling me to find something else to do and it‚Äôs just so odd. And when I‚Äôm like no it‚Äôs fine I‚Äôll just watch this video, I can‚Äôt concentrate because I‚Äôm stressed. I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm stressed about or what‚Äôs going on, ultimately I‚Äôm just confused because I‚Äôm feeling so on edge for no reason.

It happens all the time. Even writing this I‚Äôve switched apps about 5 times and got up out of bed twice to go do/grab things because I can‚Äôt concentrate on just writing this and THEN going to do those things. It‚Äôs really bad at work too at the minute, I‚Äôm currently in training for something and every time we are assigned a task, I have no idea what it is because I don‚Äôt listen. Afterwards I‚Äôll go on break with people and they‚Äôll discuss the session and I‚Äôll be like ‚Äúhow do you know that?‚Äù and they‚Äôll always respond ‚Äúwe literally just got told 5 minutes ago‚Äù, and I‚Äôll have no idea what they‚Äôre talking about. My memory is really bad at the minute too, it‚Äôs always been bad (doctors have already told me it‚Äôs a knock on affect of some issues with my mental health) but at the moment I cannot remember anything. 

I just don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs wrong with me. As I type this I‚Äôm needing to regulate my breathing and I‚Äôm restlessly shaking my leg and my heart is racing and I‚Äôm just stressing over nothing. Why does my anxiety work like this, is it just me? It‚Äôs constant I‚Äôm SO unbelievably sick of it.

Tl;Dr My mom is/was terrified of drugs that crossed the blood-brain barrier and denied for years how bad my anxiety really was. To her credit, she got me into therapy young and it did make a difference for me.

That said, Therapy does not work for everyone. Medication does not work for everyone. As with many things, you‚Äôll have to try medication and/or therapy and see what benefit they bring you, if any.

I know for me personally a combined 4-5 years of therapy helped, but was not enough as I had a base line of anxiety I could not get control over using every tool ever created. Starting medication gave me a new life, and control over my brain back. I have more good days than bad, even in difficult situations.

I don't want to try meds in the fear of it screwing with brain chemistry too much. I figured I'd rather be anxious rather than feel nothing at all. As for drugs, they all started making me feel awful, so it wasn't hard to quit them either.

I am adamant against using medication. Fuck that. I don't need chemicals in my brain, the doctors wanted to give me antidepressants or anti anxiety medication (i don't recall which) just after a phone call when i asked for therapy...


Therapy should be free but they didn't want to give it to me. I don't wanna pay for that. Fuck it i would rather die. Doctors would want to throw pills at me to get rid of the problem that way. Well i don't want chemicals that change my mixture of chemicals in the brain. So i do what i do how i do until i snap and when i snap damn... watch out..

I‚Äôve done things to help my anxiety, reading, hobbies, breathing and it helps that my dad deals with anxiety and he told me when I feel anxious to tell my anxiety to ‚Äúfuck off, I‚Äôm stronger than you‚Äù. I think it also helps that I know I‚Äôm young and healthy and don‚Äôt smoke or do drugs and I yearly get lab work so I know I‚Äôm a healthy person it‚Äôs just my mind playing games with me. I also learned what triggers my anxiety and stray away from those things. I was prescribed medication when I got a panic attack but I didn‚Äôt want to become dependent on medication, I wanted to find out what was the root cause of it and it‚Äôs been a while now since I‚Äôve had a panic attack and anxiety is not really around.

No meds in almost a decade, but I‚Äôve been in and out of therapy. Honestly it‚Äôs not great. I‚Äôve started seeing gray hairs sprout on my (26) head and that‚Äôs not genetic. It‚Äôs anxiety I‚Äôm most certain. I‚Äôm not depressed, but anxiety runs a great portion of my life, whether or not i admit it to myself or not. But I know I‚Äôve gotten better in few-five year increments, so it helps to look back at that sometimes and be grateful in that way.

It‚Äôs not as bad as people make it out. I was medicated for about 6 years up until about a year ago. The first few months were fucking rough. And I regretted my decision. But once I really started making changes to my lifestyle (working out, removing toxic people, learning to be happy with myself and most importantly revolving life around what I like to do rather than what I have to do as much as possible) it‚Äôs gotten a lot easier. There‚Äôs so much more you can do for anxiety than just take meds. It just takes a whole lot more effort but honestly I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs worth it.

"I‚Äôve been off meds for a couple of years now, I honestly feel better.  I would never tell anyone else they are wrong for being medicated, it‚Äôs such a personal decision and we are all different.  My meds made me worse, I was a totally different person.  I was medicated for both anxiety and depression, first anxiety then my doctor recommended antidepressants.  In the two years since I‚Äôve been off I‚Äôve suffered through some of the absolute worst losses a person can suffer and I‚Äôm thankful I wasn‚Äôt medicated, I don‚Äôt think I would be here.

I always say speak to a doctor, there are so many convenient therapy options now (online, text etc), it doesn‚Äôt hurt reaching out and seeing if that works for you.  There is also genetic testing to help determine what works best.  One of my biggest complaints about meds is how hard it is to find something that works.  I switched so many times, it takes awhile for them to take effect, then to find out they aren‚Äôt working or making your symptoms worse is really disheartening.  If I ever were to go back to medication I would look into the tests, no clue if it would be covered by insurance or cost.  I know a friend who had it done, I‚Äôm not an expert by any means so I apologize if I‚Äôm wrong about the test but that is how it was described to me."

There are days (sometimes weeks) where the anxiety wins out, especially when it teams up with depression), so isn't a cure-all or without its moments of overwhelming pressure.

I have a prescription for Hydroxyzine to take as needed, but other than that I don't take any anxiety meds and I'm not in therapy. I wouldn't mind being in therapy, but talking about my anxiety will sometimes cause me to have anxiety, plus there are too many to choose from and that causes me to have anxiety too (what if I pick the wrong one and I have to start over, etc).

"I had a therapist that gave me tools several years back that I will use till the day I die... Like radical acceptance, grounding techniques, etc. But I still have days like today where I collapse in on myself and the panic just punches me right in the face and I think I'm dying ...Just like every single other time. It is debilitating when it happens. I'm not doing meds or therapy right now, but I have tons of herbs/minerals/vitamins and little tools and things I can do when it overtakes me. Exercise is key for me. I have to stay active and get my pulse up every day for extended periods of time or the adrenaline and energy in my body will transform in to anxiety. There are days where I think I'm going to completely lose my mind. Delusions start to set in at times. Obessions/OCD issues/etc... But I have to constantly just reposition it in my mind and remind myself what it is. I have mantras I plug in to. I have a whole book of things I've saved over time that are like reminders and ways to ground myself. If I could give any advice at all, it would be to form a system of controls. Tangible actions. Things you can really hook in to for yourself that give you some power and small steps of control you can take while simultaneously learning to sit in the reality that you have no control and sometimes will have to let the waves carry you knowing they've carried you before and crashed you on the shore every time eventually... There will be a shore. You'll reach it. Every. Single. Time... eventually. But there are times it is insanely difficult to build up and have it all crash down again and again. The intervals between shores can be grueling. Just for some of us medication never helped and only made things completely unbearable so we've had to make due the best we can.

Yes 100% that‚Äôs me mostly because when I have tried to get therapy I just end up having a bad experience and never attempt it again üôÉ and medication is just not for me, I‚Äôve always been against pharmaceuticals unless it‚Äôs a life or death thing. Honestly I‚Äôve found ways to manage through exercise and healthy living that I think are better than any drug. If you do a lot of reading on the subject antidepressants and anti anxiety meds are only marginally more effective than placebo.

I realised I had to work on myself hard and tackle each issue on at a time. I started with my physical health. Lost weight, ditched the AD, and stopped eating certain foods. 

i exercised for a while. I was unemployed and realised I was a free bord, who needed to enjoy life again after covid. With the weight loss, I felt light headed and happy. I got plenty of sun and fresh air. 

Then I finally broke off all contact with my toxic ex and accepted I had to be alone. No more dating. Dating apps were always toxic to me. The men on there were horrifying. I finally said goodbye for good to that cesspool.

I then finally had the mental freedom to find someone amazing. I read tons of stuff on healthy relationships and finally met someone great. I am now in a happy relationship for 1 year already. 

Then I slowly got a part time job so I can keep having some freedom and dont have to deal with my anxiety all the time. Taking away the obvious causes of my anxiety was waaay better than trying to change my personality or to try and make toxic relationships and jobs work. I got rid of all that toxic crap!

"How much THC? And how long have you been doing it? Do you do it every day? And have you noticed a tolerance buildup?
Last November I did the same thing for about a month. It was the best I have felt in 10 years. It helped remove the fog to such an extent that I realized I needed to seek professional help (that and I was moving to Japan next year, so I needed a legal alternative). I explained my situation to my psychiatrist, that I wanted something that mimicked the effect of the micro dosing, and while he explained it might not be exactly the same, he suggested I try sildenafil at first. So I took those for two months. After the first month, I realized it was nothing like weed had felt, but I gave it another month to make sure. But after that I told him I wanted to go off because honestly it was just making me unproductive. That and I didn't want to go to Japan with the added luggage of having to find a medical supply. Now I'm here, and have been here for four months. It's great, and I love it, but I've started having flare-ups, and I definitely miss weed.

"Hey there, so the gummies I take are 10mg THC and 40mg CBD. I've been taking them for about 3 months. Just about every day. 

I do have a bit of a tolerance, but nothing substantial. For me, the key is to not rely on too high a dose because I've also had abuse problems in the past, so it's a bit of a fine line.

I cut them in half and take one when my anxiety is rising. It's usually in the first half of the day, and  if the day is particularly bad, I take the other half in the evening. Cutting in to fourths could also work, I haven't tried that yet.

There‚Äôs a 85% chance it‚Äôs just placebo and isn‚Äôt doing anything for you unless you‚Äôre just some alien. SSRIs are no different than any other medicine. You build a tolerance to everything. After 20 years you have likely overcame most of whatever you needed it for, but after that long there‚Äôs no point in getting off of it because you likely won‚Äôt be able to.

In zero ways is it harmful. I took SSRIs for over 6 years, seen multiple therapists, had agoraphobia so bad I couldn‚Äôt leave my house or be in public. It‚Äôs a fact, and it‚Äôs not a hidden fact. Benzos are probably more reliable than SSRIs if taken responsibly until you get to place you don‚Äôt need them. Anxiety isn‚Äôt even a chemical imbalance, there‚Äôs zero studies proving it is, doctors just guess that increased serotonin helps like it does with depression. You can disagree all you want, but that doesn‚Äôt mean what I said is entirely untrue. It can vary for person to person, but what I said a lot of people can agree with. CBT is far more beneficial in the treatment of anxiety and panic disorders than SSRIs.	Away-Tear-7267	reply	na	na	na	0.9975010752677917	no	strong	no	na	anxiety	no prediction.

"It's hard AF at first but sitting down and RECOGNIZING it's anxiety is the first step.  Mine used to be fear of vomiting so I'd sit down with my stomachache and be like okay... I bet I'm not going to vomit in the next 10 seconds.  I bet this shit is anxiety.  Whaddya know. No vom.  Still had the anxiety attack the first time.  The next time I was like okay... It's more likely that in 5 mins, I won't have puked than I will actually puke.  5mins pass.  No vom.  Less intense anxiety attack.  I did that for months and I stopped giving a shit about it.  

After that it was omg I'm having a heart attack.  I'm 36, fat as fuck and sedentary.  But I'm 36.  I'm not having a fuckin heart attack but telling your brain that doesn't do shit.  So I say there and I was like okay... This is probably anxiety.  I still went to the hospital but I caught my brain being a bastard.  Next heart issue anxiety attack I was like okay let's play this game.  Fuck it.  We're having a heart attack.  Do it.  Just kill me and get it over with and I kept watching my movie.  No heart attack.  No anxiety.  I spent less time saying fuck it and just staring it in the face than I did trying to work with it.

Anxiety is a bitch.  I used my anger to get past it.  It'll work differently for everyone but if you're also tired of being anxious, say fuck it.  Look your anxiety in the eye and say do your worst.  When you're alive 24 hours from then, look back and understand your anxiety is a coping mechanism for dealing with the world as it is.  You're safe.  You deserve to be happy.  Fuck your brain for making you think otherwise.

"To sum it up, I told a family member I noticed I sleep so well through the night when I know I‚Äôm working remotely the next day. I have no anxiety the next morning and my stomach is calm. It makes me feel better and ready to start the day. Instead of being met with any sort of understanding, my family member said I was a spoiled brat. I‚Äôm not sure why that hurt me so much when they said that. I guess I fear that I‚Äôm ‚Äúweak‚Äù since I can‚Äôt work an 8-5 job Monday-Friday without suffering mentally. 

Because of a health issue that required more than one surgery, I had been working my job from home full time for 7 months. I am still recovering, but I realized my anxiety and stress levels were down, and my IBS (irritable bowel syndrome) was nearly nonexistent. It was wonderful.

I returned to the office last week. I‚Äôm allowed to work one day remotely. My anxiety is high again, I don‚Äôt sleep well at night, my stomach is upset every morning and then I starve myself throughout the day. I can barely relax at my desk and my brain doesn‚Äôt function until lunchtime. 

It was like this before when I had to be in the office everyday. I dislike my job and have been searching for something for over a year now, but I haven‚Äôt had luck. I hate how anxious I get. I‚Äôve tried everything to calm myself: meditation, putting on a white noise podcast or music I love, taking medication for both my anxiety and stomach, calming tea, therapy on a weekly basis. 

Would it help if I enjoyed my job? What if I had help cleaning and cooking from my partner at home? Probably.

For years and years I worked in office settings and had to deal with my anxiety and the IBS that it causes every single day. It was a very miserable situation for me. Thanks to covid, with so many companies offering remote opportunities, I was finally able to make that transition to a role that is fully remote. It's something I've been dreaming about since long before COVID. I've now been working 100% remote since April of 2021. It's the best thing that's ever happened to me. I also started taking medication for my anxiety and IBS so overall my quality of life is drastically better than it was. Your family member is a jackass. They should be happy that you are so happy.

"It sucks you HAVE to go back in all the time and so suddenly. But IMO, spoiled isn't any part of this. Not the right word I guess. Like if someone worked in an office all their life and then was told, okay you are working in the office and your manager is going to stand over your shoulder the whole time, you would have increased anxiety. You weren't ""spoiled"" by not having your manager over your shoulder before...

But, more importantly, I do think you want to look into how to make working in the office less anxiety inducing. Identifying what parts of it are causing the anxiety. Is it the people? Your chairs comfort? Stress of having a manager nearby? Worrying about performance being watched?  Then finding ways to identify when those stressors are occurring and facing them little by little.

The things you are trying, music, podcast, etc, are all good things to do. They are things I have tried. But I have learned, at least for me, they are things to suppress the anxiety, not recognize the causes and take tiny steps through it. Suppressing is certainly a useful tool though."

They have nothing to do with who we are as a person. Obviously, the specific cause is different for everybody, but the generalization is that its an extremely unfortunate and uncomfortable hiccup in the way, our brain processes information which then sends or body on a fight or flight mission.

You're living my dream. I want a work-from-home job so badly but in my area there are very few jobs advertised as remote anymore. It seems like unless you already had a job where you could negotiate for that, your odds of finding a new one is unlikely.  I get what you mean entirely, for me it comes down to having to get up/get ready for work, the commute (both of which take a good chunk of energy before your day even begins) and then the micro-managed workplace environment. Always being watched, monitored if you aren't working every single second. It makes you feel so on edge the entire workday no wonder its exhausting and stressful.  I think having an office or being in a position with more freedom/control would help but I'm not holding my breath on getting one like that anytime soon.

That commenter is just jealous because work from home allows you to go at your own pace, cook lunch, take a walk etc. They secretly want that same freedom but they can't get it, so they put you down to make you suffer because they are suffering.

I'm the exact opposite as I developed anxiety from the lack of human contact during the lockdowns. I can work from home but not too many days in a row, otherwise if I'm going back to work I'm anxious again because of the lack of contact before. However, talking to as many people as possible if I'm back in the office helps me tremendously and is a great coping strategy for me. I just make sure I eat and stay hydrated, stretch my legs often and most importantly sleep plenty and have a good posture while behind the desk.

"I found therapy to be really helpful. Even though half the things they said I had thought of before, I still needed someone in that role to tell me and check in with me over time about what I was trying. 

But to be clear, maybe your steps forward end up being ""work without podcasts for 10 minutes and writing down what you are thinking in that time"" and then you turn back on that Stuff You Should Know for the rest of the day. I don't want you to think you can't use music or podcasts as tools to get through the day.

But I found small, well rewarded, steps helped me. And absolutely NO punishments for not accomplishing them. My whole deal has been I suddenly had anxiety about eating. Especially at restaurants. So, I spent a few times going into restaurants and feeling the need to leave early. A few times I went in, ordered my food and immediately asked for a togo box and just sat and talked with friends. In those cases, my success metric was ""can I have fun at dinner with friends for any amount of time"". No matter what else happened that was success. I could have left within 5 minutes after saying ""hi"". Or thrown up (please no though...). So long as I chatted with friends for a little bit and frankly, just went in the first place.

Anywhoooooooo, I am confident you currently or will soon have the tools to get through this.

I have struggled with severe anxiety most of my life and finally sought help this spring. After a few dose adjustments and an additional panic attack med, my life has changed.

But my anxiety has always prevented me from doing things like I want to, which has also left me with a lot of guilt for not doing more.

Well...I did. I walked right up and knocked on the door. I've never talked to this person before in my life. I was shaky and nervous but I. DID. IT. I had a good ~10 minute convo with him about the kittens (I wasn't even sure he knew they were there at first), offered to help rehome them, had a friendly chat.

"I went to a wedding recently (a wedding I was in actually bc it was my brother getting married) and oh my God, I feel physically attacked by the memories. 

The worst is when I recall the husband of another bridesmaid. He stared at me during the reception and then later at the after party told me about a bachelor party he went to in Florida about the ‚Äúamazing‚Äù soundtrack, and at some point, he said some thing about a strip club (I was very drunk at this point). Anyway, it got to the point where he told me I could go down there and essentially marry a rich dude with a yacht.

Obviously none of us are in your shoes, but the looks you got from the other wedding attendees were probably a judgement of *him*, not you. And even if they were--so what? Their opinions of you and your actions have no bearing on your character or ability to succeed in life. Remind yourself that if they were the ones on the receiving end of that creepy behavior, they'd probably be caught off guard just the same and not know how to respond either.

What you are experiencing is called [rumination](https://www.healthline.com/health/how-to-stop-ruminating#causes). Repetitive, obsessive thinking in which we blow our memories way out of proportion when no one else likely even remembers the thing at all. I myself had struggled with this hardcore for a long time, but it ihas gotten a lot lot lot  better lately after I: A. found out it has a name (rumination), and B. started practicing techniques to break the obsessive cycle.

I practice asking myself the question ""what did I learn from this experience"" when I am in a rumination spiral. And then I remind myself ""OK, now that I have learned what I needed from this situation, there is nothing further I can gain by obsessing over it. Taking what I learned, here's how I will handle \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ in the future, if it happens again. This may have been painful or embarrassing situation, but in many ways it was also useful. I will take this experience and grow from it, but there is no further value in obsessing over it--I have learned what I needed to learn.""

And that's just my general monologue as a perfectionist who obsesses over mistakes. Not minimizing, but I'm not quite clear what it is that you are beating yourself up over! Was it that you allowed someone to speak to you inappropriately? That's on the dude. Of course you responded awkwardly--or so you think. The truth is, you were put into an awkward situation by an awkward dude saying awkward things

I just wanted to make everyone aware of this fantastic book I am reading per my therapist called The Worry Cure. I am almost half way through the book and it has been soooo helpful and great to read everything Dr. Leahy has to write about.

"Everyday when I wake up, I‚Äôm rushed by an adrenaline of anxiety that already ends my day before it begins. This constant feel of worry, unhappiness, defeat, weakness, exhaustion, lack of motivation, jitters is a life sentence I‚Äôve been living with. 

When I see strangers walking down the streets, in a coffee shop enjoying their drink or reading a book at the park I wonder if they ever felt what I‚Äôve felt, or are they that lucky to live a life without this suffering. It just feels so unfair, but I would never wish anyone to feel what I feel. I know some people have it worse. 

What would life be like for me if I don‚Äôt suffer from panic attacks, depression and hand tremors? Sadly I know this will be a part of me for the rest of this lifetime. I have to accept it, accept my limits. 

I wished there was a pill that gives me that feeling of alcohol intoxication, not drunk, just that tipsy feeling where I actually don‚Äôt give a f*ck in the world and actually can enjoy life in the moment without a worry. Like all the thoughts is blocked off and I‚Äôve found a sense of confidence to be me. Then it wears off and it all comes rushing back. Or even a pill that can numb my emotions, maybe then I wouldn‚Äôt shake so much when I‚Äôm nervous. 

Life is so beautiful yet I can‚Äôt enjoy it. They say just stop caring, just do this do that. How do you battle something you can‚Äôt control? My mind and emotions are physically out of my control."

Yes. I told my therapist that I was at this point and having experienced both severe depression and panic disorder, I‚Äôd rather have the depression.

"YES YES. 100% YES! 

 Especially when I didn't think I had anxiety/I was undiagnosed and didn't know what was wrong,  and my symptoms went from tremors( body shaking) (earliest I can remember to about 15-16ish) to fullblown panic and anxiety attacks, high blood pressure, hearing/seeing things when I was super stressed,   worsened tremors ( body shaking )and maybe more. 

 It made me want to hurt myself so bad and make it all stop,  and it eventually spiraled into depression and trying to plan to kill myself. I wrote letters and all. 

 Doing much better now though even though my anxiety/suicidal thoughts/depression aren't 100% gone, this is the best I've been since then.

I‚Äôm so sorry you‚Äôre going through this, I‚Äôve been there and I wouldn‚Äôt wish it on my worst enemy. Three years ago I was so miserable and desperate to make it stop I would‚Äôve done anything, because it literally felt like torture.

I actually found out later that it‚Äôs pretty normal to think you‚Äôd rather be dead than deal with so much pain, because who wouldn‚Äôt want an escape from that? But it did get better (a LOT better) after I finally found the right medication and continued seeing my awesome therapist. Trust me, you won‚Äôt feel this way forever.

"I'm sorry it's been so rough for you. I've been dealing with anxiety for as long as I can remember and during periods of more than usual stress, I'm generally lost on what to do with myself. Suicidal ideation, for me, usually stems from not wanting to make an effort for anything at all anymore. It just feels as if it won't matter and generally starts with seemingly smaller things like wanting to get seriously ill or injured. My therapist has helped to figure out that in my case, what I am seeking is some grace. From someone around me. And it's true to some extent. 

What has worked for me is, not letting myself stew in my thoughts for too long. Lean into your support support system. Let them listen to you be one of those voices outside your head that say something other than what's going on inside. I know reaching out is hard. I know believing those voices from loved ones telling you you're going to be okay is harder but please trust me it's best that those voices are there. Another thing with me is that when suicidal ideation ramps up, I don't leave my bed. Now it's tricky because while I don't want to leave my bed and I need to try to do something, sometimes your body is too tired from what's going on in your head. You have to let it rest and catch up but at the same time know that you cannot enable yourself too much to give into these though. Talk to friends. Have ramen. Listen to a nice playlist. For me, my body has bounced back and with it my thoughts eases down too. It comes and goes. Progress isn't linear but it's still progress.

I've said this to people and I always get a weird look but it's true for me. For me, when my depression in the more dominate, I largely feel numb and when I live with so much noise and fear and pain with the anxiety, that feeling of being numb is always a welcomed change for me. The depression sucks but the anxiety is exhausting and demanding and to the answer the OP, often makes me sucidial. I just so long to stop feeling everything and noticing everything all the damn time so much and sometimes it feels like death is the only solution.

"Anxiety at its core is you body producing excess adrenaline.

Movement burns the excess adrenaline.

That is omly half the problem. You need to focus your mind on something to occupy the mind so it doesn't keep repeating negative thoughts (consciously or unconsciously).  Your brain is respo ding to negative thoughts by giving you the energy to fight or run away but there is nothing to fight or runaway.

Focusing on a task...cleaning and doing the physical cleaning clears your mind of negative thoughts and burns the adrenaline

"My grandfather often thought I was my father, back when my father was in his late teens, my aunt left loves when I visit even though she thinks I'm an employee at the facility she works in.

Oddly enough I recognized that I can still connect with my aunt because of dealing with my wife's dissociative identity disorder (multiple personalities) and my time working with people who have severe schizophrenia and very limited grasps on reality.

No matter how our brains misfire, the person is still there underneath it all.

Thr connections are sometimes few and far between because there is so much static, but it's there 

It's hard to explain but I think there is meaning still even on the confusion.

My aunt sees me as an employee because she knows I'm there to help her plus I literally work with the mentally ill.  She sees my brother as an insurance salesman...he is in finance like my dad and they are the ones that set up her retirement  and long term insurance

Are those coincidences?

For me it's her mind still connecting with us.  But also be prepared.  Like all people she will at times feel abandoned and lash out because part of her knows you weren't able to provide a better situation.

"I live with my parents. They are currently on vacation and left me their car. Since I‚Äôm uninsured, my parents made it clear that I should only travel small distances to reduce the risk of damaging the car and paying copious amounts of money to repair it. 

For the record, I‚Äôm 22, and have been driving ever since I was 18. I have severe OCD that forces me to drive in a responsible way and always having my attention on the road. I have never had any accidents before today. 

I went grocery shopping today, and accidentally hit a shopping cart tent while I was trying to park. I was moving slowly with the car while I was parking so I thought it was nothing, but there is a scratch and a sharp dent on the hood of the car. Its maybe an inch long but its pretty noticeable since the car is black and the paint peeled off. 

I immediately went back home and had a panic attack. I had intrusive thoughts that if I lied to my parents saying someone hit me, the insurance company will investigate and find out it was my doing and take me to court. Im also fearing that I will have panic attacks while driving now and I wont be able to drive anymore. I also feel like I will ruin my parents vacation by telling them this.

You accidentally hit a stationary object, where the only damage is to your vehicle and your pride.

Let your parents enjoy their vacation, and tell them the truth when they get home.  You know it's the only sensible thing to do.  Lying is a treacherous road of neverending anxiety that you don't want to go down.

"I've gone through similar things. And sometimes I'd give myself a hard time for breaking down over things I found ""silly"".. after I thought about it.. I wasn't breaking down over the 'shoes' themselves but the situation. Like with your example.. I was already stressed and dealing with sensory overload..stressed about going on a trip or whatever was happening.. and now this! Now I 'don't have shoes to wear'.. it's a combination of  everything that leads to the breakdown.
So to answer your question.. Given everything you've gone through and are going through that lead to this. No I don't think you are overreacting. Try not to be so hard on yourself. You got this.

"I was prescribed 40mg of propranolol twice a day when needed for anxiety. I took my first dose a few hours ago to see how I would feel on it before taking it out in public. I'm 26F and haven't done any exercise in a long while. I'm not overweight but I could be healthier. My resting heart rate is usually between 80s-90s. I noticed that I had a burning sensation in my chest and felt like I couldn't take a deep breath. I checked my HR and it was down to 42. 

Question is - was 40mg too much for my first time ever using it? 

Is it normal for your heart rate to drop that low when awake? (Even when sleeping I'm I'm the 60s)

I‚Äôm not sure if the dosage is normal. I would assume your doctor would know the correct amount, but I suppose they could‚Äôve made a mistake. What you said about your heart rate concerns me a little. I don‚Äôt think your heart is in danger is stopping right not, but if your heart isn‚Äôt beating enough, you may have lower levels of oxygen circulating through your body.

"I've always been the ""nervous"" type, the chronic worrier and it was just a part who I am, so I mostly attributed my generalized anxiety to just that.. being a nervous person. 

However, I did have to have emergency stomach surgery when I was a month old. I was unlucky and got stuck with an old, stubborn surgeon who was still holding onto the belief that infants couldn't feel pain (a theory that had been disproven 13 years earlier in '87) despite being at the top children's hospital in the US at the time, and so I had open stomach surgery with no pain meds or anesthesia. I've been exploring pre-memory trauma, particularly around infant surgery, and it explains literally EVERYTHING from my entire life. I thought I had a normal-ish childhood and no good reason to be experiencing PTSD-like symptoms and SEVERE anxiety, but it was the surgery, of which I have no conscious memory. Had I never seen a small thing on the news about it when I was 14 about a local doctor getting sued for performing infant surgeries without pain meds, I never would have even known about the whole ""infants CAN feel pain"" findings, because my parents believed the surgeon."

I am a 36 year old female who has recently experienced heightened anxiety. I was experiencing a lot of pain on my right abdomen, and the right side of my back was hurting as well. I went to the ER thinking it was something serious bc I was in a lot of pain. I was diagnosed with gall stones, and diverticulum. When I came home, I starting googling my symptoms bc I felt like there was more going on and I read that hall stones can rupture, and I was also experiencing symptoms that mimicked appendicitis. Long story short I went to the ER almost 2 weeks in a row with a couple of days off. There were days I even went twice. I‚Äôm doing better now, but I‚Äôm still anxious. For example, I was reading that diverticulum can only be diagnosed through endoscopy and that diverticulitis can be diagnosed through CT scan, so now I‚Äôm wondering if I was misdiagnosed.

"I went to IOP today.  It was definitely interesting. Everyone has their own issues you know? I felt pretty ""obvious"" if that makes sense. A lot of people were there for behavioral issues and depression. It felt as if though I was the only one dealing with anxiety. It stressed me out. No one seemed to deal with derealization or intense anxiety like I was. 

I met my therapist and well I feel better and more hopeful. I guess I'm expecting after today I'll just be magically cured you know? I fixated all day on getting better that I barely even heard what we were discussing most of the time. I know improvement takes time but today was just so... useless? Of course I have to take one step at a time to get better. So I'm going to try to stick with it. All I want is to get help you know? Whatever will help this be over already 

I think my genuine fear is that I'll get trapped in a panic attack. Like if I have one I'll have no way out and I'll be like that for the rest of my life. Its terrible. I was so fixated on nothing yesterday I even started questioning my identity! All that did was make it worse! I slept terribly last night and goodness I never realized how terrible this type of life could be. You hear people joke and complain about people with these types of conditions and now that I'm experiencing it... it just feels horrible

But I know I need to stay focused you know? The only way I'll improve is if I let myself improve. I just never would've thought it'd be so difficult. As I'm typing this the derealization is making me nervous. Making me feel like that day will happen all over again. The therapist said it's not psychosis  but just a rush of adrenaline. Which is so so comforting to hear 

I really needed to get this off my chest. A lot of my family thinks I'm being dramatic. Begging for attention and ""acting a fool"" on purpose.

Usually I hyperventilate, but it just feels like a heavy heavy weight on my chest, and my hands get numb and it's hard to clutch things. I'm on 10 mg of Lexapro, and I have 0.5 mg of Lorezapam. I'm worried that I'm downplaying my symptoms and could be getting helped more with meds. Also, I have an excellent crew of health care professionals, I moreso have issues with taking my mental health and somatic symptoms seriously because of pervasive childhood trauma, as I'm sure most can relate.

Much love ‚ù§Ô∏è

Anyone else?"	weevilnomore	post	45.836656786900264	female	White	0.9526225924491882	na	na	na	1	anxiety	no prediction.

"A little back story.. I have been struggling with depression and anxiety since preteen, I am not 33 F. My life has been a mess since I got out of a 4 year abusive relationship where I left my 9 year corporate job because I was drowning in my own depression and anxiety. I haven‚Äôt been able to get my life back on track since and my symptoms are only getting worse where I wake up hating myself and life everyday. I don‚Äôt want to give up yet I feel so defeated. Recently I decided to pursue nails and thought I was capable. I did fine through the learning but when I finally had to work on my first client, I went into a full blown panic attack. I shook so bad and it was so embarrassing I almost wanted to walk out and dig myself a hole to crawl in. Why am I like this? It happened again and with the next 3 clients that it was unprofessional in the workspace. Im back to feeling defeated and don‚Äôt know how I can beat this. Maybe I need to work on strangers who arent paying for the service and know my situation beforehand so I can get used to working on people. I really don‚Äôt want to give up just yet until I really tried. I don‚Äôt want to go back into the darkness where life feels like it‚Äôll never progress. I‚Äôm really trying to push myself out of my comfort zone despite how afraid I am. But I know I can‚Äôt do it alone and I don‚Äôt have any support around me that understands. I just feel like a disappointment and failure to my family. Before I give up, I‚Äôm going to shoot my shot. So if anyone is willing to be kind enough to let me do a free manicure on them and lives in or near the San Francisco area, I would forever be thankful! 

If not, I still thank you for taking your time to read my post. May you have a wonderful day and future."	Nail_Anxiety	post	25.705514238896328	female	White	0.9968377351760864	na	na	na	2	anxiety	no prediction.

Anyone else ever wake up in a panic attack? Just took at 30 minute nap where I wasn‚Äôt in the deepest sleep and woke up to my heart racing, shaky, numb and felt like I was going to pass out.

Yes ‚Äî During the worst of my anxiety episodes last spring, it was impossible to nap during the day because I would jolt awake terrified right as I fell asleep. This would seem to happen no matter how tired I was. Sometimes this would also happen while trying to fall asleep an night. The experience for me was more of a feeling of emotional fear/terror, and less physical symptoms (fast heart beat, etc.).	tssf2014	reply	na	na	na	0.9842743277549744	no	strong	no	na	anxiety	no prediction.
Yes I have had this. My first panic attack happened like this. I woke up feeling really weird, I remember thinking I should call an ambulance and thinking I might die if I don‚Äôt, but along side this feeling there was a rational thought that said , get some water and sit out in the fresh air, if it didn‚Äôt pass I was going to call for help. Luckily it did pass and someone I told about it told me it was likely a panic attack.

"I'm just trying to exist in this world. I just wanna be myself and be happy. Why is that so hard to do? I don't like how I look in the slightest, no one makes an effort irl to affirm my gender despite claiming they support me. And I'm on hormones which is like going through the emotional hell that was puberty, again. 

Ive felt so off for the past couple of days and I just want to feel okay. 

And I feel like my partner isn't attracted to me anymore which really hurts. I know I need to talk to them but I'm scared. 

My main method of coping is distractions so if anyone can recommend things within my hobbies I'd appreciate it greatly, my hobbies are video games, cooking, PC building, and training my puppy."	mogwr-	post	9.558892524747085	female	White	0.995267927646637	na	na	na	5	anxiety	no prediction.
"Please don't take this as criticism of who you are, or who you want to be.  I just want you to be happier, but...

It really isn't up to other people to affirm your gender for you.

If you've transitioned to the gender you identify with it's up to you to be happy with that.  It's nobody else's responsibility to pat you on the back and tell you what a (gender affirming comment) you are.

I assume your partner got into a relationship with someone of the opposite gender to what you now identify with.  You need to have that talk with them, no matter how scary it is.  If they no longer want to be in a relationship with who you've become, you need to accept that.  Transitioning to a different gender is a valid reason for a partner to no longer be interested in continuing a relationship, and you need to accept that without argument.  This is a choice you made in an attempt to be happier, but your partner has a right to make their own choices to be happy too.

I hope you take the above for what it is, and not as an attack on you.  I don't know you, but I know how it feels to be unhappy.  Depressed.  Not knowing what to do.  Eventually other things come along though.  If things feel like they're ending now - friendships, relationships, whatever else -  other things will begin for you.

Hi all, i‚Äôm currently away and i forgot to bring my sertraline 150mg (aka zoloft). Im only going to be missing 3 doses (Wednesday, thursday, friday) and i‚Äôm worried if i‚Äôll be okay. I have been taking the meds since March and I have never missed a dose. If this has happened to any of you please let me know your experience.

I googled the half life of zoloft and its about 26 hours. So around that mark you might start to experience light withdrawal symptoms. But don't worry too much, withdrawal symptoms aren't harmful, just unpleasant. But since it's only 3 days, it should be mild. You might not even notice anything.	augustwilbur	reply	na	na	na	0.9899907112121582	weak	no	no	na	anxiety	no prediction.
Just recently started having extreme health anxiety primarily surrounding my heart. I'm only 27 and I was diagnosed with hypertension 2 weeks ago. I have been absolutely spiraling since. I cannot make myself calm down and I don't know what to do. On Friday, I started having frequent palpitations that feel like my heart is skipping a beat and then coming back really hard. Sometimes they are very unfomortable. Yesterday, I had like 5-10 every hour. I also feel like my heart rate has slowed down significantly. Thursday night I kept habitually checking my heart rate and saw that it got down to 52 BPM while I was lying in bed. I know logically that there is most likely nothing wrong. I saw a cardiologist and had an echocardiogram last week which came back entirely normal. My blood work was all normal as well. Both my GP and my cardiologist said that my heart rate is fine and nothing to be concerned about. But I still cannot stop obsessively googling, and checking my heart rate/ blood pressure. I have been to the ER twice this last week because I was convinced I had a heart attack. But the 6 ECGs ive had done and my cardiac enzymes are all completely normal. I am just so tired. I have a holter monitor on for 2 weeks but I honestly don't think I can make it that long. I am just so scared and I've never had anything like this happen to me before. I don't know what to do.	jswizz69	post	30.417079285856744	female	White	0.998119056224823	na	na	na	10	anxiety	no prediction.
52 is normal for when we are laying in bed actually. If it‚Äôs 52 while you are up walking around and stuff then it‚Äôs a concern. Anxiety is so awful isn‚Äôt it? I called an ambulance when I was 23 convinced I was having a heart attack- I had numbness in my arm my neck and chest pains and it felt hard to breathe. I was nauseated and clammy. It was a panic attack. Your mind doesn‚Äôt like free floating anxiety and your  mind tells your body  and alerts you something is wrong. The things is it is wrong but it‚Äôs hormones in overdrive  giving you anxiety so bad your heart will do things like palpitate. If your really worried ask your doc to send you to a cardio specialist they can do an echo and also you could wear a monitor for a weekend but my bet is you could use some anti anxiety medication and a good counselor. That‚Äôs what helped me with panic attacks.

"It gets better with time, kinda. I started having cardiophobia a year ago and I‚Äôm still alive, had tons of visits to the hospital and everything is fine. Hell, at one point I didn‚Äôt leave my bed for weeks because I would get a heartrate of 120+ by just standing up (it is all anxiety, crazy) I still get palpitations sometimes and they freak me out but I still need to remind myself everything is FINE. What helped me the most is getting back to exercise. If my heartrate gets up to 150+ bpm and I‚Äôm somehow still standing everything must be ok I guess.

"Regarding the hypertension - are there things that you can improve in lifestyle (exercise, healthy eating, good amount of sleep, etc) that will help it?

After that, the biggest thing you can do it to work on acceptance. The doctors are telling you that you are ok. As you go forward you will need to work on accepting that. Also know that when you experience symptoms, from everything you are saying, it's likely anxiety. After awhile you'll need to recognize that the symptoms you keep showing aren't going to kill you, but that's its your anxiety causing you to feel the flight or fight."	jswizz69	reply	na	na	na	0.998119056224823	weak	no	strong	na	anxiety	no prediction.

Well perhaps it did but not with your heart it may be higher cortisol or it could just be deeper anxiety for example we can be anxious about something and have anticipatory anxiety of something that isn‚Äôt going to happen and then anxiety about how anxious we are and all the thoughts surrounding and judging that. Secondary to- it gets compounded and complex and therapy will help you not turn it into a full blown phobia which can happen with panic attacks and when our free floating anxiety latches on to something.

"Im kind of at my wits end right now, I've had severe cardio phobia since I was 16 or 17 I think and ever since then sleeping at night has been a constant challenge. When I close my eyes to sleep all I feel is my heart beating in my chest and it causes extreme anxiety. I know nothing is going to happen, but every time I feel it I can't help but fear that it won't beat again or I'll get some extreme pain suddenly or it will skip idk its just that anticipation that it will stop beating I can't handle.

I was able to control it about a year ago when I get medical marijuana. I has helped, however now it feels like its only exaggerating my anxiety and my sleep issues have come back in full force. I deal with possible bipolar/panic disorder/depression, essentially I am fucked up. I know for a fact I need medication because I am completely dysfunctional at this point but I think Ive called about 20 psychiatric centers and I can't get into any of them for a variety of reasons. 

I really just don't know what to do. I have tried exercising, meditation, I avoid caffeine at night, I don't eat close to when im going to sleep, melatonin - nothing works. The second my eyes close my heart starts pounding out of fear. It's just starting to feel hopeless, I can't do this for months until I can get to a psychiatrist.

"Hi,

I‚Äôll keep this short but I have a lot of intrusive thoughts. Negative thoughts about my boss, my finances, my co worker, my previous job, etc.

(I have OCD, so I think it may be related to negative thoughts I had when my OCD was terrible).

These thoughts keep coming in.


I‚Äôm trying the technique of not paying attention to them but there seem to be mixed results. I wonderful if I just need more practice?

Anyone have this issue?"	Discussion-Relative	post	54.986824114046925	male	White	0.9979475140571594	na	na	na	1	anxiety	no prediction.
Hi, you can pay attention, you just must not engage the thoughts. You should sit through them like they're videos you're waiting for to end. Even then it might take a while before it gets better though. But this way you're at the very least keeping it in check from getting worse.

"Hello. Recently (maybe a week and a half ago), I developed a dry cough (I don't smoke) and I cough throughout the day. It has gotten worse. I've been having mild chest pain that comes and goes throughout the day (mostly on the left side, but is sometimes on the right side), and I sometimes have heart palpitations. Also for the last 2 days, my heart rate has been jumping to over 100.

2 days ago, I took my pulse and it was over 120 (I was feeling calm at the time). 40 minutes later I went to urgent care and my pulse was 132. The EKG was normal. The doctor there claimed it was anxiety. Heart rate started to drop soon after I got home from urgent care. Heart rate continued to drop throughout the day and by the time I went to bed, it was 64. That number is normal for me.

Yesterday, I had an appointment with a family doctor and my heart rate was 132 again. But maybe like 20 minutes later after they said my pulse was 132, I had another EKG done and then it said my pulse had dropped to 97. It continued to drop throughout the day. Went back down to 64. I also had a chest xray and blood tests done yesterday and it all looked normal. Blood pressure is also good.

Last night, I got up out of bed in the middle of the night (I had just woken up) and my heart started pounding. I almost immediately layed back down and it calmed down. I was experiencing a lot of anxiety last night, but my heart rate was normal.

 This morning, I took my pulse as soon as I woke up and it was 72. But then I stood up from lying down in bed and it jumped to 116. Stayed over 100 for maybe 20 minutes and then it dropped to 96. But then I bent over to pick something up and it jumped to 104. Then went back to 96. It continues to drop and it doesn't go up when I stand up. It just did it once this morning. 72 right now.

The rapid heart rate has only been happening in the mornings. 

Sometimes my ears feel plugged. And today, every little noise sounds louder than normal. And I'm feeling super irritable for some reason.

I'm super scared something is wrong with my heart, because I struggle with an eating disorder (anorexia nervosa) and I know that can damage the heart. I usually eat 500-800 calories a day. Under 800 most days. But for the last 2 days, I've eaten around 1200, to see if eating more would help my symptoms. But it hasn't.

Could all my symptoms just be anxiety?

Also, I don't take any stimulates or any medication. I also don't drink alcohol or do any drugs.

Thank you"	No-Spring-729	post	25.08441466458245	male	White	0.9939706325531006	na	na	na	2	anxiety	no prediction.

"16M just to clarify I have not been diagnosed with anxiety at all anything like that so I really need some help her on what's wrong with me 

Hey everyone, I've been in this group for awhile and never posted anything until now.

So for awhile now I've had tons of pains and aches randomly. this happened just after I had left highschool since I got bored of it and wanted to Start working as I've got a course coming up end of year. 

This all started when i first got sick and had a chest infection that healed on its own. But at the time I had tons of chest pain on left and right, it didn't really bother me until I used ""doctor Google""bi remember the first things popping up mentioning all sorts of cancer including lung, throat, ect you get the point. But then I completely lost It and was in tears I thought my life was about to disappear from me in blink of an eye. I was telling my parents saying I've got something wrong with me I need to get this checked out, this overwhelming worrying fear was really new to me. I spent countless days/nights searching up symptoms and crying over it. Few days ahead pains were still happening so after annoying parents enough saying I'm dying I ended up going to the hospital.

Me and my dad waited there for a few hours, I finally got checked told them my problems and fears they said due to me being anxious they would help by giving me a chest x-ray and blood test. (They all came back fine and clear) 

Since then I've had countless ECGs blood test and check ups.

I've been feeling like shit and not myself ever since then I've been to the hospital so many times just for them to tell me I'm fine and healthy it's driving me insane. Every little ache, tingle, pain, sensation in my body send me straight to fight or flight mode and I'm thinking of dying young.

 It really hasn't helped as I've heard so many things of people being diagnosed with cancer and many conditions that can't be fixed. Especially recently I've been having headaches and so convinced I have brain cancer/tumour it's so exhausting. There a bump in my head that goes like up and down apparently Ita just a pimple... But surely it's just more than that. I just wanna feel normal it's been getting worst too, see Normally I'm a really outgoing person and nothing really bothers me. But all of a sudden I feel this emptiness I feel like I Start viewing life in third person like I become disconnected with my body/reality and to me nothing feels real. My parents have gotten sick of me complaining about my issues so this is only place I can feel alright so yeah sorry for this all I've just been caught up in my own head and want to know what's wrong with me. Oh and plus I can't sleep at all cause I think I'm going to die in my sleep 

So just to sum it all I'm I'm 16 thinking I'm going to get some really bad disease and feel anxious all the time about any other pain. I've probably missed out alot more of information but this is all of the things I can think of the mean time"	pacslayer	post	16.03393979545065	female	White	0.9979717135429382	na	na	na	3	anxiety	age: 16, gender: male, explanation: the person mentions that they are a 16-year-old male in the post. there is no information given about ethnicity so it can't be predicted.

You are wanting closure, but cannot receive‚Ä¶ something almost anyone experiences in breakups. Unfortunately if you guys do not have contact with each other and or the other party does not wish to do so you must move on. I had a relationship where I obsessed over wanting answers until I realized I didn‚Äôt need any, I didn‚Äôt need to know anything because this person was no longer in my life. People are going to come in and out of your life constantly because this is how relationships and friendships work. I know it may be nice to know if they‚Äôre doing alright but they are technically none of your business anymore. I don‚Äôt mean that to seem harsh but you are living your own life now and so is she, so you go your separate ways and leave each other in the past. I know it‚Äôs hard to do but you‚Äôve gotta do it, block her from your mind in anyway possible.

I have been experiencing the shortness of breath really bad recently. I do vape and smoke weed, but i have not been smoking for long so I doubt im experiencing long term effects, and ive had experiences with anxious and depressive episodes before and what people are describing sounds like what I am experiencing. It just feels like i cant get a satisfying breath in recently. I think i just get the tightness and shortness of breath and that freaks me out so i end up just not being able to breathe.

I can relate to this. Tight chest, feeling lack of air. It's anxiety, fight or flight response kicking in. I have been vaping all the time while I was recovering from GAD.

"Did you experience shortness of breath before you picked up vaping/smoking? Vaping can cause shortness of breath in days or weeks. It doesn‚Äôt have to be a long-term thing to impact your health. It‚Äôs certainly not doing you any favors. If you‚Äôre serious about wanting to breathe well, I‚Äôd advise you to stop the vaping and smoking.

It‚Äôs possible that anxiety is affecting your breathing, too. It can make you hyperventilate, so you feel like you‚Äôre not getting in a good breath. I would just focus on taking slow, deep breaths. A quick, powerful inhale through your nose, and then slowly exhale out of your mouth with pursed lips, exhaling as much air out of your lungs as possible. And repeat. I have a breathing disorder, and my occupational therapist taught me that exercise to help me take in deeper breaths. It‚Äôs helped me a lot.

It‚Äôs possible that you could have a breathing disorder too. If the issue persists, it could be a good idea to look into seeing a doctor."	bluntforcetrauma_	reply	na	na	na	0.9976166486740112	no	no	strong	na	anxiety	no prediction.

"Horrible sexual dream involving OCD obsession- please help. I‚Äôm so distressed

I have OCD and it‚Äôs really intense atm. I have been dealing with a sexual obsession where I‚Äôm terrified I‚Äôm attracted to a family member. I have been getting intrusive thoughts and images which try to convince me that I am during the day lately. It‚Äôs awful and I spend so much time ruminating on them. 
Last night I had a dream and it started off with me having sex with my husband and I was aroused in the dream, then for some reason my husband went away and was replaced with my family member. In the dream it was like I was ‚Äòokay‚Äô with it and was still aroused by the act. 
I woke up sweating having a panic attack and have been so distressed since. Why the hell would I dream that (and not be disgusted in my dream like I am in real life)?! 
I legitimately do not want that in real life, or find this person attractive. So why was I not repulsed in my dream, and was okay with it/wanted it?

"Looks a bit like your OCD is creating you an opportunity to punish yourself with a sense of guilt. Don't fall for that. It's just a dream, a product of a tired mind searching for comfort and creating visions which should in no way be taken literally.  Imagine you were dreaming about killing someone from your family. Would you be scared that you're going to do it for real? Dreams are symbolic, they may represent anger, fear, searching for comfort and thousands of different things.

"Hello. I, 19F, have been dealing with health anxiety for about 7 years now. I believe it ultimately started when I had my first panic attack that made me feel death was after me. 

Recently, there has been absolutely no escape from the hell that this condition puts me through. I got a new therapist about a month ago. I rated my anxiety, at the time, on a scale of 1/10, a 6. She told me that was not high enough for treatment. She asked me what I even wanted her help with, and I begged her for help with my hypochondria. She then proceeded to tell me to breathe in and out. I haven‚Äôt been back since. 

It has gotten progressively worse. I cant watch movies, I can barely eat, I cant color, I cant walk, I cant distract myself, anything and everything I do does not mask the thoughts that I have some terminal illness which cannot be cured. 

Today, the obsession is an odd feeling lump in my neck. No other symptoms, no nothing. Just a part of my neck where when I press down I can feel a difference in the left side compared to the other. 

I cant spend a lot of time with my boyfriend anymore. The day always ends in me having to run home, get in the shower, sit there, and run rampant with my thoughts for hours. I honestly cannot convey the horrible experience I am going through based upon words alone.

"I‚Äôve been dealing with a very similar struggle. Have dealt with anxiety for a decade, but this year had what I have been calling a nervous breakdown: intense health anxiety driven by the physical sensations of anxiety (headaches, muscle aches/twitches).
If at all possible, I suggest finding a new therapists saying you aren‚Äôt anxious enough for treatment sounds very strange to me. Also, consider seeing a psychiatrist about anti anxiety meds. I got on lexapro, and it has helped me get out from under this.
Other things that helped me:
-not googling symptoms. It leads to thought spirals. Hide the browser app on your phone if you need to. If you must seek reassurance, search your symptoms on this subreddit, and see that people with anxiety feel all sorts of strange sensations. Anxiety does wild things to the body
-not being afraid to be selfish with self care. Spend your evenings taking care of yourself. If you work from home, work from bed if you feel bad.

Hello guys. I've started CBT and been listening to some podcast episodes so not feeling very anxious lately.

"Unfortunately with anxiety your mind may stay calm, but your body isn't. It will take time for the body to stop bombarding you with adrenaline and related symptoms because anxiety has been developing for years and it's impossible to snap out of it immediately - the body will need time to heal as well. But it's actually doable. My best guess would be stay with calm mind as long as you can and let the body adjust to ""being normal"". And yes, muscle twitches are among the most obvious signs of deep anxiety.

"it‚Äôs been about 5 years since I‚Äôve had an insomnia flare up, and boy I don‚Äôt miss it. I have an anxiety disorder, been doing pretty well the last 4 years, but all of a sudden about 2 weeks ago it hit me. I started having anxiety about sleep again. I had a big planned weekend ahead and was thinking ‚Äúwhat if I don‚Äôt sleep?‚Äù 

Obviously I know the root of it, I have to get rid of that anxiety. But there‚Äôs one thing I‚Äôve failed to understand.

During the day i‚Äôll have crippling anxiety about sleep, it‚Äôs all I think about. But come 10 o clock I‚Äôll take a hot shower, and relax watching TV and my anxiety will be pretty tame. However, i‚Äôll try to fall asleep, my mind is clear, i‚Äôm just thinking about whatever, and I get nothing and nowhere. I breathe deep, focus on my breath, relax my muscles as best I can, and still nothing. 

That brings me to a question that I‚Äôve never been able to get the answer. Am i suffering from adrenal fatigue? I know it‚Äôs not a real medically accepted diagnosis but everything I read about it seems like it fits me to a T. Tired but wired, low energy around dinner time, etc.

So, yeah to be honest I've had trouble making friends irl for the past year or so, as well as finding a potential partner and I know it's only going to get harder now that I'm taking all online classes(I didn't really have a choice in the matter btw, that's just all that my college offered with the specific classes I'm taking). For clarification I'm 20 years old. I've been looking for ways I could branch out and meet people with similar interests it's just hard because I do live in a smaller town, I've been looking at local events and clubs that sorta thing but they seem pretty sparse and I have also considered joining like a dating app or something, my biggest worry with that though is my age, Idk is 20 too young to be doing that sort of thing? I'm also wondering if anyone my age even really uses dating apps, or if it's mainly older people who are out of college, I'm sure it depends on the app/site ,but it does seem like the experience as a whole is meant for people more so in their mid 20s to 30s. If anyone has any tips or advice for how to safely go out and meet people that would be great. I'm not looking to make a boat load of new friends I just worry about being that person with only one friend, I don't want to overburden anyone. And yeah I would also just like to increase my chances of meeting someone I'd want to date.	mmcolalover	post	31.883738989695175	male	White	0.9946093559265137	na	na	na	3	anxiety	no prediction.
There is absolutely nothing wrong with going on a dating site dude!!! I think you‚Äôll probably stumble on to a lot of other people that feel very similar to the way you do. But pushing that aside for a second‚Ä¶ bro, you‚Äôre 20!!!  This might sound annoying, but just try to be patient. Don‚Äôt force anything because you‚Äôll just get yourself in a lot of bad relationships that way. The truth is that it‚Äôll probably pop up when you least expect it and aren‚Äôt looking for it. I felt similar to the way you do when I was 18. I would look back at my 18 years and feel like‚Äù what have I done this whole time???‚Äù but I‚Äôm 43 now and I realized I did what I was supposed to do. I was a kid. I rode BMX, I got in trouble, and I went to punk rock/ emo shows. I couldn‚Äôt see it then, but my life just started at that age. Same as you. It‚Äôs hard to believe but your life is just starting.

"Nothing for it but to just get used to it. I sympathize.

It took me years to get the courage up to try medication. I was afraid of the side effects, afraid I'd feel like a zombie and not myself anymore.

It‚Äôs hard as fuck. I used to puke when I was anxious. Accepting it was the hardest part but eventually I did it. I accepted the worst that could happen, that if I puked right now it would still be ok, the world would still exist. Eventually, I told how I felt to my friends and they were supportive and told me that if it happened it wouldn‚Äôt be as problematic as I imagined. Not sure if you can relate to my experience but everybody knows anxiety, just go get fresh air and tell yourself that even if the worst were to happen, you still would be ok and your life wouldn‚Äôt really change.

All of a sudden at 42 years old, my business started doing very well and then came the panic attacks. It took me a while to figure out that was the cause. Five out of seven mornings, I wake up two hours before my alarm sweating and nauseous and have diarrhea. I am absolutely exhausted, because I am not ready to wake up yet, but my body was jolted awake from a nocturnal panic attack. I try to ignore it and lay in bed, and It gets worse and worse. I begin to sweat more and more.  I have to get up and start moving. But I usually can‚Äôt go too far from home because my stomach is so unstable. I usually end up going for a walk on the nature trail near my house for the first hour I‚Äôm awake. It also seems that the walk helps settle my stomach and even makes me hungry and allows me to eat. It seems like in the beginning of the walk I am still gagging and by the end of the walk, I am hungry and ready to eat. Give it a try. I definitely had to force it in the beginning but it ended up being my go to move now ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Sometimes I wonder if I can still refer to them as panic attacks because I know it‚Äôs coming damn near every morning at 4:00-5:00 am.

I get bouts of just total body rigidity. It‚Äôs hard to explain but I just feel tightness all over my body, I have little to no appetite. That‚Äôs how my anxiety manifests.

"I have a prescription for Lorazepam (.5mg) to use as needed because my anxiety tends to get really bad and leads to panic attacks while I‚Äôm traveling.

It‚Äôs been 2 days since I‚Äôve had one, but I feel like my anxiety is SO much worse. I‚Äôm not sleeping, my chest is tight, and I feel like at any moment I could go into a full blown panic attack.

"Sometimes you need to take the benzos more often than not.  Anxiety  can happen more frequently for you now because of routine changes, job issues or health, daily worries etc.  The dr. said ""take it as needed""....so if you feel the anxiety is unmanageable, and getting close to a panic attack, then take the medication. Just don't take more than the recommended amount.

I take Xanax .25mg for morning anxiety and it works well for me. I'm not going to pretend my anxiety doesn't bother me - of course it does. It's awful to wake up feeling anxious every morning.  Most of the time I have no idea what I'm anxious about. So I take my medication which makes my anxiety more manageable. It does not magically disappear but I feel more relaxed.

Try to determine, if you can, the cause of feeling more anxious this past week. Taking a benzo a couple of days in a row should not contribute to increase your anxiety levels."	Blueberry5232	reply	na	na	na	0.996489942073822	no	no	no	na	anxiety	no prediction.
"Does anyone elses brain go haywire in the evening? When I try to settle down at night I have all these random thoughts - things from the past, present, and future. Some are negative thoughts about myself, some are problems I need to solve, and some are just random thoughts based on what I did that day. I have done meditation, good sleep hygiene, have taken a few calming type supplements, exercise before bed, writing my thoughts down before bed. Nothing really works. I've seen a life coach, a talk therapist, and a hypnotherapist - theyve helped in certain areas but I'm still having the issue.

I have severe sleeping bruxism (I clench my teeth in my sleep) and have tried tons of things for that but I feel this issue of my racing mind is causing that, my mind is always going, even in my sleep. Any suggestions?

"If this is happening chronically (not just during a situational stressful period) it might be because you are avoiding or not allowing yourself to feel certain difficult thoughts or feelings during the day. As a result, when nothing is competing for your attention at night, they all come rushing to the surface. 

In the short term, I listen to sleep podcasts to distract my mind, and I try not to control or judge my thoughts; I just try to observe them. If it's so bad it's preventing me from sleeping, I get out of bed and do something relaxing in another room for a bit.

Do you have someone with you on this vacation that you can talk about what you are going through rn?  (friend/sibling etc) Social media and Reddit are definitely a big help when it comes to anxiety, and i guess its definitely hard on anyone these days to be offline. For me, I use physical exercise to make myself less anxious so i would have suggested going for a swim or something else physical like jogging. If that's not ur cup of cake, have you considered taking photography?

"In my recovery, I struggled with this too. I put a ton of pressure on myself to relax or to not feel anxious, which (as you can see) backfires hard. 
More struggle = more fear = more anxiety.

In therapy, I practiced letting go of that desire to control and resist anxiety. I did something called Acceptance therapy. Which ultimately lessened my anxiety greatly long-term. The basic idea is to shift your goal from ""I should feel relaxed"" to ""I should try and enjoy the present, even if I don't feel 100% relaxed."" 

As a result of being able to enjoy the present, a state of relaxation will naturally happen. If you practice, you can enjoy life experiences even if you're not feeling 100% relaxed.

Been there. It's coming from frequent reassurance seeking. To stop this you must not try to convince yourself you do not have cancer, as strange as it may sound. It's all down to low tolerance of uncertainty. You must stop seeking reassurance and that way get used to uncertainty. Otherwise this will not stop.

I need help! I'm ao scared and so sick and tired of feeling this way. I examine every single thing happening to my body. Around 2 months ago I met a guy and we had unprotected sex a few times. I got super scared but couldn't find PEP in my country easily. I took two tests and they were negative but we hooked up again. like 10 days before my second test (4th gen). After this I stopped hooking up with him because I was too scared. I told him to get tested but he's travelling and assures me he will when he's back. Its been 6 weeks since our last encounter and my face is super itchy and my heart rate has been high. I'm wayyyyyy too scared to get my final test. I've convinced myself that this one will be positive and if it is I have to end my life. in my country there is no acceptance of premarital sex and I can't tell my parents. I'll have to kill myself. I just can't live with this anxiety anymore. I want to feel free. I'm finally doing good in my life and I can't get tested. if its positive my life is over.

"Hey everyone, I wanted to reach out and get some advice on a personal situation I'm going through. I've been on SSRI medication for the past two years to treat severe anxiety, and honestly, it's been life-changing for me. Before I started taking the medication, my anxiety was so debilitating that I wouldn't even leave the house due to the overwhelming fear. It had negative effects on my job, my relationships, and pretty much every aspect of my life.  
Since starting the medication, I've been able to live my life more freely and happily. I can now do things I want when I want, and it's a liberating feeling. My friends and my girlfriend have mentioned that they've never seen me so happy and willing to do things. However, the one person in my life that is against it is my mother. She's been pushing me to stop taking the medication, claiming that she's seen a change in me and it's not for the better.  
I'm conflicted. I don't like that my life is dependent on a drug, but at the same time, I prefer it to the alternative of not being able to live my life at all. The medication has been a real game-changer for me, and I don't want to go back to how I was before. On the other hand, I do understand where my mother is coming from, and I do value her opinion.  
So, I'd love to hear your thoughts. Do you think I should stop taking the SSRI medication or continue with it since it has been helping me so much? Any advice or personal experiences would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!

If you believe you‚Äôve made changes in your life to help prevent the anxiety from coming back, or learned ways to cope with the anxiety when it does come, and still be able to function than I‚Äôd say go for it.

"It‚Äôs not uncommon for people to want to discontinue taking or decrease an SSRI, if for the 2 years you have been taking them you have also been doing therapy and or changed a lot you might be able to slowly decrease or discontinue and be ok. But your mom and your ejaculatory delay are the only reasons to stop and the reasons to continue taking it seem to greatly outweigh those two things. 
I‚Äôm currently taking an SSRI, I understand the sexual side effects, I‚Äôve also previously tapered off and restarted several times.

"So SSRIs have been terrible for me personally and my mother is very pro-psych-medication. I‚Äôm trying to imagine what an equivalent scenario would be. My mom insisting that I need to stop treating my sleep apnea, and go back to a place where I was too exhausted to function, I guess. You see how absurd that sounds?

There are some side effects to look out for like weight gain but have that conversation with your doctor, not your mom. 

RE: being dependent, I get it. Dealing with the healthcare system is a pain in the ass and it would be better if we didn‚Äôt need these things. Do you have a therapist? I‚Äôd try talking to them about what it looks like for people to get to a point where they no longer need meds, and make that a goal for the next few years. You don‚Äôt necessarily need to be on them forever (and sometimes they eventually stop being as effective) but I don‚Äôt see any reason to stop them now; rather, use the time you have on them to build stability and coping skills for if you do end up stopping them later. But if you abruptly stop now without doing any of that work I don‚Äôt think that will be good. And it should be a decision you make for yourself, not because of your mom. 

Also‚Äînever quit taking SSRIs abruptly if you do decide to (or have to for practical reasons), always taper off by decreasing the dose over a week or more.

I get this sometimes. Even if I don‚Äôt feel anything I‚Äôm just numb to the stress, but still feel effects. I use calcium carbonate (Gaviscon), omeprazole at max dose until the stomach is better. Eating and sleeping well at least stabilise the mood. There‚Äôs many anxiety meds and often time people need to try a couple before finding one who works.

"Your skin is an amazing (multi layer) barrier to all sorts of germs and chemicals and is excellent at protecting you around the clock. The dog‚Äôs saliva will dry and not be a bother to you. Overwhelmingly any germs in the saliva will die as soon as the environment changes (the saliva dries out). Maybe you find it a little gross to have it on your clothing, but it won‚Äôt harm you. 

Many people live with animals and play with them all the time and are perfectly healthy. The joy a pet brings far outweighs the fur, dirt, and saliva that animals bring.

I would wash the scratch with some soap water. Soap and is really great at washing away dirt and other things and then you can go about your day. If there is no blood, you still have other layers of skin protecting you.

If for any reason the scratch is worse tomorrow, you still have plenty of time to treat it and get 100% better.

"It‚Äôs been happening for the last 3 years for me. Started with one episode where I ended up in the ER. Then didn‚Äôt come back for about 6 months. Around the beginning of the pandemic it came back and had been nearly constant since. 

When it gets bad enough to lead to a panic attack I take Klonopin and it helps. Lately I‚Äôve found exposure therapy to be the most helpful. Actively focus on your breathing and tell your anxiety to bring it on. It sucks at first, but after a while it helps. The worst thing you can do is try to fight off the feeling, it only serves to feed your anxiety.

At so many different points in the last three years, I  thought it would never get better. For the first time I‚Äôm starting to feel a tad more optimistic.

Hey I have been feeling the same! It's difficult to breathe all the time. I have to keep drinking water to breathe at ease. When I am nervous it is worse but when even everything is fine I have difficulty breathing. I usually breathe through the mouth because i have to take deeper breaths coz I feel suffocating sometimes. Checked with the doctor everything seems fine. But I have been going through this for many years but recently it has become worse.	soicanreadit	reply	na	na	na	0.017235424369573593	weak	strong	no	na	anxiety	no prediction.

I think there‚Äôs a possibility. Particularly because of the feeling of wanting to escape her body. Is this her first experience like this? I would recommend her consulting her doctor because if it is anxiety it needs treatment and as a precaution they do blood tests and ecg to rule out any other causes.

My first ever proper panic attack was suffered when I was asleep, it woke me up. But prior to that I had a weird sensation of going really hot and feeling sick that came and went. I found it unpleasant but I didn‚Äôt recognise it to be anxiety. The one where I realised it was an anxiety attack was more intense. I thought I was dying.

"Hi, here‚Äôs my situation. 

Every single day no matter where I am, I am always nervous when talking to people. In particular, at work, where I have to talk to others. I find my self constantly rehearsing conversations/how i‚Äôm going to start them in my head, as I have stuttered many times when trying to get something out quickly, which is very embarrassing. 

This happens alot when I‚Äôm caught off guard or can‚Äôt figure out how to respond well to someone, especially when i‚Äôm not confident in what I‚Äôm saying. For example something like ‚Äúthis task should be done in 30 minutes‚Äù. I‚Äôm not fully confident that I‚Äôll complete the task in the time frame i‚Äôve given, so when I‚Äôm explaining why this will be the case, I can‚Äôt formulate sentences together very well because i‚Äôm worried about the actual outcome.

I can feel my heart beating heavily and I sweat a lot. I‚Äôm pretty young and relatively healthy, it just feels out of my control, I have little reason to be so anxious, it just seems like whatever I do I just can‚Äôt shake it. It‚Äôs a horrible thing to have to deal with and I don‚Äôt know what to do. It just feels absolutely in-escapable, and I dread going into work every day because of the social aspect. My colleagues are mostly very nice people too which makes it even more confusing for me, as they are very tolerable and kind. 

I‚Äôm actively trying to improve myself every day, and I tell myself today is going to be different, but as soon as I‚Äôm in the situation everything goes out the window. I‚Äôm sweating, heart beating hard, and constantly thinking about how I‚Äôm going to make my way through the day, and when I‚Äôm going to say this or that and how i‚Äôm going to do it. It is extremely tiring, on top of my actual work. 

Please give me some advice if possible, I really hate that i‚Äôm like this.

"I‚Äôm 17 and talking to a girl that I find super attractive and I really don‚Äôt wanna lose her. I‚Äôm a virgin but I could get hard while making out with other girls before her, I could also get hard with her up until the first time we tried to have sex, I left the room to get a condom, got it in my head that I needed to get hard again and could not get it up at all, very fucking embarrassing. She said it was okay and I let her know it was because I was anxious. I stressed so much about that event, thinking of it like a lot throughout days and was honestly scared to try again because I was unsure if it would happen again or not, I don‚Äôt masturbate a lot and when I do there‚Äôs no problem, if anything though after the first time I felt as if I wasn‚Äôt as horny much anymore because I was just always thinking about that first scenario. Next time we got intimate I would get hard while making out and stuff, but I was constantly monitoring it and as soon as I started monitoring it and was like oh I‚Äôm hard, now I have to stay hard, it would go. When we were just cuddling and I was really relaxed I was super hard and it stayed because I felt no need to try to keep it as we weren‚Äôt going to have sex. Throwback to the other day, through the whole time I was trying to stay out of my head, it was so hard to not monitor it though, I was hard enough to get the condom on and then I started overthinking and boom, gone, did oral to her though and she still enjoyed her self, embarrassing as fuck again though. She says she doesn‚Äôt care at all but I feel bad because I want to have sex so bad with her. Now all I can think about is the next time and I‚Äôll masterbate to like prove to myself I can still get hard throughout the day, just a very stressful situation, please help. Super anxious about it all.

I know it‚Äôs a mental thing, and I‚Äôve had anxiety my whole life, how do I stop myself from stressing and having anxiety over the past failed attempts to prevent it from happening in the future.

How do I also get out of my own head? This is a huge thing that I struggle with daily, and I can‚Äôt seem to fight it, it‚Äôs mentally exhausting and I‚Äôm literally drained at the end of days from trying to like ‚Äúreset‚Äù my thinking."

"Hi everyone, just want to clarify that I‚Äôm not seeking medical advice, I was just hoping maybe some of you could share your knowledge on this matter, or what your experience has been etc. 

So long story short, I have lived with OCD my entire life but never really had genuine panic attacks, up until recently. I lost my 1 year old golden retriever to kidney failure back in June, and then a month later almost lost my puppy, (he ate a sock and had an obstruction) needless to say, it was as the phrase goes. too much, too fast, too soon. Bc, I didn‚Äôt even have time to process what happened with my 1 year old dog, before ending up in an urgent health situation with my puppy. 

I‚Äôm experiencing debilitating panic attacks pretty much daily for two reasons, the first being guilt about if I have my one year old dog a good enough year, if I was mean to him, if I spent enough time with him, feeling like I failed him, etc. I panic, bc I feel like he passed bc I didn‚Äôt appreciate him enough. 

The second reason, is almost like a trauma response to what happened with my puppy, if he throws up I automatically think the worst and CANNOT, no matter what I do, calm myself down. It‚Äôs like the panic takes over me to the point where I‚Äôm just laying there daring off into space and shaking. I know dogs can throw up for other reasons, but I‚Äôm always convinced it‚Äôs another blockage, and can‚Äôt get myself to snap out of it. 

There was so much  in such a short amount of time, there is definitely post traumatic stress involved, which seems to make the panic attacks even more debilitating. I‚Äôm on an SSRI for my ocd, and I have a beta blocker than can help with panic attacks but first of all, my ocd medication stopped working entirely, my ocd is out of control and I think is what triggers the panic attacks in the first place, then as far as the beta blocker, it does nothing at all. I‚Äôve also tried hydroxyzine and that doesn‚Äôt do anything either. 

I am the last person that would ever consider a benzo, which pretty much tells you how truly debilitating this is for me. It‚Äôs not that I‚Äôm afraid of becoming addicted (I don‚Äôt like feeling high) but due to my medical conditions, there are a lot of risks to benzos. They can slow your breathing and I already have breathing issues, so I fear that It would end up affecting that. But I‚Äôm just so damn anxious all of the time, I can‚Äôt live this way anymore. My parents have pointed out that I guess I don‚Äôt spend that much time with my puppy, and I didn‚Äôt even realize I was doing that at first, but then I realized I blame myself so severely, that I feel like I can‚Äôt even play with him or I will hurt him again, I don‚Äôt even feel human anymore. 

Are there any alternatives to benzos that aren‚Äôt slow acting or am I going to have to bite the bullet and try one?"	HighStrungHabitat	post	25.067041190303264	female	White	0.9982768297195435	na	na	na	5	anxiety	no prediction.

By the way, with these thoughts, the right approach is to not engage them at all.

"Hi, I(22f) moved to my own apartment a few days ago. Before the move I have had some anxiety problems like panic attacks whenever I have slept in an unfamiliar environment like at grandmas or abroad. So I started to prepare for having some anxiety when I moved. 

It gets easier in daytime but at night the panic rises and I can't sleep and I miss my family. I can manage everything financially and I think I am well prepared to live on my own. But just today I went to the store and I started to panic and I couldn't breathe. I have gone to stores alone and I have had no problems then but now that I have to buy everything for myself I have a hard time doing it. I lived with my dad and we used to do weekly trips to the store together and we bought everything we needed together.

I moved to he other side of the city from my dad and sister, and now I just feel completely alone. My mom and dad and sister have all told me that I can always call them or visit, but this is such a big event in my life that I don't know if I can handle it. I knew that the first weeks would be tough and I would be fine after, but now I just get so overwhelmed. 
And it takes me 40 minutes to get to work by bus. I don't have a licence, I can't afford it. 

My apartment is new and I like it. I was just so okay with living with my dad and sister and now that I don't get to see them everyday it hurts. I feel so bad. I don't know what to do. I have tried to get a time for therapy but theres a line so I have to wait. I take sleeping pills every night because I am so scared that I can't fall asleep. 

I thought about moving closer to my family but I don't want to trouble them for help with that. My family isn't well off. 
I don't know how to write clearly enough that I feel so anxious and alone and horrible.

"First of all, you aren't alone! Your family is still out there, and it sounds like they still love and support you no matter how far apart you guys are!

Second, as I think most people recommend to do, is breathe. Don't try to rationalize or talk yourself down, literally just focus 100% on breathing evenly so your brain stays quiet for a minute. Shoot for five minutes of that. Some people like to try to intentionally think about something after a little because it really does get boring just breathing, but it helps!

It is great you are in line for therapy! It may be a wait but signing up at all is a very important first step. When I had home-anxiety-sickness in college, what I found to be very helpful in the long run was to turn my living space into a home. Really focus on making it your own where you can, even if that just means doing little things. It will help you associate it as a sanctuary in your mind.

Another thing that may help alleviate these feelings is just to call them! Every family is different of course, but if they are willing to help you face these feelings, family is a very powerful resource!

But, in the short term, just breathe. They are ok, you are ok, just making it through the day / night right now is your main focus. Tomorrow is a new day.

(This is gonna be a long ass vent but here we go) i'm sick of beint the funny friend in my friend group. I love my friends, i honestly do. But it seems like they only see me as the funny guy right now and not something else. I love making people laugh. It is something to make myself and other people happy, especially my friends. I love making them laugh. But i went way too far with this shit. I'm a socially insecure person, all i want is for my friends to see me as someone they can have fun with and laugh with. But i took it too far by making myself a clown, purposefully acting retarted and dumb to make my friends laugh. But now i've come to realize that now i'm older, my friends see me as nothing but a clown. Everytime i ask a genuine question on how someone is feeling, or if i have something to say that isn't really meant to be a joke. Everyone kinda ignores it. I feel like i'm stuck at a place where the only role i can fulfil is to make people laugh by acting out a stupid ass act where i'm supposed to make people laugh. I'm sick of it. I want to be someone who can make jokes, yes. But i also want to be there for people when they need someone to talk to, i want to be someone who can help you with all sorts of things, i want to be someone who you can talk to without being judged. I want to feel appreciated for who i am as a person, not only as the funny guy. I have this girl i like a lot and i'm afraid that she only thinks me of the guy who can only make jokes and has no other qualities besides that. I've talked to a few friends about this but even though they say that they do appreciate me, i just don't see them actually acting like they do. This is honestly making me miserable, i feel so lonely even though i have all these friends who i love so very much... just wanted to vent this out rq, sorry if it was too long but thanks for reading this!

Hey guys! So my anxiety has been off the charts lately and I've been considering giving CBD a try. I used to smoke weed, but it would often trigger anxiety attacks and derealization, so I'm worried that CBD might have similar effects since it comes from the same source. Has anyone here tried CBD or any other non-psychoactive herbal blends for anxiety? I'd love to hear about your experiences and any recommendations you might have.

It helped me significantly. I'd recommend full spectrum...isolate isn't as effective for stress & anxiety. Make sure its a reputable merchant. Tincture drops under the tongue worked best for me.

I also use YouTube and anything else to distract me from anxiety. Yes, what you described is a common symptom of anxiety. I am similar as you but instead of nausea I get intestinal cramps and the urge to go to the bathroom. I just tell myself if I need to go to the bathroom then so be it, sure it's inconvenient but nothing bad will happen ultimately.

"I started a job at a big grocery store yesterday and I find myself more anxious to go back tomorrow than on my actual first day. I had horrible nightmares last night, I barely slept, I've been on the edge of a panic attack all day when thinking about going back tomorrow.

I'm usually not an anxious person. I can't even say what's stressing me so much. My coworkers and manager seem nice, I got along well with others, I learned my tasks quickly, the only thing that triggered my panic was that I got lost several times. The building is huge, I got lost three times in a few hours in the products storing basement, I got locked outside and a security guard laughed when he opened back to let me it. The second time I couldnt find my way back and ended up in middle of customers looking at me confused, and the third time I got lost so far in the basement I was lost for 4min before I could find someone to take me back.

I feel horrible and stupid. I kept asking people for direction every five minutes, sometimes to the same person, and I feel like there's ""dumbass"" written on my forehead. I already forgot the password to the entrance door and I cant recall where is the second door my manager told me about.

I can't stop worrying about being lost again and again at my new job. I know I won't sleep tonight because of stress. Can anyone share advices ?"	Ellie_SeJo	post	25.083758608146507	female	White	0.9994489550590515	na	na	na	6	anxiety	no prediction.
It's ok and should be expected by your employer that you are not going to know anything when you start at a new place. For me,  I find that it takes about 3 months to not feel like its my first day.

"I only lasted one day at my college dorm and left right away. I was excepted into a BA program at a college 3 hours away and I was excited and was planning everything to get ready for college. I pictured myself becoming a new person, making friends, doing things on my own, just being independent however that didn‚Äôt last leading up to move in day. My anxiety was settling in a few days before but I figured that was just normal jitters but it just got worst and I held up packing until the night before. 
I tried push down the feelings and covering it up with excitement for leaving but on the drive over I began to shakes in my legs and arms, the heavy feeling on my chest and my eyes watering, finally 30 minutes away I began to cry. My parents had to calm me down the rest of the way there, when we got there I still had the anxious feeling but from the pep talk from my parents I felt better, I checked in and started unpacking in my room. My parents went to the store for me to get last minute items and being alone in the dorm and still unpacking made me cry again, to try and calm myself again I ran outside and just waited until my parents came back. Again they had to sooth me and talk me down again until I felt better. They left and I was alone again.

Being alone in my dorm I looked around, I didn‚Äôt like how my room looked like hospital room, how quiet it was. I tried talking with my RA and other dormmates in the hall but it wasn‚Äôt helping. Back in my room I organized my desk for the class the next day, watched a YouTube in my laptop but nothing was working. Finally I called my parents, they were still on the road home but I cried and said I can‚Äôt do this, I want to come home, please come back. 

Parents said I need to talk with my advisors and professors first, and i went into panic mode. What if I can‚Äôt leave, what if I‚Äôm stuck here for four months alone. My parents told me they would come back the next day but I cried myself to sleep. I slept 8 hours actually but that was probably because my body was tired from all the crying I did. 
The next morning I went for a walk on campus before my class started, my anxiety was so high I felt like running but I could only just walk fast. The same fears came back ‚Äúwhat if I can‚Äôt leave, what if I get kicked out of the program‚Äù but I just wanted to leave that was more important to me right now.

I got in contact with my advisor right at 9 and was honest with him and told him I can‚Äôt be here what can I do, I want to leave. Thankfully he said it‚Äôs okay if I leave and another big surprise was that all my class are online. He said you can take your classes back home, just talk with your dorm advisor about checking out. Thankfully check out was quick since I only check in yesterday however I just had to wait for my parents. 

My parents told me they couldn‚Äôt come until later in the day so I still went to my classes and packed all my stuff. While I was excited to leave the embarrassment came in. I only last one night here, and I‚Äôm leaving. I‚Äôm such a baby I can‚Äôt stay here for a week. I tried telling myself well my classes are online are don‚Äôt really need to be here I‚Äôll just be in my room all day, but the shame came back that I can last here. 

I wanted to be discreet when taking my stuff out when I parents got here, I didn‚Äôt want the same people that moved the same time as me see me leave, I was so embarrassed but once everything was packed and we got back on the road my cried again but this time that I was gone. My parents didn‚Äôt yell or make comments like I thought they were, they just smiled at me and looked forward. But I feel like I disappointed them, that I brought shame to them.

I‚Äôm back home now, laying in the comfort in my room , in my bed. Now that I‚Äôm home I‚Äôm reflecting on this, what happened, what can I do to fix this. Im 25 years old, I feel so far behind in life because I‚Äôm scared of change, I can‚Äôt be alone it seems with my thoughts and trying to become an adult while I still live with my parents. I feel far behind in life because I‚Äôm not living the ‚Äúadult‚Äù life like I should be like my friends and family my age that are all on their own going to school or working somewhere far. 
I set up a meeting with my therapist, but
I just want advice on how I can get through this, if you‚Äôd had the same experience as me how did you handle it? If their are mean comments maybe that will encourage me to do better but right now I feel like I‚Äôm in a rut that I can‚Äôt move forward, because of I‚Äôm afraid of being alone, change and maybe having to grow up. I don‚Äôt want to ruin another chance I might get like this again because I‚Äôm anxious."

"Hi I'm Matt 31M. I have generalized anxiety so most new things make me nervous. It's been over a year since my breakup. It was my first and only relationship. I'm a bit of a late bloomer when it comes to being social. Before I got serious into that relationship I made sure she knew my flaws so she wasn't blindsided. She started out kind, loving and supportive. Being with her definitely improved my self confidence and I gained a lot of experience socially. After a few months she started to grow cold and eventually broke things off. She still strung me around for a month calling every day for over an hour saying she missed me, and her 8 year old son wanted me to keep helping him ride his bike without training wheels. I got real upset after one of our hour long calls when she dropped the bomb she was seeing one of her friends. We had heated arguments for a week. She told me it was wrong that I found happiness in our relationship and that I needed to find happiness in myself. Part of me understands that, self love and all, but I don't get why it was so wrong to lean on each other. In the early phases of our relationship she assured me she would be there for me no matter what. I did so much for her and her son as well.

My anxiety is still terrible, but in the last two years I've overcome a lot. I'm kinda just venting since it's been on my mind lately, and I don't have anyone to talk to. It helps putting it out there instead of bottling it up. I'd love to hear input from anyone who has a partner that has similar anxiety and how you guys coexist.

"17 years ago I was kinda tossed in a psych ward for partying and self medication too much (lots of family issues, I was a ‚Äútroubled teen‚Äù bla bla) and I was diagnosed bipolar based on somewhat iffy criteria like rapid mood changes reacting to being held against my will.   It‚Äôs also important to note that my ‚Äúmania‚Äù was not really present unless I was intoxicated.   I have since given up recreational drinking etc.   also my mood swings were short term and reactionary to life events rather than long term and internal.  

Anyway long story short some of the meds made my anxiety and also ocd way worse and no one really cared but I also was afraid to ask for help.  Some bipolar meds also made me very physically sick like icu inpatient.   To add onto it all I have had medication allergies before so ofc I‚Äôm always scared of that.  

I‚Äôm now only on a very tiny dose of an AP which isn‚Äôt really supposed to help bipolar at that dose.  I can‚Äôt increase the dose much bc it makes my breathing problematic.  

It does help me sleep and chill a little but gives horrible restless leg which make me anxious and makes me feel nihilistic.  And while I‚Äôm falling asleep it makes me think I‚Äôm dying or insane. But going off it also has those withdrawl symptoms.   

I can‚Äôt say I‚Äôve had mania according to my drs I‚Äôve only had severe anxiety depression ocd and possible adhd. 

But I‚Äôm absolutely too scared to try SSRIs because in my formative years it was drilled into me they‚Äôd make me crazy. A lot of my trauma and anxiety i probably acted really on edge and racing thoughts and I was told it‚Äôs psychosis and mania and it was heavily implied this meant I was a moral failure whereas if it were depression and anxiety I would be a patient getting treatment.  As it was, I was treated like a moral failure and a criminal although I did not commit any crime. 

This is part of why I‚Äôm scared to believe my current doctors because what if I just tricked them all into the idea I‚Äôm not bipolar bc I was shamed for it?  But I try to always tell them the full truth.  I also feel like maybe I‚Äôm just traumatized that I was forced on bipolar meds that made me dangerously physically ill.   

I actually was once one lexapro and nothing else for months and I did feel kinda okay.  I did sort of have a really weird group of friends briefly but I got away from them. Idk how to tell if that‚Äôs bad judgment from being manic or if that‚Äôs just being happy and stable enough to actually get out of bed and try things. 

My anxiety is bad enough that I think I‚Äôm going to die or go insane almost every day.  

I also feel that my anxiety and panic episodes were just labeled mania and I really don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs true.   

This is complicated by the fact that I‚Äôve learned I have an actual physical neurological disorder that may require ironically some meds that are also for bipolar although we will avoid the ones that didn‚Äôt work for me.  But I have more testing first. 

So anyway what would you do in my situation of crippling panic and anxiety, a real health condition of the brain that means I also can‚Äôt always take any old antidepressant bc it makes my symptoms worse, and constant fear of going crazy?  Benzos work short term and I‚Äôm going to ask for them again tbh but I have addiction anxiety as well.  However I have successfully used short courses of Ativan in the past for severe panic and then stopped.  

I am considering asking to start an Ssri again ‚Äî I quit both Zoloft and lexapro right away because I can‚Äôt handle the 30 day buildup ‚Äî but asking for Ativan or something to get through the 30 day buildup when anxiety can get worse, plus stay on my low dose AP bc I‚Äôm too scared to go off it and need it to sleep. And then benzos as needed until I can stabilize and also receive the medication for my neuro condition which should help. 

In all of this I can‚Äôt stop my intrusive anxiety thoughts that I actually am bipolar and going to become psychotic and that I‚Äôve just manipulated everyone to believe I‚Äôm not.  This is in spite of the fact that even in the ER recently a doctor made a side note that although bipolar is in my history I seem stable in that regard in spite of not really being on anything for it.     However they did note I seemed anxious. 

So yeah like WDYT?   I‚Äôm honestly too scared to just try an Ssri but maybe if I ask for Ativan for the transition and for things like trips, plus stay on a small dose of AP it will help me feel safe trying antidepressants?  I was convinced that any serotonin increasing drug wasn‚Äôt for me but now I know that they can make my neurological condition symptoms worse, but perhaps knowing that or hopefully soon getting on a med for that too will help?   Especially I think maybe I have to try something for ocd and anxiety now bc the meds I‚Äôll need for my brain can make my ocd worse.  


My OCD and anxiety are getting so bad that sometimes I just sit there afraid to move or take any action whatsoever.  It was drilled into me that I will be crazy and have bad judgment but not KNOW it.   Which is kind of feeding into my panic issues.    

Then if I get over that fear, I end up experiencing the scary neuro symptoms which make me afraid I‚Äôm about to drop dead right there.  

Feel I‚Äôm in a rock and a hard place.  WWYD?  Every med helps one things but makes other things worse.  But it‚Äôs clear that not being on meds isn‚Äôt working for me.  

Btw the unit that diagnosed me bipolar was closed for serious patient abuses. 

I see my Psych in two days and will share all this but I‚Äôm interested in feedback from the anxiety community.

I feel in such a weird spot bc as soon as I start getting anything done I feel like oh yay my anxiety and adhd are better today. Then immediately my fear goes to oh no I‚Äôm goal oriented and getting things done what if it‚Äôs mania. 

And then I have the neuro condition on top of it all. 

I‚Äôm so tired.   And my anxiety is so bad it makes me super depressed although I think the depression is a secondary reaction to anxiety and ocd.  And I‚Äôm scared if I‚Äôm not hyper vigilant that I will have terrible judgement; I‚Äôve felt that only my hyper vigilance keeps me okay or something."

"As someone who's not a medical professional, just an anxiety patient --

It sounds to me like the correct idea is to start over.  A bad diagnosis, frankly, can be worse than no diagnosis.  By your own admission, your diagnosis was under questionable circumstances.  You've significantly changed in 17 years.  And mental health practices have changed significantly over that time.

If you otherwise trust these doctors, I'd think starting from the beginning is a good plan.  Let them do a workup without any preconceptions.  Maybe you need meds, maybe you don't.  If they tell you you're not bipolar, I'd consider their reasoning, since you have reason to question the original diagnosis.  If you have a physical neurological issue, that's legit reason to need meds.  Let them focus the meds onto your physical condition to start.  In the meantime, have you tried a counselor?  (Did I miss that?)  I'd start talking some of this out.  You've got a lot to unpack.  Tell it to someone who's trained in helping dig through all of this."

"From experience I've tried SSRIs over the years and found them to be fine, no side effects except if I suddenly didn't take them (I'm very forgetful). I was on a low enough dose but if your anxiety is so bad, why not try the medication for 6 months and then see how you feel?

You have my sympathies because I also have OCD, depression and ADHD. I'm terrified of the side effects of meds too, and have been prescribed a very high dose of Effexor which sounds terrible. Makes me almost miss the days of Lexapro. I only stayed on for a max of a year and I chose to take them whenever things got so out of control, I couldn't cope. It's best to not let yourself get to that stage, but if you're there, they can help stabilise you."	Flaky_Pomegranate	reply	na	na	na	0.9898017048835754	no	strong	no	na	anxiety	no prediction.
I agree. This is very logical. Thank you. I currently have a counselor as well.   I haven‚Äôt got an official diagnosis besides anxiety from my psych.   I guess I also have a trauma and fear of psychiatrists because of the times I was forced onto meds that landed me in the icu and told I had to just keep taking them and I was a bad patient with no judgment.  So because I have a psychiatrist np I trust now I am nervous to start over with like a clinical psychologist or something bc it took ages to find even a prescribed I trust.

"I just started taking it(10mg Lexapro). I practically don't have obsessions anymore, and therefore no new compulsions. The problem now is that I don't want to be stuck on an SSRI at all. The side effects are weird. It makes you sleepy after you take it, and then makes you unable to sleep well at night. The sexual side effects are disturbing. The withdrawal stories are too scary. Everything about it is so ambiguous; what is it doing to my body? I've read studies and it does weird things like lower sperm quality and potentially messes with your cardiovascular health, not to mention the PSSD fears and so on.

Also, you can't just take these medications forever, and when you do stop taking it, all of the symptoms come back, so what's the point? I feel like if I keep taking it, an anvil is over my head. When will it randomly stop working? Will these side effects go away after a couple of weeks or will I be stuck with some? Will tapering be impossible?

It doesn't feel like an actual solution, but a sick joke ""Here's what you would be like if you didn't have OCD, but it will only last for a short while""

When I perform ERP and am successful, it's entirely a good thing. There are no catches. I'll never not be able to touch a doorknob again, and it's because of ERP, not a pill. This just doesn't feel reliable at all. ERP feels 100% reliable. I've never gone back on something that I performed ERP on. With this pill, once it wears off, it's like I'm back to zero again."

And in the past some ppl have been told by their doctor(normal doctors aren‚Äôt trained to know anything about tics btw) that the stims are ‚Äúanxiety tics‚Äù or are caused by anxiety, which isn‚Äôt true.	i-fd-up	reply	na	na	na	0.9982030391693115	no	strong	no	na	anxiety	no prediction.

Basically, I‚Äôve had a cold since about Tuesday last week. Had to take a day off uni and rested all week, stayed home etc. However, I was still
doing about five hours of study each day when I probably should have been resting, causing the cold to linger longer than it should. It‚Äôs nothing terrible now, but still a sore throat, and REALLY bad brain fog/tension around the forehead. I‚Äôve been fisnlly getting on top of my anxiety for the first time in years, but this cold and the resulting fatigue is making me feel a bit dissasociated which is generally a huge anxiety trigger for me. 

Does anyone have any tips on how to get my mind and body to being back to ‚Äúnormal‚Äù? I haven‚Äôt been exercising much as a result of the cold but maybe I should go for a gentle run/walk tomorrow? 

Any advice is appreciated!"	mariedel123	post	32.54834664143501	female	White	0.9958567023277283	na	na	na	5	anxiety	no prediction.

"TW: mentions car accident

I‚Äôve been seeing this therapist for almost a year and while I really like speaking to her and think she typically gives good life/relationship advice, I don‚Äôt like some of her suggestions when it comes to handling anxiety and panic. 

She sometimes advises me to distract myself from negative thoughts and feelings as a last resort and I‚Äôve never found that to be helpful. I‚Äôve also been in a car accident and suffered injuries from it which has caused a ton of anxiety in the car and her advice moving forward is to just breathe and distract myself.

I know that most therapists aren‚Äôt there to actually help you get out of the cycle completely, but it bothers me to hear advice that I know for sure will only make things worst and keep me in the cycle.

How do I bring this up without sounding like an a-hole?? Should I speak to her about it or just look for a new therapist?"	Ilove_pancakesz	post	31.367948293870775	female	White	0.9993745684623718	na	na	na	14	anxiety	no prediction.
The distract yourself technique is a common anxiety coping strategy. So it‚Äôs not surprising that she is suggesting it to you. But if it doesn‚Äôt work for you, that‚Äôs okay. Just tell her you‚Äôve tried to do that and don‚Äôt find it helpful, so you need her to help you with other coping strategies. She won‚Äôt think you‚Äôre an asshole.

Therapy is a teamwork. Both sides have to be on the same level.

the ONLY Thing that helped me (car anxiety/agoraphobia) was forcing myself outside and into these situations. whether you like to hear this or not, i'm sorry. I Got to a point of being a shut in for 2 years. Then one day went outside to leave and immediately was hit with a sense of doom. then same thing multiple times a week to where I simply became afraid to leave my house. The only thing that worked ? Forcing myself. biting my tongue and going for it. after about 10-20 minutes in a car, a store or elsewhere in public and I felt a hell of a lot better. it sounds like her advice is good enough and if you enjoy talking to her, then tell her what advice you're having trouble with and she might be able to further you into a different goal sheet or something.

"I actually have no problem going out and into the car. I‚Äôve always forced myself to continue going out by car since the accident, even long road trips & I would even still be driving myself if I didn‚Äôt lose my car in the process, but what seems to be the problem is that I experience uncontrollable anxiety, panic, & intrusive thoughts the entire ride and it affects the driver sometimes as well with me constantly flinching and bracing. I just feel that while distracting myself does help to calm me in the moment (because I‚Äôm not paying attention to what‚Äôs going on) I‚Äôm afraid of becoming reliant on distractions. I feel like it isn‚Äôt helpful long-term.

I generally always have the feeling of horror figure to be watched and that felt like such a figure was right at me and would look over me. I have panicked for minutes scanning the back of my head and my back, pulling on my shirt hoping it would go away but it stayed for a good 15-20 minutes.

The more you force yourself to be away from them, the more you will be ok with it. With anxiety, we have to make ourselves do the things that make us anxious in order to work through that anxiety.

"So I've been dealing with anxiety a while but the last 1-2 weeks have seen to be the worst in a while. Not this past weekend but the weekend prior I hit a deer with my car and messed up my hood, no problem. Then I had a girl whom we were talking pretty well and everything seemed fine until she ghosted me, then I accidentally overdrew my account and can't cover shit till Friday. It all added up to today, where I had a panic attack on the way to work today then while at work I just couldn't stop shaking, feeling anxious, worried and I felt another attack coming so I asked to go home early since we were already over staffed for the day and I was the first one there so it wasn't a problem. I got in my car and drove home, when I got home I crawled in bed and just started tearing up. I've been crying on and off ever since and I've been talking with myself, trying to hype myself up or something cause I've never felt so depressed and anxious before. 

I usually keep my anxiety and stuff under control. Today idk felt like the straw that broke the camels back I guess and I just broke down and couldn't continue. I used to see a therapist last year but I felt he was not offering good advice and since it was a 'short-term' clinic that was provided through my school I didn't think it was for me as i'd like to see a therapist long term, but after today I seriously need to see someone.

About 4 weeks ago now, i had a week long period of hell. ER 3 times, multiple panic attacks a day, constant feeling of ‚Äúsensations‚Äù (chest, tingling burning all over body, couldn‚Äôt eat, couldn‚Äôt sleep, racing heart, dizziness, ect.). I don‚Äôt know what caused it, or why it lasted that long, but 4 weeks later i‚Äôm still terrified of falling back into whatever the fuck that was. My doctor put me on some medications that i reacted horribly to, and when i told the doctor/office, they told me to continue taking it. To continue taking the medication that made me hallucinate, shake and cry in bed for 12 hrs straight. At that moment i lost all trust in the healthcare system, cancelled my appointments and decided to raw dog this anxiety. Every day since this week long ‚Äúepisode‚Äù i have been having a really hard time suppressing the thoughts of ‚Äúwhat if that happens again?‚Äù ‚Äúi can‚Äôt handle that again‚Äù. I am genuinely terrified of what happened that week and it‚Äôs haunting me. How can i let this go? Does anyone else go through this/has anyone else gone through this?

it was citalopram and hydroxyzine. i‚Äôm so traumatized by medications that i think they do more harm than good to me. i was given ativan at the ER and that also made it much worse. i use insurance from the state so it limits me to one doctors office in my area, and they disregarded everything i was feeling and treated me like a psycho pretty much, so i‚Äôm just discouraged to go through them for anything at this point. i tried to contact multiple therapists that take my insurance but they are multiple year waiting lists. thank you for your advice though, i‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre going through this.

You are not alone. The doctors were very unprofessional with you but not all doctors are that way, most aren't. I currently take SSRIs for my anxiety, not sure if they help but they don't make my anxiety worse (I think). I may need to change to something else. Just because some medication doesn't work for you doesn't mean none will help. Keep trying to get into a clinician and find a better doctor. You will get better.

"There is no ""certification"" you need other than a document from a provider that your dog is an ESA. Don't pay anybody anything. Also be aware of limitations and changing laws around ESAs in your area. My dog is documented as one but as a renter I make sure to talk to the leasing office about her and make sure they won't give me any funny business. If you have a dog where they don't want one you are putting a target on your back for problems with neighbors and management. And just remember, ESAs don't get special training or pass specific tests so they don't have other special priveleges outside of the housing accommodations. Always be a responsible pet owner.

It may be difficult but first go see your PCP and see if you can find a clinician through them. Your doctor may prescribe a SSRI which is the safest anti-anxiety medication on the market so you have something that may help until you see a therapist. Then they can adjust your medication to see what helps while doing the therapy. There is no shame in doing any of these things, it doesn't make you weak and you may end up not needing drugs after a while.

"I start university in 2 weeks and I've never been more anxious in my life. I'm so scared of the unknown factor. My whole life, I've tried so hard to make everyone happy and proud by overworking myself to get the best grades. Obviously, I didnt always have the best grades, but in highschool, I started to get the best in the class. But, university is different. It's hard, and I shouldnt expect myself to be perfect because its gonna be hard. But I'm terrified that I'm just going to dissapoint my teachers and my family. This isnt a family issue though, I have the most amazing parents on earth and they've supported me through a lot. It's just my brain telling me theyll be mad if I'm not perfect. 

I'm also changing work places because my current work place makes me feel worthless. Customers are rude, and my manager tries to humiliate me. I'm scared that my new workplace will be the same, but I think I'll be happier. I'll be working in a pet store, its something I think I'll love. But, since I havent started, obviously it makes me anxious.

All of this has caused me to spiral before it all starts. I wanted to start this school year with the best mindset possible, but I've over thought it so much that I'm not at all confident.

You need to talk to your parents and ask them to let you see a therapist or a psychiatrist. A therapist can teach you ways to mitigate your anxiety at school. A psychiatrist can prescribe something to make the anxiety less intense like lorazepam or Lamictal. Ideally you should do both at the same time. The medication makes the anxiety less intense, which makes the tools you use to overcome it easier to master, then you can slowly reduce the medication as you get better and better at handling anxiety on your own. If you don't think your parents are approachable, talk to a school counselor. If money is an issue, there are free clinics in every major city in the US, as well as clinics that offer sliding scale rates. You don't have to suffer through this.

"Hi friends,

I don't know what to do, but I feel like I had my 2nd panic attack today. And I am scared as hell about them.

Each time I feel like totally loosing control and passing out immediately. I feel the need to hold myself onto a table or my chair to not fall from it. My hands become sweaty and tremble massively. My chest feels like it's going to explode. Like a blast getting bigger and bigger while it surges from my belly over my chest to my neck. I also feel an intense heartbeat rate. Like it becomes uncontrollable for me to manage and I fear the worst.

That happened to me twice. The first time I was shocked massively by imminent danger and I sprinted up four floors to run away from said danger. My heartbeat felt like 300 or 400 at that time and then the symptoms described above hit me completely. It was months ago.

  
Today I was under immense pressure due to a decision that was to be taken by somebody. All of the above happened again while awaiting the decision's result, despite my heartbeat might have not been that high, but still it felt very fast.

 I don't know what to do or how to cope with this, because I really feel like ok this is it now. I think it helps to write it up, I guess. Maybe someone knows what I am talking about.

"Therapy is the best option. Usually panic attacks could lead to a fear of fear and panic disorder.

I've had hundreds, first of all they are nothing to fear as hard as that may seem. You already know how bad they feel but nothing you think could happen will.

Next time you have a panic attack, try to remember that there's nothing to fear you're not going to pass out or all the bad things you're thinking. They're harmless and just accept that you're having one."	Melodic_Travel5148	reply	na	na	na	0.995438277721405	weak	strong	no	na	anxiety	no prediction.

"I have been experiencing an odd physical symptom paired with intense stress/anxiety and I‚Äôm curious if anyone else has had it too. 

For the past 8 months or so I have been feeling this pressure on my soft pallet and sometimes also on my tongue. I‚Äôve been searching the internet to try and find a cause but I can‚Äôt find anything that sounds like what I‚Äôm experiencing. It‚Äôs not a pain feeling, it‚Äôs literally just pressure, as if something is pressing up on the roof of my mouth and down on my tongue. When I‚Äôm having this feeling (it comes and goes but is present for at least part of the day every day) I also feel very stressed and anxious. Sometimes the anxiety can be tied to triggers in my life but a lot of the time it‚Äôs not. I‚Äôve never had anxiety present itself in this way physically, it just started happening one day and will not go away. I recently had a CT scan done of my face/sinuses because I felt like there could be something wrong but it came back normal.

I just need to vent. First, about me, I'm (29 F) I work full time in community mental health and part time in private practice as a therapist for adults. I'm moving over to the practice full time in October which I know will make a huge difference for me, because I am beginning to loathe my community job. I stress about money constantly, but again I'm gonna be making more come October so I'm trying to keep it together until then. For as long as I can remember I've delt with anxiety symptoms, specifically nausea/vomiting, knots in my stomach, feeling tired, etc. I've been on 50mg of Zoloft since 2021 and just increased to 75mg because I can't take it anymore. I also have a small amount of Xanax that I'm allowed to take as needed but I don't feel comfortable taking it when I'm not home, (I'm afraid of looking spacy/sleepy in my sessions and I don't want to risk it). When I'm working with my clients 1:1 I feel great. It's a ton of work but I really enjoy the practice and the practice only. The community job is getting toxic, and I am literally counting the seconds until I leave. The bummer is that they've dumped a bunch of work on me since they know I'm leaving, and they're pissed I'm not renewing my contract. It's not my fault you guys can't pay me...  anyway... I am just soooo over the dull stomach cramps. I hate it. I never have an appetite so I gotta force food down. The only decent non expensive food options by the community office are subway and chipotle.. or the goddamn grocery store. My body dysmorphia has been bubbling to the surface since I'm refusing to eat or opting to have a cigarette and a latte for lunch. It sucks sucks sucks. I just want to work in a place where I feel valued and can help people without having a panic attack and dry heaves.

I have major health anxiety around stomach issues due to multiple traumatic food poisoning incidents in the past. At the beginning of September, I‚Äôm traveling with my friend to a country without food safety regulations or safe water. We‚Äôll be staying with her family two hours outside of a major city and will be eating over there most of the trip. Refusing food is culturally insensitive and I would never want to offend someone but I don‚Äôt know what to do. My immune system is down due to overly sanitizing things and only eating packaged or fast food for the past year due to my anxiety and eating disorders.

So in my sophomore year someone in my class showed me a gore video (as a lot of teenagers do) which led to me passing out in the middle of class. Probably my most embarassing moment. I've had numerous times where I've came across a gore video or something similar at home, but it's just made me anxious (like a normal person) and not lightheaded. However, any time someone mentions something a little gorey, I get a sudden burst of anxiety that makes me terrified I'll pass out. This has lead to me almost passing out again, which I doubt would happen without this fear of passing out. I think it's gotten better over the past year, but is there any way I can not be terrified of this happening and move on when someone mentions something gruesome?

I had my first tooth extraction today (2nd last molar on bottom right). Im not really scared of dentists or the procedure but what I am terrified of is me messing up the healing process. Im terrified of the idea of messing up the blood clot, barely managed to eat some soup out of fear of doing something wrong. I ended up crying because I read it can take months to heal and ive barely managed a single day. I mainly just want to get to the point that the bloodclot/hole is covered and I cant do anything myself that could mess it up. Im worried about sneezing, coughing, eating, sleeping ect. My paranoia gets really bad when something can only be messed up by me and this is my first ever dental/physical recovery, ive never broken a bone or anything. This was mostly to rant but if anyone can help reassure me ill be thankful because im losing my mind.

I had a similar experience to you 6 months ago. Had my molar tooth extracted which left a pretty large hole in the side of my cheek. First day I found to be the worst. Extraction area was really sore and my cheek was swollen, so I could barely talk. My paranoid self thought it was a great idea to write everything down for the rest of the day instead of actually talking to people. Looking back now that measure seems extreme because I ended up bleeding on my pillow during the night anyway. Dentist said this was a normal thing to be expected for the first night or so. He said as long as you're keeping your mouth clean with corsodyl spray, salt water, and brushing its going to heal up nicely. 6 months later my mouth is all healed.

"Hello, I'm 3 weeks post top right wisdom tooth extraction. Weeks leading up to my appointment had me in near constant anxiety attacks, the whole 9 yards. Terrible experience compared to the actual procedure and taking care of my new hole afterwards. I was so worried about not having general anesthesia. But when the day came they just numbed me up and had the damn tooth out in like 3 mins maybe less lol. No pain during but some pain after for the first couple days. The hard part was just getting the clot to form the day of extraction, ended up biting down on a wet teabag to get it done. Didn't really brush my teeth the first couple days and only chewed on my other side once I was able to eat harder foods. Keeping food out of the hole was just very gently swishing some salt water and letting the water fall out of my mouth instead of spitting.

If you are not bleeding much (some red saliva is normal the first couple days or so) then the clot is intact. Just be conscious of sneezing, not spitting, don't use a straw etc and you will be fine. A dry socket is painful but isn't very common. After a week or less I was able to do normal mouth things. I still get food in the hole but a little rinse takes care of it. You may not fully heal for many weeks or months (everyone is different) but the clot only needs to be there for like a week or 2 by then the bone has some tissue coverage and isn't in danger of a dry socket.

In which case its healing pretty quick I think. Still getting bouts of anxiety especially when there is pain because its makes me more aware of the gap.

"Does Seroquel (quetiapine) ever cause people to behave more aggressively as a side effect?

Yes.

Aggressiveness, anger or rage, violence, and homocidality or suicidality more specifically are all troubling risks of antipsychotics, including Seroquel (quetiapine). Systematic study has not been done into exactly how often these effects happen, particularly in ‚Äòreal life‚Äô populations where polydrugging, off-label prescribing, and chronic use are the norm rather than messy research factors to try controlling around.

‚ÄúAggression‚Äù is regarded by the manufacturer as one of the most common drug effects per their highly limited studies, and it can also result from other, compound drug effects like ‚Äúmania‚Äù. Additional common drug effects like apathy, akathisia, restlessness, and irritability can sometimes give rise to or worsen expressions of aggression, too.

Aggression, violence, or related effects are very common during active use, but can also be part of discontinuation effects‚Äîwithdrawal symptoms, rebound symptoms, or a central nervous system stress syndrome. Even if a drug is reduced gradually, such effects are quite often encountered by patients and can last minutes, days, weeks, months, or years.

"For my first session my therapist just asked a lot of questions. I always feel anxious before a call until I realize she's a professional and she guides the conversation. I don't have to be prepared in any way because she asks questions and I answer.

The first session the therapist may just ask about your home life, your work, your family, just to get an idea about you as a person. They may ask what you're hoping to get out of therapy. 

The nice thing is all you have to do is bring yourself."	jfjksndbxxkxlcbflfjf	reply	na	na	na	0.0193785410374403	no	strong	no	na	anxiety	no prediction.

I was scared too. I suffered for five years until I finally gave in. My psych recommended Prozac and we start at a very low dose and worked our way up. I never had any side effects. None.

Sometimes, I get wrapped up in the idea that my anxiety is terminal and I will never overcome it.  But then I remind myself that I have made strides, even if they‚Äôre small.

"10 years ago I was 17 and anxiety wasn‚Äôt really an issue for me. It ramped up around 5-6 years ago and got super bad when the pandemic started. I was afraid to even be a passenger in a car for a few months but I slowly got over that. 
I used to drive everywhere, I loved road trips and I would drive to clear my head. January of 2020 was the last time I drove on the highway.

I used to live in a neighborhood that had a grocery store just around the corner so I could at least do that on my own but now we live off a main road with 55MPH speeds so I just drive my son to the playground at the end of our neighborhood.

All of that to say, my anxiety never let me get bloodwork done. I was so so so anxious about needles (still kind of am tbh) but as soon as I got pregnant I HAD to face that fear.

"Not be freaked out by change! 

I've been with my company for 10 years this year and I was so scared and awkward and weird. 
Now I just own the weirdness. 

I've been in 3 stores, I've done 4 different departments and also head office and I just get better everyday. I've even applied for a health and safety role recently to expand my responsibilities - something I absolutely never would have done 10 years ago. 

Even just 4 years ago, we moved cities and I transferred with my company. I was brave and got a promotion etc, but then they gave that job to someone else. 

So I transferred again to another site, stating that I didn't want to work at that one because they didn't value me and that was so so hard. I sat in my car and cried almost everyday before and after my shifts. 
Now, I've been at the new site just over 3 years and I love it. It took guts to stand up for myself and I am really proud of that.

"Dude! I‚Äôm similar to you in age (turning 28 in a week) and I recently also randomly developed the fear (which would lead into insane panic attacks) from driving on the freeway and even be a passenger in a car. I related so hard to this because I too used to LOVE driving and would drive everywhere, to clear my head just like you mentioned. I used to be the friend that would drive everyone everywhere and thoroughly enjoyed it. From the sound of it I think you and I randomly developed anxiety/panic right around the same time‚Ä¶mine also started during/little bit after the pandemic. 

In the past month or so I‚Äôve gotten a little better with driving on streets with lights but still haven‚Äôt mustered up the courage to hit a highway. Hoping I‚Äôll be able too soon. I randomly feel lightheaded when I drive and that becomes me spiraling into a fear of having a panic attack while driving which leads into thinking I‚Äôll lose control of the car and die. I‚Äôve had to pull over even a few times when driving and panic when I can‚Äôt locate a curb to pull over just incase (completely irrational.) 

You made me feel a lot better knowing I‚Äôm not crazy and others have the same issue.  Wishing you the very best, just know this won‚Äôt last forever and make sure you celebrate the little strides you make.

"I started talk therapy when I was in my 30's. I would recommend starting earlier if at all possible. It took about five years for us to dial in my medications, and about seven of talk therapy before I could really avoid obnoxious drunkenness. As I' live in a state where pot is legal, I find about 5mg can really help take the edge off.

I also use an app named Sunnyside. It helps me track my alcohol intake. When I forget how much or how quickly I'm drinking, ugly things happen. 

More than anything, I realized I didn't want to be ""that guy."" That mean spirited drunk didn't represent me. Truly demonstrating who I am means distancing myself from that guy, same way I would from a toxic, long term friend. Figuring out who I am and how I wanted to present myself helped me make the biggest step away from over indulging.

Being kind to yourself also helps. You will drink too much again. Reflect honestly on what happened and examine the triggers, then move on.

"What works for some, may not work for all but I was black out drink for a good solid 6-8 months in my youth. Gave myself Jaundice from drinking so much and my doctor said I would die within the year if I didn't stop. 

I'm 5""3 and (back then, was) 50kg (110lbs) soaking wet. 
I was chugging maybe 12-15 beers a night and then some. 

I went totally sober cold turkey for a long time and nowadays I can have a couple of drinks but I rarely if ever get drunk. 

What worked for me:
Slowing down. When you got that nice buzz of tipsy, switch off the alcohol. Go to water, sodas etc. 
For every alcoholic drink, take 2 other drinks before your next, it'll also help with hangovers!

Switch the group you hang with. Hanging out with the nerdy guys at the party playing board games in the kitchen gets you so distracted you don't even notice you're not drinking

Offer to be the designated for your friends if you drive! 

The thing that really, really helped me stop was leaving my partner at the time who was also alcoholic. It's was a shame and one of the harder things I've had to do in life, but the entire relationship was toxic at the time."

I was 18 when I got my drivers license and I am now 25. The best advice I have to give is: start with small trips in an area that you know well and isn‚Äôt very crowded. Practice the things you find difficult like parking for example in an empty parking lot so you have space and time to learn. Maybe take someone (if you feel comfortable) who is relaxed with driving and has experience.

short answer - exposure. i suffered from emetophobia that controlled my life for 10+ years off and on. i was pregnant twice throughout and never threw up, and then my third pregnancy was just different. it‚Äôs made me throw up a handful of times and i started to realize that throwing up is gross, and unpleasant, but it‚Äôs quick and harmless. but it didn‚Äôt matter how many people told me that, i had to be exposed to it to really get it.

"I also get a little lightheaded when driving (probably anxiety building up).

"Same here!! This actually happened to me earlier tonight. I had to take some clothes to a dry cleaner which was 18 mins away (using streets of course lol) and I felt okay since I‚Äôve been feeling better while driving lately and I felt a minor panic attack coming on at a red light. Agreed with you it is soooo random. Something about just sitting there waiting for the light to change, i feel like i need to move and I‚Äôm just stopped. And once i start driving i feel the need to pull over and panic if i can‚Äôt. It‚Äôs. So. Weird. 

So crazy that I found someone with the same type of anxiety/panic I experience to the T. The ‚Äústuck‚Äù feeling is also a huge trigger for me, that‚Äôs why I hate planes too. The turbulence isn‚Äôt as triggering as the thought of not being able to get off the plane for however many hours. 

I‚Äôm not taking any meds. I occasionally take valerian root supplement if I feel my anxiety skyrocket, helps a little but doesn‚Äôt do much. I‚Äôve also noticed that taking magnesium before I sleep helps too (i sometimes suffer from debilitating morning anxiety) I‚Äôve been recommended propranolol and Xanax before but it‚Äôs just not my thing. I know others have their opinions and I‚Äôm sure some meds really work wonders for many, i just have an extremely addictive personally and I‚Äôm afraid of being hooked. My anxiety over the potential side effects of non anxiety pills also plays a role ü§£

I will say compared to 2/3 years ago, I feel like I‚Äôve progressed towards the better. Back then I thought I was losing my mind, I landed myself in the ER multiple times because i was convinced i was dying of a heart attack. They gave me a Valium and sent me on my way (followed by the best sleep of my life) now I‚Äôm able to identify triggers and remind myself I‚Äôm healthy physically and it‚Äôs just my anxiety acting up.

‚Äúwrite out a detailed story about their death scene (e.g., their children and relatives surrounding their bedside, the immediate aftermath of their death). Whatever the focus is, I then have them audio-record their written story and play it for themselves at least once per day. Note that it is important that your imaginal story is tailored to your own specific fears and triggers or pressure points. It needs to be detailed and vivid so it can feel as real as possible. Often, my clients feel immense anxiety and/or sadness while writing out the detailed story and perhaps the first couple of times they listen to the audio recording.

I don't have a ton of experience. I've just tapered off Lexapro 20mg to Paxel 10mg myself. My anxiety symptoms are the same but it may be weeks before I see a change if any. I sometimes feel off balance and I sweat profusely sometimes like at night in bed, but mine are hot flashes and it's hard to tell if it's my anxiety or the new meds.

Use this moment, as your rock bottom moment. 

Self reflect. Be as honest as you can about your life and your past. Write it all down if it helps. 

Feel it. Your pain, your regret, your self loathing. 

And then let it all go. 

I know this is easier said then done. But the past is gone. Can‚Äôt change it. All you can do is move forward. Slowly. One step at a time. 

Focus on your successes now. You have a few good friends and a fiance. Sounds like you are a nice person who brings joy to other people in your life. Also, I am sure there are others out there, many others, that would trade their lives with yours in a second to have what you have. 

I see you have 20k in debt, which quite frankly, is probably most of us in todays day and age. This can go away too over time, either up front with a debt consolidation loan or by slowly chipping away at it.

"A few years ago I felt exactly like you. I had (and still have but managed) a severe general anxiety disorder. I wasn't able to do anything or feel any joy at all because everything was triggering and scary and I had panic attacks ever day. my days were work -> home and panic -> obsessive cleaning -> drinking. I also wondered if this would just be my life for ever and if it might not be easier to just go. 

But here I am now. I went to therapy. It got better. It got a little worse and got better again. I have it under control mostly. I still have anxiety disorder, it won't go away but I learned how to handle it. I can be happy again. I can feel joy and let loose. I moved to my dream town, started online uni and just bought a house with my partner.

If I left I would have missed all of this and I am so grateful I am here to experience it. I know it's hard. I know it feels impossible right now to ever feel any different.

The problem with modern society is that it insists we have to have all the answers, right now. On top of that, we must provide value. Except modern society completely strayed away from what's actually valuable - which is the stuff *you're* doing. 

Something that always helped me was this: nature requires only two things of us: to survive, and to procreate. That's it. Everything else is superfluous. Life defines itself *by* itself. It doesn't need to justify it. It just is. 

As for the procreation, eh, with an overcrowded planet, *not* procreating is the healthier choice. So you're surviving, which is all we're biologically expected to do. If you're also watching badass Netflix shows, that's a bonus. The key thing is the alive bit. Not the productivity. Not the 'worth as dictated by society.'

"TLDR im too anxious to quit my job and i need to help me hype me up lol.

Im working temporarily at a Grocery store as a cashier and I absolutely hate it. It's boring, my feet hurt and the pay is low. The manager offered me a position in the back for more money 7 to 2 pm for a few months to cover for maternity leave but it keeps getting pushed back. I feel like they know I want to quit and they are dangling it. 

I have a few opportunities coming up for some gig jobs (music venue, bartending at football games and a Halloween seasonal thing) I prefer working in this way cuz it's variation and the pay is better. 

I'm super anxious and a people pleaser. They are extremely short staffed and I feel like I want to throw up when I see the manager and want to tell them I'm quitting. I have no idea why it's a legitimately awful job. Help.

"Hey Reddit.

I (29m) have a job interview in 3 days and I'm panicking.

I've been at my job now for 7 years, but I'm needing to make a switch for my mental health.

The interview I have is for a job that will probably make a little less, but will be 5 minutes from home (opposed to the 45 I'm driving now). I'll be able to be close to my family and I'll be saving a ton on gas. It seems like I'd really enjoy the job too. It's different and intriguing. 

Deep down I know that this change would most likely but a good thing, but there are so many ""whats-ifs"" that keep popping up in my mind.

I wish I could not have panic attacks with changes like this. It's also been a long time since I've had an interview for anywhere so that's adding to it."	FluffyBrewbs	post	25.30010865897603	female	White	0.9934682846069336	na	na	na	1	anxiety	no prediction.
"Is it just that you haven't interviewed for a long time?  Or are there other reasons to panic?  You feel you're not qualified?  Overqualified?  Not the exact fit for the position?

I was ready to cancel an interview because I didn't think I was qualified at the last minute.  I talked to a friend who told me, ""don't tell yourself 'no', let someone else tell you 'no'.""  I went to the interview.  Now I've been a network engineer for a hospital for 15+ years.  I almost told myself no.

Think about the position.  Remember why you applied.  Regardless of drive time, something about it intrigued you.  Embrace that intrigue.  Be curious.  Show them you're interested.  Let it happen.  See how it plays out.  You might get it, you might not, but if you don't go to the interview at all, you definitely won't get it.  Life is about trying new things.  Give it a try.  Be polite.  Thank them for the time and the interview.  Take a moment to ponder the question and think of an answer; you don't have to blurt out the first thing that comes to mind.

"Every time I express that I'm terrified of getting drugged via food/drinks, touching surfaces, etc. I Almost always get told ""listen, drugs are expensive. No one is going to go through the trouble of getting them and then waste them on someone else."" I fucking hate when people say that shit. So many of my friends got dosed in high school by their ""friends"" because they thought it would be funny to make them trip balls, and they were broke teenage kids. I know of people who have gotten ""acid slapped"" at a music festival because some dickheads think that everyone at these events *want* to be high like they are. They think they're ""blessing them."" So money isn't really the issue, it's that shitty people exist that do shitty things all the time **and I'm afraid of that.**

Is my fear realistic? Not really. I have severe OCD so I definitely take this fear to extremes, but when people tell me it's ""never going to happen"" it's insulting and minimizing. I *personally* know someone that is now schizophrenic and a shell of his former self following psychedelic drug use. I've seen countless videos like ""watch me give my mom shroom chocolate. HILARIOUS REACTION!!"" and shit like that. I've read stories where people make brownies for a group of people in the same container they stored their LSD in and the entire party got high by accident. 

I'm afraid, deeply horribly afraid, but I'm not *stupid.* These things happen all the time, my problem isn't that idk if it *can* happen because I know for a fact that it fucking does. My problem is that I don't know how to go on with my life and go out to eat, go to people's houses, etc and not be crippled by fear that I'm going to get drugged or high somehow."

"Well, I'm not going to dismiss your fear.  You are perfectly correct that it could happen to you. It could also happen to me.

However, the chances of it happening to you is slim to none.  Yes, they do happen. They do not happen ""all the time"", as you claim.  It would be on every news channel, touted as a national or worldwide epidemic, like looting stores.  I've read stories of people being hit by lightning, so that could also happen to me or you..... but it's not likely. In fact, it's still very rare. even with a few stories about it every year.

Good example - lightning.  What could one do to minimize the possibility?  Don't go running around in a field, in the middle of a lightning storm, right?  There are also things you can do to minimized your chances of getting dosed. If you go to a festival, don't take food or water, or whatever, from strangers.

If you are afraid of your friends and family, that they would maliciously dose you with psychedelic drugs, you may need to change friends or stay away from your family, but it could also be paranoia.

While getting doused without your knowledge is a real, yet rare, occurrence, it should not panic you everyday and make you afraid of going outside of your house and do things. That's your OCD in high gear. I would recommend getting help..... & I hope better days ahead for you."	Baby-Snoopy	reply	na	na	na	0.9971511960029602	weak	no	no	na	anxiety	no prediction.

you could also look into the substances to know what they do so that you get a feeling of how dangerous they are. especially acid is regarded as one of the safest drugs there is by several different studies, anecdotic evidence of you knowing a guy who overdid it with acid does not change the facts."

However, few days ago my right ear started ringing randomly a bit longer than usual and then went away but now I‚Äôm obsessing over it. I can‚Äôt focus on anything but ringing in my ears which has made it even louder and now I‚Äôm worrying if it‚Äôs just me being anxious or if it‚Äôs actually loud ringing. I was never a fan of loud things and never been to concerts. It‚Äôs like all my other worries are gone and my brain is just fixated on this one thing. I plug my ears but don‚Äôt hear any loud ringing just muffled noises. Idk what to do and am getting increasingly worried :/	yayeet212223	post	33.210042619695315	female	White	0.998261034488678	na	na	na	2	anxiety	no prediction.
My tinnitus gets louder when I have anxiety. Focusing on it increases my anxiety and increases the perceived noise, it's a feedback loop. You can get tested to see if there is a diagnosable cause. It may not be related to your anxiety. Anxiety often causes us to fixate on bodily sensations, it's quite common and something you can work on. Medication may help with anxiety and may lessen your fixation and of course therapy can help.	yayeet212223	reply	na	na	na	0.998261034488678	no	strong	no	na	anxiety	no prediction.
"TL;DR: From someone going through very similar for 2 years now, I reccommend focusing on the present and NOT worrying about the past or future. For as bad as tinnitus is known to get, it can always be manageable and you are never alone. 

r/tinnitus is a great community where those going through similar symptoms help each other sort through emotions, doubts and causes.

I've worried about tinnitus since my first encounter with it at age 8 (22m). Since, it's only ever persisted for days and that was back in 2016 when i used earphones alot. For the past year going on 2, I've worried constantly. I'll close my ears with my fingers to really hone in on even the slightest sign, thinking it wouldn't go away anymore. 

I made the world seem like a very scary place to me because I allowed my fear of tinnitus to choose whether I'd ever live normally or not.  

However, now that I've developed health anxiety with far worse symptoms, I've realized worrying is only doing myself in. Never been to, and I dont plan on going to an audiologist. Last ER visit I had was a month ago, and although coming back negative for anything, I've developed my doubts. However, since I cant and aint planning on going back by my own accord, I'm choosing to slowly overcome health anxiety. 

Ultimately, please do not worry yourself sick. Find joy in what/who you normally would. Tinnitus isn't always permanent or caused by irreversible damage. It is often times earwax, a usually completely harmless quirk having to do with your jaw/neck composition. The community I mentioned has resoruces to reference, but never self-diagnose. I reccommend staying calm and positive. 

I really hope I helped, if you have any questions/confusions on anything I said please feel free to reach out to me."	yayeet212223	reply	na	na	na	0.998261034488678	weak	strong	no	na	anxiety	ethnicity: unknown, age: 22, gender: male, explanation: the author identifies himself as a 22 year old male ('22m'). his ethnicity is not mentioned or suggested in the text.

"28 (F). Ive had heavy periods majority of my life (thanks mom and grandma lol). In 2017 I started BC pills. I switched a few until about 2019-2020 when I found a really good one that stopped my spotting in between cycles. It was still a bit heavy at first but then started getting lighter and shorter. Recently (2 months), I signed up for conditioning training at a sports facility. I go three times a week and do HIIT workouts and strength training. I also modified my diet starting mid July. My last period was manageable and not heavy ish (more medium). Now I just started my period again (yesterday), and usually the next day is heavy in the mornings after sleeping, but today it wasnt.. Im a huge hypochondriac so now im just googling things but im just wondering if any of what I started doing had an impact. Mind you, it's also only 7 am where i am so it may get medium later on. I did have mood swings during PMS (theyre always so bad), and i have very minimal cramping and bloating now.

Nurse here, HIIT training is intense and great workout so kudos to you.

"I've been feeling heart palpitations for 2 years now. I've been to a cardiologist and have been diagnosed with benign pac's (ectopic beats) which feel like your heart skips a beat. Anything from 1 to 300 per day. I've been assured that these things are completely benign and that I can do anything I want to do.

Sadly I am still anxious about them. I avoid certain situations bc I am afraid I will get palpitations and I am afraid of exercising. Every time I look online I read people who are afraid of these things which also doesn't really help (even though I completely get it!).

So I was wondering if there are people who have overcome their anxiety about these things or if you know people who are not afraid of them.

"Hi, I was afraid of developing cancers and degenerative diseases. It's the same principle. 

The way it works is, it's all coming from being too uncomfortable with uncertainty, leading to constant reassurance seeking and avoidance of triggers. And by doing that, you keep feeding it. 

To get better, you need to stop with it, resist reassurance seeking and don't avoid anything purely because of the fears. This way it'll be scary at first, but pretty soon it'll start improving."	santas_number1elf	reply	na	na	na	0.013961701653897762	no	strong	no	na	anxiety	no prediction.

Can't really recommend a specific brand sorry. With other supplements, it's the same thing, depends what you're not getting enough of. Overall it's good for anxiety to simply be healthy and physically active. So not just eat healthy food but also avoid unhealthy food.

"Same boat as you. Bought a house recently and it just made my anxiety really really bad. I have GAD so I guess random things will make me very anxious and it's not specifically health anxiety.

Here are a few things that might make it easier to think about the house?

1. You have a place to call your own now! No landlord kicking you out, increasing the rent to absurd amount and all that. There will be a sense of permanency that will really help your anxiety too. I used to get very anxious everytime I moved and I am glad to get that behind me. 

2. Build up an emergency fund that specifically for your house payments? If anything happens you can always sell! The emergency fund will help smooth things over the time it takes to sell the house. For example, my target is a six month emergency fund. 

3. Buying a house is a big milestone and won't keep coming in life. So celebrate it? Let the anxiety return later but today, let's celebrate? Just to acknowledge the positive emotions you have about the house. Even in the catastrophic thinking scenario where you lose the house later down the line, the memory of having celebrated it is something no one can take from you."

im not really sure whats wrong with me. lately my anxiety has gotten worse but nonetheless i‚Äôd say i‚Äôve been productive. sometimes i work on schoolwork all day just to distract myself from getting anxious and it works, which is good. so i haven‚Äôt had issues with concentration (which i usually do). the only problem is that i have no appetite whatsoever. nothing sounds appetizing and there are times where i am hungry but when i think of eating literally anything it just gets ruined and my appetite goes away that easily and quickly. i‚Äôve been eating barely one meal a day, i tried eating chicken and rice today but could only get two bites in until i felt full and couldn‚Äôt eat anymore. my old favorite foods don‚Äôt even make me excited or sound yummy anymore. and then when i try to go to sleep, i cant. and if i do sleep at a reasonable hour, i‚Äôll wake up a couple hours later and i wont be able to fall back to sleep. i don‚Äôt go on my phone either, i laid in the dark with my eyes closed for at least an hour and i still couldnt get myself to fall asleep. last night i got about 4 hours of sleep and felt so tired all throughout the day and was so excited to get rest but when i went to lay down to finally get sleep i can‚Äôt even fall asleep. i‚Äôm frustrated with my physical health right now because i‚Äôve recently gotten into a healthier mindset despite my anxiety and i feel like all of this is setting me back and i‚Äôm not sure what to do :( any tips and/or advice would be really appreciated	k1ssitoffme	post	15.397266775733174	female	White	0.9994767308235168	na	na	na	1	anxiety	no prediction.
I'd say that the best thing to do is see a doctor asap. A doctor can rule out any medical issues that could be causing these symptoms. And if there is nothing medical, it is likely caused by anxiety, and you should benefit from medication as not eating or sleeping like this will take a toll on you quickly, and you should be treated asap.	k1ssitoffme	reply	na	na	na	0.9994767308235168	weak	no	no	na	anxiety	no prediction.

Not finishing one thought before another arrives and takes you off on a tangent.	Successful-Power-162	reply	na	na	na	0.9992774128913879	no	strong	no	na	anxiety	no prediction.
It could be that also. They only way to know would be to try a medication for ADD. I was prescribed adderall for 8 years but I was using it for the wrong reasons and quit two years ago. A couple months later I developed anxiety. I refuse to go back on it though. Not sure if that‚Äôs why I have anxiety now though because there are several other culprits. I believe with new pathways being formed in the brain, anything can be fixed. For you, I would recommend CBT.

"I can confirm this is definitely some anxiety symptom.

Moreover I have racing thoughts - like forced intrusive thoughts that are also half processed, there might be 20 or even more different thoughts per minute, thinking about thinking about thinking and then overanalysing objects, things around me, my thinking, why did I think about that.. it really makes me panic so bad! 

I will sound cliche but I would advise you to see a therapist.

I‚Äôm just afraid that because adhd can cause anxiety that somehow my adhd maybe created a thought that can never be explained and that makes me panic so much.

This may be long so bear with me, but I would really appreciate some input and advice. 

Two weeks ago I started cymbalta 20mg once a day, I was taking it at night at first but then I stopped sleeping after the 2nd night, and started taking it at 9:30 am. Well, I am still having trouble sleeping. Like, I won‚Äôt sleep at all type shit. When I saw my dr she told me she wants me to take the 20mg twice a day, and gave me hydroxyzine to help me sleep. Well, the hydroxyzine worked the first couple of days, and then kept me awake all night feeling drugged up. I have yet to start taking the full 40mg of cymbalta, mostly because I‚Äôm afraid of side effects. But because I am not sleeping, my anxiety and panic attacks have started to come back, so I WANT to up my dosage for that reason alone. I have tried taking melatonin to help me sleep and even if I do sleep, the whole next day I‚Äôm so tired and out of it that I can‚Äôt function. I‚Äôm just really suffering right now and I don‚Äôt know what to do. 

So my question is, has anyone taken cymbalta twice a day? 40mg? Has it worked out for you? I know everyone is different but god I just need some sleep"	AmandaPlease722	post	29.400047856791968	male	White	0.9983559250831604	na	na	na	5	anxiety	no prediction.

I've never tried Cymbalta. However, I know for certain that many SSRIs initially have a side effect of insomnia. Serotonin is involved in not only regulating mood but sleep and appetite.

Tell them what‚Äôs on your mind and just let it out. Then let them talk and you focus on their voice.

"Experiencing an anxiety attack can be distressing, but there are several techniques you can try to help alleviate the symptoms. Here are some quick strategies you can use:

1. Deep breathing: Take slow, deep breaths in through your nose and exhale slowly through your mouth. Focus on your breath and try to make each breath longer and deeper. This can help regulate your body's stress response.

2. Grounding techniques: Use your senses to bring yourself back to the present moment. Focus on the physical sensations around you. Name five things you can see, four things you can touch, three things you can hear, two things you can smell, and one thing you can taste.

3. Progressive muscle relaxation: Start by tensing and then releasing each muscle group in your body, starting from your toes and working your way up to your head. This technique can help reduce muscle tension and promote relaxation.

4. Challenge negative thoughts: Anxiety attacks often come with negative thoughts and catastrophic thinking. Challenge these thoughts by asking yourself if they are rational or based on evidence. Replace negative thoughts with more realistic and positive ones.

5. Use a grounding object: Carry a small object, such as a smooth stone, a stress ball, or a piece of jewelry, that you can touch and focus on during an anxiety attack. This can provide a sense of comfort and stability.

6. Engage in soothing activities: Find activities that help distract and relax you. It could be listening to calming music, engaging in a hobby you enjoy, coloring, or practicing mindfulness or meditation.

7. Seek support: Reach out to a trusted friend, family member, or therapist who can provide reassurance and support during an anxiety attack. Sometimes talking about your feelings can help alleviate anxiety.

Remember, these techniques may not work equally well for everyone, and it's important to find what works best for you. If you frequently experience anxiety attacks, consider seeking professional help from a mental health provider for further guidance and support."

"(M30). Have had OCD, anxiety, health anxiety since I was little.

A year ago I was lying in bed to sleep, it was the middle of the night. Suddenly out of nowhere I find it hard to breathe, I get palpitations and a burning sensation in my chest. I get out of bed thinking I'm having a heart attack. I go to the emergency room and after EKG (ECG), tests, blood test and blood pressure measurement, they send me home.

I contact the local health center as after that episode I started to have irregular heartbeats. The doctors take my blood test, urine test, they do an EKG on me, and all values look good. My doctor concludes that it is anxiety and panic, so I see a psychologist. I have trauma from childhood and the year before (2021) my grandmother passed away suddenly, my grandmother who raised me (basically).

I continued to contact the local practitioner as I could wake up in the middle of the night completely out of breath and a racing heart. I am constantly worried about having heart disease, such as a stroke or heart attack, but the doctors say my heart is normal.

I continued to have heart palpitations several days a week, had constant chest pressure and chest pain and finally got a referral to a heart specialist clinic. There they connected me to machines, did an echocardiogram, ultrasound and I had to perform a test where I cycled while connected to machines. According to the results, my heart is normal.

I keep waking up at night with my breath in my throat, the feeling of someone strangling me, pain in my stomach and pressure on my chest and a constant worry and fear of death. I go back to university in 2 weeks, looking forward to that, but really don‚Äôt want this shit to affect my studies and social interactions too much. 

I don‚Äôt know what to do. Really. I‚Äôm on the edge my family members have had it, they don‚Äôt want to hear it and they think I‚Äôm crazy. I‚Äôve always been an anxious kid, I‚Äôm afraid of dying constantly and I think about that a lot, but since I had that one ‚Äúmajor‚Äù panic attack, my life has changed completely and I haven‚Äôt felt well for over a year now. 

I see a therapist, but not that often, once a month maybe (your typical underfunded Scandinavian free health care office). But I‚Äôll have more appointments in the autumn. But i think about trying CBT.

Also, one thing that gets me to relax is meditation, East Asian calming music and Tibetan bowls.

It took a month for the withdrawal to subside. I pushed through, knowing this was my brain adjusting to the lack of medication. And honestly, I felt great afterward.

"hey guys! 

So... I'm about to move between rental apartments. 

I got married since my last move so now it's my wife and I and we have a legit amount of stuff plus heavy appliances. 

Moving is stressful for obvious reasons but I actually find it anxiety triggering for a weird one.

The last move was the first time I used a moving company and honestly watching the movers in action made me super anxious. 

Weirdly not for my stuff but for the movers themselves.... I felt really bad watching them exerting themselves and I kept worrying that they were going to hurt themselves! In the end I found it so stressful that I needed to go get a beer! 

Any tips? It feels like there's a lot of exploitation in the moving industry and it makes me feel really bad that I have no other way of moving my stuff (and our landlord is moving his daughter into our current rental so the onto alternative to renting again is being homeless!) 

TIA for any advice that fellow anxiety sufferers can offer. My wife keeps saying they're professionals and not to worry about it but...it causes me so much stress!"	danielrosehill	post	28.085432454638756	male	White	0.9975066781044006	na	na	na	1	anxiety	no prediction.

"Was at a petco today and left the bathroom after washing my hands. Didn't use the air-dryer because it uses the bathroom air to dry your hands. Used clean toilet paper instead. When I got out some guy who was bigger and taller than me (I'm a small guy)  takes a picture of me and I can hear him and his lady complaining about not touching the door handle because people don't wash their hands. I heard the camera sound effect so I knew it happened, but I just walked away.
 
Been spending the whole day anxious,  giving too much of my mental energy to this A-hole thinking about how it could have played differently. Obviously the guy was looking for a reaction. After I left the store I can't stop thinking about how I could have said something, resort to violence or just went up to the front and asked the people working there to accompany me to confront this guy and tell him to delete the photo of me. 
What purpose does it serve? Why would he get a kick from something so petty? How often does this guy do it and gets away with it because of his size. Guy looked like a PoS in his late 20s/ early 30s.

"Your mind's ""alarm bells"" and the repetitive thoughts can be seen as attempts to reduce uncertainty about the situation, to prepare and protect you in the future. However, sometimes, this protective mechanism can be overactive, causing unnecessary distress.

Recognizing your thoughts as just thoughts and not getting attached to them can help. Understand the man's action were really about him and not about you. His own little way to make himself feel better. People who need to do that to feel better about themselves are not in possession of opinions you need to worry about.

If it persists and you find yourself getting stuck in a loop of distressing thoughts, grounding exercises. Stop, breathe, count, you can google it. If you need allow yourself a set time to process the event, but then make a conscious effort to move on.

"Generally, my anxiety about things has been resolved. Except for my anxious attachment. Whenever I feel like someone is pulling away, especially in relationships or people I like, I can‚Äôt help but reach out more, and then I feel like I‚Äôm pushing those people away more.

"You are already ahead of the game in recognizing the patterns. Understanding that it's a part of an anxious attachment can help put things in perspective and give you a starting point for addressing the behavior. Obviously there is therapy, CBT,  Meditation and so on but there are a few simple things that have helped me.

Engaging in mindfulness can help you stay present and resist the urge to act on the anxiety. It can also help in distinguishing between the *perceived reality* created by anxiety and the *actual reality*. For example when feeling anxious, stopping and taking a breath, maybe look around. This can help divert focus from the source of anxiety to the present moment giving you a chance to break the cycle and let it pass before trying to offset the anxiety by texting and so forth. If you can come up with soothing techniques that can divert your attention and focus. Engaging things like taking a walk or reading and I mean actually reading, getting into it or at least allowing yourself to do so. If you feel you need more structure or boundaries to help handle this issue you can set a rule where you only check messages at certain times of the day, or you can't send a follow-up message until a set period has passed.

"To break this cycle, you have to learn to resist compulsive reassurance-seeking. So I would challenge yourself to sit in the discomfort and the anxiety of ""not knowing,"" this will help you gain some confidence. 

So let's say you're starting to feel that jittery, anxious feeling in your belly compelling you to send a message; instead of giving into that feeling, I would put a timer on my phone for 30 seconds (at first) and just sit with that feeling. Allow it to be there. Give yourself compassion. Every time you get that anxious urge to text, increase the timer on your phone by 30 seconds. Challenge yourself to wait long and longer each time.

With practice, that anxiety will become easier to tolerate, so you won't be so compelled to ""get rid"" of that feeling by texting. As a result, the compulsive ""urge"" to text will fade."	Earthlygifts	reply	na	na	na	0.996569037437439	no	no	no	na	anxiety	no prediction.

"So I'm a guy who has a lot of OCD fears and struggles, one of my phobias is the thought of toilet seat pregnancies. Not long ago I was masturbating in my bedroom, and a few minutes after I was done I had to pee. I got to the bathroom and wash my hands first just to be careful. I then lift the seat with my foot and pee carefully aiming into the bowl. At one point I see left over semen mixed in with my urine and panic. Instead of using the main toilet paper roll on the wall, I take a piece off another that hasn't been used to be cautious and put that roll away in the cupboard. I then lift the seat back down with my foot and flush everything and wash my hands once more. A few minutes afterward my female housemate uses that same bathroom. There's no chance of a toilet seat pregnancy right? My anxiety has been in overdrive and I can't help but wonder whether there was any left over sperm residue I brought in even though I just went in to pee. I'm pretty sure it can't happen because most answers from doctors online that other people have asked before say it's impossible. I just need reassurance cause I've been freaking out.

"I completely understand how debilitating this can be, so I hope everyone's replies here help.

It's impossible. 

First, semen doesn't survive long once it's out in the air or on a surface. 30 minutes at the maximum, but even after 10 to 20 minutes most of the sperm will no longer be viable.

Second, urine has been found to have some spermicidal properties, because of the ammonia. So sperm that have swum in piss are going to die even sooner.

Third, sperm can't walk or fly or move on their own. The only way she could contact it at all is by sitting directly on it, and then it's got to somehow wriggle it's way from her ass all the way to inside her vagina. There's just no way this is going to happen.

I really looked for info on this and it's not just extremely unlikely, but properly impossible. Nobody in recorded history has ever gotten pregnant this way.

I do wonder when you picked up this fear and how it got lodged so firmly in your mind? It's usually teen girls who worry about stuff like this for obvious reasons.

Anyway, at least your toilet is always going to be well-cleaned.

But just in case you need distracting, here's an amusing story about something even more impossible; a woman once claimed she got pregnant from a bullet that had gone through a man's scrotum before hitting her.

If you're observing these thoughts they aren't you, so in the moment look at it like a protection mechanism..	HyperLagomorph	reply	na	na	na	0.9879564642906189	no	no	no	na	anxiety	no prediction.
I wake up every morning with a pit in my stomach. I don‚Äôt have a trouble falling asleep in the night. In fact most of the times I am very tired but I am just scared of falling asleep because if I sleep I will awake around 4 or 5 in the morning and the shitty day will start. I will have to face my manager and my shitty job. I never feel calm the entire day. I try to push myself to go outside the house, take some fresh air, just see people and that does change my mood for some time but the whole anxiety thing kicks back in. I am so exhausted all the time. It has started affecting my relationship with my near and dear ones as well. I feel I am not enough and I am scared all the time. I occasionally think about ending my life as well. That way I will be able to end my suffering and it won‚Äôt hurt anymore. I am tired of being myself. I want it to change. I have been like thing ever since I was a kid. If I am worried about something, I would just have a mental breakdown. How can I change it? I really need help. I feel like I will die if I don‚Äôt get help.	Consistent-Dog-8157	post	22.853317422202032	male	White	0.9987510442733765	na	na	na	2	anxiety	failed
"I‚Äôm so sorry. You have to remember you are not suffering alone. There are people who care about you.
I‚Äôve had chronic anxiety since I was a little kid, it fucking sucks and it‚Äôs just been getting worse-but there is hope!! This isn‚Äôt the end.

I‚Äôm not sure how old you are/your situation, but I would consider talking to someone. I‚Äôve been stuffing real bad these last couple weeks and finally decided to get some help. This isn‚Äôt necessary for healing, but I would give it a shot.

It‚Äôs not fair that you have to deal with this. I feel for you and with you. But giving up in not the answer. You have to have faith that it will get better (even if it takes a while, and that‚Äôs okay!!) you have a whole community of people on this app (and in the world) who know exactly how you feel. You are not alone, you are worthy, you are valid.

You don‚Äôt have to struggle alone. There are many resources available, it‚Äôs up to you to find something that works for you. Don‚Äôt turn to the dark side, you are here for a reason.
Unfortunately deep thinkers/feelers are often cursed with anxiety and depression. But remember it‚Äôs a gift to feel things so immensely, you have the power to get through this. You‚Äôre going through a dark time but it‚Äôs NOT permanent. 
Proud of you for reaching out and talking about this. That‚Äôs the most important first step. 

Remember to breathe.

It's called diurnal anxiety or morning depression and they think it's linked to the morning cortisol spike which your body uses to get you up. It's a symptom of depression. I take Antidepressants and they have helped me but there are lots of different meds and CBT therapy that can help. I would Def speak to your doctor about this as there are lots of options available to help you feel better it will really help to get the doctors support.

I‚Äôm wondering if anyone could provide a reasoning or further explanation of what is happening to me. I have had anxiety for a good part of my life, but it had been noticeably better for about a year. Even when I went through stressful events, I was clear headed and I could feel my brain fighting off the thoughts. But. About 3 months ago, while i was learning to drive I had a weird incident. I was pulling out of an unfamiliar, long driveway when my car started to beep as if I was going to hit something. Nothing was there and It had just been something to do with the height of the car. My body had a physical reaction and I was on the verge of tears, telling my mom I couldn‚Äôt drive home. This incident started a string of chain reactions of similar incidents of extreme anxiety. Only since then have I felt this very pressing anxiety, and it feels different then it did for me before. Then it was just obsessive thoughts and feelings, now it is physical body reactions.	ryanrosslova	post	19.564656601264858	female	White	0.9898334741592407	na	na	na	1	anxiety	no prediction.

So my school summer vaca ends today and ever since a few days ago I‚Äôm terrified of the thought that I have to go to school again. My school is related to performing arts, and even though I decided to do this, ever since a few months ago it‚Äôs been making me really anxious. I‚Äôve never hated school this much and the thought of going there just makes me wanna die, and going to this school actually made this year the lowest point of my life, I‚Äôve been sober from cutting and ever since going to school, it‚Äôs started again. I‚Äôve never been diagnosed, and I‚Äôve never been to therapy either. but I‚Äôve never felt this way before and I really just need advice on what I should do.

There were around 2-3 times where I guess I got something like a anxiety attack? I was up in front of everyone performing (I was feeling a bit anxious) and  the teacher stopped me and asked to do it again cuz it was‚Ä¶ bad? And then suddenly I felt like I was gonna die and there was a tightness around my throat and I couldn‚Äôt breathe and for some reason I started crying too, maybe it was because I was scared? 

A few days after that my summer vaca started and I‚Äôve been doing good, I was relaxed most of the time, and I‚Äôve never felt this good in the past few years. 

Well‚Ä¶ now my summer vaca is ending today and I have to go to school tomorrow. And since yesterday I‚Äôve been trying to distract myself with absolutely everything I can and I still feel so restless and I can‚Äôt get the thought of my school out of my head. Last night I was trying to just look at my phone and staying in my room just started to make me feel‚Ä¶ suffocating? Overwhelming? I don‚Äôt know how to explain it and it was so weird. And then for absolutely no reason tears started falling, I couldn‚Äôt breath properly and all the thoughts about school started hitting me harder. 

And today it‚Äôs been worse because from the morning I woke up until now, I haven‚Äôt felt relaxed at all. I‚Äôve been fidget a lot, like tapping my toes, scratching my fingers, moving my hands constantly etc..(I never used to fidget) I checked my average heart rate and usually it‚Äôs around 60-65 bpm but since yesterday it‚Äôs gone up to 80-100 bpm. I can feel my heart pounding even though I‚Äôm just laying down and it‚Äôs honestly driving me insane. Around an hour ago I started feeling the same thing as I did yesterday, I had tears falling for no reason, it became hard to breathe, it happened 2 times intensely but it both lasted very short. 

I feel like something‚Äôs genuinely wrong with me because I‚Äôve never felt like this in my life, can you please give me advice?"	Midgetspinner_160cm	post	15.365684836241877	male	White	0.9985644221305847	na	na	na	1	anxiety	no prediction.
"Hi, the episode with the teacher sounds like a panic attack. And the rest sounds like you're having strong anxiety. If you're not diagnosed, would you be willing to visit a psychiatrist? 

And it's actually important to not try to calm down and not try to stop the feeling of anxiety, that makes it stronger.

"I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs worse than other types of anxiety, all anxiety so horrible but with other types at least you can technically avoid what you are anxious about. Don‚Äôt like school? Don‚Äôt go. Don‚Äôt like work? Don‚Äôt go, scared of talking to people? Stay on your own. Scared to to go out? Don‚Äôt. Even specific phobias like heights can be avoided. Now I say technically as many of those things are hard to avoid and would make your life depressing but the fact is with health anxiety you can‚Äôt avoid it‚Ä¶you‚Äôre trapped in your body 24/7 feeling these symptoms and you can‚Äôt escape.

It‚Äôs better than you think for you to experience it everyday because anxiety is a chronic condition need to be controlled hence why we get long lasting symptoms until we use the right medication and therapy.

You need to see a professional, sooner the better. All those symptoms CAN be from anxiety - I've had the same, for decades now. Not being able to breathe, chest/throat tightening, suffocating, I've had this hundreds if not thousands of times. Dizziness and basically any physical symptom you can think of - I've had it happen to me from anxiety at some point. Get checked by a doctor first for your physical symptoms, and then preferably a psychiatrist after that.

I know you‚Äôve probably been told this but you should try to find a professional who can help you. The best and most sustainable way to deal with anxiety is therapy, most of the things you might find yourself that help are usually insufficient. I‚Äôm not sure where you‚Äôre from but maybe you can ask your GP for a referral? Where I live, you can get prescribed therapy which gets paid by the insurance so you don‚Äôt have to pay yourself.

That sucks‚Ä¶ it seems that most public health care systems are struggling majorly post Covid. I had to wait 3 months for my therapy to get approved by the German health care institution or whatever it‚Äôs called in English. Can you get on a waiting list and try to find some support groups in the meantime? Are there any options for urgent cases that have a more speedy process? I know here you can get a therapist within 4 weeks if your GP finds that you‚Äôre an urgent case, as in the insurance is required to assign someone in that time frame, they can‚Äôt not do it. Maybe there‚Äôs a loophole like that for the NHS? If you‚Äôre having panic attacks ever day that‚Äôs definitely impacting you severely and there should be an option to get help asap. Worst case scenario - maybe a visit to the ER can get you some pills to take off the edge so you can have a bit of a chance to breathe for a day or two?

"TW anxiety and disordered eating

Hey guys. I haven‚Äôt posted here before so please be kind. I‚Äôve been an anxious person for years (19 years old) and went through a very intense highschool and part of college experience, think extreme perfectionism, perfect SAT and GPA, attending an Ivy League college. It made me feel awful and I hated how constantly stressed I was, hardly sleeping and just stressed all the time. Developed an eating disorder out of perfectionism and anxiety which was awful.

Kinda half recovered from the ED but not mentally, only gained some weight but didn‚Äôt fix the mindset. Fell into serious depression and it got terrible.

I‚Äôve been working on myself a lot this summer and I‚Äôve been feeling less sad, which is great. But I feel the anxiety that I kind of suppressed coming back over the past month or two. And it‚Äôs worse. I suddenly feel the need to restrict my food again bc of body dysmorphia. I feel like I need to plan my whole life, as in grad school, tons of activities in college, jobs, even a family, my whole career. I feel a constant irrational fear over everything; I feel like someone is going to attack me, I feel like Im in trouble, I always think I‚Äôve lost something valuable, I always think I left a stove on, I can hardly walk from my car to my door without panicking, can‚Äôt sleep in a house alone. And even weirder, my short term memory is completely shot. Many many times a day, I‚Äôll intend to do something and forget, then realize I forgot, and then come back. Like for example I‚Äôll go upstairs to grab a charger, then I‚Äôll just go to the bathroom and go back downstairs, then in 5 minutes realize I needed a charger.

I don‚Äôt know what to do because I feel like all the things are getting worse. Is this a description of something that happens with anxiety?

FYI I tried therapy/psychology and it just wasn‚Äôt for me plus I can‚Äôt pay for it. I‚Äôm not diagnosed either‚Ä¶ hope it‚Äôs ok to post still."

"Hi, I know a bit about anxiety, I overcame what I'd consider an extreme case and to me this sounds like a textbook GAD. It's all coming from being too uncomfortable with uncertainty. To stop it you need to stay in uncertainty about your fears on purpose and that way slowly get used to it. With the eating problem, the right approach is to very slowly push tiny boundaries, say eat 100kcal more daily than you are comfortable with. 

This is all of course much easier said than done. I'm saying this is something you should be making steps towards too. And if it's too extreme then you might need meds.

Your brain is being a jackass and is telling your body that there is a threat or danger and wants you to react as such.

I am constantly fearing going to sleep every single night because I always get different feelings in my chest and arms. I get pain in my arms all the time and tightness and heat in my chest makes me feel like I am having a heart attack. All throughout the day all day long I feel difficulty breathing then at night when I go to bed it‚Äôs always pain in my body and I get chest spasms (kind of like a muscle spasm after working out just in my chest) the heat and tightness in my chest is unbearable and I am constantly only getting 2-3 hours of sleep every night. My body is exhausted but I can‚Äôt fall asleep because of these symptoms. I‚Äôve went to the cardiologist so much he is annoyed with me my chest and heart are perfect. I am a little on the heavier side but I‚Äôve been told that my cardiovascular health is wonderful. I have tried trazodone (I am currently prescribed it) but my anxiety is so bad some nights that my body fights it and the physical symptoms get worse and I can‚Äôt sleep.

"I remember the first time I had a ‚Äòheart attack‚Äô that ended up being a full body panic attack, manifesting in my chest and heart. Medically fine but horrible. Sounds similar to what you‚Äôre going through. Especially in the evening because you stop and all the things you‚Äôve been avoiding have some time to eat your brain. 

I‚Äôd create some regular morning and evening routines to create a place where you can process all the emotions (and panic which is likely causing the physical symptoms). Anything that can get your awareness out of your head (and all the ‚Äòthreats‚Äô ahead) and into the sensations in your body. Yoga, mediation, breathing, qi gong, guided hypnotherapy, etc will all help your body to process the emotions rather than spin in them.

But specifically, progressive muscle relaxation before bed and first thing in the morning. There are short videos online and it will help.

There are many things you can do but it sounds like it‚Äôs good to speak to a professional about ways to cope with overwhelm and panic. 

Ultimately there is something that is concerning your system so much that it‚Äôs in full panic mode. Short term there are exercises to get your body to calm down. Long term, it‚Äôs about changing your relationship to this feeling of dread / panic. Instead of reacting to it and being inundated by it, recognizing that it is one possibility and it‚Äôs safe to be kind to ourselves and we will be ok.

"\*brews a cup of Earl Grey and sits down among a teetering library of books like some sort of vampire Dark Academia professor\*

I'm glad you asked!

So, if you like your science-fiction dark, gritty and chrome-plated, I recommend Richard Morgan, very specifically his Altered Carbon series. I expect you'll have seen or heard of the show, but the book is God-Tier cyberpunk. Death? Pfft. *So* last year. Nah, now we download consciousness into new bodies called 'sleeves.'

Another in the grimdark vein, anything Warhammer 40k. Forget the expensive tabletop game and painting the models, the Black Library has some of *the* best bleak, dystopian sci-fi fiction this side of Tartarus. A miserable, hardscrabble future millennia hence, where people live their entire lives inside monumental manufactoria, trillions die every day from sheer ennui, and suffocating on blacklung is considered quite a nice way to go. Seriously. 40k takes 'miserable future' to a whole new ballgame and makes *now* look like a paradise. I would say start with the Gaunt's Ghosts series by Dan Abnett. Grim, messy, frontline action.

Now, if you prefer a happier and more optimistic future, I cannot recommend more highly the books of Becky Chambers. She writes what they're calling 'solarpunk,' which is a more utopian, cheerier and more egalitarian vision of the future. Post-scarcity philosophy, integrated galactic community, wholly inclusive and ecologically-responsible societies. It's love, Jim, but not as we know it. Start with 'The Long Way To A Small Angry Planet' and prepare to cry *a lot.*

For somewhere between, I wholeheartedly recommend my personal favourite sci-fi author, Ben Bova. He's about 72 now, and still going. He writes a sort of... social sci-fi, with hard sci-fi elements. We're talking the deep-diving of Jupiter's semi-liquid oceans via hydrocarbon-breathing to talk to *Jovian Space-Whales* kind of jam. We're talking 'the world has been taken over by religious fundamentalists and ecological disaster, so all the corporations fight over the moon' kind of marmalade. I really, really recommend the novel 'Saturn' by him. You'll see what I mean. It's like... West Wing, in space.

Lastly, if you like your sci-fi hard as a Martian boulder, Kim Stanley Robinson. Proper hardcore, this-is-how-we'll-actually-do-it terraforming stuff. He has a trilogy, Red Mars, Green Mars, Blue Mars. Hefty, hefty stuff, but I love it. Do not go into it with a headache."

"I have been on reddit for about two years and not made a post, but felt like this was a good place to make my first. I am a 26 year old male who has been dealing with what may be (is likely) anxiety issues. Its been just over two months since this has started. 

The night before I had gone out drinking with some work peers and over ran my body by working out, going into a sauna for an hour, and swimming until 3-4 in the morning following the bars. The next day I felt fine until around 1:30 when I suddenly had what felt like a heart attack that lasted three to four hours. I went to the emergency room and the doctors told me there was no issue with my heart, they told me it was likely a bad panic attack. Since then I have had ever-changing symptoms. For the first month I could not go out in public, I had vibrations in my chest, tightness in my chest, lightheadedness, and difficulty breathing. After about a month I started to lose the pain in my chest for other symptoms. Now I always feel lightheaded, my breathing is not difficult but its become numb, I get weird feelings in my chest for the first hour every morning, and I get a daily bad heart palpitations, and I am hypersensitive to every feeling in my chest area. Sleeping is a nightmare in its own. Now I am able to go out in public but I am afraid of a cardiac event. Everything bothers me now, (A pull on my chest hair can cause me to pause).

I have gone to my family physician 4/5 times and he has prescribed me pills for anxiety, GERD, chostocondritis. Gone to the emergency room three times. Had 3/4 ECG's done (Apple Watch ECG's count is too much to count), five blood tests, three chest x-rays, a halter monitor for a day, an echocardiagram and an upcoming stress test. Everything has come back normal but I do not feel normal, I do not really remember what normal feels like. This has embodied my life for 70 days now. 

Before this I thought I was the healthiest person alive, I did not drink pop or eat candy. I went from 118lbs to 151lbs in a year and a half from going to the gym. I played beer league hockey every week. Went out with my friends to the bar or sporting events or movies every other week. Focused on my work and school. 

Now that has all changed. Now I feel like the unhealthiest person alive. I have always had heart palpitations but now I feel them more. I haven't ever posted or talked about myself much so I just decided to do it on here, as reading through the experiences other people have had and are dealing with have made me feel closer to normal again.

"Go on YouTube and learn about what anxiety is. Anxiety can cause all your symptoms and in the end it‚Äôs all 100% harmless. No one dies from anxiety. The physical symptoms are a huge part of anxiety. Once you can accept them for what they are and understand how harmless it all is you might find that things overall are less intense. Anxiety feeds on your own fear of it. I swear once I finally realized and accepted that what I was feeling is all theater of my mind I just let it pass over me now. My heart skips a beat‚Ä¶ whatever. It would have killed me by now if it was actually something bad. Can‚Äôt breathe? Somehow I always survive. 

Next, consider going to a therapist and learning, cognitive behavioral therapy for anxiety. This is highly effective with a ton of legitimate science behind it.

hey bro i have gone through the same thing. Anxiety about my heart ruined my life from 2020-2021 and you might need to be put on medications for panic attacks. I have to take ativan every day now, but its hard to get prescribed. I suggest finding a psychiatrist who can prescribe you medication based on your symptoms. Don‚Äôt ask a regular doctor for any medications. Also, I still have the chest and heart feelings. have had routine ekg‚Äôs, echocardiograms, stress tests, and this year did the nuclear stress test. 3 years in a row, at this point i finally believe my anxiety is causing it. I know its scary, I‚Äôve been fired from jobs for freaking out thinking im having a heart attack at work. Ive been through a lot with it. Go see a psychiatrist, advocate for yourself, be open to options. Hope you feel better and find a solution.	QueasySalary519	reply	na	na	na	0.9933217167854309	weak	strong	no	na	anxiety	no prediction.
"Man, im a 26M and about half of the stuff youve gone through i have as well and same time frame. I had a spike in Blood Pressure to the point of getting medication as well as treating my GERD and uric acid symptoms. My Adderall withdrawals are mostly (what i believe) the reason for my panic attacks and higher anxiety. 

Im a hypochondriac, i freak out about the smallest symtoms
I used to feel my heartbeat so profoundly and then i didnt. Happy about that. 

Still feel like a Heart Attack could be around the corner but a provider told me that at our age its damn near impossible to have plaque issues or heart issues. It takes decades on decades to build up plaque and blockages if we eat poorly. Just hearing that makes it a bit easier. 

I know exercise for me has done wonders for my nervous system as i could not swallow food that well, and would take 30min to get through half a plate of food.

Right now I am taking naproxen for the chostocondritis. I took pills for GERD for a bit. Tried the anti-anxiety pills one time and hated how I felt. So right now I have a lot of pills but don‚Äôt taking anything consistently. For myself, the pain has gone away. Either I have burning on my sternum or no feeling at all. Going from always feeling my heart for 45 days to suddenly not feeling it at all has scared me the most. I think it‚Äôs a good thing and it‚Äôs normal but I do not believe it yet.

"This weekend was by all means really fun. I went out with a friend to a rave where I was getting on stage, singing and dancing with other people, my friend and I had a good buzz going drinks wise and people were even complimenting me on my dancing the end of the night. The next day I went to a nice bottomless brunch followed by a rooftop pool party where people were visibly/vocally excited I showed up. I met a ton of new people and had some great conversations and felt like I solidified some newer friendships I‚Äôve been building. I got drunk but on the same level as everyone and the next day people were jokingly reaching out ‚Äúoh how‚Äôs everyone‚Äôs hangover?‚Äù In no way do I feel like I was being any more outlandish than anyone else. 

But for some reason I just can‚Äôt accept I just had a fun raucous weekend. I keep flashing back to interactions with people thinking ‚Äúwas I being too weird in that moment? Did that person actually want to dance with me? Was actually being embarrassing while drunk and just not picking up the social cues? Did I over stay my welcome? Was that a weird thing to stay to them?‚Äù And on and on and on. I know logically, in all likelihood, I just had a fun weekend where I let myself cut loose for once and nobody thinks any lower of me or thought I was being weird/rude/overbearing at all.

Could I suggest staying away from the alcohol. If you need booze to have a good time then you are not hanging out with the right people.

"Yes. I go through those periods on and off. Ir's happening again lately, and there seems to be no sure way of predicting it. My advice is to find a therapist and potentially a psychiatrist. 

If you want some specifics to ask any future doctors about, here are some medication options

beta blockers (like propranolol)- primarily used as blood pressure medications, these often help with physical anxiety symptoms like rapid heartrate and shaking/tremor. Doctors use this as a first line of defense because they are totally non addictive. 

Benzodiazepines like ativan (aka lorazepam), xanax (alprazolam),etc. Definitely the strongest stuff out there for anxiety, but not generally used long term because of abuse potential. They're all pretty addictive

Antihistamines- many people find hydroxizine and benedry to be helpful, plus you can get tons of them over the counter

Gabapentin- this is generally better for people who have anxiety stemming from depression

Various antidepressants- great option. Lots of antidepressants treat anxiety symptoms in both ppl with and without run-of-the-mill depression

Yeah you might get some of that. The most common is nausea. But even then it doesn't tend to be that bad. And more importantly, the side effects stop after about two weeks and then don't come back.

"My late mother and I used to go out to the various restaurants in town on the weekends. It was kind of our thing, trying new places and usually supporting the local economy by avoiding chains whenever we could. I like to continue the tradition now after she's gone, but I go alone now.

Today I went to a new place I've never been to yet, but have heard good reviews about. I'm seated immediately, and get my drink (just a diet Coke) and I start looking over the menu. 

Then I wait. And I wait. 15 minutes go by, no server. I start looking around. The place isn't overly busy and everyone else seems to have ordered or has their food. I wait more. 20 minutes. A table that was sat after me is brought their food. I'm still sitting here with a menu in front of me.

I try making eye contact with the waitresses. I don't remember which one gave me my coke, they're all young brunettes wearing all black, and they are all ignoring me entirely. Another table is seated right next to me. I try to get their waitress' attention, but she turns her back and walks the opposite way. The music is loud and she probably didn't hear me.

30 minutes. The table beside me gets their appetizer. I again try to get her attention. She zooms off before I can, again in the other direction. By now I'm starting to panic. Should I just leave? Should I leave money on the table for my coke that I have half-finished? This has honestly never happened to me before.

Nearly 40 minutes, I finally get the server at the table next to me to look at me. I ask meekly if I can order, I've been waiting a long time. She asks who my server is. I say I have no idea. She takes my order seeming a bit annoyed since I'm apparently not her table. 

Once I get my food she apologizes because apparently I was her table, but she misunderstood the other server who told her to take me. I tell her it's ok, and just eat my food. Its delicious and holds up to the good reviews.

I get my bill. It's full price, no offer of taking a percentage off for my wait. I don't complain. I tip 22%.

"Server here to offer my perspective! 

This sort of mix up is honestly very common and easy to make and usually comes down to miscommunication between servers/hostesses. Yes, somebody should have noticed you were sitting there without being taken care of. Usually other servers can notice and check in ‚Äúhey who has table 31? Anyone been to them?‚Äù But if it was super busy, or perhaps all of the servers In that area are new to serving, it‚Äôs possible to slip by. Especially since you had a drink, people probably assumed you were being taken care of. I know for me, I usually am able to tell if someone‚Äôs been missed if they haven‚Äôt been given any drinks at all! So I‚Äôm assuming that‚Äôs what happened.  

It was absolutely up to the server to make it up to you. Had it been me, I would have comped food, offered a free drink or dessert, and truly been on my A game from there on out. However, shitty servers exist. 

All of this is to reassure you that this was not personal. Restaurants are chaos and things happen. Next time, I highly suggest looking for a manager or a hostess and very kindly letting them know you think you‚Äôve been forgotten.

The only difference was that he was the only Asian in a room full of non-minority people and our server actively would look at us and give him dirty looks when he passed us. The young white couple next to us were being doted on and given free dessert when they said it was their anniversary. All we got was our meal an hour late and our waters refilled once. I don‚Äôt want to jump to conclusions and say our experience was racially motivated, but that‚Äôs what it felt like.

"I'm so terrified to go out because of stuff like this.
Something very similar happened to me at a Dunkin Donuts actually very recently lmao.


 My friends and I were going to hang out for the day and we decided to stop and get coffees. We went in because there was no drive thru and the place was empty. The workers greet us and start taking my friends orders. Friend a is paying for friend b and asks me if I wanted her to pay for me too. I tell her no thanks I'm gonna pay for myself. My friends step aside and I go up to order, and the worker just walked away and ignored me.

Now, I've worked for years in the food service for YEARS, like way too long, and I know that you don't just walk away when you still have people in line. But I don't wanna be a pain in the ass so I just wait, thinking they'll get to me. My friends get their orders and are waiting by the door looking at me confused. Then some old couple walks in and is immediately greeted and asked if they're ready to order. That's when I was like ""um hey sorry but can I order, now please?"" And one of the workers came up like she was going to help me, listens to what I'm ordering and then doesn't ring anything up and walks away. Then I had to wait for another person to come up and take my order, and he had an attitude about it. I didn't even have a complicated order, just an iced coffee and a bagel.

"You sound like a really nice person, but I am angry for you. The fact that you are upset about this, but still tipped nicely is an indication of your strong character. 

But what if I reframe this from the restaurants perspective -- they have a high quality of food, they want to remain an upstanding part of the community -- would they not want to receive feedback from someone like yourself?

I think it is in their best interest for you to pull the manager aside in situations like this because you were the victim of this situation. 

Mistakes happen, and surely you don't need to throw a fit, but if you are wronged -- and, by the way, using up the time of a patron and not checking on them for 40 minutes is wrong -- you have a right to bring up this feedback. This is useful for the restaurant and provides them with the opportunity to salvage their misdoings. 

I am a large man and when I get upset about something and try to break down why I am upset about it I constantly try feel like I am mansplaining and that I should just shut up. 

But the fact is that if you are upset by something, and you have the opportunity to speak up for yourself, you should take it -- not to scold others or put them down, but to allow them the opportunity to empathize with you. 

If it is poorly received, that's OK. It's OK because you were honest with yourself and you relayed honest feedback to those who are in a position to most benefit from it.

They can make sure that aspect of their restaurant receives attention... calling out the specific server when you don't know whether it's just an off day, or the manager fucked up the schedule or table assignment, or what... seems unnecessary and unkind

Next time, try to ask him how you can do better and apologize for your mistakes.

"For context, I've gone to the ER 3 times since March for all these symptoms and followed up with my PCP each time. I am also currently seeing a psychiatrist and have been prescribed buspirone.  I feel like I'm doing everything right to figure out what is going on, but I still feel chained by all my symptoms. 

I consistently feel brain fog, dizziness, sharp headaches that last for about 10 minutes a few times a day,pain in my chest, pain in both arms, tingling in my arms, and occasional sharp pains in my thighs. My brain automatically thinks blood clots for some reason. 

My PCP prescribed 25mg metoprolol about 4 weeks ago because I was experiencing high BP.  That for the most part is under control. 

Time and time again it's has been written off as anxiety but of course I can't just shake the idea that something else is wrong. EKG and X-rays are normal. The only thing abnormal to show up on my lab work is a positive ANA result. I'm following up with my PCP soon about that. Everything I read about positive ANA ranged from it's nothing to worry about to potentially leading to an autoimmune disease.

My PCP has agreed to continue process of elimination by scheduling me with a rheumatologist to do further testing to check further on the ANA positive results. But at some point I'm just afraid he's going to give up and rule it completely as anxiety and stop referring me for other tests.

"I think I have OCD... my psychiatrist as always going back and forth on my diagnosis but I definitely have an anxiety disorder and some triggers are very specific and result in a strong inclination to a particular action. The most frustrating and annoying of all is how my anxiety and compulsions manifest in situations where alcohol and drugs are involved... in particular with my significant other. This could easily turn into a gigantic lecture on all the nuances of the situation but in a nutshell:

  
Whenever my girlfriend is out drinking with her friends or smoking weed or whatever I get uncontrollably anxious and I become very quiet and removed from the situation. This occurs both when I am with her and when she is out without me. My body goes into this weird mode where I kind of resent her and feel like I want to ignore her as if she has betrayed me somehow. I feel like she is now ""different"" in some way and I cant look at her the same. My compulsion is usually to either get extremely drunk because for SOME REASON I think it puts me ""on the same level"" as her, whatever the hell that means, or I just collapse into some anxious mental state where everything bothers me, I resent her, and I feel like the world is about to end.

  
I feel like such an asshole and maybe I come off as a manipulator?? I don't know... all I know is that this has incredibly impacted my ability to have stable relationships because drinking and smoking are just a part of everyday life and for some reason my brain feels like the world is gonna end whenever, specifically, my girlfriend partakes in these activities.

"Everyday is a blessing. In life, if you have no reason to be happy, you must forge your own path to happiness. Often, many things will try to hold you down or purposefully set you up for failure but in this case, you must find a way to turn your bad situation into a good one. Sometimes, people feel hopeless as if they are tied down and have no method of being able to do anything. For some people, their situations may be worse but in the end, nobody will truly understand what you are going through as they are not you. In this case, the only person that can help yourself is you. Find people who truly care, not all doctors are as you describe them to be. 
I truly believe that you can recover from this. Even if you feel like you've reached rock bottom, you can still climb your way out. It may take time but in the end, you will be glad for all the effort you put in.
It's okay to feel defeated sometimes but it is never okay to give up hope.

"I feel like I‚Äôm the perfect person to answer this for you! April of this year I had the opportunity to move to a whole new state with my boyfriend. I wanted to do but I was physically and mentally unstable to stick to a decision. I spent since late June making a decision. I had constant panic attacks and impending doom about it. I started CBT therapy and it helped me make the decision that I wanted to move to a new state with my boyfriend. So now he‚Äôs already there and I‚Äôll be going in October! When I say that I struggled with it, I REALLT struggled. I went to inpatient for the night because I was freaking myself so badly and overwhelming myself. I rotted in bed and everything and everyone triggered me. Never experienced anything like it. My therapist helped me through it and guided me to help trust myself with a decision. That was my underlying problem. I didn‚Äôt trust myself making such a big decision. Now I kinda chuckle at it because I feel so confident about the decision. But hey, we‚Äôre all different and we all deal with things differently. For me, it was really scary. And for some people move away isn‚Äôt. Now I‚Äôm excited and ready for new adventures. I wish you luck! Also: sitting with yourself and allowing only YOU to make that decision helps. I always let other ppl influence my decisions that‚Äôs another reason why I struggled.

"Hi there, I have previously gone through a similar experience for a short amount of time where I was afraid of choking due to anaphylaxis and allergies from eating. 

The method I used to overcome this fear and to show myself how irrational the fear was is to go to the doctor and get an allergy test. They will test pretty much everything to see if you have any allergies at all. For me, I was allergic to pollen but nothing else. After this, I felt way more relieved and was able to slowly ease my way into eating normally again.

Anxiety is related to your brain which controls your body. For me, I couldn't swallow food or water properly because my throat kept tensing up as if there was something stuck in it but after my anxiety cleared up, the symptom disappeared."	hhearts93	reply	na	na	na	0.9994723200798035	weak	strong	no	na	anxiety	no prediction.

And about the problem itself, did you try ERP approach? I don't know if you're familiar with it. It's about avoiding all reassurance.

Okay. I'd recommend keeping a glass of water near at all times, somewhere you can see it as a way of getting used to and that way slowly stopping the fear.

"If your anxiety has a source, it can be dealt with by trying to understand why what you fear is not a problem. It's perfectly fine to have anxiety without a source too in which case can be managed by talking to people about it such as therapists or a trusted friend or family member.
Your school, college or university will most likely have a guidance councillor as most do. Do not be afraid to tell them what is going on and try to work out a system in which you will feel safe and comfortable.

I would say if they have ran blood work on you and all is fine then it is safe to say it's just anxiety.

"If you are 15 years old, there is extremely little chance you will have cancer as you are too young to get it and too old to have doctors not notice it prior.
Cancer often shows in bloodwork as abnormal counts of red and white blood cells act as indicators. If you have any abnormalities in your past tests, the doctors would have done further testing. Also, cancer can be passed down through genetics. as long as your family does not have a history of cancer, you are fine.
I would however ask the doctor about why your arm is hurting but I too believe that it is due to anxiety since I have the same symptom too. My left arm starts to feel weak and hurts. Other times, I just get pins and needles but this only happens when I am anxious which further proves my point that it is a symptom of anxiety.

It's even a scientific fact that many people become sexually aroused when they die (so called ""death erections""). What if the act of dying is the best feeling ever? The bottom line is we don't know...death might be great, it might not be, it might just be a passage from one existence to another, or it might literally just be the end and nothing more. But why assume the worst? To go about your life being afraid that there's this awful thing waiting for us at the end is a terrible way to live.

I‚Äôm an anxious person. I‚Äôve suffered from most kinds of anxiety extending from normal anxiety to nocturnal panic attacks. I‚Äôm also an artist who suffers from impostor syndrome..Yesterday, I was at an anime convention, and I saw an artist who I admired the art of for a while now. Me and my wife were already down to our last dollar, but because we both loved her art decided to take the slight hit on the credit to buy some of her stuff. My wife talked to her at the last convention we were at and said she was friendly, so I decided to be brave and tell her I was a huge fan of her work‚Ä¶ and she looked at me, frowned, and turned away. I was crushed. I immediately left the artists hall with my new $20 art poster from her, (my wife bought a $30 mouse pad from her so we were in the hole an extra $50 total) and found a spot that wasn‚Äôt busy and curled up and cried for 20 minutes in public while my wife just stood next to me. I feel terrible because now we spent more than our means because I wanted to support her, but now the art I purchased feels tainted like I can‚Äôt enjoy it.She probably was tired and I get if you‚Äôre an amazing artist you likely get praised constantly.

"First of all,  ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è.  Hugs from an Internet stranger!

Second, in terms of the financial aspect, you're no worse off than you expected to be.  I hear you about not being able to enjoy what you bought, but the situation is no different.  If the poster is causing you emotional pain, see if you can sell it online.  Even if you get $10 for it, you're still better off than you were.

Now . . . You did nothing wrong.  Your guess for what happened is likely spot-on.  She was probably tired.  As someone who isn't an artist, I'd still raise a Spock-type eyebrow.  People get tired, I get it, but this isn't her first rodeo.  It could be something else that set her off.  Maybe her car threw a Check Engine light on the way to the event, and now she's having to think about it after ignoring it all day.  Maybe she heard a stray comment, like, ""nah, she's really not that good, <insert name here> is so much better.""  Dunno, I'm making up guesses.  But 99.9999% certain it wasn't you.

I won't encourage you to stop trying to be social.  It's better to keep trying.  Can you remember times when you DID put yourself out there and it turned out fine?  Think about those situations.  What went right?  How did you approach the person?  What did you say?  Little things might make a difference.  Was your wife with you?  Was she not?  Was the environment well-organized?  Was the environment loud and raucous, like at a rock concert?  Was it quiet, like at a church, or a library?  You can try having your wife initiate the conversation.  There's nothing wrong with that.  I tell me wife ""I don't know anyone here"" or ""I've never been to a place like this"" and end with ""I need to follow your lead.""  I set expectations with her.  If you want to meet someone at a booth, stand back and observe the interactions at first.  See how the person is reacting.  See what others are saying.  Go at a time when it's not *too* busy, but there are a few other fans there.  How snippy is the person going to get with you if they're surrounded by other fans?  You may not get as much 1:1 time with your favorite artist, but you'll still be able to interact a bit.

Quite frankly, you're more daring than I am.  I'd love to go to a Comic-Con and meet Dana Terrace and crew from *The Owl House*.  I don't know the first thing about events like that, so I'd be completely lost.  So you've taken the step of actually going, which is one up on me.  I can't suffer from imposter syndrome because I can't impersonate an artist to save my life.  But one of the fan arts I really enjoy for *The Owl House* taught me about self-bullying, and it might ring true for you on your imposter syndrome.  The main character, Luz, is talking to a random artist at a convention.  https://reddit.com/r/TheOwlHouse/s/gcoJrgrc4E

I was forced to face stereotypes in my mind.  Insomnia, hypertension.  This is just a sampling of the effects it had on me.  I just got off the hypertension med a couple of weeks ago.

*I ENCOURAGE WATCHING IT.  I WOULD NOT EXPECT THIS KIND OF REACTION FOR THE AVERAGE VIEWER.  THERE IS NO REASON TO THINK YOU WOULD HAVE A SIMILAR KIND OF REACTION*.

This started for me in September 2021.  My counseling journey has been a huge self-discovery.  I got a new counselor in June 2022; she diagnosed me with depression (I've heard this off and on), anxiety (never knew), and mental trauma (never knew).  The continuing journey has been amazing and unsettling, but I'm so much better than I was.  I have many ways in which I relate to Luz.  Roughly a year has been spent discussing my past and how I relate to various aspects of Luz' personality.  That's how personal this show has been.

TOH starts with a teen girl (Luz) who doesn't fit in with her peer group.  Mom sends her to a ""reality camp"" to make friends, but Luz wanders into a ramshackle house and goes through a portal, *Lion, Witch, and the Wardrobe*\-style, into another world.  She befriends a witch (Eda) who becomes her mentor.  Luz makes some friends, meets the school bully, and continues to learn to be a witch.  An emperor (Belos) is trying to get a handle on ""wild magic,"" which has been injurious over the years.  We find out about a curse Eda has.  We find out about Eda's contentious relationship with her sister, Lilith.  A student develops a crush on Luz; Luz eventually reciprocates.  Through the first 1.5 seasons, it's pretty cute, nothing too serious, but it was in the first 1.5 seasons that I had my crisis that I believe was unique to me.

Second half of season 2, it gets dark.  Characters find out they were lied to all their lives, they're not who they thought they were.  They reveal character pasts.  Many examples of mental health issues -- including anxiety -- and characters helping each other.  Season 2 into season 3, one character arguably becomes suicidal (it's debated by the fandom; nothing ever comes of it, things get better).  It's a great example of having mental health problems and being supported by friends and loved ones.  Luz is illustrated as neurodivergent (probably ADHD).  Little narratives about social issues.  One character carries a blue ribbon in a scene, which is a symbol for child abuse (and it fits the character).  Season 3 is abbreviated (3 double-length specials).  There are more lighthearted elements, but it's still serious.

You can binge the whole thing, which is an advantage.  I was able to binge through seasons 1.5, then watched week-to-week.  My anxiety was extreme, to the point I had to seriously consider not watching the show until the rest of season 2 was on Disney+.  By the time season 3 came out, I had a handle on things.

But it's a great show.  It starts off kind of slow, but it gets its stride mid-season 1.  And remember, nobody should be punished for who they are."	Emotional-Leather602	reply	na	na	na	0.9994823932647705	no	strong	no	na	anxiety	no prediction.

Anxiety itself is a medical condition. There is absolutely nothing wrong with taking medication to treat it. Finding the right med has given me control of my life again.

"I am not on medication, but I have friends who are.

If they don't take care of themselves, they can still fall through that buffer and have bad anxiety or a panic attack. But anxiety no longer rules them. Seems like it takes 3 weeks to start working and side effects such as drowsiness, low libido, diarrhea/constipation etc lasts a few months.

33F.. This might be a long post. I‚Äôve always had anxiety as long as I can remember. It had never run my life or been debilitating. I noticed it got a bit worse after I had my first son and then again with my second, but nothing that prevented me from living my day to day. This past year, my husband deployed and in that time I dealt with being employed in big tech and facing layoff threats three times, a health scare, working full-time, essentially being a single parent, and eventually leaving the company I was working at due to not wanting to be on the layoff rollercoaster any longer. I had my first panic attack in April at the airport with my husband while we were leaving for a kid-free vacation. Since then, I‚Äôve had about 3-4 more panic attacks. It‚Äôs starting to severely impact my day to day. My husband is gone a lot and I now almost have this impending doom of something horrible happening to myself or my kids and having no one around. My 2 year old had a respiratory emergency last week and had to be taken by ambulance so it‚Äôs almost as if one of my worries came true. I‚Äôm super unhappy at the company I currently work at which I‚Äôm sure is contributing. I‚Äôm so frustrated with how anxious I‚Äôve become. It‚Äôs almost like my anxiety is giving me anxiety. I want to go back to the way I was. I started seeing a therapist but I know that takes time. I don‚Äôt know if my body and mind are just completely exhausted, but I just hope it gets better. It sucks.	galuszkm	post	31.12905178500329	female	White	0.9979713559150696	na	na	na	3	anxiety	no prediction.

"Hello,
I‚Äôve had bad anxiety since I was a kid. I‚Äôve been diagnosed with GAD, depression, and PTSD since I was 13 (22F now, PTSD was dx last year). I‚Äôve tried a rotation and combination of lexapro, Zoloft, lamcital, and Abilify and haven‚Äôt seen any improvement with any permutation of those. I just started a new job and my anxiety is through the roof. 

I‚Äôve had a sneaking suspicion much of my depression/anxiety is actually ADHD as I tend to hyperfixate, trouble with active listening, struggle with any kind of routine, and have an inability to focus on a task. My dad and sister are also both diagnosed with ADHD/ADD. I‚Äôve not been able to be tested as the waitlists have been years long in my area. As I work at my new job which is very detail oriented and people focused, I‚Äôm noticing that I‚Äôm worse than I‚Äôve ever been for anxiety and focus. 

I‚Äôve had a variety of situational events happen this week and I‚Äôm absolutely useless at the moment. I‚Äôm having extreme chest tightening that‚Äôs painful and GI upset, as well as inability to hold it together without bursting into tears from anxiety and frustration, I locked myself in the bathroom to cry today from just that shaking, bursting out of my chest feeling. I can‚Äôt get it together and I‚Äôm nervous it‚Äôs going to further impede my ability to function. 

I made an appointment with my psychiatrist this morning for next week as I feel I really need help. I had significant improvement and was off all meds for a year. However, I‚Äôm finding I need that support to regulate again. That being said: if you‚Äôve had a similar experience, what worked medication wise? Is it it worth bringing up the ADHD concern to my doctor, I‚Äôm just worried about being shut down?

"I started this new job waitressing at a restaurant about 3 or 4 weeks ago, and for the most part, it's a good job. It can get hectic at times, but overall its a good place to work. The pay is good, the coworkers are nice, the work is borderline fun (and familiar as I've worked in restaurants before, which is a bonus when you're anxious and don't like massive changes) and my bosses actually listen to me and my needs, unlike my previous job. But sometimes I'll do something slightly wrong or hesitate for a second too long or ask a silly question and suddenly I feel like I'm a failure and that everyone hates me. I'm sure many of you know the feeling all too well. But usually I forget about it within the hour, especially if I'm running around a busy dining hall. 

Tonight I was making up cutlery for tomorrow morning, and I stacked the pile a little bit too high, which meant that about 15 minutes later the whole pile came crashing down. Everyone started blaming each other in a joking manner, but I was absolutely horrified when I realised that it was my fault. Someone asked if anyone had actually explained to me how to make up and stack the cutlery, and when I said yeah, I was told to make two piles as big as possible so I did and they looked at me like I was an idiot. I'm not the best at understanding things sometimes, I admit that, and sometimes when I'm so focused on making a good impression I make stupid, completely avoidable mistakes. I tried to laugh it off and quickly just cleaned up, but I could feel the eyes of everyone on me and I could tell they really wanted to talk about what just happened without me hearing. I just went quiet and left as my shift was over anyway, but my anxiety brain has been obsessing over it for the past hour. ""You fucked up, it's your fault everyone got held back at the end of a long night, they're all talking about you behind your back, you'll never be one of the crew and socialising at work is going to be so awkward from now on, if you keep fucking up like this you'll get fired and then you won't be able to afford rent and you'll end up homeless"".... you know the drill. I've been spiralling pretty bad. 

Rationally I know that at most this will be a funny bit of gossip for the next few days and then it'll just die out, if it hasn't already, but my anxiety is making me feel like a total fuck up. Like I'm the joke of the workplace, or like I'm the example of what not to do at work. I already have trouble fitting in and socialising with everyone like a normal person because of my social anxiety around new people and other neurodivergences (I've never been tested for anything but I'm definitely built differently mentally and I share a lot of traits with people who are autistic or have ADHD) so every little mistake and slip up makes me feel so small and unlikeable.

"Hey all. Just wanted to ask about a symptom that I've noticed I suffer with a lot more as of late. Anxiety has been part of my life for 26 years. Not only have I always been a very nervous/shy person, there was also a lot of problems in the home and at school, as well as some other personal issues. Got diagnosed with GAD about 13-14 years ago. My anxiety is at its worse when I'm having intrusive thoughts or spending too much time thinking about something that is triggering. However I've also noticed that I'll get that horrible anxiety/butterfly feeling in my stomach at random times even when I'm not thinking about anything. It's as if anxiety is such a normal thing for me that my body produces it without me needing to even think about it. It makes sense I guess, your body gets used to the feeling and trains itself to thinking it's natural. I've just never heard of/read about this kind of thing. 

Does anyone else have this?"	FloatsAlong0	post	30.98701843883874	male	White	0.03211254999041557	na	na	na	2	anxiety	no prediction.

"I (30M) have never had any erectile problems. However, during the past month I've been going through a very stressful period, sleeping 5 hours instead of the 8-9 my body needs, fatigued, lack of appetite, and stressed out from alot of different factors, including some panic attacks even. I've noticed that it is taking me like 5x the time to get an erection lately, and even when I do its not as hard. I do get hard in foreplay but even then I notice that it takes much more time than usual and im not as  hard - I used to get one immediately.

I also have been smoking way more than usual.

Just recently started having extreme health anxiety primarily surrounding my heart. I was diagnosed with hypertension 2 weeks ago and have been absolutely spiraling since. I cannot make myself calm down and I don't know what to do. I've been having palpitations very frequently all day every day and I feel like my heart rate has slowed down significantly. Thursday night I kept habitually checking my rate and saw that it got down to 52 BPM while I was lying in bed. I know logically that there is most likely nothing wrong. I had an echocardiogram last week which came back entirely normal. My blood work was all normal as well. I also saw my GP and spoke with my cardiologist who told me that my low heart rate was nothing to be concerned about since I'm very young and healthy. But I still cannot stop obsessively googling, and checking my heart rate/ blood pressure. I have been to the ER twice this last week because I was convinced I had a heart attack. But my ECGs and my cardiac enzymes are all completely normal. I'm now convincing myself that I have sleep apnea because I googled it and now o keep catching myself not breathing when I try to sleep. I am so tired. I have an appointment with a psychiatrist this coming Wednesday but I don't think I can wait until then. I am just so scared and I've never had anything like this happen to me before.

"Why would you quit your job? Sounds like the job went well! It's normal to have some anxiety during transition periods (especially if this is your first job), go easy on yourself. Your panic will probably go away once you settle into your new job. I know panic is very uncomfortable, but it can't actually hurt you. So you definitely won't make it things better by stressing about the panic itself. Just ride the wave when it comes. 

I would also consider opening up to your parents about this, just to let them know what you're going through.

"I've suffered from anxiety for my whole life and have also been a ""light"" self-harmer since the age of six.  Specifically, when overloaded and angry, I will sometimes punch my legs, bite my hands, or pinch myself.  I'm in my thirties now and have tried to stop.  I've been going to weekly therapy for family issues (brother has bullied me my whole life) and job stress (career teacher and don't feel cut out for it).  I'm on meds prescribed by my psychiatrist.  The meds have been switched up many times and do little to help unfortunately.  

I desperately want to stop the self harm.  I've done research and have utilized all of the techniques that are suggested online.  Nothing seems to help.  I'm afraid of repercussions if I bring up self-harm to my psych and therapist.  I've read online that this is on the line for being ""reportable"" and I'm a foster parent.  I've fostered 1-2 kids at a time for the past 5 years and it has been rewarding.  I would never hurt a child or anyone else...aside from myself.  I'm by no means suicidal.  I fear that opening up to the professionals in my life could come back and bite me in the ass.  

Has anyone had experience with this?  Any suggestions?  I want help that is more tailored to my situation but I'm concerned that I could potentially lose my fostering license.

"I don‚Äôt know if you could put this accommodation in ahead of time and if it would be approved. But my daughter would have extended periods of time where her anxiety would flare. And she would need to come home. And she would need extensions on her work. And miss more classes than the professor allowed. 

What she did was contact a certain department at her college (can‚Äôt remember the name) and provide them with a doctors note from her psychiatrist. And that department would pass along that doctors note to her professors. She would email her professors as well explaining the situation. Her professors may have not been obligated to grant her extensions and extra allowable absences. I‚Äôm not sure. But they always did. I think it helped that my daughter was a great student. Who did well when she was feeling well. Participated when she was feeling well. And her college was very liberal and really valued mental health.  

But my best advise would be to have an open dialogue with your professors.  If you even think you might need an extension communicate that to them and ask for one before the due date. If you end up not needing the extension no harm done. If you are nervous about presenting, communicate that to them well before the presentation date.

The more you do something(as long as you aren't purposely holding on to the anxiety)more confidence the  you get. That's neuroscience and psychology.

Hey there I am 22 and I have just recently felt episodes in which I believe were panic attacks.

You have to just let it pass. Allow the anxiety to do its worse. You don't want to communicate to your brain that you should be afraid of anxiety sensations. That will cause it to happen more frequently. Despite having a panic attack or anxiety continue throughout your day as if you weren't having it. You beat panic attacks by communicating to your brain it is incorrectly perceiving threats. Why are you having panic attacks? Idk.

I‚Äôm going to try to make this short but enough information people can understand where my head space is at. I‚Äôm a recovering alcoholic of 1 and a 1/2 years. Got sober after almost dying in the hospital and being in the icu for two months. I was self medicating for a anxiety disorder and I was running from my problems and trauma in the only way I knew how. I‚Äôve been on lexapro 20mg for about a year and 5mg diazepam/ propanolol as needed. I only use the diazepam maybe 3-8 times a month depending on what going on. Here recently I‚Äôve been seeing a therapist once every two weeks, but my anxiety is getting worst and I sometimes can‚Äôt even make it to the appointments and cancel. I‚Äôll be up for 24 hours because of worsening anxiety symptoms. It‚Äôs been getting worse for about two month and my therapist recommended I switched medication. Well within the last two weeks I‚Äôve been given worse news about my health and I was exposed to a Situation that triggered a very traumatic memory for me. I‚Äôve been in a hole of panic and anxiety. Also still coping with being a new diabetic because I lost 80% pancreas from being so sick.

You are dealing with so much. I have been making a list of the things that help me when it gets really bad. Last week I started taking cold showers and it was a game changer for me. The discomfort of the cold water for 2 minutes was nothing compared to the pain of the anxiety and the positive effects lasted all day. Dr Hubberman has a great podcast on cold therapy. I did find it much easier to get into a warm shower and then slowly keep making it colder.

"I‚Äôm a 28F. I‚Äôve suffered from anxiety my whole life, since before I even had a name for it. I suspect I also suffer from depression and possibly ADHD, but anxiety is the main thing.  
I have a stable job, savings, a college degree, and am about to get my first apartment in the very immediate future. I‚Äôm ‚Äúput together‚Äù in a lot of ways. And I generally have normal relationships with people and don‚Äôt do anything to drive them away. Honestly, I have always been introverted but have gotten better with age. The exception to this as a kid was my mom, who I always had a strong connection and was definitely overly attached to. Now an adult, that has gone away, but it‚Äôs carried over to romantic relationships. In the beginning stages, I‚Äôm good about being level-headed, calm, and not overtexting them. But when my feelings grow or they start to show signs of losing interest, I tend to get very anxious about losing them and overtext trying to keep them. Rationally, I know that this does not work, but my anxiety gets in the way and pushes them further away.  
Recently I was in a casual relationship with someone several years older than me whom I cared deeply about and loved. We vibed better than anyone I‚Äôve ever met. But he broke it off due to personal issues and the age gap. I worry that he may have found me emotionally immature and not liked me texting too much, even though I am well rounded in many other areas and overall a good person.  
I think my issue is that 1.) I get very invested in people I have a deep connection with and try a little too hard to keep that connection 2.) my mind simply moves too fast, as it does for most of us anxiety sufferers. Especially if I am sitting doing nothing, I tend to overthink or overtext my romantic partners about just random things and silly details about my day. But I find it difficult to get into hobbies to distract myself due to my anxiety and short attention span. 
I am in therapy and have tried a few medications for anxiety to no avail. I am prescribed Lexapro and tried it for the first time the other day, but it immediately gave me terrible side effects, so I decided to not continue taking it.
It‚Äôs such a catch-22 issue, because my anxiety causes me to ‚Äúbe too much‚Äù in relationships in order to keep the connection going, but in turn, this drives people away and hurts hope of anything in the future. I realize I need to be happy on my own, but it‚Äôs an everyday battle when you have anxiety.

"Go through each of your senses and identify them in the room.

3 things you see
3 things you smell
3 things you can feel
3 things you can hear
Etc

Alternatively, you can do literal feet on the floor grounding, in which you shift as much weight/pressure as you can with your feet on the floor.

You can also keep a glass of ice cubes next to you. Hold on ice cube and let it melt in your hand. You can then use your cold hand to touch your temples and stuff.

Very sour candies like Warheads or a splash of cold water also works wonders. These things kind of startle you and put you ""back in your body"".

"I'm (M29) and I was on Zoloft from around 12-21. I weaned off because the side effects. I realized How much it Was numbing me and I decided that enough was enough. Its been about 8 years since Ive been on it and although I manage my anxiety day today, I realize that I am living a severely compromised life and I could be so much happier with some kind of intervention

I have both a family member and a significant other who takes buspar for their own types of anxiety and they both have been doing fantastic on it. I had a meeting with my doctor and he agreed that it would be a safe thing to try without having a lot of consequences.

He wrote me a script and I'm about to go pick it up but I'm scared to try this medication. I realize that it is safer than others, but what I am concerned about is everything I read seems to point that this is a short term medication. I see a lot of things recommending that you only take it for up to a year. 

&#x200B;

* What happens after that year mark?
* Is it normal to take this medication by itself and not with another anxiety medication for people that have generalized anxiety disorder like myself?

One night I went to get ice cream after thinking about it for about two weeks because of rabies fear, I finally did it a couple of days ago, and I instantly regreted it. The area has light and there were people hanging outside of the ice cream place but that was pretty much the only place where people were. After leaving the ice cream place I walked back to my home, it was dark around me. Recently I have though back to this because I came across a video about rabies, and I could not stop thinking about if i contracted rabies unknowingly by a bat in the back of my neck (or somewhere were i cannot see the bite or scratch mark) while walking to my home, is it just anxiety or should I should I actually be worried. I have talked to people about it and they have not given me very good answers, I also asked AI and that was no help either. What should I do?

"Xanax increases GABA in the brain, which promotes a calm and relaxed feeling. First time you take it, you may feel drowsy - somewhar similar to taking a Benedryl. With a calm body, your mind follows.

You may still have anxious thoughts, but you won't feel it in your body as much, so the thoughts don't feel as scary. 

Xanax kicks in pretty fast, like 15-20 minutes and is basically gone after a few hours, so it's not something you'll suffer from if you don't like the feeling. I'd suggest taking the first dose before bed or on a weekend so you can see how you feel on it without having to go to work or run errands.

"Most people will try multiple medications before finding one that works for them. Initially they'll start you on an SSRI. It'll take two weeks to reach peak levels and after that you'll have a true idea of whether it's working or if there are annoying side effects. If that doesn't work, it's essentially trial and error. You try a med, give it a shot, go back to your doctor, report how you feel, rinse and repeat. Everyone has individual body chemistry so what works for one person may not work for you.

Meds lower the severity of anxiety in your body, allowing you to manage the anxiety better and be more productive. Initially you may have the same anxious thoughts, but they won't feel like the gut punch they currently do. If the thoughts don't make you feel as anxious, they way less on you and you take them less seriously over time. 

Therapy is about adjusting how you view the world and your anxiety. Anxiety is a thought disorder, so you essentially see an issue or worry differently than how non-anxious people see them. Therapy helps you identify why the way you look at something is harmful and teaches you how to view it in a different light.

Ideally, you want to throw as much shit at the wall and see what sticks. The harder you work and the more you do about and learn about your anxiety, the more you will improve. That's where meds really help because anxiety itself makes it really hard to work on anxiety. Personally, I tried meds until I found what worked for me, I read tons of books - cognitive behavioral therapy, philosophy topics like zen Buddhism, stoicism, etc, I spent time each day calling bullshit on my anxious thoughts, I built positive habits that made me feel good and productive, I worked on all issues that made me feel bad about myself. Eventually I hit a point where I could function without much issues. If I get an anxious thought now, it's pretty easy to ignore or I'll just do something about it immediately."

"Meds is definitely the first step. Schedule an appointment with a psychiatrist if you can. A primary doctor can and will prescribe SSRIs, but they're not specialists. Take inventory of your symptoms before the appointment. Write down what anxiety does to your body and also what it does to your thoughts. If you have gotten panic attacks, mention that too.

Meds is all about communicating. Each session you repeat the symptoms you have, identify side effects of you have them, and report what is better on the meds. It's trial and error, but over time you'll find a combination that makes you feel significantly less anxious without side effects that bother you. 

Even if your anxiety is cut in half, wouldn't that be amazing? Think of how much more freedom and enjoyment you'd get out of life if it were only cut in half. But the better part is, once you no longer are severely anxious it allows you to begin the real work on undoing anxious habits. Because you've probably been anxious for awhile and developed anxious habits. Initially you might be worried about going into the community or socializing - because that's how you've viewed those things for awhile now. Then you'll push yourself a bit and think, wow this isn't as bad as I expected. You'll be able to push your comfort zone more and more. Plus, doing something, anything, about your anxiety will make you feel better about yourself."	VintageFrog442	reply	na	na	na	0.004523287061601877	no	no	no	na	anxiety	no prediction.
Are there even any benefits, or do you only need to block the b1 receptors? I currently use propranolol for this, which is a nonselective beta blocker so it blocks both b1 and b2.

"Beta blockers block the release of the stress hormones adrenaline and noradrenaline in certain parts of the body. It essentially makes your heart beat slower and less forcefully.

It works for anxiety because anxiety is felt in the body and the body and mind are connected. Calm body , calm mind. If you're having anxious thoughts, but your body isn't reacting as if it's anxious, then it will feel less mentally impactful.

Panic attacks are also when anxiety meets adrenaline. So beta blockers also do a good job of preventing anxiety from progressing into a panic attack.

It's a really good medical medication for anxiety that has few side effects. A lot of people afraid of psychotropic meds try beta blockers first.

"Some history: have been living along side anxiety for the past 5 years, was diagnosed with panic disorder previously. At my worst, I was agoraphobic but managed to thrive after cbt therapy with a psychologist.

However, over the years, I've sort of realised that my few seconds of dizziness that seems to appear out of nowhere may well be because I was holding in my breath/or breathing in a shallow manner. The more focused I am on a task (wanting to finish it asap), the less I tend to breathe. I also hold a lot of tension in my stomach area. I am always sucking in my guts and I'm typing this now in a crouched manner.   

I'm tired of feeling this way, and would really appreciate any tips or things I can do to better manage this. How to breathe deeper or release the tension in the gut area, I would be FOREVER grateful if someone can point me to the correct resources.

Many thanks in advance!"	Odd_Hawk_3095	post	28.839684120067616	male	White	0.002515011467039585	na	na	na	1	anxiety	no prediction.
"I assume you‚Äôre aware of this, but generally speaking this is where developing and practicing mindfulness will help you. By mindfulness I mean technique‚Äôs that focus on your attention to your present tense and environment -  such as meditation, focusing on characteristics of what you see/smell/hear/feel, describing how your body feels, etc‚Ä¶ 

Ideally this allows your body to return to a more relaxed baseline with regular breathing and more relaxed muscles."	Odd_Hawk_3095	reply	na	na	na	0.002515011467039585	no	no	no	na	anxiety	no prediction.

"Hello I‚Äôve seen some posts similar to this but more so wondering if anybody who‚Äôs dealt with this had success with a medication. Basically I have no problem falling asleep but I‚Äôll wake up usually a few hours later with a mini panic attack. There was a period of time where I‚Äôd wake up nearly every morning with a bad panic attack, vomiting and everything. I can‚Äôt seem to figure out what the cause is because it‚Äôs been years, I‚Äôve tried multiple medications and I went to therapy for a while which helped a lot with my general anxiety. My issue seems to be happening while I‚Äôm asleep and I can never remember my dreams so I‚Äôve had the suspicion that maybe I‚Äôm having nightmares. I exercise every day and try to keep good sleep patterns but without fail, every morning is a struggle. If there is ever a big event in my life (interview, first date, moving etc) then my problems persist for nearly a week leading up to those events.  I‚Äôm trapped in the flight or flight response for days at a time and feel really worn out when I‚Äôm finally able to eat and sleep again. 

So my question to anybody who has struggled with this, what was the cure? I‚Äôve tried searching for underlying things but really nothing is relevant, I‚Äôm happy with my job, the person I started seeing is great, I guess my only worry is worry itself, I‚Äôm afraid it will come back and debilitate me like it did before. I‚Äôve tried multiple medications including busparone, Zoloft, and celexa."	Phenex1802	post	23.094744576401183	male	White	0.9979902505874634	na	na	na	0	anxiety	no prediction.

"I'm hoping some of you might have some insight or personal experiences to share. I recently started taking Source Naturals Magnesium Glycinate, as I've heard great things about its benefits for relaxation and sleep. However, the reaction I've been having is quite the opposite.  
I've been taking 2 tablets of Magnesium Glycinate (200 mg) twice daily for the past week, and the physical anxiety symptoms I've been experiencing are overwhelming. Heart palpitations, racing thoughts, jitteriness, and an overall sense of restlessness have become my constant companions. I've haven't had physical anxiety and dread like this for years, and it's incredibly distressing. I even called out of work because I felt so anxious.  
I did some research and found that magnesium is often recommended to help reduce anxiety symptoms, so I'm really confused about what's going on. I've done some other research saying this is a possible side effect. Has anyone else had a similar reaction to magnesium supplements, especially magnesium glycinate? If so, did these symptoms eventually subside, and how long did it take for things to get better?  
I'm planning to stop taking the supplement immediately, as I can't handle these symptoms any longer. But I'm worried about how long it might take for my body to return to normal. Could this be an initial reaction that will pass, or should I be concerned about a longer-lasting impact?  
Of course, I'll also be reaching out to a healthcare professional about this, but I wanted to tap into the collective wisdom of this community to see if anyone else has been through something similar. Any advice, personal stories, or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance for your help! üôè

"I know this is not normal. 

Conflicts with roommate have caused me(21F) to start shaking uncontrollably to the point where I can still stand/wobble but have been dropping things. It lasts for anywhere up to an hour and sends my heart rate to 170-180bpm. Afterwards it leaves me felling drained and frustrated (since the conflicts are never resolved), but I can hold onto things without dropping anything.

I have tried controlled breathing with little success, as it's hard to get it under control in that state. Tried sleeping it off, but hard to fall asleep like that. Melatonin does not help.

After the shaking stops, some light exercise has helped me get back to where I was before.

"I'm sorry you're deling with this. Sounds like the root of the problem would be resolved by moving out or getting a new roommate. A bit of conflict with roommates is normal, but excessive conflict that is leading to significant mental/physical problems IMO is not worth it. 

In the meantime, my best advice is to simply let the anxiety pass naturally. Don't try to ""control it"" or make it go forcefully away. Your body doesn't work that way, there's no ""instant relax"" light switch. In fact, trying to force calm often backfires and creates more tension and stress. Your body actually has a built in mechanism for going back to baseline, so just let it naturally do that. 

So just continuing your day/evening even if you're feeling a bit shaky, do what you would normally do at that time, and allow it to pass."	Decent_Temperature70	reply	na	na	na	0.9979937076568604	strong	no	no	na	anxiety	no prediction.

Once I earned that it helped me get away.

They are usually about 12 hours and don't have commercials so you don't have to come back after 1.5 hours or deal with commercials. You also don't have to look at something. If you try that I suggest books with dual narration. Books with only one person read them suck because on person is trying to do both sexes. Dual a guy does the guy parts and a girl does the girl parts and it flows a lot better. Actors Everywhere is a group that is outstanding. Jessica Threet is out of this world with different voices.

"Overview of the situation: My wife's sister has struggled with severe anxiety and OCD for 3+ years. She stopped seeing a therapist a year ago and has not been back since. Her husband has run out of ideas and is worried he will have to exit the marriage. Over the weekend he asked for my wife and I to help him convince her to seek help. 

&#x200B;

Finer Details: My wife's sister has experienced low-levels of anxiety since she was a kid. It was never a problem, mostly stress-induced. In 2020 she went remote for work and developed a severe anxiety and OCD towards cleanliness. Not necessarily scared of COVID, but just felt like the world around her is dirty or ""infected"". She stopped allowing people in their home (they recently moved and we are allowed in the home now), couldn't enter multiple rooms in their old house, constantly washing herself to the point of frequent bleeding from dry skin, refused to ride in her husband's vehicle, requiring her husband to clean himself in a certain way (I'll touch more on this later), throwing away MANY large items in their house because ""everything was dirty"", but the worst is how she has to watch herself navigate the house using camera systems or she records herself on her iPhone that way she can review the footage to ensure nothing dirty in their house is touching her. 

Her husband has undoubtedly enabled her this whole time, and he understands that now. He comes from a family of enablers, works long hours, and used that as an excuse to ""just do what she wants"" that way he can relax after the cleaning routines. I have witnessed first hand when he arrives home from work he can't touch anything in the house, has to go straight to the shower and she supplies him with a disposable cup full of specific soap that he has to wash himself with. Then he has to retrace his steps and wipe down every surface that he may have touched or stepped on. 

Over the weekend, her husband informed me that he has told her he won't be doing the cleaning routines any more and that he can't support her in that way while she refuses to get help. His next words were ""I don't want to lose my wife, but if she doesn't get help I won't be able to live like this anymore"". He says she dismisses anything he has to say about getting help, and refuses to have the conversations. My wife's sister tends to listen to us and our opinions, and her husband has asked that we try to help convince her to seek help. We don't believe she is a harm to herself, but we also don't know what kind of reaction she will have if she finds out he is considering divorce because of her. 

So my question is, should we help? If so, what are some ways we can encourage her to seek help on her own? My wife and I both know that nothing will get accomplished unless she decides she wants to get better.

"I know it feels impossible right now, and I cannot begin to imagine what you're going though. But keep going one step at a time. 

I know it can be hard to be rational when the weight of the world is on your shoulders, so I've popped a few thoughts below. Please don't take them as failings or anything on your part, or as patronising, I'm just hoping they may help you be able to see above the trees.

Firstly, money is a huge worry for anyone, if your bills are higher than your salary and the salary isn't going to increase maybe try to up-skill so you can try to find a better job or find a new job with a higher pay. There's a decent video relating to how to do this here - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFA8AS5Cu2w](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFA8AS5Cu2w)    
It's going to be time-consuming and hard short term, especially if you're trying to hold down a job and care for your mother. Maybe it'll take months, but if you can change the situation over the long term, in 5 years from now you'll be glad you did.  
If it's just a case of your outgoings being too high, remove everything that isn't essential, so you can get on top of the bills and then either up-skill, change jobs or try to get higher in your company so you can get above the financial problems.   
Ultimately, what I'm getting at is to find the things you can control, so you can start to shift your story, and life. I know the above doesn't remove the other problems but it's one part of the puzzle. 

With your mum and life, I'd say find some space for 'you' time even if it's just watching some TV or indulging in your favourite food, or a walk, just something to bring light into your life. And give yourself a break, you sound like an absolute warrior with so much on your plate, most people would struggle in your position, you're an incredible person to be doing what you are. 

As for your Dr, find a new one, they sound awful, you deserve better. 

Don't give up on life. I think most people with anxiety have felt like giving up in the past, but years later you're always glad you didn't give up. As ultimately there will come a time when things get better, you've just got to hang in there. Life is long, and this hardship won't be there forever. Take care and look after you, you're an amazing human and maybe one day you'll be able to help someone else in a similar boat find the courage to carry on :)"	ElegantJuggernaut475	reply	na	na	na	0.9986926913261414	weak	no	no	na	anxiety	no prediction.
"I apologised and turned the music off. To be honest I didn‚Äôt realise how late it had got.

It happens, it‚Äôs fine! Sometimes people don‚Äôt realize they‚Äôre doing something that‚Äôs disruptive to others, and you handled the situation exactly the way you should (except for the feeling frozen part).

"So here's the thing.  Put yourself in your neighbor's shoes.  You said he didn't yell?  Wasn't rude?  Probably mentioned it just because it was a moment of opportunity?  All of that tells me it didn't bother him too badly.  If it was really a problem, he'd have knocked on your door.  Or even pounded on the wall, or floor, or ceiling.

Truth be told, he's probably forgotten about this encounter, or at least considers the whole thing over.  He said what he needed to, and he's going on with his life.  He probably has no idea the effect his comment has made on you.

Which means, if he doesn't consider it a big deal, why do you need to consider it a big deal?

You sound like a considerate person.  You admit you didn't realize how late it was.  Guess what?  It's happened to everyone.  You're allowed to make a mistake.  It's okay.  If you really want to try to clear it up any further, the next time you happen to see him, apologize for the loud music.  And 99% chance he'll say ""oh, yeah, thanks for the apology.  No big deal.  I appreciate you turning the music down.""  And again, that's that.

And you don't need to go any further -- ""yeah, I was really enjoying it, it was one of my favorite groups, time just got by, I'd had a really good day and I just wanted to celebrate with my favorite group"" etc. -- he doesn't need to hear any of that.  The conversation can be as short as described above; nothing further is needed.

If a friend of yours described what you just described, how would you react?  What would you say?  ""Your neighbor didn't say anything else?  Then it's fine.  Just be careful on the volume next time.  I'm sure everything's still good between you and your neighbor.  He sounds like a cool guy.""

"I get these feelings too. Im a people pleaser and hate feeling like I've inconvenienced someone or that they're annoyed with me.

But the fact that the neighbor politely asked you to turn it down and you did they're probably feeling super relieved that they asked and you complied. If you're super worried about it, maybe you can check in again and just say you're sorry the music was loud and you didn't realize and if it's gotten any better.

That sounds like you're feeling your carotid pulse. Normally, when checking for a pulse, people check for it higher up the neck, nearer to the jaw, but the carotid artery runs the whole length of the neck, so you can feel the pulse lower down as well. In some people, you can feel it and in some you can't. Sometimes you can see it, particularly if someone is thin or their heart is beating harder or faster than at rest, or just if they're sitting very still.	goldenpanchax	reply	na	na	na	0.9971717000007629	no	no	no	na	anxiety	no prediction.

"I met with my long-ish distance bf for the weekend and then walked with him to train station, for his train.

We both were very tired, so instead of writing to him soon, I told him I'll only write in the evening, so he'll have time to chill.

I wrote 3 messages, every two hours, and called twice at 1am, in the night but he's not answering and I'm thinking the worst things happened, including accident, robbery, death

I don't know how to deal with that anxiety, and if I'm being unreasonable.

Thank you all for the answers, it did calm me down and after couple hours I fell asleep.

I'm sorry to write that, as it may make somes anxiety stronger. 

I got a message from my boyfriend in the early morning, saying that he got food poisoning (despite us eating early that day, before the train). Passed out in his room, and by miracle not choked on being sick. He just woke up couple hours ago and got aware what happened.

The more ridiculous the better as it helps deflate the worry. Our minds can go to the worst thing possible and get stuck on it. So feed it some dumb things to run out of steam. In the mean time do something for yourself. Take a long bath, get some food that you really like, watch that movie you really want to watch. Do some self-care and self-loving. He has your messages and call to show you care and were checking on him so he is set. He will reply, in the mean time live your life.

"I'm not a medical professional, just another person with anxiety and a stroke history.

I have seen comments on here about magnesium helping with anxiety.  I can't honestly say whether it's helped me or not.  It was suggested to me (along with riboflavin) for preventing migraine headaches.  I can tell you it does wonders in that arena.  I still sometimes get an aura, but rarely do I get pain.  And if I get pain, it's about a 0.5 on a 0-10 scale.

Far as I know, magnesium is generally safe.  You can get it over the counter.  I take 400 mg daily.  I split it up as 200 in the AM, 200 at night.  My stroke neurologist also recommended another 200 mg for an acute migraine.  That's a total of 600 mg a day in the worst case with no ill effect.  You mention magnesium glycinate, and this is the form that was recommended to me.

I found Healthline to be a pretty direct, no-nonsense medical Web site.  Here is their article about magnesium, the different forms, and uses.  It mentions depression.  No mention of anxiety.  [https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/magnesium-dosage](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/magnesium-dosage)

I've never been one to be big on medications, but with my medical history now, it's inevitable.  I prefer to take the medications that have a purpose and get off the meds that no longer serve a purpose.  I just got off my high blood pressure medication; it's regulating well on its own.  But I've adopted the attitude, if you need it, take it.  That's what it's there for.  If you don't need it, don't take it.  You're looking for something to help, and it might do that.  It's benign enough that you can probably try it for a while and see if it helps.

But, as always, it's never a bad idea to check with your doctor."	YungRomeow	reply	na	na	na	0.006235920358449221	no	strong	no	na	anxiety	no prediction.

Most of the population is deprieved of magnesium because there is less and less of it in vegetables. 40 years ago, someone eating an healthy amount of vegetables would get them all the magnesium they need. Its not true anymore in 2023.	YungRomeow	reply	na	na	na	0.006235920358449221	no	strong	no	na	anxiety	no prediction.
i (24f) went to a swimming hole with a waterfall yesterday with some friends, it wasn‚Äôt a super high waterfall but i can‚Äôt swim and i‚Äôm terrified of water and heights, i felt pressured and i jumped off the 6 ft cliff into the water, i looked terrified and i didn‚Äôt even jump, i walked off  when i went down and i tried again and i did the same thing again bc i was overthinking it, my friends laughed and i feel embarrassed. i kept saying i didn‚Äôt even want to do it bc i didn‚Äôt. i know it isn‚Äôt a big deal, and i‚Äôm more upset with myself because i feel like i can never do anything right and i always embarrass myself	Purple-Bass-9003	post	13.173291536861463	female	White	0.9991795420646667	na	na	na	3	anxiety	no prediction.
"Umm - you walked off a 6ft waterfall, into a swimming hole, even though you are terrified of water and heights. That's pretty brave of you, yet you feel embarrassed.

I think your friends were laughing because you did it (humans do laugh when someone does something brave and they are proud of the person doing whatever it is), not because they were making fun of you.

Here's what to do:  go the the most trusted friend in this group and ask ""So, were you surprised that I jumped off that cliff, even though I was terrified?"" and see how they respond.

&#x200B;

I, too, thought I did something that was stupid, years ago.  For some reason, my brain decided to remind me of that event & it troubled me that I might have embarrassed myself in front of others, which included my dad.  Funny enough, he mentioned that very same event the next day on a call... ""Remember when you did xxx?  Man, that was freakin' cool!""  My point is, don't rely on your own perception of an event.

"Don‚Äôt stress about it, because ironically, stress induces a fight or flight response. Thus your body increases your heart rate and tightens your blood vessels.

Yep. One of the meds I was out on when I jumped on the pharmaceutical train this last time was a blood pressure medication (not beta blockers for the anxiety). After a few months when my acute attacks became more manageable it returned to normal in the in between parts.

"Hey there! I'm not a doctor, but I can definitely share some insights that might help you understand the connection between anxiety and blood pressure spikes. While genetics can play a role in high blood pressure, stress, and anxiety can also have a significant impact on your blood pressure levels.  
When you're anxious or stressed, your body releases stress hormones like adrenaline, which can cause your heart rate to increase and your blood vessels to constrict. This, in turn, can lead to a temporary spike in blood pressure. Over time, chronic stress and anxiety could potentially contribute to long-term HBP.

"Hi Everyone,

First time poster here.

I (F28) have met an amazing man (M27) and we have been in a relationship now for almost 5 months.

Everything has been so great from the very start of the relationship and it has been a big change for me after coming out of a long term relationship of 7 years in 2021 which was quite toxic toward the end of things - it was not a mutual decision to split, but we didn‚Äôt love each other anymore so was for the best. 

I am just so terrified that I will screw this relationship up and find myself second guessing everything and am always thinking to myself it is a matter of time before he gets tired of me. I have voiced this to him, and his is so understanding and reassuring so I‚Äôm not sure why I‚Äôm still feeling this way. The relationship is completely healthy in the sense of communication, chemistry and everything in between. It was so easy when we were getting to know each other and feels like a breeze.

I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs just the fact that I‚Äôm afraid that after my 7 year relationship I don‚Äôt want to be hurt again, and feel the feelings that I felt back then but the thoughts can get very overwhelming. I‚Äôm also unsure if it‚Äôs the fact that everything is going so well I‚Äôm just doubting myself. As I said, I‚Äôm so happy with this man and I genuinely think that he is the one.

I have always suffered with anxiety so often find myself overthinking the smallest things, and had a period where the level of anxiety was quite low, but it seems to have come back with a vengeance. Not just with this relationship but with other things in my life too.

Does anyone have any advice or has went through the same issue?"	Practical_Top254	post	19.438114654393235	female	White	0.001509159803390503	na	na	na	6	anxiety	no prediction.
"I struggled a lot with relationship anxiety at the start of a relationship. My best advice is to shift your perspective. Stop stressing so much over what someone thinks of YOU and start focusing on what you think of them.

Instead of worrying about: do they like me? Do they find me boring, etc. Ask yourself: Do you like THEM? Do you feel good/safe around them? Are you having fun with them? Do they behave in a way that makes you feel cared for and loved?  

When you're hyper-focused on being liked/chosen, you tend to lose sight of how you feel about the other person. This can lead us down the path of allowing people to treat us poorly and a lot of other behaviour that lowers our self-esteem and perpetuates relationship anxiety. Remember, you are a great person, I'm sure, and you are choosing him as much as he's choosing you. He should be trying to impress you too, etc."	Practical_Top254	reply	na	na	na	0.001509159803390503	no	strong	no	na	anxiety	no prediction.

I think I do in my own head for sure - I don‚Äôt seek verbal reassurance from my partner often as he often voices himself that he‚Äôs really happy that we met and loves me etc. I feel that I‚Äôve found something so great but due to previous failures that it‚Äôs only bound to happen again!

Okay. The way to work with that is, whenever you start being scared you might break up or something, tell yourself in your head that maybe you will. The point is to accept the uncertainty. I understand it's hard, but this approach is the right way. This is all coming from being uncomfortable with uncertainty. And by making peace with uncertainty, the fear loses power, making it slowly stop.	Practical_Top254	reply	na	na	na	0.001509159803390503	weak	no	no	na	anxiety	no prediction.
"Things have just been moving faster and faster every year. I have less energy or desire to do things which makes me even more scared for how quickly time is moving by.

I feel like I should be more mature and know what I want in life at this point so I can spend my time doing it.

"Seeing civil society slowly collapse around us during the last few years has been to me an indication that no one at any age actually has their shit together, and we‚Äôre all just a bunch of clueless hairless apes on a rock in space playing pretend. 

It‚Äôs all made up, almost every part of everyone‚Äôs identity is a social construct, and all the institutions we box ourselves into were invented by people far less knowledgeable than you decades or centuries ago and persist solely on inertia. None of it has any inherent meaning.

It‚Äôs easy to internalize self-loathing when you don‚Äôt meet the standards set by this world, but that‚Äôs just your primate brain causing you to react as social creatures do to social pressure.

Move at whatever pace you can, and don‚Äôt let anyone tell you that you‚Äôre somehow bad for doing things differently. In the grand scheme of things practically none of the stuff our society considers important actually matter. But in your life right here and now, you matter. You matter to those who care about you, and you should matter to yourself. 

Try focusing on that instead of what other people might say or where your life is headed.

"You're not being dramatic. I hate when people say that because of how dismissive it is. No, your concerns make perfect sense because of the immense pressure we're under as young people. It's like every time I log into social media I'm reminded of all the ways in which my life is inadequate, and the news is no better because the world is literally on fire. 

But the way you think about youth and life is nothing new. It's something that the vast majority of people worry about. I personally know quite a few older adults (60+ years old) who are obsessed with youth and feeling young again. 

But nothing is forever. Everything is changing all the time and life once lived can never be lived the same way again. Some people are caught up on the death aspect of change. They think that change is defined by loss. But another way to look at it is that things are constantly being born. The universe is dying every second, but it's also being created every second. 

Growing older has its disadvantages, but it has so many beautiful advantages over youth, and those advantages might surprise you. One day you might look back on your 20s and laugh about how worried you were over nothing, because you've learned to make peace with the uncertain nature of life. Of the very nature of the existence of all things. 

I know that doesn't directly address your fears. I just wanted to say that I hear so many people talk about how important it is to set yourself up financially for the future, and that to live a comfortable life in old age you'll need to have $X amount saved up. That certainly is important, however one thing that's rarely talked about, one thing that's often laughed off is what I like to call spiritual retirement. If you do what you can now to begin developing yourself spiritually (I'm not talking about healing crystals and holy water), you will age gracefully. 

There's nothing better in my opinion than to learn learn how to gracefully deal with life's uncertainties. If you can do that, then you'll feel genuine gratitude for even the smallest things, and the weight of regret might lighten.

"You‚Äôre much too young for a mid-life crisis‚Ä¶ but here‚Äôs something to think about.

In 100 years, nearly everyone alive right now on the planet will be dead and replaced by a completely different set of assholes. The only guarantee that life gives every single one of us is that, one day, it will stop. Aging is an inevitable part of the cradle to grave Rube Goldberg machine we call life, but you can look at it two ways: a countdown or milestones.

We are all floating on a rock in the vast emptiness of space, and have defied every odd imaginable, to win the lottery of existing. Nothing alive has any inherent right to be. It is only through a vast array of really fortunate happenstances that our little ball of dirt has been able to churn out a person named u/deetsfordays, who will ask this question on Reddit. 

That‚Äôs the whole point/secret of life to me. There is no point. There is no secret. You are alive despite every single obstacle the universe has produced over the last few billion years to prevent it. Just live knowing that none of us should even be here at all. 

I will be 48 in October, and I have lived enough life for three people‚Ä¶ a lot of it wasn‚Äôt great, some of it was amazing, a little of it was both, but most of it has been interesting.

Even if I do something awful‚Ä¶ in 100 years‚Ä¶

Life does have a finish line, but it‚Äôs not a race, so don‚Äôt think of aging as getting closer to it. If you do, you‚Äôll either run faster toward it, or you‚Äôll give up and the line will come to you.

"Honestly? Youth is overrated. 30's are awesome (so far, I'm 31).

I used to overthink everything. If I wanted kids, what career I wanted to do forever, etc etc. Recently, I've realized I was mostly worrying over what society says adults should do. When I stopped considering anyone else's opinions, it was pretty clear what I did and didn't want. 

My husband and I aren't having kids. Other people comment on that, and it doesn't bother me like it did in my 20s. I work a manual labor job that pays decent. There are plenty of higher paying white collar jobs I could be doing instead, but I love my job. My free time and money goes towards doing things younger me couldn't afford. There's a sense of freedom and peace that comes when you stop obsessing over what your future should be, and start imagining what could be.

"OP, 20 years ago I felt that as well. Felt like I was faking my career. Couldn‚Äôt decide whether to have kids. Finished college late. Made very little money and just wanted to have fun. I could see others around me turning away from fun for ‚Äúgrownup‚Äù lives in the burbs. Time was passing but I felt this pressure that I couldn‚Äôt reconcile what I wanted with what I should be doing.

Fast forward 20 years, and it turned out just fine. I realized I could have kids and keep doing things I love. I realized I could move far away but still come back and visit loved ones. The career I thought I was faking is now a solid 20 years of invaluable experience and extremely rewarding. I live somewhere that I used to dream about. I finally got diagnosed with Anxiety this year, and in hindsight  my decades of hand wringing map perfectly to that diagnosis.

I wish I had started therapy and an SSRI 20 years ago, because now they‚Äôre helping me accept current reality and focus on being present, whereas before I was constantly ruminating on ‚Äúwhat might happen.‚Äù I don‚Äôt know if my own anecdote is helpful, but I believe in you, and I think you‚Äôll be just fine.

"I'm with you on this for sure. I've told my story a few times here but I'll tell it again because anxiety can happen for a million different reasons. 

Prior to March of this year I just worked, came home, played video games, repeated. My only stress point was my job and I had some anxiety about it but nothing too difficult to manage. March I started doing local standup comedy as a hobby. I found out I really liked it and wanted to keep doing it. If you want to get good at it you have to work on it as much as possible. This entails going to as many open mics as possible so I was out Monday - Thursday doing it. I have learned a lot about myself since then but one thing is I'm a perfectionist and so I put a lot of pressure on myself to be as good as possible. No one is expected to be amazing at standup right away but for me I compare myself to others way too much. I started having days of extreme worry so I decided to see a therapist. First off finding a therapist is extremely difficult because they're mostly overbooked. I think I have finally found someone to work with. 

Anyways it's a work in progress but it has been really hard. All I do is obsess about standup and worry about it even though no one cares if I do bad on any given night. My heart races and I don't find joy in anything. I work Monday - Friday and used to look forward to weekends but don't even do that anymore. I continue to work but it is so hard given the stress and anxiety it brings as well.

"I got a dna test and put it on a site where it basically shows what you're more at risk of having/developping. It's much more complicated than that, and I won't share the sites name to spare fellow hypocondriacs from looking into it, but basically it solidified what I always thought was going to happen to me; die of heart complications. I carry 2 copies of a gene for a rare heart disease and strokes. But the thing is, I always told myself I was going to die of a heart complication, if I don't get killed or k*ll myself first. So that didn't worry me too much.

My biggest fear is mental health. The site showed my biggest risk overall is schizophrenia. It took years to convince my anxiety I'm not schizophrenic, but I definetly took a hit after reading this and regressed back into my fears a bit. Scared of going crazy, my brain being ""damaged"" by that one weed bad trip, psychosis, schizophrenia, etc.

The reason I wanted to leave a comment tho is to say that on that same site once again, I found out I carry 2 copies of a gene for a rare degenerative eye disorder (fusch's disease I think it's called). However no one in my family has lost their vision or gone blind or has this disease, so I think my odds of actually developping it are pretty low.

So, I worry about many areas in my life and I am getting in thoughts spirals and that makes me feel horrible. But I will go to therapy, soon. As a diabetic, let me tell you - I was more afraid of the diagnosis and it was not necessary. I have it already for more than 15 years and everything is fine! I eat everything I want, I manage my blood sugar and I live a pretty normal life :). It means, that we imagine it a lot worse then it actually would be. The funny thing is, I worried about getting hypochondric as well. It sounds so horrible to me, that I rather worry about all things in general and it changes, than being constantly worried about getting sick. So, even if it was the worst case scenario, just remember: you will get through it, nothing bad will happen and you are strong enough to deal with diseases. Besides, I don't think that any of you will get diabetes and it's not even that bad in most cases...I know a lot more people without diabetes than with diabetes. I know a lot more people without cancer than with cancer. My grandpa beat cancer btw. And I know a lot more people without MS or strokes than with it. So, if you think what if you will get that disease, then also think about...what if you don't? And even if you do, then remember, you are strong enough to deal with it! These are just your thoughts and your anxiety tries to protect you...it doesn't mean anything and I am pretty sure that majority of you will stay healthy or will be able to deal with everything. You are stronger than you think, your mind is the only thing that is bordering you...I hope you all have a great day and that you there will be a time, where we all feel much more at ease ‚ù§Ô∏è	Anneber04	reply	na	na	na	0.017542917281389236	no	strong	no	na	anxiety	no prediction.

RABIES!!! All thanks to that one famous reddit post, if you know, you know!!

Rabies is so scary! I went down the rabbit hole of watching videos of animals and people who have it, fascinating but terrifying.  There was a girl that survived it though, they put her in a coma for a while and she lived. Her parents say she's totally different now though, even her voice.

"Hi everyone ! 
I (25F)have a quick question, so for a quick background I'm diagnosed adhd, depression and anxiety. After a breakup last year the two last really flared up worse than they used to (anxiety especially was already bad before that) 
So I'm typically a very fast texter, I see a message i answer (to avoid forgetting to answer & because I get fidgety and start complete panicking when I don't get quick answers ex: what did I do wrong, did I offend them, is my message bad, am I annoying them etc...) unless I'm in orchestra then I typically answer at the break and after the session ends, which is about 1h in between each 
I normally apologize for a slow reply after 30 minutes or so. Yesterday a friend I hadn't talked to in a while was shocked I apologize for what he considered a quick response.

So here is the question: how long after you received a text should you start apologizing for answering late ? 
And kind of second question: 
How do you deal with that stress mode when you are waiting for an answer? What are your tips and tricks to try and not overthink this?

"It seems like a common theme that people will mention that they ""used to"" take an SSRI and then it stopped working, and they either tried others and one worked, and then that eventually stopped working too, and they then went with therapy and lifestyle improvements like exercise and have treated their mental health problems without an SSRI for X years.

This is quite annoying and makes me want to not bother trying one if I know it's just going to stop working out of nowhere one day. It makes it seem like SSRIs are just a short-term crutch to get you to fix your life before they stop working or have bad side effects, basically."

"As someone who will always needs meds, it's not like I can change that so why not take meds that help? I started on SSRI's and they worked for a little over a decade. That's no short term fix. If SSRI's don't work for you then definitely don't stick with them, but part of getting help can include taking meds and if it works, it works. 

There are different kinds of anxiety conditions, some temporary, some longterm, some lifetime. No amount of exercise, therapy, and lifestyle changes can help in the lifetime aspect. Take all the anecdotes (even mine) with a grain of salt and work with your doctor to find something that works for you. Just because some people stopped being receptive to a drug does not mean that is everyone's experience. 

Stay open minded and keep a journal of how you're doing with any treatment. Better, worse, or the same today. Anything odd that might be a side effect of treatment? These little notes can help build a more complete picture of if something is working or not. Hope any of this helps."

"I think it's important to ask these questions and manage your expectations of medication. In my experience, Medication is a great tool, but it's not a cure-all, long or short-term. It definitely helped bring my anxiety down 80-90% and allowed me the breathing room to go to therapy. But it did not eradicate it. That's why therapy is a crucial piece of the puzzle for successful long-term recovery. 

In therapy, you learn to challenge the behaviours and thoughts that are driving or worsening your anxiety. Those maladaptive thoughts and behaviour will still be present even while you're on medication. For example, judging yourself harshly for your anxiety or chronically avoiding triggers. 

So if you want to heal your anxiety disorder long-term, you need to do this work to develop a healthier relationship with anxiety."	AidePast	reply	na	na	na	0.9990822076797485	no	strong	no	na	anxiety	no prediction.

I recently started seeing a psychiatrist for my anxiety and they started me on 5mg of Lexapro at night.

I‚Äôm shaking, overheating/getting cold, throwing up, having the runs, headaches, insomnia, no appetite, and dry mouth.

"I was on Lexapro for about a year and it really helped with my anxiety. I stopped for 1,5 years and currently I am restarting the medication (also 1 week in, 10mg tho).
I have similar side effects, my anxiety is much worse and I'm shaking and constantly cold.

If you can manage it, stick it out for another week, then the side effects should wear off. My anxiety took some time to disappear, I would say 1-2 months."	bromannhorsejack	reply	na	na	na	0.9992514252662659	no	strong	no	na	anxiety	no prediction.
"So last night me and two other coworkers who don‚Äôt usually work Saturday nights were asked to come in with the reward of a different day that we normally work off instead because we had a busy week unloading 12 trucks in 7 days at our retail store and they wanted help catching up before this week.

The problem however was that we have another coworker who likes to cause problems and then claims to be a victim because she‚Äôs deaf working last night too and while my two coworkers and I were trying to set the line to unload the truck this coworker tried to take a Uboat that we needed for the unload out to the sales floor with her.

When one of my coworkers and our boss tried to tell her no that we needed it she got mad that she wasn‚Äôt getting her way and got right in my coworkers face screaming at her and when her screaming made her spit on my coworker my coworker wiped the spit back onto her shirt which caused her to explode to the point of going to the police station when she didn‚Äôt get her way after talking to the closing manager to try and claim that my coworker pushed her/attacked her/what ever you want to call it.

Anyways while we were unloading the truck my coworker and boss both got pulled away from the line to go talk to the police about what happened and my stomach just got so messed up in knots as a result that by the time we were finishing the truck I thought I was going to be sick.

I realized that the emotional state I was in to start with combined with witnessing the argument caused my anxiety to trigger a post traumatic response as a result of an experience with a former coworker at my previous job that verbally and emotionally/mentally abused me and that‚Äôs how my stomach felt messed up so I was curious if anyone else has stomach problems as a result of their anxiety?"	spdgurl1984	post	23.513586427033534	male	White	0.998134970664978	na	na	na	15	anxiety	no prediction.

I completely understand this feeling all too well. I am also on Zoloft and rarely have panic attacks. However, I do still have high anxiety every day. Trying or adding new medication is definitely an option. Therapy might also help too. I think certain lifestyles can also play a big part in anxiety levels.

"Typically with my patients when they aren't quite where they need to be the first step would be increasing the dose as high as they are able to tolerate (obv within recommended therapeutic levels). For highly anxious people, they often need to be at max doses of SSRIs. 

If that doesn't cut it, then we can look at either adding an adjunct like Buspar or Trazodone- or switching (typically through cross taper) to a different med like an SNRI (Effexor is usually my go to). 

There's also options for genetic testing through companies like OneOme, Genesite, or Helix that can let you know which medications will work best for you.

Lastly, definitely encourage you to continue the therapy. Would recommend making sure your therapist does CBT (vs generic talk therapy or others).

I know your brain is telling you you need to worry about this and that something bad will happen if you don‚Äôt, but you truly do not need to worry about this.

They found cracks in the walls and eaves and hung out between the outside and interior walls where it was nice and toasty. The house wasn‚Äôt well maintained and we frequently had bats get in. I bought a net specifically to catch them because it happened so often. I had anxiety attacks over it, like what if a bat bit me in my sleep.

I'm not new to anxiety, I've known I've had it for roughly 10 years now. I've learned to comfort myself and understand it better through the years.

it's made me scared to be alone at work now, the space where it happened gives me the darkest feeling, Like I'm almost afraid to be at work.  it's given me uncontrollable anxiety about my own health.  I mean any moment I'm not actively speaking to someone my brain is stressing about it. 

anyone have any advice?  let me add - this person did not pass thank God. but what happened to them was not something I ever expected to see in my life and was wildly violent to see. as goofy as it is, it feels like PTSD or something.

having high standards it's ok, but beware that if they are going to stop your growth, then you need readjusments.

"Over time, I've noticed I have somewhat backwards relationship between anxiety and caffeine.

Higher daily caffeine intake lowers my anxiety symptoms and makes my mind feel much more clear. On the flip side, low caffeine intake increases my anxiety significantly over time (even after going low-caffeine for long enough to get past caffeine withdrawal).

"i‚Äôve read some people in here say they get random bursts of feeling very exposed and almost as if they are naked in front of people.  

i‚Äôve felt like this since i was little. i get it sometimes when i‚Äôm with others, but usually happens when i‚Äôm initiate with my bf. he‚Äôs my first serious bf (been dating for 5 years) and the first guy i‚Äôve had sex with.  

it usually only happens when he fingers me, but it just happened tonight after i had a finished. sorry i know this is graphic but there is literally no other way to explain it. 

the feelings i get: 

- INTENSE feeling that i need to cover up my body immediately 
- feeling that i need to leave the room immediately and turn all lights on and put on clothes 
- feeling the need to puke/ intense nausea
- will not let my bf hug me / touch me at all
- body starts showing all physical signs of panic attack or fight or flight more: i start to shake rapidly, hyperventilate, bawl my eyes out etc 
- i have to do breathwork in order to calm down at all 

because i‚Äôveseen people say it is anxiety, i always figured it was that. but i‚Äôve (along with my bf and my parents) have always wondered if i i was sexually assaulted as a kid. i always turned down anythinf sexual with guys in high school, i never will wear a tampon bc the thought of that being down there makes me want to die, i used to her bad rashes as a baby apparently and randomly wouldn‚Äôt let anyone wipe me or bathe me, etc. who knows. 

sorry for the rant and language i just was wondering if anyone in here experiences similar or if it sound to anyone like something other than anxiety. i‚Äôm sure i‚Äôm missing a ton but this is a gist.

ETA: just thought it was important to say my bf is the most wonderful supportive person in my life. he shows me so much love and grace so i know it‚Äôs not anything to do with him. one guy in HS wanted to go further with me and i got very upset and did the same with him. aslo, after these spells my bf will always want me to lay with him and comfort me, he handles it so amazingly every time."

I saw his TikTok videos about psychology and about the human body and mind‚Ä¶ I cried my life after hearing he committed suicide. It makes me doubt medicine and wanting to be. A doctor in the future.

"Suicide is not the end path of being a doctor. You can be the most educated person in the world when it comes to the mind and still succumb to a mental disorder, emotion, etc. That knowledge is a tool, not an immunity. Becoming a doctor is difficult, being a doctor is difficult, you do your best to help people but sometimes they don't want it, or it just didn't work out. The people who push through are not the smartest or the most talented. They are the most resilient. Those people thrive on helping someone stay healthy, or get the treatment they need to feel better. It's making a tangible improvement in others lives that you can see. It's having the tools to save lives so they go on to live another day, giving their family relief. 

Being afraid and having doubt are natural things though, especially when it's something difficult. Find that core reason you want to be a doctor. Whatever it may be and hold that tight. Medicine has many, many different avenues so even if you get to your destination and think ""this isn't right for me"" then you have other paths to pivot to with the knowledge and training to back it up. I think we are all capable of doing amazing things if we just keep moving forward. 

For now though, take some time and grieve. Grief is not logical so it doesn't make sense why we feel it, but we do. To get past that we need to deal with it and process it. And if things get too bad, see a doctor to get the help that you need. Sometimes we just need some temporary help to get us back up on our feet."	lovatichere	reply	na	na	na	0.9967787861824036	no	no	no	na	anxiety	no prediction.

"Rabies spiraling

About 6 days ago on my walk in our subdivision I saw a cat. It seemed real cute and friendly and I figured I was one of our neighbor‚Äôs cats. 

Out cat passed away about a year ago but we still have his carrier so I went and got it so I could contain the cat till we found it‚Äôs owner. Like I said, the cat was real cute (purring, wanted belly rubs and so on). It actually walked right into the carrier. But when I picked him up and started walking he kinda freaked out and hissed and batted at the inside of the carrier and the bedding a few times. I figured this wasn‚Äôt gonna work so I took him back to where I found him and let him go. 

But in the process of letting the cat go, the bedding fell out and I had to stuff it back in. The owner reached out on Facebook that the cat make it back home. Come to find out they let the cat out most nights and it returns home in the morning. 

My concerns are as follows:

1-the cat hissing could have gotten saliva on the bedding/inside of the carrier and then that bedding fell out of the carrier

2-I actually had 2 non-bleeding hangnails on that hand that I used to put the bedding back in the carrier and the saliva could have gotten into the hangnails via it being on the bedding 

3-because the cat is a indoor/outdoor cat the risk of rabies is higher than just an indoor cat

4-did some googling that cats can actually shed rabies via saliva up to a week prior showing symptoms. Also read hangnails are considered an open wound. 

I have not asked about the vaccination status of the cat because to tell my neighbor the story it sounds stupid. Nor am I sure I would trust the answer.

I sent a mychart message to my primary care doctor and a nurse called back and said my doctor said I didn‚Äôt need the vaccine. 

I also did a virtual visit through my insurance with a different doctor just to get a second opinion and she said the same thing. She said I ‚Äúwould not qualify for post exposure rabies prophylaxis because there was no direct contact of saliva or body fluids of the animal in question with broken skin or an open wound or mucus membranes. The hangnail that the patient was describing is not considered an open skin lesion or open wound as there was formed skin under the nail and no bleeding.‚Äù

Now, a normal person would look at this and say 2 doctors told you no need for the rabies vaccine (plus the fact the acted completely normal and was a domestic cat), you are fine. But I can‚Äôt seem to let it go given the dire consequences if they are wrong. I mean my research said the hangnails were indeed a vector for the rabies to get it (this contradicts what the second doctor told me). Plus, the fact that the cat was acting fine isn‚Äôt a guarantee of no rabies (can shed it for several days prior to symptoms starting). 

I‚Äôve debated just going to the ER and seeing if they would give the vaccines but I‚Äôm afraid to spend 4+ hours in the waiting room with a $150 copay only to be told it‚Äôs not needed and be sent home. 

Obviously I‚Äôm no doctor and I even admit I know that getting rabies out of that situation would be EXTREMELY unlikely but my brain can‚Äôt seem to let it go because the chances aren‚Äôt literally zero."

"Don‚Äôt go to the ER. Rabies is primarily transmitted through bites, sometimes through scratches. That didn‚Äôt happen. Getting a rabies vaccine at this point isn‚Äôt for your protection, it‚Äôs to try to stop your brain. And even if you managed to get it, your brain might not stop. Your brain has latched onto this ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù scenario and will not let go, no matter how much rationalization or reassurance you receive. 

What you‚Äôre currently experiencing is called a cognitive distortion called ‚Äúcatastrophizing.‚Äù You‚Äôre jumping to the worst possible conclusion, even if it‚Äôs basically an impossibility.

"I‚Äôve had anxiety my whole life in one form or another. Mainly from PTSD but I‚Äôm sure some of it is genetics as well. Anyways, it is getting worse as I age. Some days it is downright crippling to the point where I breakdown crying (in private) because this is not the quality of life I want. I have a good job, a great marriage, we just built a beautiful house. We have wonderful friends and family and two dogs that I would move the earth for. My life is ‚Äúgood‚Äù so I downplay how severe my anxiety is in 99.999999% of circumstances. At work, no one would ever know I was anxious (I work remotely most of the time so that‚Äôs easy). My spouse knows I have anxiety but doesn‚Äôt really know what that means and certainly doesn‚Äôt know the extent of it. I just feel like people chalk everything up to ‚Äúanxiety‚Äù these days and it doesn‚Äôt get taken seriously at all and if you try and frame it any other way then it‚Äôs now mental illness which has its own stigma.

"Hi, I overcame what I'd consider an extreme case of an anxiety disorder. 

Anxiety is an irrational fear that cannot be stopped with logic the way normal fear can. Meaning normal fear will stop once there is nothing to fear while anxiety won't. Or you might be scared of the same things other people are, but much more. 

It's  all coming from having low tolerance of uncertainty. What feeds it is reassurance seeking. If you try to convince yourself or reassure yourself about how you're not in danger regarding your fear, you further lower the tolerance of uncertainty. That's how anxiety keeps going. So to stop it, you must stop with reassurance seeking. And also avoidance. Avoiding what you're scared of makes the anxiety about it stronger. So the solution to that is so called ""exposure"" to your fear.

You certainly shouldn't be seeking reassurance and shouldn't be avoiding triggers. You should also tell yourself that perhaps you won't get enough sleep and that it's okay that way, it'll work out somehow. That's an ERP technique. Always accept that what you're scared of might happen. And add that it's okay if it happens, even when it's abosolutely terrible.

"I don't even know where to start with this post, but I'm hoping that anyone who has been through something similar can give me some good advice right now... In short, I am not doing well. I've struggled with my eating habits my entire life and I've never been able to bring myself to eat when I'm stressed, and lately, that's been all the time. I've probably been eating somewhere around 700 - 900 calories a day for the last month and a half and I feel terrible. I'm weak, I'm losing twice as much hair in the shower as I normally do (I have extremely long hair so this in particular is making me freak out), I was supposed to be on my period right now, but it's so light that it's barely even there... I know something is wrong. I weighed myself today and I'm 103lbs. I'm 5'4"". Apparently that puts me in the clinically underweight range.......

i ended up having a blood test done and it came back that i had hyperthyroidism which explained some of the things i was going through such rapid weight loss, shakiness and bad anxiety. eventually over time when i found better medications i started to gain weight naturally. hopefully this helps in someway."	doughnutsprinks_	reply	na	na	na	0.9991753697395325	no	strong	no	na	anxiety	no prediction.

Hey, I‚Äôm just writing this becuase I‚Äôm going crazy. I‚Äôm a 21 year old male and when I was 18 I saw a video on YouTube called ‚Äúthe c*ancer is back‚Äù that sent me down this rabbit hole that is my life now. I started fantasizing about me getting illnesses . I would check my body constantly and have full blown panic attacks every day. Everyday it is something new. A new diagnoses tht drives me crazy. I‚Äôve played baseball my whole life and I have fine blood pressure and everything but I had a fit bit when I was 18 I just found and I looked at my past resting heart rate and it was 55 when I was 18. I googled it and it says a normal resting heart rate is 60-100 and if ur under 60 you have bradycardia and it could be a heart problem and needs a pacemaker. Now all I do 24/7 is check my heart rate and I‚Äôd say some days I‚Äôm 60-62 beats per minute but when I‚Äôm in bed at night I will check my heart rate and it‚Äôs anywhere from 54-58BPM. Now I‚Äôm having a full blown panic attack and I just can‚Äôt keep living my life like this. Now I‚Äôm fully thinking I have a heart problem and my life is over.	sjjsdjjdjd	post	36.89086254237447	female	White	0.9977756142616272	na	na	na	9	anxiety	no prediction.
Bro, I‚Äôm 43 and I‚Äôve been through a similar experience. I played shortstop in my day! I promise you are perfectly fine and I‚Äôm great physical health. Your problem is mental.

Worried? You need to go get an EKG done! They look at your electrical signals and can give you an overall explanation of anything that may be going on. If there is more testing, then they do them. If you need some meds, you get meds! If you need help with first steps, lemme know! Good luck friend and I‚Äôm sorry you are struggling!

"It's probably the opposite tbh, your low heart rate is a sign you're fit and very healthy. I have friends who are really amazing athletes and their heartrates are all between 45-55 at rest. They are absolutely not sick and their hearts are more than capable of pumping enough blood. They've all run marathons and they do like 15 km runs for fun, or 150km bike rides, stuff like that. It just means your heart is really efficient!

I don't have any advice regarding your health anxiety, as that kind of obsessive tendency isn't something I've personally experienced. That said, it's a common enough problem that I think you could get some really good help for it if you sought out a therapist."	sjjsdjjdjd	reply	na	na	na	0.9977756142616272	no	strong	no	na	anxiety	no prediction.

"Codependency is tough! Most of us tend to get into relationships hoping it will help us feel okay (which it often does, at least at first).

I think regardless of the particular tool you employ what's paramount is the intention with which you use it. So if you're using a tool to try and escape a feeling it may not work as well as if you're using it with the intention of building long-term resilience.

One thing that's really helped me is realizing that my thoughts and worries are largely dependent upon the state of my nervous system. When we're in sympathetic, we automatically worry about whatever is top of mind. When we're in ventral vagal, we really don't worry much if at all.

"First things first:
Get somewhere safe for you both mentally and physically. Take deep, slow breaths (I find box breathing to generally be best, 6 seconds in, 6 seconds hold, 6 seconds out, repeat).

Distracting yourself with comfort movies or games can help lots too. It is also a good idea to take some time to quiet your mind in a quiet environment to help you recenter, if you can.

Now second thing second (ONLY once your anxiety is calmed): You need to ask yourself why they make you anxious and take your next steps from there. Is it trauma based or irrational? Should you take steps to separate that person from your life the best you can, or attend psychotherapy?

Finally, remember that anxiety is temporary and that it will pass. See it, recognize it, and when you can, let it go and slowly allow yourself to come to and process that you are safe and that it will cannot truly ever control you."

hi everyone, i was diagnosed with severe anxiety about a year ago but i‚Äôve been feeling like this my whole life and it gets worse and worse by the day. i also have depression but it‚Äôs not nearly as bad as my anxiety. that being said, i‚Äôve been put on antidepressant after antidepressant for the last year and it does not help me at all i‚Äôm still just as anxious and depressed. everytime my dr says ‚Äúi‚Äôll up the dose then!‚Äù but it doesn‚Äôt work. i have asked her a few times if i can go on anxiety medication instead of antidepressants, and she flat out told me no and raised my antidepressant dose again. that‚Äôs when i got the idea to get a medical marijuana card. i‚Äôm a minor so it‚Äôs a big ordeal but, to those who have a medical marijuana card, does it help? what is it like? pros and cons? additionally, if you‚Äôre a minor with a card or have a kid who has a card, what‚Äôs the process of getting one as a minor? thanks!

"I am constantly on overdrive. I always have to be doing something, and if I‚Äôm not, then my mind always has to be doing something. As you can imagine this becomes a problem more so at night when all there is to do, is sit in bed alone.

It can just be so stupid sometimes, like the other day I was in bed listening to music whilst messaging friends in our group chat, whilst also looking for a new hoodie to buy, and also looking for new jewellery to buy, and also wanting to watch some videos my friend sent me on tik tok. I know this sounds so ridiculous but instead of just focusing on 1 thing, or even 2 things, or just doing 1 thing at a time, I kept switching between all of these different things and it was getting me really stressed out.

I can never focus on one thing ever. Now for example, I was just writing a Reddit post but after every sentence I typed I was like, shall I go get that bottle of water now? Shall I go after this post is done? Shall I go now and write the post after? Shall I write half the post now and half after? Then I told myself I need to watch a video, then I told myself I need to do this and that and etc.. I know how silly this sounds but it gets me so stressed and almost panicky and my heart starts beating quite fast sometimes too because of it. I just never quite can focus on one thing or be in the moment, I‚Äôm always stressing about what I need to do, or what I‚Äôll do next.

It‚Äôs the same with my thoughts I can just never focus on one thing because another 10 things branch off it and then I‚Äôm in a loop of thoughts and research and questions. I don‚Äôt know. And then I have so many things going on in my head or that I‚Äôve told myself I need to do, that I obviously start to forget them all and that too stresses me out.

For me my phone is a definite culprit in constantly making me on a overdrive like you mention. So I just physically keep it away from short periods of time when I am doing something.

I've never had this strong a feeling of anxiety for such a long period of time, and I feel like the lack of quality sleep is only making it worse.

"Prescription sleep medication is the best option. Either Trazodone, Seroquel, Mirtazipine, Ativan. You can use these short-term to help you get through this stressful time at work. Since work stress seems to be the direct cause of this issue, your sleep should resolve once the work stressor is gone. 

I wouldn't make it a long-term habit of using prescription medication to sleep though. But sometimes you need a little extra help to sleep during those high-stress periods."	sjyisfalling	reply	na	na	na	0.9983012676239014	no	no	no	na	anxiety	no prediction.

Hi, what do you mean if you're crazy? About the anxiety, you must let the thoughts about it run freely and not resist that all. Allow yourself to have all the anxiety you're feeling. This way you're creating resistance to it, making it weaker. And yes chest pain like that can be happening. Hard to tell how long is it gonna last. It should be shorter if you addapt the approach I described.	OkPineapple3034	reply	na	na	na	0.9955554604530334	weak	no	strong	na	anxiety	no prediction.

I see. Chest pains can happen because anxiety attacks, especially sudden ones that go from zero to a hundred quickly cause dopamine spikes, resulting in heart palpitations which can cause chest pain. It's normal, nothing unusual. so you're not crazy :)	OkPineapple3034	reply	na	na	na	0.9955554604530334	weak	no	no	na	anxiety	no prediction.

Please help!

I attended a concert with a friend, and I made the foolish decision to hardly eat anything. The concert was great, but the night after, I literally only got one hour of sleep because of how bad my anxiety was. Not exaggerating. I managed to take a one hour nap on the car ride back home, but I‚Äôve been experiencing anxiety since. 

I tried eating more today, since I know that played a major role in why I couldn‚Äôt sleep, but all I could manage to eat was one cracker, a scoop of plain white rice, applesauce, and two pieces of plain toast.

I think this might be silly to ask, but is that enough? I don‚Äôt want to overdo it, especially after I haven‚Äôt been hungry. I haven‚Äôt had an appetite despite my stomach growling earlier today.

Also, how can I make sure to get enough sleep tonight? I can already feel myself getting anxious thinking about sleeping tonight, which is exactly what I don‚Äôt want to happen. I slept from 4 am - 5:15 am, then from 10:30 am - 11:30 am, and I‚Äôm trying to sleep at 9 pm so I don‚Äôt wake up at 3 am. 

What should I do in regard to these? I want to get back to feeling as normal as possible, as soon as possible. And I especially don‚Äôt want another sleepless night.

Thank you!"	oodleofnoodles1	post	24.311835279423583	female	White	0.9934878349304199	na	na	na	3	anxiety	no prediction.
"I've struggled with chronic insomnia for over 3+ now (although it's mostly under control), and my sleeping anxiety started very similarly with 1 really bad sleepless night. If I could go back in time, I would scream at myself to stop worrying about sleep. 

I would tell myself to Get off Google. Get off the forums. Stop shopping for sleep supplements and solutions. Remember that sleep is an automatic process. It will happen when your body needs it. Stressing about sleep, researching things, and putting all this pressure and attention on sleep only increases sleep anxiety. 

Take the pressure off sleep, stop researching, keep your normal sleep schedule, go to sleep only when your feeling really tired, if you can't sleep get out of bed for a bit,  and just keep living your life even if your tired.

If you're feeling that restlessness in your chest, that's ok. This happens to a lot of people. If you feel bad/very anxious, just get out of bed for a bit and do something relaxing in another room until the anxiety passes. Get cozy and try to embrace that time. Of course, it's not fun to be awake at night, but there are a lot worse places to be than curled up on your couch. I like to get cozy and watch a relaxing show on my phone or read for 20-30 minutes.

"The older I grow, the more I realize that most people around me are struggling. Some are struggling because of health issues, some family, other career and even more with their partners (or lack of one). Or many other combinations and reasons. Their struggles consume them. They really really really don't have the energy to think about me. Maybe I say something cringe and maybe at that point of time they might not like what I said but you know live moves on and people dnt bother about every interaction they have on the day. Just like how I am mostly consumed by my own anxiety to really care about what others say or do. 

Soooo, maybe everyone doesn't think you are an idiot. They really just don't have the time or energy to think about you. So just continue with your life. Forget about them the same way as how they have likely forgotten about you. You seem to have a lot of your plate already, why add worrying about what others think to the list of tasks you are doing in a day.

"Dear friends,  
I hope this message finds you well. I am seeking your guidance and support regarding a challenge I face during anxiety and panic attacks. Specifically, I struggle with an intense fixation on my heart rate, which hinders my ability to calm down and regain control. This fixation has caused my heart rate to remain elevated for hours, leading to a loss of confidence in engaging in activities like travel, running and other aspects in life. I am reaching out to ask if anyone has experienced a similar fixation and if you have found effective ways to calm down and redirect your focus. If you have successfully overcome this challenge, I would greatly appreciate hearing your experiences and any advice you may have for regaining confidence and fully engaging in life despite the fear of heart rate fluctuations. Thank you for your understanding and support. Your shared wisdom and personal experiences would be of immense value to me as I work towards managing this fixation and reclaiming a sense of confidence in my daily life.

"for reference, i'm currently 16 (f). i've always struggled with my mental health, but recently it's been getting a lot worse. i haven't seen many teens my age going through the same thing, so i'm sharing my story to help those who might be able to relate.

for the past few months or so, i've been dealing with depersonalization. when it first started i didn't really know what was going on tbh, so ofc i googled it and from there i kinda figured out what it was. i started having panic attacks kinda frequently, most of the time it was towards the end of the school day. i honestly was scared to tell my mom because i didn't really know how to explain what i was feeling, so for a while i never told her.

once school ended, my anxiety started getting worse along with the depersonalization. now, i know i'm young and even though many ppl say, i ""have nothing to worry about"", i've been struggling with extreme death anxiety. i've always been scared of death, but for some reason it's just gotten so much worse. i'm constantly thinking the worst and nothing seems to really help. i'm currently taking medicine for my anxiety, but tbh i'm not sure it's doing much. in full honesty, there was a week or so where i constantly cried, multiple times a day, because i was terrified. although, i can say i've started to see SOME improvement. i'm not crying as often, and i've found distractions that make it somewhat easier to deal with. (puzzle games like candy crush and sudoku tend to help)

"I keep mentioning it in multiple communities but it‚Äôs because it‚Äôs important to the vent. I work a full time unpaid job, I work more than my sister, more than multiple of my coworkers and the same hours as my dad and don‚Äôt get paid because I am a volunteer. 

My parents think my job will look good on my CV and that it‚Äôs good to have the experience of a job and working somewhere. 

When I am at work, i experience hallucinations that distress me, I can easily get overstimulated (especially if someone is mowing the grass outside), I get told off and shouted at by my dad for not doing enough work, I get told to stop complaining and just get on with it, I keep getting interrupted when I‚Äôm doing different jobs so I can help my dad do his and it‚Äôs all really exhausting. I work from 8am until around 3:35/3:45pm, and I have to wake up at 5:30am every morning to get to work on time. 

Multiple things cause anxiety at work, mostly hallucinations, fear of being told off and fear of following orders and working to my death. 

A couple weeks ago I was made to carry a box of over 40 hardback books, and the box ended up hitting me in the jugular. I started panicking and thinking I was going to die. 

I keep getting made to carry boxes up and down the stairs, but I have to carry them with two hands so that leaves me no way to grab the railing if I fall, and so if I trip on the stairs, I could die. Sometimes my dad makes me get up on shelves and kneel on the very edge, while he passes me kinda heavy boxes that I‚Äôm supposed to stack behind me. I am in constant fear that one day I am going to die there.

I am also scared of making my dad angry, I hate when he gets mad at me and when he tells me off. If I refuse to do something, he starts calling me an asshole and such. Sometimes he‚Äôll ask if I‚Äôm busy rather than just demanding I do something, but if I say yes then it feels like I‚Äôm being interrogated. ‚ÄúWhat are you doing what are you busy with what‚Äôs that for why are you doing that who said to do that‚Äù. I have quite bad problems with ganglions in the backs of both wrists sometimes, and I‚Äôm scared that if I tell him I can‚Äôt lift a box because it hurts my wrists too much then he‚Äôll get angry and annoyed and swear at me. 

I don‚Äôt know what to do, I don‚Äôt want to make any of the staff upset or heartbroken by telling them that working there is making me feel this way. I also don‚Äôt want to let them down by not showing up, they‚Äôre already surprised I have lasted as long as I have. Nobody expected me to last the full first week, but I‚Äôve been working there since June 20th. I‚Äôve only missed three days, two were sixth form taster days and another was one my dad booked off so we could go shopping for my mum‚Äôs birthday. My next day off is August 24th for results day. After that, my next day off is September 5th, because that‚Äôs when I start sixth form. Lucky me, I get to work there over the Christmas holidays too, the busiest time for the company. 

I really don‚Äôt know what to do, I love the staff there like family but the job is really mentally fucking me up and I don‚Äôt think I can handle doing school full time from September until December and then using all my time off for work that makes me fear my life. What should I do? Please help :("	AshSays_LGBT	post	24.493184201963977	female	White	0.9976848363876343	na	na	na	8	anxiety	no prediction.
"Oh, sorry this is terrible. I guess there isn't an option to be at least doing a paid job since you basically have to have work? 

With the fears I highly recommend ERP approach of accepting how what you're scared of might happen. It sounds weird, but this makes fears powerless. The way to do it is, whenver you're scared something might happen, tell yourself it's totally fine if it happens, no problem. Even if you're terriied of it.

Burnout is terrible, it can be totally extreme. Often it's not necessary to treat it with drugs, you just need to stop whatever is causing it. But I'm guessing you cannot do that?

I made celery juice for the first time today and about 30 minutes later I started getting really dizzy and anxious. I had it on an empty stomach and I don't think I had a lot.

"i have this huge fear of psychosis right now and i was wondering if any of you have ever felt this way as well?

i started feeling this way after i had a very very bad panic attack and overall experience after smoking weed for the first time back in may (i took WAY too much, very bad time lol). it was also my first very bad panic attack that i think ive had and every time i even think about what i had experienced i feel anxious. and after that had happened, i started googling what i had felt at the time and googling symptoms and what not and that lead to me becoming extremely anxious over whether or not i have psychosis or went through psychosis.

now, my anxiety has gotten much worse since then. i think that it might have flipped a switch in brain and made my anxiety severe or something. its always been shitty, but ever since then, my anxiety has gotten sooo much more worse, which has given me anxiety about many things, one of them being psychosis. i always get scared that im losing my mind or i might lose my mind. it also doesnt help that i just started trying out an SSRI for the first time (zoloft) and so my brain is just foggy and everythings a haze right now.

does anyone else ever feel this way at all? any tips to try and ease anxiety about this? :("	bunnbs	post	23.331305928708797	female	White	0.9978261590003967	na	na	na	30	anxiety	no prediction.
"Definitely the feel of having a psychotic break of some sort has haunted me since me early teens, as my anxiety got worse this intense sensation that I was about to lose my mind especially during and after a panic or anxiety attack got worse and worse. When I was on a SSRI this fear was also much more intense for me since the medication de-regulated my emotions from their baseline and fogged my memory. But everyone reacts to medication differently. 
The feeling that you‚Äôre going to lose your sanity or your grasp of reality when you‚Äôre anxious is pretty common I think, just remember that when you have an anxiety disorder what your anxiety is telling you is not at all indicative of reality and just your anxiety misfiring. Focus on soothing your anxious feelings that are the true root of the problem. It‚Äôs extremely unlikely you are going to have an actual psychotic event unless such a thing runs in your family.

"This is a very common fear among those of us with anxiety issues. I used to do random ‚Äúreality checks‚Äù on myself by asking the people around me if they were seeing/hearing the same mundane shit I was. I often asked questions like, ‚ÄúCan you hear that bird chirping?‚Äù and ‚ÄúDo you see that red car?‚Äù

I also went to many therapists literally in tears, asking if I was going insane. Turns out, I wasn‚Äôt. People who experience psychosis don‚Äôt actually stop to think that they‚Äôre experiencing psychosis. For instance, an undiagnosed schizophrenic will 1000% believe that their delusions and hallucinations are just as real as the ground they‚Äôre standing on. Someone experiencing a manic bipolar episode will 1000% believe that they‚Äôre the chosen one. 

Meanwhile, anxiety doesn‚Äôt do that. Anxiety makes us question everything and play the ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù game. Playing the ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù game and freaking ourselves out is not the same as psychosis. Getting paranoid out of fear due to smoking weed is not the same as paranoid psychosis.

Anxiety commonly makes people feel like they are losing their mind, going crazy etc. This is all just the anxiety. You are not and will not lose your mind. Anxiety is capable of making you think and feel a lot of horrible things. You definitely need to talk to a therapist that can teach you cognitive behavioral therapy for anxiety.

"I had a very similar experience to what you're describing in this post about 4 months ago that I also took to posting to this subreddit about. I also had recently experienced a severe, downright traumatizing panic attack on weed that had elevated my anxiety to previously unprecedented levels and was also concerned about psychosis (more specifically, I was anxious that I was developing schizophrenia). I'm pleased to report that I still haven't displayed any symptoms of psychosis and still don't have schizophrenia. My anxiety in general is considerably less intense than it was back then (although still elevated from my pre-panic attack baseline) and my fear about schizophrenia in particular has effectively been relegated to an occasional afterthought. 

Here are some things to keep in mind that helped me persevere through that particularly intense bout of anxiety:

Do you have a family history of psychosis or psychotic disorders? If not, your chances of developing psychosis/a psychotic disorder is fairly low. Even if you do, that's far from a guarantee that you'll develop it yourself. The vast majority of people with a family history of schizophrenia, for example, still don't develop it.

Moreover, what if you do develop psychosis? In many cases psychosis isn't permanent, and even when it is it's often treatable. Many people who suffer from psychotic disorders live normal, happy, and healthy lives with medication and therapy. 

Anxiety can very frequently make people feel as I'd they're ""going crazy"", especially their anxiety becomes particularly acute due to a traumatic experience (ie a severe drug-induced panic attack). It's all smoke and mirrors, however. Anxiety can produce some exceptionally strong irrationality and cognitive distortion, but with time and support it'll fade.

"Throaway account. 

I've (21) been dating this guy (23) for 8 months now and I can't stand these fucking types of ""joke"". I am HORRIFIED of being a mother for now and of course we do everything we can to protect ourselves from an unexpected pregnancy. It is working and I feel safe, but EVERY TIME someone ""jokes"" about it I get so fucking bad and ""paranoid"" I start wondering if it's not a signal from the universe or whatever. I know it sounds stupid.

Two days ago me and my bf were talking about our plans for the future to some friends and we didn't even mention kids. We were saying about how we were planning on moving in together and (jokingly) how we'd marry in December 2026 then our friend said: ""well, she'll get pregnant before it anyway"" and fuck, I've been feeling SO bad because of it, especially because he didn't even say in a ""joking way"". He was being TOTALLY serious. 

I DON'T get the point of this shit and why the fuck joke with this shit I am honestly pissed and paranoid with it to the point I had a dream in which I was pregnant with a kid and it was HORRIFIC. I cannot stop thinking about that and I'm convinced I'm already pregnant (even though I rationally know I am NOT).

I am so pissed honestly. I don't feel like having sex again even though I want to, but I'm not feeling in good terms with that 'friend', I'm SO mad at him and don't even know why. Am I overreacting?"

Since you are also mentioning that this topic is making you very anxious, maybe listen to some relaxing music. I can recommend Nujabes if you're interested to try it out (it helped me a lot during my depression)

I‚Äôve been struggling with anxiety for years but it‚Äôs been so much worse the last couple weeks. I‚Äôve never felt this bad in my life. I can‚Äôt eat anything at all, I can‚Äôt sleep except for maybe 1-3 hours a night, and worst of all I start a new job tomorrow and I‚Äôm so scared I‚Äôll ruin it. Isolation was killing me so I applied for the job and at first I was really excited and now I‚Äôm panicking over it. I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôll feel bad while driving to work or that I won‚Äôt be able to function because of how sleep deprived I am. I keep having constant panic attacks and I don‚Äôt know what to do. My doctor gave me hydroxyzine but it doesn‚Äôt do much. I won‚Äôt see my doctor until sometime in September and I honestly feel like I can‚Äôt take it anymore.	celestialyooko	post	17.48041733251049	female	White	0.9993610978126526	na	na	na	3	anxiety	no prediction.

"Could part of the increased anxiety be because you are starting a new job? New jobs are usually big life events and it would make sense that you have a lot of feelings about it.

Do your best to prepare for tomorrow, get your clothes and bag ready. Make a list of what you need. Review instructions how to get there if the way is unfamiliar.

Is taking a bubble bath possible? Or a hot shower? Do you have tea like chamomile or nightly calm? Can you go for a walk? Are there any self care rituals you like to do?

Ask yourself how much is anxiety and how much is excitement? Are you excited to start a new job? Work with new people? Excitement is an arousal emotion like anxiety, your heart rate can go up and you can feel more alert. Oftentimes feelings of arousal are met with trying to calm down, but sometimes it needs to be the opposite. Sometimes dancing around your room with excitement or saying out loud ‚ÄúI am excited, and hyped and I am ready to go‚Äù will help you align with your feelings and feel less like you are fighting yourself.

You probably won‚Äôt sleep that great tonight. It‚Äôs ok. Humans are very resilient and can cope with lack of sleep. It‚Äôs not always pretty but it can be ok. 

It can also help to play through the worst case scenario for your first day.

"I am aware that nausea is a big part in anxiety. I have a friend who never gets sick- ever. 
Recently in her life she lost an aunt she was close with and she keeps thinking she‚Äôs going to throw up randomly. She never does though. But she genuinely will not feel well and really fell like she will but it just never plays out. 

However I‚Äôm pretty sure you can‚Äôt just not throw up if you genuinely are going to. If you are actually going to be sick (wether from virus, food or whatever) you just do.

This is my first post on here so hoping this works! I started a new job a few weeks ago (my first real job out of university). It‚Äôs a shift job, 12 hours to be exact. It‚Äôs hardly labour intensive, mainly just waiting for emails. Tomorrow I start do the first 12 hour shift (I have been doing shorter hours the last few weeks). I am very anxious but I can‚Äôt put my finger on exactly why. The people are nice, the place is nice, I‚Äôm just spending the evenings dreading when I have to wake up and get ready. I‚Äôm also commuting by car for the first time, I‚Äôm not a very confident driver. This is making me even more anxious, it‚Äôs only a 20 minute or so drive, but I‚Äôm dreading it.

getting a new job can make you anxious. But it gets so much better in time. I think the one thing you have to be working on is your fear of driving. One way is to start driving a lot, so your brain gets used to that is not dangerous. Try driving the way to work a few more times a day. It might sound silly but I works.

"For context: I‚Äôm diagnosed with General Anxiety Disorder, to my knowledge I‚Äôve never had a panic attack.

So I lead music at my church. Recently I took 3 weeks off to rest more during the week since my 2 year old stopped sleeping for a while. Today was my first day back, just one song at the end. I felt great all morning, no anxiety detectable. I got on stage and my heart was RACING. Started doing some breathing exercises, but they were not successful in slowing my heart down in the short time I had before the song. So I started playing and singing, and then my arms went numb as well. My hands were shaking like crazy and I felt dizzy or kind of separated from myself. Hard to explain. But I was still hitting all the chords and singing like nothing was wrong. By the end of the song I was almost back to normal, just some residual shakiness.

I have been dealing with this for more than a year now after a series of intense panic attacks. As time has passed the panic has subsided and the anxiety has faded away but sometimes returns with diminishing frequency. My attitude has been that I won't let the anxiety stop me from doing things and going about my business.  I stay busy, exercise regularly and eat healthy foods and I feel a return to normalcy mostly.

"Hello. The majority of my life has been controlled by health anxiety. As time passes, it continues to have a tighter grasp on me. Over the years, I've sought professional help and medications, yet nothing has slowed its steady negative progressive march. I'm writing this seeking help and advice because I don't know what else to do or where to turn. Below is my full story in as much detail as I can provide starting from the beginning. I know it's long, but I'm hopeful that with full context someone out there can help without causing more fear and anxiety.

First, I am a (nearly) 38 year old male living in the United States. My story begins with general anxiety and not health anxiety. I remember the first night I experienced anxiety. I was in elementary school, approximately 10 years old at the time, and was at a friend's birthday party which was a sleep over. A group of young boys all met at the friend's house and we spent the day in his basement hanging out and playing video games. We stayed up as late as 10 year old's could and eventually all fell asleep on the floor in sleeping bags. I wasn't asleep long when I was woken up by a terrible stomach ache. I didn't know what was going on but I did my best to try to alleviate the pain. I tried rolling over and laying in other positions, I tried praying, but nothing helped. Eventually I decided I needed help and I needed to call my parents (this was before cellphones). I shook the boy who lived there in an attempt to wake him up to let him know that I needed him to tell his parents I didn't feel well. I remember he was very difficult to wake up, but eventually he partially woke up and told me he'd help in ""five minutes."" I believed him and watched the clock very closely waiting for 5 agonizing minutes to pass. Eventually it did and I again shook him to ask for his help as he'd fallen right back to sleep. The process of waking him up and waiting 5 minutes repeated, but eventually he did wake up and notify his parents. I waited outside his parents bedroom door feeling embarrassment still having pain in my stomach. The next thing I remember is my dad's car arriving and getting into it. As soon as I closed the car door, I confusingly felt instant relief in my stomach. It would be awhile until I understood what had happened to me that night. Looking back as an adult, I wish I would have gotten up and found a phone in the house myself. I wonder how my life would have been different had I done that? I assume I never thought of finding a phone because of the focus on the pain, the fear of embracement, and being a 10 year old little boy. The next day, the birthday party continued at a kid party/play area type business. I remember being dropped off there that morning and everyone wondering what had happened to me the night before. The stomach pain and embracement left a lasting impression on me.

After that night, I was scared to sleep over at any friend's house. Whenever a school friend would ask me to spend the night, I'd have my mom call their mom and give some excuse of why I couldn't. I'd secretly listen silently on another phone just so I could hear how good of an excuse my mom would come up with and if there was any judgement from my friend's mom. My mom was a rock star with this task by the way! I remember asking her at which age do kids typically stop having sleep overs because I couldn't wait for them to stop. My fear extended beyond friends and to close family. Another time I was out of town with my dad on his work trip. I went with him because my cousin lived in that city. I was again sleeping in their basement when I had the same stomach pain at night. My aunt called my dad at his hotel and he came to sleep with me. Again, as soon as he arrived, my stomach pain vanished but the embracement stayed.

Fast forward to freshman year of high school. I had one of my first medical anxiety inducing events. The epiglottis is a flap of skin in your throat that prevents food and drink from entering the windpipe. For some reason, mine became enflamed. I would cough and the flap would stay ""closed"" for a few seconds causing me to not be able to breathe. Being a young kid, I didn't think much of it, until eventually my dad saw me not be able to breathe for a few seconds and started asking questions. I soon found myself at the otolaryngologist office where several times they'd numb my nose to stick a camera in it to view my throat. I had this done about three times or so without a clear diagnosis. The ENT doctor told me that whenever it happens, the flap would eventually relax so I could breathe, but the worst that would happen would be that I'd pass out from lack of oxygen and my parents would need to take me to the emergency department where they could resuscitate me. This caused extreme stress for me and I ended up having a week long migraine which also caused vision trouble. One night I was so stressed out, my mom took me to the emergency department for help. When I was released that night, my mom drove us around town to help calm me. Shortly after, we traveled to get a second opinion for another ENT doctor. The symptoms eventually cleared on their own and have never returned. Thankfully, I never did pass out from lack of oxygen, but this whole event was traumatizing to say the least.

If I back up to age 2, I had croup. This is swelling in the airways which causes breathing problems. While I don't remember this event, my mom told me she was aware of croup and took me to the doctor for treatment. She later told me, and I don't remember the details exactly, that the doctor said that croup either doesn't happen to kids over a specific age, or that kids that get it over the specified age don't need medical help. Whatever age he said, it was younger than 9. I got croup again at age 9 and I remember this event. I woke my parents up at night because I had woken up since couldn't breathe well. My mom boiled water and had me breathe the steam. This wasn't helping and I was asking her for help but she remember that the doctor had told her I was too old at this point. She eventually saw how much my stomach would suck in with each attempt to draw air in and took me to the emergency department. I remember it felt like breathing through a straw. The doctor and I had the same name, but when he asked me what my name was, I couldn't physically speak. He gave me medicine that helped but made me nauseous. I spent the night there. After the events above with my epiglottis, the memories of the croup attack came flooding back.

When I was 20 years old, I had a spontaneous pneumothorax. In simplified terms, a hole spontaneously opened in my lung and it collapse. I was home for the summer living at my parent's house and sitting at my computer one evening when I felt immediate and extreme pain in my chest and back. The extreme pain lasted for a hours and I let my parents know. My dad said I lost all color in my face. I was having trouble breathing, but thought that it was anything from acid reflux to asthma. I'd never been diagnosed with asthma, but it is in my family. My mom suggested acid reflux. Eventually the pain lessoned and I was able to lay on the couch on my side and fall asleep. The next day (about 12 hours later) I still felt funny and had a weird feeling in my throat but no serious pain. Convinced I had asthma, I decided to go to an urgent care thinking it'd be a quick check up and I'd leave with an inhaler prescription. The doctor listened to my lungs and order a chest x-ray. He informed me of the diagnosis and that he had called an ambulance to take me to the emergency department. I had no idea what was happening or how serious it was. At the ED, the doctor informed me that my lung was fully collapsed and the air pressure inside my chest was pushing on my heart. He estimated I had about 30 minutes before I had a heart attack. The movie Three Kings came to mind when Mark Wahlberg's character is shot in the chest. I had emergency surgery to have a chest tube inserted. They couldn't fully sedate me and I remember one nurse bear hugging my feet and another holding my arms above my head. Then I felt something similar to a lot of bee strings on the side of chest where the tube was being inserted. Next thing I knew, I was waking up in a hospital bed with a tube in my chest and monitors connected to me. Still unsure of where I was or what was going on, I saw the povidone iodine stain on the bed and panicked thinking I was bleeding. After I calmed down and realized where I was, I started to think about how I had almost agreed to a camping trip the night my lung collapsed. Since I was able to eventually fall asleep the night it collapsed and wasn't thinking I was in an emergency situation after the pain subsided the next morning, I fear what would have happened had I agreed to the camping trip. This haunts me to this day.

While in the hospital, the doctor told me that this condition typically heals in a few days and then I could go home. After a week, mine hadn't healed and the doctor decided that it'd be best I have a surgery to remove the top part of my lung which is where the hole most likely was. After the surgery, I was in a lot of pain and my chest tube was draining a lot of blood. I had some difficulty breathing until the nurse drained the blood from the tube. This was also a high traumatizing point. But my lung was not leaking air and the hole seemed to be sealed! Unfortunately, about a day later my lung started to leak air again. The doctors gave me a few more days to see if it'd seal up and stop. But it didn't. At that point, they told me that my case was unusual and not in the medical books. They tried things like allowing my lung to deflate and then reflate in an attempt to promote the hole to heal. Nothing they tried worked. They offered two more surgeries and gave me deadlines as to when I'd have to have them. One procedure is called pleurodesis where they inject a chemical into the chest wall that scars the chest wall causing the lung to stick to it. That way if there is a hole, the lung can't collapse. But they told me that this is a surgery for someone who has smoked all their life and they didn't want to do it a 20 year old if they didn't have to. The second option was to cut my chest open and fill it with water to search for the hole in my lung, similar to how you might find a hole in a leaking tire. The surgeon told me that after the surgery, I'd look like I came in second in a chainsaw fight. With the deadline looming over my head, I was stressed at both of these options. I was tasked with choosing my medical treatment because my case was not in the books as the doctors had said. I was trying everything in my power to see if I was improving. The tube in my chest was hooked up to a plastic box with water in it sucking out the air in my chest cavity. I would count and time the bubbles in an attempt to gauge the size of the hole. I thought that if the frequency of the bubbles decreased, the hole was getting smaller. I was out of control, but had a deadline to meet.

Several days before my second surgery, the doctor had thought to try breathing pure oxygen. After doing this for a day or so, the bubbles stopped and the hole sealed! I don't know if the oxygen helped, or it just finally closed on its own. The doctor working that weekend wanted to remove the oxygen, but I didn't want him to do it thinking the high oxygen environment was helping. He agreed to turn it down but leave it on. I'd only remove the oxygen mask between bites of food or to get a drink of water. I wanted the healing hole to have as much time as possible with the oxygen to heal assuming the oxygen was helping. Several days later, the hole was still sealed! 22 days after entering the hospital, the doctor was ready to discharge me. He told me that it was basically a coin flip if it'd happen again and to never fly in an unpressurized plane or scuba dive.

Thankfully, neither of my lungs have collapsed again. But the event further traumatized me. I would have panic attacks frequently at night and often times feel twinges and slight chest pains that would send me spiraling out of control thinking it was happening again. I was afraid to travel too far away from home because the doctors had told me that a larger hospital would not have let me stay for 22 days. They would have done the more invasive surgery options much sooner. From that point forward, I no longer trust myself in being able to recognize that I am having a medical emergency. I feel more trust in my parents for recognizing my health problems since they were there to witness the whole event. I thought that if it were to happen again, they'd be able to recognize it, because I didn't the night it happened and may not be able if it happened again. I only went to the urgent care the next day because I thought I had asthma and that it might be good to get an inhaler. It was the most painful thing I've ever experienced, but I still failed to recognized the immediate problem. Doctors told me they've never heard of someone waiting 12 hours to get help for a spontaneous pneumothorax. I had never heard of a spontaneous pneumothorax or even thought it was possible that a lung could spontaneously spring a leak. My fear is, what else could happen that I've never thought about and wouldn't be able to recognize the seriousness of it? I don't want to become a hypochondriac or have doctors view me as the boy who cried wolf. I only want to go to the doctor when I actually can confirm I need to go. But, I don't trust myself.

While in college and struggling to cope with my anxiety, I made an appointment with a school mental health therapist. I met with this lady for a couple of months, but she seemed very disinterested to help me. I found no benefit from meeting with her. I did find that time was helping though. I decided to try again and I met with several other therapists over the past 17 years. They all tried their very best and I appreciate their efforts. Eventually we'd hit a wall of an endless loop after I explained the above story. I never seemed to make progress and they'd eventually stop scheduling meetings with me because I always had the same story and nothing new. I tried Lexapro and Wellbutrin medications. Neither of these solved the problem and I had negative side effects sever enough that I hope to never have to use these types of medications again. I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder and post traumatic stress disorder. I never understood the difference between anxiety and ""fear"". I tend to think that maybe I don't have anxiety, but instead I have fear and that is why I can't be treated.

Today I continue to greatly struggle. It has morphed and grown from fear of collapsed lung, to general health fear and extreme fear of the night and sleep. Nights are a constant battle for me. I struggle greatly with insomnia (undiagnosed), racing mind of thoughts of doom and death, and the feeling of being alone and having to navigate the next 8 hours of night solo. My mind easily focuses on these dark thoughts at night with less distractions. When the sun rises, my anxiety levels begin to lower knowing that my family is awake and medical services are more easily available. My methods for falling asleep are not good sleep hygiene. I basically wait until I'm so tired that I fall asleep quickly after closing my eyes because laying in bed lets my mind run wild. I watch/listen to standup comedy since jokes are quick and help distract my mind. Standup comedy is perfect for me since I don't have to focus on a full long developing story or a plot like a TV show or movie which allows my mind to start wandering to dark places.

Some examples of how my mind wanders out of control are thinking about health issues that I may have but haven't recognized or haven't been diagnosed yet. For example, when I can't sleep, I wonder if I actually have insomnia or if I have fatal insomnia (warning: if you have health anxiety, do not google this!). I think greatly about my life and why I am alive, or if I am alive. Why my soul is in my body and not a different body or a different type of living creature. Why am I alive now and now 1,000 years ago or a 1,000 year from now. The universe is 13.8 billion years old and relative to me, that time passed in an instant up until my first memory. The moment I die, another 13.8 billion years will also pass in an instant relative to me. It makes me feel like there is no point in life if time will pass that quickly relative to me at the moment of my death. All my loved ones and all future history will come and pass in an instant the second I die relative to me. I have no way of entering another person's mind or body to understand if they experience the world like me or if they are even real. I feel like maybe things aren't real and everything is fake or an illusion around me. These thoughts make it very hard to stay motivated at best and make my stomach feel like it dropped 100 feet and anxiety ramp up to max at worst. I don't know how to stop my mind from thinking about death, dyeing, and the permanence being dead for an infinite amount of time. Medication and breathing exercises have been suggested. I've struggled with both as I often times get anxious when have a chest pain/twinge and breathing exercises amplify the pain feeling and memories of my breathing health problems. With medication, I've only found that it allows my mind the freedom to fall further into dark thoughts. With the lack of motivation, I find myself not doing things that could keep me healthy longer like exercising. I then feel guilty for not exercising and that it may expedite health problems so I loose motivation to start exercising. Cycles like this repeat throughout my life.

Each day I get a day older and my chances of a health issue or terminal diagnosis grows with it. I fear the day that I get an actual serious or terminal diagnosis such as cancer. I have family history of prevalent prostate cancer. Its extremely likely for me in my near future. Even if I had cancer that was cured, I'd constantly be in fear of relapse and wondering about the unknown of what is happening within me. While in the hospital with the spontaneous pneumothorax, I had a CT scan and daily x-rays. I wonder about how the radiation my catch up with me eventually such as causing lung cancer. My wife was diagnosed with HPV (not sure which one of us originally contracted it), and I think about how this virus could affect us in the future. I think about actions and regret things I did in my past that may have negative health consequences. I am not suicidal and don't want to die, but I have no idea how I'd react with a serious or terminal diagnosis. I don't think I couldn't mentally handle it. I'm told that my mother had a miscarriage prior to becoming pregnant with me. I think that it would have been better that she had that child and that I was never born. Just like that child that was lost, or other kids she didn't have, no one would have known what would have been missed had I never been born. But here I am. My parents have been my support group since they have directly witnessed my struggles with anxiety through the years. They are aging and my anxiety only gives them unnecessary stress. As an adult approaching or at middle age, I feel like these are struggles I should be able to face without their help. I can talk to my wife about it, but while she tries her best, she just isn't able to fully understand. I'm having to fight this battle alone more and more and I'm not sure how I'll do when I am eventually fighting it completely alone.

On the positive side, I have made improvements in the last 17 years. I think the years of talking to various therapists has help to a small degree and time has helped the most. I can now travel on strict conditions where I feel like I have some sort of control should I have a medical problem. I would really like to get control over the racing thoughts and the difficulty with nights and sleep. I'd like to be able to accept that one day I will die and it may be a slow death. I'd also like to accept the fact that death will be permanent and that it is ok to not know why my soul is in my body now in this point in time in the universe's history. I am sad looking back at the amount of  years I've waisted living in fear, worrying, and being anxious. I can't know what will happen tomorrow and I know eventually one day will come with terrible health news. I'm not prepared and I'm not sure how to improve. My hope is that one day I wake up, and without having any prior knowledge or warning, I die or am killed quickly.

Okay so some back story i‚Äôve been having lots of anxiety over my blood sugar. I am so scared of it being low and i‚Äôm scared I have reactive hypoglycemia. i‚Äôve been obsessively checking it and spending so much money on the test strips. I‚Äôm also scared to eat because i‚Äôm scared of how it will affect my blood sugar. I cried the other night because I was so hungry but so scared to eat. 

well today my mom wanted help bringing the groceries in and I was like yeah okay whatever I always help her right. well the last time I did barely any walking outside maybe like 5-10 minutes when I came back inside my blood sugar had lowered a ton. ever since then i‚Äôve been scared to do any kind of even slight exercise. as i‚Äôm bringing the groceries in my heart was RACING. I mean like racing racing it was at like 170. I am now scared that something is wrong with my heart. I am constantly so anxious about my blood sugar that my anxiety has gotten very much worse. I don‚Äôt know if the heart racing is my anxiety or not honestly. 

my issue is my anxiety is so severe and I have agoraphobia. I haven‚Äôt left my house in months and going to the doctor is just not seeming possible for me. I don‚Äôt know what to do. i‚Äôm so scared all the time and no one around me understands. I feel like i‚Äôm going to die.

I know when we become obsessive with the things about our bodies, it leads to more stress and more difficult it is to sort out the problem(s) that also causes more anxiety. I‚Äôve been there and done that. My sugar used to get low a lot of times which my dad and my aunt experience as well so this wasn‚Äôt new to me if it was genes that played a big part. Typically you‚Äôd see me carrying around candies and such to keep my sugar up. Now it‚Äôs not a problem for me. I do know a lot if stress and anxiety can make things a lot worst where it‚Äôs taking a toll on daily or normal activities. Having low blood sugar is fixable. Having anxiety, it‚Äôs manageable. Best thing to do is ring up a therapist, see where can take you. What you could do. Also wouldn‚Äôt hurt to go to the doctor and see why your sugar is low.

"I know exactly what you mean about feeling over-exerted leading to spikes in anxiety. 

I just took my dog out for a walk in the late afternoon heat and at the end the sweat started pouring and my mind started racing. 

The physical sensations mimic anxiety and my hyper-vigilance for anxiety triggers wave after wave. I took a shower and the sweat was still coming, but eventually my heart slowed down and now my palms aren‚Äôt even sweaty.

I realized in that moment of feeling overwhelmed that I just felt extremely vulnerable. I‚Äôve been getting poor sleep lately and that makes everything in my brain and body to a bit wonky. But recognizing that I felt vulnerable in that moment helped me somehow.

I have recently had these concerns. In summary, the anxiety uses up more of your natural energy (blood sugar). I carry glucose tablets and pop one when I feel shaky or anxious. It's unlikely that you are hypoglycemic, without other symptoms or a recognisable decline. Hypoglycemia is chronic, your condition is likely just low sugar leading to anxiety. It's a cyclical thing, just like most anxiety symptoms. Your overactive brain is using up energy, producing unhelpful thoughts and stress.

I have had such horrible sudden anxiety of bats and rabies ever since I read they can bite you in the night and you won‚Äôt know it. It is causing me difficulty sleeping and extreme anxiety. It started this week ever since my cat got a bat  7 days ago last Sunday. I took her to the vet asap the very next day. We got her boosted w rabies vaccination but they didn‚Äôt seem concerned and i asked about my other two cats. They didn‚Äôt seem concerned because they weren‚Äôt near it at all.  I also contacted my Dr due to worry about a small scratch I had got from. the cat when I was loving her after the bat incident. My dr didn‚Äôt seem concerned either about me, She just told me keep an eye on it for infection. The scratch is almost healed now. I live in the PA mountains so Bats are common here. She didn‚Äôt kill the bat and it was not injured. I got it out the window using a long handle dust pan and a broom unknowingly realizing I should have killed it and had it tested. Bats are so common here i never realized the threat before. I‚Äôm so scared of rabies and that cats/Myself getting it. It‚Äôs been 7 days so far and the cats all seem fine. The vet told me the cat who got the bat prob still had immunity from the shot she got last year. 


Early Sat morning at like 3am another bat was in the house. I have plumbing issues in my house so there is two holes my ceiling that I think that's how they are coming down from the attic possibly. I took care of the bat, I got it into a box, and the cats were no where near it bc I locked them in a room. I talk to the Pennsylvania Game Commission Warden, yesterday morning and explained everything great detail. She told me she doesn't think this is an exposure incident and was not concerned but I could reach out to my dr if I wanted to and said that even if they test it that it would not be sent out till Monday anyways but she wasn't concerned. The other thing the game warden said too was that sometimes health insurances won't even cover a vaccine if there was no exposure. She told me I could get rid of the dead bat outside so I put it near a creek outback my house. She also said I'm not the first to call about an issue of a bat getting in my house and mentioned migration issues. I got the holes all covered downstairs and everything. Getting a plumber in ASAP to fix the plumbing issue and will have someone fix my ceiling.  I didn‚Äôt have with a bat last night so i‚Äôm hoping the ceiling covering up worked. 

Before this I was never afraid of bats. We would get them in here and I'd just let them go outside but we all know how it is with google and it got me going. I think I'm better than I was but I get waves of anxiety and can't stop this fear of bats/rabies. üôÅ"	ouatfan30	post	29.92029694605308	female	White	0.9777808785438538	na	na	na	3	anxiety	no prediction.
"I hope you realize that contracting rabies from a bat is pretty rare. While bats are common in your area, it's pretty rare for bats to be actively carrying rabies, then going around biting people.  This is why the vet and your doctor weren't alarmed. It's a rare event. It's rarer than a fatal auto accident or a fall.

"I caught covid in November 2022 and until a couple of months ago I had hell:

\- Post exertion malaise(if I climbed several steps then I was in bed for 3-4 days)

\- Neurological pain

\- Muscle pain in the legs

\- conjunctivitis

\- skin rashes

\- muscle tremors

\- POTS (postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome) I had 150 beats just by standing up for months.

\- depression

\- Lack of sleep

\- nightmares

This is the most remarkable.

If that were not enough, my second daughter was born in January, and I have dealt with this disease in the best possible way, but come on, committing suicide passed through my head.

Now, the problem is that when I started to get better in June, **anxiety started**, and it's getting worse and worse and I don't understand why. I'm super happy to have gotten over this shit, but my head seems to have another fight for me..... I don't understand why it doesn't let me enjoy my day to day anymore and I have this feeling as soon as I get up in the morning.There are days that I don't have that feeling, and that's what I don't quite understand.

"Having anxiety is exhausting. Dealing with panic attacks is exhausting. It‚Äôs never-ending and whatever progress I make from therapy, whatever medication I am finally trying (I was super opposed to it until the panic attacks became frequent and severe), whatever attempt I have made to eat healthy, meditate, do breathing exercises, not use social media, not google symptoms, reach out to family and friends, not abandon my hobbies, stay optimistic, is so quick to get taken away when I‚Äôm having a really bad episode (an episode to me means a particularly bad panic attack as far as duration and physical symptoms). I don‚Äôt plan on giving up on myself whatsoever but it just feels so unfair that I‚Äôm ‚Äúdoing all the right things‚Äù yet there‚Äôs no end in sight still and I‚Äôm just really exhausted by this whole dance. 

I hate feeling like I‚Äôm not myself. I hate feeling like my mind isn‚Äôt mine to control. I hate that the same brain that makes me ME in the ways that I love - generally upbeat, perpetually optimistic, laid-back, in awe of life and people and nature, quick to laugh, happy cries - is the same one that makes me panic to a debilitating degree, to the point where I am fearing death despite it being such an irrational thought (confirmed by the many ER, urgent care, and doctor trips where my heart and overall health was checked along with blood tests and CT scans, etc. I‚Äôve dealt with in the last year and a half). I hate that its  unpredictability has conditioned me to fear and stress out about how it can strike at any moment. I hate that I can be having a really good fucking day with people I love who have been more than patient and loving with me while I find answers and a sudden tightening of the chest, rapid heart rate, random ache, blurry vision, and being convinced I‚Äôm going to die can just rob me of that good day. I hate that I have to apologize to people constantly when I‚Äôm feeling overwhelmed and need to be distant. I hate that the few people I‚Äôve opened up to about my struggles say they would‚Äôve never guessed because of how happy and cheerful I am. I hate that I know why they say that. I hate that unless you know how shitty and bad it can get, anxiety is still an easy thing to be dismissive of. I mean, I was that person before I ‚Äúgot‚Äù it.

Maybe it‚Äôs because it‚Äôs a ‚Äúnew‚Äù thing that I‚Äôve never dealt with before, that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm struggling to manage it. Maybe I just need to be patient. But man, it‚Äôs been over two years and just the hell I‚Äôve been through this last year trying to get help for this only to constantly end up back to square one, well, I‚Äôm just tired. 

Really, really tired.

I (23f) just started Wellbutrin a few weeks ago and noticed an improvement the first week but after that my anxiety has been through the roof. I‚Äôm trying to get off of lex because it hasn‚Äôt done anything for me for over 6 months (20mg) when I started it. I have severe anxiety and panic. I am so emotionally closed off due to my anxiety I literally can‚Äôt date. Will Wellbutrin even help with my anxiety? I‚Äôve been reading I need a stabilizer maybe?

Hi, Wellbutrin should help you, but only after some time. If you felt better during the first week, it was probably only a side effect. It can do that. But otherwise this type of med doesn't help that early on. And yes maybe you do need a secondary medication on top of that. Lots of people need that to recover. But that should be on a doctor to decide.	Flack12	reply	na	na	na	0.9991231560707092	weak	no	no	na	anxiety	no prediction.

"When dealing with your anxiety, what was the most impactful thing or moment of clarity that helped you on your road to recovery?  I‚Äôm hoping to either identify something I didn‚Äôt think of or confirm I‚Äôm on the right path. 

Backstory
I‚Äôve been on Effexor for Anxiety for around 10 years.  It contributed to me (37m) gaining 40+ pounds, having no energy, being irritable, always napping, and more. I asked my psychiatrist to help me get off to see if the grass was greener.  It was rough.  We spent the next six months tapering from 150mg/day to zero.  He said the taper was textbook but I was experiencing antidepressant discontinuation syndrome (rumination, chronic anxiety, unable to sleep or nap, almost a constant state of panic).  It‚Äôs very slowly been improving but still rough.  I was prescribed Clonazepam .25mg as needed but I‚Äôm terrified of medicine so I‚Äôve yet to take it. 

My challenges
Generalized Anxiety
Social anxiety 
OCD
Pharmacophobia

"Acceptance? Just accepting that anxiety is going to be there sometimes with reasons and sometimes with no reason. I think that helped me cut down my anxiety spirals and in that sense recover from it quicker.

Past me: ohh I am feeling anxious today, ruminate ruminate ruminate. Terrible night of sleep. More anxiety because I didn't sleep well last night. Getting behind on work and not getting my exercise. And the spiral continues.

Present me: feeling anxious today. Maybe take a step back for a bit. Still feeling anxious. Okay, now let's just do this one thing despite anxiety. Still not feeling better, doesn't matter just do this next thing. And so on. 

I think moving on with life helps get the mind to stop thinking anxious thoughts, even if it is for a short while, which in turn helps reduce the anxiety. 

I have an SOS prescription of Ativan as well and when things are really not working out, I don't mind taking it. Specially in the night before sleeping -- it does really help break the cycle."	OpeningAnxiety3845	reply	na	na	na	0.005773741751909256	no	strong	no	na	anxiety	no prediction.

Have you considered speaking to a therapist about social anxiety? What you‚Äôre describing sounds like social anxiety. I promise you that while your coworkers have probably noticed that you are shy, they are likely not dwelling or focusing on it at all and have just accepted that you seem to be a private or quiet person. People are never judging you as harshly as you judge yourself, even for a few spots on a cup you washed. At the end of the day the quality of your work will be more important than being the most sociable person there, and everyone prefers a reserved coworker over a loud obnoxious one. But I think for your quality of life would be improved by trying to work on that anxiety, cognitive behavioral therapy and possibly medication if deemed necessary by a professional are both very effective, you don‚Äôt have to suffer this anxiety constantly.

"""Depression/anxiety is the collapse of illusion in the face of reality.""

\-Wilhelm Reich

&#x200B;

Our culture does not do death well. We avoid thinking about it through constant distraction and busyness.

But, sooner or later this illusion of avoidance collapses and we are faced with the reality of something like death; namely our own.

Like the quote ""Everything goes slowly then all at once.""

The more we avoid the topic the harder it hits when we are faced with the reality of our own death.

Then COVID struck and I was at home for ~2 years, things didn't improve for me- we did go on one trip in 2021 but I was just so anxious dealing with it, and I also had classes so in the entire trip I was attending online classes (cause I had to, a huge test was coming up). My problem is that I'm anxious before the trip happens and during it I'm completely fine. It's gotten better now tho, but not completely cured. Going alone or with friends seems like a mammoth task. Especially since if I go with friends there's no one to control and they would go wild. I know I need to get over this for the future. Any tips?	anon3_3	post	23.046316478171576	female	White	0.9990119934082031	na	na	na	1	anxiety	no prediction.

"I‚Äôm 20f and have hidden myself away due to mental health issues my entire teen years, but have gotten better at ‚Äònormality‚Äô although I go long amounts of time not talking to many people.

I haven‚Äôt slept properly in a week and am once again on zero sleep dreading even waking up because i‚Äôm so scared. I feel so ill.

I got a feel for the new place i‚Äôm working at and was introduced and I think the biggest fear is not only new stuff but the people. They‚Äôre all a team and weren‚Äôt very talkative. I always seem to be ‚Äòweird‚Äô to other people even when i‚Äôm acting literally the same as them and i‚Äôm terrified it will happen again here.

it‚Äôs working within a room all day with people, what if I get there and within the first 5 minutes run out of things to say?! What do I do if it goes quiet. What if I get a sense of rejection from someone whilst already on the verge of tears and can‚Äôt escape? I‚Äôm so scared. I also have to work with kids which is my dream, but i‚Äôm so awkward!

Yes. Caffeine effects the vagal nerves which in turn will effect the amygdala (the part of your brain that deals with all the bad stuff; fear, anxiety, stress to name a few) , in essence 'revving' it up, heightening anxiety and stress.

"I think this has a yes and no answer.

Let me explain -

Yes, obviously if you cut caffeine out of your diet completely there won't be any stimulants in your system, thus less bursts of energy/anxiousness. However, I think it has a lot to do with the amount ingested at one time. For example, if I have a soda that contains around 35mg of caffeine and I finish it in a short amount of time - I get a small but noticeable amount of energy but it's nothing crazy. 

Now, if I decide to have drip coffee and sip it over an hours time - I'm going to have a noticeable amount of energy and start feeling somewhat anxious. Remember in an 8oz cup of coffee that's anywhere from 75-145mg of caffeine. A lot more significant than an 12oz can of soda that has 35mg. Now, say I drink 2oz of espresso that has about 75mg in one shot - I'm going to be off the walls anxious. Uncomfortable, elevated heart rate and shaky. 

I also tried this will cold brew coffee. I can't get drink hot coffee, it just upsets my stomach and I'm on the toilet almost immediately. Cold brew coffee is something any anxious person needs to avoid. I used to drink cold brew coffee all the time. What would happen is I'd suck it down and go on my way feeling okay. Then about 30 minutes later I would be bouncing off the wall, panicking, anxious, heart rate through the roof and not being able to sit still. Cold brew coffee has about 200mg of caffeine in 12oz. 

I think sodas are okay and decaf or half-caff coffee is fine. Sodas on average have about 35-45mg, decaf is like 5mg, and half-caff coffee is at most 75mg. We're talking 8-12oz, so a cup to a little over a cup. 

This is only MY opinion and what happened with me.

I still drink caffeine but will not touch espresso or cold brew anymore. (Especially Nespresso pods and Starbucks espresso)"	lucascon777	reply	na	na	na	0.9988045692443848	no	no	no	na	anxiety	no prediction.
"It makes me SO bad. I try to stay under 50 mg of caffeine a day.


However, you could try green tea if you really need caffeine, it has L-theanine naturally which has calming effects, and with green tea you‚Äôre not being slapped in the face with caffeine, it‚Äôs more slowly introduced to your system,  I can handle green tea but I can‚Äôt handle coffee."	lucascon777	reply	na	na	na	0.9988045692443848	no	strong	no	na	anxiety	no prediction.

Logically, consuming any stimulant when you suffer from anxiety doesn't make sense but I still did it and got used to that feeling until I detoxed (I got the flu)...didn't drink it for maybe 10 days.

For me personally, it hasn't really helped to have little/no caffeine compared to like a cup or two of coffee a day. I never get overcaffeinated anymore so I guess it's helpful in that way because that definitely did make the anxiety worse, but otherwise my baseline anxiety is still there and not really any better or lighter.

I notice that my anxiety has been through the roof since I begin drinking coffee again...	lucascon777	reply	na	na	na	0.9988045692443848	no	strong	no	na	anxiety	no prediction.
It really depends on the amount of caffeine within a given cup of coffee! It is possibly to get coffee with a significant smaller amount of caffeine. But best just drinking decaf - if being sensitive to caffeine.	lucascon777	reply	na	na	na	0.9988045692443848	no	no	no	na	anxiety	no prediction.
Not sure what you‚Äôd get from Starbucks but it was always the sugary coffee drinks that made me super anxious	lucascon777	reply	na	na	na	0.9988045692443848	no	strong	no	na	anxiety	no prediction.
For me it‚Äôs the added extra sugar that usually comes with those drinks. I can drive cross country and pound iced coffees and have a 70bpm heart rate, but switch to like mochas or something from SB and I‚Äôm fatigued after just one.	lucascon777	reply	na	na	na	0.9988045692443848	no	strong	no	na	anxiety	no prediction.

That‚Äôs how I am.  I feel like I get more anxiety if I don‚Äôt have my morning cup. But I only allow myself one and day and it doesn‚Äôt affect my anxiety-it‚Äôs always other things or my mind lol	lucascon777	reply	na	na	na	0.9988045692443848	no	strong	no	na	anxiety	no prediction.
Same. I allow myself a little each day, partly because it does calm me down, partly because for some strange reason it makes my migraines end faster?? I recently tried a no caffeine stepdown again and once I was at zero for a few days the anxiety spiral came back :(	lucascon777	reply	na	na	na	0.9988045692443848	no	strong	no	na	anxiety	no prediction.
That‚Äôs because there‚Äôs L-Theanine, an amino acid that's found naturally in tea, and it impacts the way caffeine interacts with your body and brain. It usually produces a more calming effect versus the caffeine in coffee.	lucascon777	reply	na	na	na	0.9988045692443848	no	no	no	na	anxiety	no prediction.
L-Theanine is also found naturally in tea leaves, which is why a lot of people who drink tea don‚Äôt get the same anxiety as coffee, though tea also contains caffeine.	lucascon777	reply	na	na	na	0.9988045692443848	no	no	no	na	anxiety	no prediction.

You know, spot on! It also helps to take with coffee if you‚Äôre sensitive to caffeine. I find that it does a good job of anxiety from cannabis, especially sativa strains or more racy hybrids.

It was immediate after drinking it. I cut out coffee and wasn't drinking it for a few weeks and then a riend brought me coffee to work.

Yes. I feel bad when I have an unexpected call or an email while I was happily watching something on my phone. I am currently trying to sleep but worrying what if someone calls or something bad happens. I feel bad and hope I could do better than writing.

"I was at a party last night and ended up drinking (not very much) and had 2 hits off someones weed pen. I was hesitant to smoke weed because it usually heightens my anxiety, especially around new people, but I thought if I kept a good mindset everything would be fine. Later into the night, a few of us are outside talking and my mind is RACING. I can't focus on what anyone else is saying, I'm just so anxious and hyper aware of myself/my appearance. With every anxious thought I try to tell myself it's okay and to just focus on breathing. But suddenly my vision cuts out and I lose consciousness for a second. My friend takes me to another room and her loving presence brought me back to Earth.

Everyone at the party was really nice to me after, but it's hard not to feel shame/embarrassment. I didn't ""freak out"" or have a hyperventilating meltdown, but I did lose consciousness and had to be escorted away in front of everyone.

Was this a panic attack? If so, what can I do better next time?"	littleblackksheep	post	30.2974595493089	female	White	0.998027503490448	na	na	na	25	anxiety	no prediction.

Im 31 now. I first started smoking weed at 12, I used to have getting to high. But I was with older kids and couldn't ever have weed of my own. If I did I had to smoke it all before going home lol. So with that being said iv had alot of weed induced panic attacks. Didn't know anything about it back then I just knew I fucked up and go to high. Fast forward to about 22 or 25 years old I was introduced to edibles. Now those got me paranoid ever time so I decided to stick to weed. Now at 31 I can't even smoke weed now. It causes to much paranoia and I now have anxiety so It triggers a anxiety attack. Its ok to not be able to smoke weed. Iv met alot of people who wish they could smoke weed but couldn't for what ever reason. Our bodies and minds change over time. Weed will always have a special place in my heart.

I can‚Äôt smoke weed at all, ever, under any circumstances. It sends me straight to hell! Always takes me a few days to shake off the experience. It simply doesn‚Äôt work with some people.

No problem! But hey, everyone really is different. Don‚Äôt want to be discouraging because you might be able to smoke weed and have fun again! I‚Äôve seen people go from having a bad to good relationship with it. Could depend on your general state of being in life and if you‚Äôre anxious at the moment. In my case I think I‚Äôm always a little anxious beneath the surface even if I‚Äôm not aware, so weed puts a magnifying glass to the anxiety and makes me feel that things are much harder than they are.

"TLDR.... Idk how to describe it but when I'm in the walls of my workplace I'm somehow the best version of myself. But in my personal life... it all changes. I'm becoming mentally unable to connect with the people who I'm supposed to be the closest to in my life and it's sending me into heavy feelings of depression.

I work in the senior living industry, activities department, and at work I'm very well-liked by my residents (which is most important to me) and I'd assume most of the staff. It's a mentally taxing and social job, but I do (did?) consider myself to be a warm person... so it works for me, and objectively i am good at my job. At work, I present as a very positive person who's full of energy and always goes the extra mile for my residents. My role is to be uplifting to others and constantly engaging... and i do it well, obviously I'm not a perfect employee and have off days/moments but for the most part I am the ideal version of myself when in the walls of my workplace. I know the right things to say, I can make conversation no problem, naturally engaging even w meaningless smalltalk... etc. Work me, just knows what to do. I'm so good at making strangers, or people not a part of my life happy, and I'm able to actually be myself? If that makes sense.

Now, let's go to after hours/weekend me. As soon as i walk into my home, my mentality just changes for the worst. My identity... leaves me, i feel like a shell. On my days off I don't want to do anything or talk to anyone most of the time, including my friends and family. I know this is wrong, and mentally I do WANT to spend time w my circle but when the time comes and I do hang out w people close to me... I feel like my brain goes into autopilot. I'm physically unable to be the naturally social person I am (was? Am actually not?), I feel myself be cold, I feel my body language get closed off, it's difficult to make eye contact (im constantly looking down/away i noticed), my mind blanks and I have no idea what to say.... it's like a social panic attack. But only towards the people I'm close with (like, immediate family and close circle of friends. None of which did anything to me that would make me naturally distant, in fact they're all wonderful supportive people who treat me great and I'm so lucky) I don't know how to describe it, in the moment I just become so closed off. I feel like I purposely ice out and blow off meaningful conversation, I don't know how to carry a conversation with them anymore, i can't even look my best friend or my father in the eye anymore during a full conversation when theres literally NOTHING WRONG i just feel anxious for no reason. then when it's over I cry and feel like an asshole because I know I didn't act the way I should have, I wasted yet another moment to connect and have a meaningful conversation bc I was so closed off and couldn't bring myself to say anything. 

I've felt this way for maybe a couple of years now, slowly becoming more cold but it's eating me alive and I don't know how to change it. It's like an uncontrollable reaction to love and I feel like I'm traumatized but I don't know from what (i worked in healthcare through covid and saw a lot of traumatizing shit, thats what my mom chalks it up to but idk). 

I thank you so much for reading my vent, any kind of advice or suggestions are beyond appreciated, especially anyone who has been in a situation like this and has techniques on how to be more ""connected"" to life. I need to reclaim the way I live my life before I drive wonderful people away and fully lose myself.

Hi all, I‚Äôm currently doing my exams and there was a lot of pressure and stress surrounding it since I want to do well, so there was a certain pressure and expectations that made me stress for a long period of time, for 8 weeks straight before we get breaks. The symptoms are me feeling heavy/pressure in the head, feeling like I‚Äôm about to faint because the world does not feel real (???) , and worst comes to worse if I don‚Äôt manage these anxiety inducing thoughts I can get panic attacks and it‚Äôs usually in public, which is great. I‚Äôm really scared because I‚Äôve never felt like this before and for such a long damn time it seems to be okay for a few days then come back the other days. It feels like I‚Äôm sick with a fever but I don‚Äôt have the fever aspect ykyk. The symptoms are especially obvious when I walk in complex visual areas, at some point I‚Äôm also suspecting wherther i have PPPD or is it just I‚Äôm simply too tired and fatigued and stressed about a lot of things. I have a history of OCD and anxiety and I just feel it hitting me hard right now. I just want to shut off and feel normal again.

I messaged my sister, but I have no data here so no phone calls. I can try and see if the hostel has landline I can use but the thought of that gives me even more anxiety. The people at this hostel are what set off this panic attack. In the last hostel everyone was friendly and I made friends immediately. Everyone at this one is fucking wierd and distant. I had to try and sleep in a room with 8 strangers who wouldn't even say hello to me.  It was creepy and freaked me out.

So, part of traveling is figuring out what experiences you enjoy and what experiences you can live with and what things you're just not going to do again.  It sounds like you've found one of those last ones.  Is it possible to adjust so that you can avoid this situation again?  Are there things you can do to feel more comfortable?  Did you check the reviews on the hostel, were there any red flags that could have tipped you off?  Can you get some data on a prepaid card or something so you can make a phone call if you need to?  Sometimes the worst travel experiences also make the best stories!	Gastte	reply	na	na	na	0.9995015859603882	weak	no	strong	na	anxiety	no prediction.

"Hello everyone I hope you are doing well ! 

I want to start off by saying I‚Äôm a 22 year old health 6 ft 65kg male. 
Had first heart test in 2016 - was an ecg and a imaging of my heart ( EVERYTHING PERFECT) by cardiologist looking at results.

2017- ekg - perfect
2019 - my anxiety starts 
2019- finger heart test at doctors = perfect
2020-2021 - had a few heart tests at the doctors all perfect
2022- EKG AGAIN - my anxiety gets really bad a week before the ekg as scared of bad news. Had skipped beats and thuds in my chest for a whole week up until the test
The test was perfect AGAIN
2023 April - Anxiety and heart anxiety gets super bad to the point where I didn‚Äôt wanna walk because I was scared of getting palpitations (skipped beats, thuds and flutters) 
The palpitations started got them nearly everyday a few times a day the more I had the more I got scared. 
Had a telephone interview with doctor and she said there is no reason. Why the palpitations would signify anything bad because there‚Äôs no symptoms like pain or passing out with the palpitations and ontop of that ALL the tests I had it would be pretty much 99.9% fine. 
The only thing she said she could do for me is to give me a 24hr heart monitor just to prove to me I‚Äôm fine and to stop my anxiety. But we agreed this would probably just cause more stress and it‚Äôs unnecessary. She said the palpitations won‚Äôt go until the anxiety does.

FAST FORWARD to 13th of august 2023. I‚Äôm still getting them most days a few times a day but now I don‚Äôt panic as much BUT if I feel them too much then I can still start panicking. The ones I get mostly are while or after eating so wondering if it‚Äôs gas. 

Sometimes it can feel like a movement in my chest and it brings my attention to my chest and then I feel my heartbeat after. I can burp or feel air sometimes after aswell
I do sometimes get a mild ish tense sort of feeling in my head straight after it‚Äôs done the skipped beat but I‚Äôm wondering if that‚Äôs due to the anxiety or adrenaline. I‚Äôve never passed out or anything. 

Sometimes my safety behaviour is to check if I look pale in the mirror but due to some lighting I can look kind of pale and also when u start panicking ur blood draws away from ur face making u look slightly more pale anyway. So I looked at myself in the mirror and thought I looked a little pale but when I‚Äôd calmed down I looked and wondered if it was the lighting or because I‚Äôm panicking or if I wasn‚Äôt even pale anyway

Now I did research on palpitations and how to tell if they are dangerous BUT my heart rate is a normal rate after maybe slightly raised due to I think it gives me instant anxiety and adrenaline rush. Anyway my heart rate and heart and heart rythme are completely normal after having them. Bad palpitations is when u get bad rythme after because ur can be a sign of something called Afib.

So I guess I‚Äôm just asking should I just accept them and stop worrying ? 
It‚Äôs just the more I have them the longer it goes on and the more I worry something is wrong. 

Can someone just reassure me and also with ur reply please understand if u say I have a heart problem or something I may go into serious anxiety so please just word it in a certain way. 
I am scared to exersise and even walk far due to fear of dropping dead or having a palpitation when walking or exersising.

Palpitations are perfectly normal. Everyone gets them but some of us can just feel them more. Once they get your attention you start concentrating on them more and you kind of hone in on your heart so you can feel every beat. Like your doctor said, as long as you don‚Äôt have any other symptoms like chest pain or shortness of breath then they are not harming you.

So I‚Äôve always been a shy person and always have had social anxiety( with people I don‚Äôt know), and girls and things like that. But since 2022 started my anxiety took a turn for the worse. I had a bad dream, then I woke up and from there on out I‚Äôve had intrusive thoughts, nightmares, which is normal but mine would sometimes be gruesome, social anxiety with family, not wanting to do anything at all because I‚Äôm self conscious, paranoid, the list goes on. I have ocd as well which I‚Äôve always had and it didn‚Äôt bother me much, but now since I‚Äôve gotten bad anxiety, it mixes bad with the ocd. I overthink so many things and it‚Äôs hard for me to concentrate on anything. My nerves are bad, it‚Äôs messed with my vision, there‚Äôs just so many things. I‚Äôm irritated very easily sometimes, I even get frustrated at my little brothers sometimes because they might scream while paying and I immediately think the worst. I sometimes think people are talking about me wether it‚Äôs my friends on the game, coworkers, or family. I‚Äôve taken Zoloft before. I tried 25 mg and thought it was working for a bit. Then they stopped working, so I upped the dosage to 50 mgs. These ones didn‚Äôt work at all, but I did smoke week while taking those so it might have been the reason they weren‚Äôt effective. I know this is long but I‚Äôm just tired.

"27, male, 6‚Äô0‚Äù, 200 pounds. 

Hey y‚Äôall, I‚Äôve made posts before on sub now that I‚Äôm dealing with anxiety. 

I‚Äôve never had to deal with high blood pressure but a few weeks ago I had a terrible panic attack that left me with high levels of anxiety and ever since then, my blood pressure has been consistently high. 

During that initial panic attack, I went to the ER thinking I was having a heart attack.  Every single test they did came back that I was fine and normal. 

I couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling of something bad, though, and bought myself a blood pressure monitor.  It‚Äôs all over the place.  It‚Äôll go from as high as 167/75 to 120/80 and everywhere inbetween.  

I went to see a general family doctor and my blood pressure was 141/86 during my visit.  He said it was high but that my I seemed healthy, and from hearing my heart and lungs, they sounded normal.  He looked at the tests they did at the ER during my panic attack and said the same thing everyone else did, that the tests are showing that everything normal. 

I still can‚Äôt shake this newfound anxiety and whenever I feel super anxious, I‚Äôll check my BP and it‚Äôs high.  Like right before writing this, I felt super anxious, anxiety attack level and it read 167/76, then I waited 5 mins and it went back down to 141/80.  

I don‚Äôt wanna know if anyone is dealing with the same thing?  Is this HBP or just terrible anxiety?

Edit:  also, every since that initial panic attack, I haven‚Äôt been getting good sleep.  I‚Äôll wake up every hour after going to bed.  Even if I sleep 7-8 hours, it‚Äôs all in intervals."	TeachMe2GetGood	post	34.77114114574884	female	White	0.9959456324577332	na	na	na	22	anxiety	no prediction.
None of your readings arr concerning. The more important number is the diastolic (bottom number) and all of yours are in normal range.

This is me. I‚Äôm not at healthy weight tho and I‚Äôm not physically active so that makes it worse. Are you on some medication for anxiety? I‚Äôd try that to see if that lowers you BP because you might subconsciously be stressed about it which is causing you to have high BP often or at least when you‚Äôre getting it read you‚Äôre nervous to the point it‚Äôs coming up high.

A few things‚Ä¶ depending on what your using to record your BP it may not even be very accurate (such as the wrist one). Second, if your nervous or anxious during your reading, your BP will be higher. Third, if tests for underlying conditions are coming back normal then you don‚Äôt have any sort of heart condition. This doesn‚Äôt seem to be blood pressure problems or heart problems at all. You have anxiety. I would see a psychiatrist and therapist rather than a PCP about your anxiety as opposed to a family physician for your BP. Also, stop checking your BP if it‚Äôs making you that anxious.

When I'm awake I'm constantly anxious and highly anxious and therefore I'm dealing with high BP as well. I'm sorry you're going through this. It's tough cause the high BP makes you feel even more anxious even though it's not actual anxiety that you're feeling in the moment lol it's wild how it's all connected in the body. 
For me, long walks in nature have helped. No music, no podcasts, just walking through the fields and forests and trying to pay attention to what's right there in front of me. Also pets help but my current living situation doesn't allow for that.

Yes, it will affect your blood pressure. But seeing as how you are only 27, it might just be during the panic attack. Have you tried testing it when you are calm?

When you're only testing your blood pressure when you're stressed and anxious it is absolutely going to come out with a high top number. I recently went to urgent care because I couldn't hear out of my left ear for a week and that compounded with me going straight after work (retail, ugh,) made it SKYROCKET. They were super worried but when they were done fixing my ear up they took it again and it was completely normal. If you'd like and it would make you feel better take it in the morning or another time you feel you're at your calmest AND in the moments of anxiety so you have a true baseline to go off of.

"Blood pressure isn‚Äôt set in stone, it literally reacts to your emotional and physical state, if it wasn‚Äôt 165 while you‚Äôre panicking then probably there is something wrong.

The ‚Äúideal‚Äù blood pressure shouldn‚Äôt exceed 120/80, but here‚Äôs what most people miss, this should be your level when you‚Äôre completely calm, haven‚Äôt smoked in 1 hour, and have been sitting down in an upright but relaxed position for at least 5-10mins.

Don‚Äôt worry OP, your BP seems normal, and all your other symptoms are completely normal.

One thing that helped me calm down (mentally, physically usually follows a few days later) is to ride the wave and accept that these are normal reactions of your body to a perceived threat, ride the wave and understand that you‚Äôve probable felt the same exact symptoms 1000‚Äôs of times throughout your life but you chose to ignore them then because you didn‚Äôt perceive them as dangerous.

I‚Äôve had mine under extreme stress and anxiety go ER level high (226/126). Like I couldn‚Äôt see straight and it wouldn‚Äôt go down.

I have had a few episodes like that. The brain is a powerful thing. You can sometimes convince yourself of what‚Äôs happening & the body has a physical reaction (there‚Äôs a word/phrase for it but I can‚Äôt remember). Some people have reported calling an ambulance for a stroke due to numbness and drooping (stroke symptoms) only to arrive at the hospital & be told it was a panic attack. Anxiety is wild.

Hi all, first of all i‚Äôm NOT asking for a diagnosis. Been to the GP several times. Just searching for some insights and opinions..

So there‚Äôs some things I‚Äôve been struggling with for years. Father died in 2013 of cancer, had very difficult years after in which I didn‚Äôt grieve his death. Also had a very manipulative girlfriend from 2013 tot 2018. Been also having OCD since I were a kid.

When that relationship ended I started to develop a cough and bowel issues. I saw that my stools were thin and weird. Saw my GP for both issues, but she assured me it would be nothing. Health anxiety started to get worse and I started getting panic attacks. Years passed and the symptoms didn‚Äôt go away. Went to my GP so many times to get reassurance about my health..

Last year in april I moved to a new place with my new girlfriend who is my fianc√©e today! Around that time I felt a very hard immovable lump in my neck that freaked me out. Started worrying about cancer and convinced myself I had it. Went to my GP who referred me for an echo, but nothing weird. Could be an extra rib they said in the hospital. Anyhow, that lump freaked me out to the MAX and I developed an one sided headache at that time. It‚Äôs more of like a head pressure around my right temple that sometimes radiates to the neck. It‚Äôs literally always there from waking up to going to sleep. Doesn‚Äôt wake me up tho. Developed (in my imagination) one sided weakness on the left side, which suddenly went away. The cough I had for years disappeared out of nothing but now I‚Äôm left with this one sided head pressure that‚Äôs constantly there for 14 months now. Also since a couple of months occasionally a weird smell. For some hours my smell gets distorted and then out of nothing (usually after sleeping) it resets. Bloods are perfect and did some neuro tests (reflexes, pupils etc) and everything is OK. GP doesn‚Äôt see a need for an MRI because if it were a brain tumor she‚Äôd likely see something in the tests and the symptoms would‚Äôve gotten waayy worse over the course of a year. Also still left with bowel issues. Never a solid stool, always gassy and stools smell bad. Thought I had blood in my stool but my GP said it was undigested foods. Also a constant pressure in my lower left abdomen. Don‚Äôt know what to do now, doc says it‚Äôs all because of high amounts of stress I put my body to.

Is it really possible that I have this one sided constant pressure because of something psychomatic for so long? It didn‚Äôt get worse over time. Also the bowel movements, could this really be stress for so many years? Doc also said bowel cancer usually gives anemia, which i don‚Äôt have. Also have strong depersonalization issues for some years which worsened A LOT the last couple of weeks.. no one notices anything. 

I sometimes think I developed bowel cancer some years ago and last year it metastized to my brain and have it there also since. Is this something realistic or am I not being sober in this? Is my heavy derealization from a tumor or more likely the anxiety and trauma‚Äôs. Last weeks everything feels very fake.

I would think.. if it were something so serious, something would‚Äôve happened by now right? The phantosmia, the head pressure (that sometimes gets really mild almost not noticable), (perceived) weakness and pulsating tingling in left side of the body would‚Äôve developed significantly if it were really something right?

Hey so I'm(20m) am having a hard time dealing with this and any advice is much appreciated and I will be thankful for 

But my Mom had a Heart Attack 4 years ago that nearly killed her(It was actually a rare one, and she is lucky to he alive) she glorifies that she went to work 4 weeks after she had it and always stayed working 

My Uncle died of a heart attack at a VERY young age due to stress. This apparently wasn't a wake up call and my mom continues to work 50+ Hours and helps my Stepdads Lawn Care Buisness on the side. She always insists to make a full course meal every night and I told her I would start cooking to help ease the load off of her(I also do dishes and trash without hesitation) 

After all of this, she ""Says"" she's not stressed, but I feel like she is. Her AND my stepfather are total Workaholics and glorfy the 40 work week and basically your job is what determines your worth. If your not working like that, your below them

I expressed my feelings and said to not overwork herself and enjoy things BUT she said she's perfectly fine and her hearts doing okay, but like, none if this makes any sense because the LAST FUCKING I WOULD WANT IS TO WORK MY ASS OFF FOR NO FUCKING REASON

I'm sorry she's really good at her job but I'm scared for her. She never listens and is very stubborn and I'm glad she likes what she does, but am I wrong for worrying about all of this or should I stay to myself?"

"I (17f) grew up in an abusive household, it was dad who did it emotionally&physically and mom being sometimes emotionally draining.

So, my whole life I've been dealing with low self esteem, anger issues as well as an eating disorder.

In the past 3 years I've developed some sort of a social anxiety and it's getting worse everyday to the point that I avoid any human interaction.

I'm what may be called a ""nerd"" so I've done nothing for the past 12 years but study, I also do have hobbies and interests but here's the issue,

During the last and current summer break I literally do NOT want to do anything. I isolate myself in my room away from my dad so I won't kill myself.

Everyone says that it's alright to feel this way since the last school year (senior year) has taken a toll on everyone and not just me. But I don't think they understand, I used to draw/read/have favorite shows. Now these things seem way too hard for me to even consider doing, I'm physically and mentally tired/drained all the time and I sleep a lot.

I finished highschool with a total of marks that allows me to enroll in any engineering program in my country, but despite that being my four-year-old dream, I'm not thrilled about it at all. It even has gotten me anxious about a new life and its consequences, alongside to my social anxiety and my inability to cope with change.

I may haven't been in my brightest days before, but these past 2 years have been so hard for me. Every now and then I'd think about ending it, but I'm not courageous enough to do it I guess. I just want time to stop for a second and let me breathe, I hate that my family thinks I'm just being ""lazy"" because I'm usually willing to help with everything & insists on not leaving me alone (always berating me and annoying me in every way possible, I'm the oldest daughter so you probably get it), I feel so overwhelmed by everything.

I'm not really seeking advice, I guess it's more of a vent because I don't usually get to pour my feelings this clearly. Well, actually that's not everything that has been going in my mind, but it's probably a great deal of it. A lot or not I think I feel kind of relieved that I managed to even write it out.

I think it's just me wanting to validate my feelings, because I'm constantly thinking that what I've been dealing with is ""normal"", but I don't think it's normal to wake up everyday only to feel disappointed in yourself and your whole life, No? 

Excuse me if there are any mistakes, English is not my first language and also if it's a bit chaotic, nothing feels clear now."	throwawayacc10uns	post	26.784888867738964	female	White	0.8740695714950562	na	na	na	3	anxiety	no prediction.
"You sound a lot like me when I was your age. I grew up with a dad who abused me physically and emotionally so I poured my heart and soul into school work. I was extremely burnt out by the end of senior year but I went to uni anyway and it almost killed me. I ended up having to drop out for 2 years because of my mental health. Now I'm back in uni and doing much better. 

Not wanting to do anything and not feeling excited about things that were exciting to you in the past can be a sign or burnout or depression or both. The only way out of burnout is to rest and to do things that fill your cup. Burnout essentially happens when you give too much energy to people or goals but don't do enough to give to yourself. When you keep pushing yourself even through burnout or depression, you're more likely to end up in a mental health crisis, kind of like I did during the last half of 2020.

Besides stretching you can try more breaks (if you're at a desk too much). Most of my pains from back when I was heaviest/most depressed only really went away with better posture and a weight routine.

"In addition to the other tips, something I found useful was using a TENS unit. It helps loosen up the tightness in my neck and shoulders. 

Keep in mind though that it only helps to loosen up tightness and help relieve pain. It doesn‚Äôt actually heal anything, so it can help if it‚Äôs due to anxiety but not if you have a real injury. 

When my anxiety and depression are really bad I get so tight that I can‚Äôt even do any of the exercises that would normally help. So I use the TENS unit to loosen up and get rid of the pain. Afterwards I feel much better and can then focus on stretches, etc."	everythingganythingg	reply	na	na	na	0.9977859258651733	no	strong	no	na	anxiety	no prediction.

I‚Äôm 23F. I‚Äôve been talking to a guy 36M from tinder. We met up for drinks last night. I had also smoked a bit of weed before meeting up. I smoked like 3 joints to myself (24% THC). Idk if that‚Äôs a lot of weed because I‚Äôm new to this.

I met up with him and he was even more attractive than his pictures. I was also extremely horny because I hadn‚Äôt had sex in a few months. We talked and I ended up having 2 drinks. He drank only one beer because he had to drive us home after. I was honestly GONE. I hadn‚Äôt eaten much that day so the alcohol was hitting me hard. The room was spinning a bit. We walked back to his car and I felt like I couldn‚Äôt walk straight. I was holding on to his arm for support. 

The drive back home was around 40 mins. We live in the same neighborhood but I live with parents and his parents were also visiting him. So I knew we would be having car sex. The whole drive back he was grabbing my pussy. He told me to finger myself, when we stopped at red lights he would help or reach over and choke me/pinch my nipples. I was extremely horny and I kept staring at the boner in his pants. I had my hand on his cock rubbing it through his pants. I kept begging him to pull over somewhere and fuck me but he said he was enjoying this too much. The drive felt like forever. 

Eventually we got closer to our Neighbourhood and he found somewhere to stop. He took his dick out and I started sucking. I spit on it and he rubbed the spit all over my face. He reached over and fingered me while I sucked his dick. Suddenly he started forcing his cock down my throat. I tried my best to take it but I was choking and was worried I might throw up on his dick. He started fingering my asshole and I said ‚Äúnononono‚Äù he started laughing and pushed my head down his cock more. I said no more firmly and he finally stopped and apologized. I felt like crying but he held me and apologized and told me I‚Äôm safe now. He asked if I wanted to keep going and I said yes. I continued to suck his cock and he slapped my ass  super hard. After a few mins I got really overwhelmed and sat back in my seat and started crying. 

He asked me what was wrong. I couldn‚Äôt get the words out I felt hysterical. He drove us to a gas station and picked up a water bottle. I waited in the car and drank some water. He asked me if he did anything wrong I said no. He kept apologizing and said he hopes I‚Äôm doing okay in life in general.  He said he hopes I‚Äôm in therapy if I need it etc. I told him that a few months ago I was assaulted and I think I am having issues with that. 

This is true. Back in March I met up with a guy and he coerced me into having sex with him. I said I was tired from work but he kept saying things to try and persuade me. Eventually I felt like I had no choice and I said yes. At some points during sex I said no (it wasn‚Äôt a firm no) but the guy didn‚Äôt stop. It seemed to turn him on even more. I felt like I had to force myself to be into it. Ever since then sometimes I‚Äôll be going about my daily life and I‚Äôll suddenly remember this assault and feel really unsafe. I think that might be what happened here. 

Regardless I really want to have sex with the 36M again. He is very very attractive but I‚Äôm worried I scared him off. I don‚Äôt know if he wants to see me again. 

I know some people are going to tell me to take a break from sex and heal from this trauma but I don‚Äôt want to do that. I‚Äôve been ridiculously horny and need to release that."	fxckingmess	post	22.40327053992987	male	White	0.00958387739956379	na	na	na	3	anxiety	"age: 23, gender: female, explanation: the author explicitly states their age and gender in the text as ""23f"" meaning 23-year-old female. however, there isn't sufficient information to predict the ethnicity of the author."

"There is a lot going on here. It sounds like you were raped twice. The fact that you said no and he laughed and kept going is fucked up. The earlier time you also said no and someone kept going - there is no difference between a ""no"" and a firm ""no"". I'm a 31m and it's no ingrained in me that any no always means no. It's a major red flag that he kept going and if it were me, I'd never see him again. There are lots of guys who will respect you and boundaries - why risk it? If his reaction is to laugh and keep going when someone is saying no the first time,  he has probably done the same before and will do it again. 

Sex can be good for stress so you don't need to avoid it but please be smart. Going back to someone who, in my opinion based on your story, raped you is not smart. Find someone else.

"I have ADHD, and horrendous social anxiety. I've never much cared for anything I did and I just followed what my mom would tell me to do, I guess I just assumed it was the best option because I didn't really want to bother thinking too much about the future.  
I'm currently 20, which obviously isn't that old, and a lot of people will say you can always fix stuff even at this age, but I feel like my life is heading straight for nothing, and there's just so much wrong with me that I don't know if I can make up for all the lost time.  


Despite my anxiety I had some friends in gradeschool, and luckily I made the smart choice of going to the same highschool as them, therefore I was never really completely alone, even if I was entirely quiet the entire time and just listening in on the conversation.  
And despite having ADHD I managed to get through classes purely because my memory is above average and because I liked math and related fields.  


I started university 2 years ago and none of my friends went to the same university as me, during the 2 years that I've been here I've made a whopping 0 friends, and I made the unfortunate choice of going into math, which ended up being infinitely harder than I though it would be...  
Being entirely alone for 2 years is crippling to say the least, my friends went to entirely different universities so I see them maybe once every couple of months if at all, and when I'm at home (that is back from university) I never leave the house, I've been a semi shut-in since I was around 13 and I just don't leave the house unless my parents tell me we are going somewhere to eat or if I have to go to a birthday party of some relative or something of the sort.  
On top of that the university I chose was as mentioned, way harder than I thought... Despite being in my 2nd year of studying I still haven't finished the first year, I can get through the practical part of the exams (that is, the written part), but then we have theoretical exams which I just fail entirely because I am unable to properly memorize information the way they want me to memorize it.  


I wanted to switch last year, to an easier program, but my mom said I should ""keep on trying"", because I had some surgery during last year's summer, and she said that was ""the only reason why I failed"". I knew that wasn't true, but I sucked it up and gave it another go...  
To say the least, that was not a smart choice, I am entirely burnt out and I feel such absolute disgust for university right now, that the moment I think about the fact that I still have to get through 2 exams makes me want to vomit, I can't bring myself to even try and do any university work, and it's just making me more and more anxious, knowing that the dates of the exams are approaching.  
This year, I told my mom on multiple occasions, that I want to stop going to university, but she just kept on forcing me to go, but at this point I have enough, so I just told her today that I'm done, that I'd rather find a job or something, and do something else, I simply cannot function like this anymore.  


She didn't really relent, and instead said to ""give it one more month to think it over"" AS IF I HAVENT BEEN THINKING ABOUT IT FOR A FULL YEAR, but I digress.  
I've already made the choice that I am done, I don't want to do it anymore, and unless I somehow magically become capable of doing everything in uni without any more studying and I get a new friend group so I at least have some contact with people, then I'm not going.  


The biggest issue I'm facing at this point is that I have no clue what to do, like at all.  
I have over the last couple of months realized I have little to no practical skills, I may as well be 5 years old and have 0 knowledge.  
I've never been taught any particular thing, I started learning guitar this year out of pure boredom, but it's not like that's a useful skill (yet).  
I have little to no idea how to survive, luckily my mom won't be kicking me out of the house over this (most likely), but if I were to be sent to live on my own I'd probably die within a month.  
I don't know how to cook \[whilst at uni I'd either eat ordered food or I'd just eat sandwiches, I don't even know if I could fry an egg without burning it or cracking it incorrectly\], I don't know how to operate a washing machine, I have no idea how taxes even work in my country \[I'm not even from the US\], I have no actual practical skills that would help me get any kind of job.  
\[This extends way further, my parents never really taught me anything, they just keep on forcing me to do shit that I don't want to do and never actually try to get me to do anything useful.  
I used to offer to help my mom around the house because I legit wanted to try how to do some basic chores, but she'd always turn me down, and then she proceeds to constantly complain about me not doing anything, like yeah, I legit don't know how.\]  


I feel like I've wasted 15 years (discounting the first 5 because you can't really do much during that time) and I know how to do absolutely nothing.  
Most of my actual useful skills, such as anything I've learnt at uni whilst studying math is practically worthless since no highschool level job would care about such a thing.  


I obviously have some skills that could be put to use, but yet again, no job would actually care about anything like that, because I don't have a high enough education to get jobs that could put my skills to use.  
The worst part is I'm confined to this small town that I was born in because I don't even have a drivers license, and I genuinely don't know if I can bring myself to go to driving school because the idea of having to study anything right now is just not something I want to think about.  


Until today I was panicking about the upcoming exams, but now I'm just panicking about everything, about the fact that my life has gone nowhere and that no matter what I do, I can't fix what I've already done by now, my anxiety won't be fixing itself on its own unfortunately, and at this point it's gotten so bad that I get nauseous just being in a room with people I don't know if there exists even the slightest chance of them talking to me, hell I don't even need to ""not know them"", my aunt visited (she moved to Australia a couple of years back), and I had to leave the room after a couple of minutes because I was about to vomit because I was worried she was suddenly going to start talking to me.  
I just don't even know what to do, and I don't know if getting a job is something I want, I don't know what I enjoy doing, I don't know what I want to do and I'm just generally scared of everything that will be happening to me in the next couple of months.  


I'm not going to reread everything I've written, but I apologize if I derailed my own thoughts a lot, I just really needed to get all my thoughts together and complain a bit.  
I'd be happy with any suggestions, any thoughts whatsoever that might help me do literally anything, because at this point I really don't know what to do, and the stress and anxiety of it all is killing me."

"You are going through a very stressful moment right now. Your anxiety about your challenges in university is convincing you that you don‚Äôt have the ability to do anything. 

When you have a mental illness like the anxiety you‚Äôre talking about, your brain tries to convince you of various false stories about yourself. It grossly exaggerates your biggest fears. 

You need to accept that your anxiety is spinning false stories, manipulating memories to make you feel worse, and give in to the real truth that you truly do not know what the future will be, and that you grossly overestimate your ability to predict the future. Once you admit that you don‚Äôt know the future, that your anxiety is distorting your image of the past, and that you can only know right now, the next step is to just accept everything about this moment. Accept the physical feelings in your stomach, even if it‚Äôs not a good feeling, accept whatever tension you feel in your body. Accept everything. 

Accept that painful things will happen to you. You can‚Äôt avoid pain. But you can alleviate the suffering that comes from trying to avoid pain by not fighting against the pain of what you are going through.

You are 20 years old, and learning how to accept pain will be a far more important ability than anything you would learn in maths. It will have a greater positive impact on your life than figuring out what job you will have. If you continue to practice this, you will be much further ahead of the game than the vast majority of people. It will give you the ability to be open to making better choices in your future. 

If you don‚Äôt want to pursue math anymore, explore something else. Or better yet explore multiple things.

Find a therapist. If there aren‚Äôt options where you live, there are options online. If you don‚Äôt like your first therapist, find another. Accept that this will take work and it will often be frustrating, but if you can accept that, you can move forward."

"My whole fucking life has been a bunch of No's.   
Couldn't really do much with friends unless it was in the neighborhood or at school. No trips or sleep overs.  
Absolutely nothing with girl. This shit still bothers my mind. Now they go ""wow you're so old dude go out and find a wife like all your other friends and cousins. bro that shit makes me so mad. They literally went from ""no you cant go there might be girls and we don't trust you to not fool around"" to ""go get a wife you old fuck.""  
Im mid 20s.   
Never had any experiences with drugs, smoking, or alcohol. I tried alcohol once, and it was a few sips. I tried to be civil about it and asked you know, ""man to man"" if I could like have a drink on my 21st, nope. Its always this bullshit of ""Oh I knew a guy, or I heard this story.""  
Never let me do sports cuz I would hurt myself. I finally managed to sign up for soccer in 10th grade but I didnt know any rules, I had no experience, I wasn't even that fit.... It was mess. just felt like a retard chasing balls and getting pushed around.   
My social skills are shit too. I never dated. Pretty much never talked to girls. Im insecure as fuck.   
It literally just feels like I straight up have no life skills. I was refused any learning opportunities as a teenager. im so fucked. Im scared of like everything it feels like. Socializing scares me, going to events scares me. Meeting people and worrying about their impressions of me and all that.  
I have pretty much been brain washed into fearing everything. Its hard to just go out and do what I want to do because I always feel this shadow of my parents harking on me. ""bad things will happen if you dont listen to us"" type shit.  
Anyways, Im going to a party and plan on drinking but I have so much anxiety over it. Im in my mid 20s, I know what my parents say is bullshit, but I cant break it. I know theres nothing wrong with social drinking. I dont plan on blacking out or anything, literally just a drink or 2 to loosen up.  
idk i just feel like im so lost. mid 20s, no social life, no hobbies, no nothing. just deteriorating in my room and getting yelled at for not doing anything.  
Its like I cant go meet people because ""danger, drugs, girls"" but then they expect me to just move out with a life and have a steady career in 2 days?

Just go do it! You'll be super anxious and uncomfortable at the first party, second, third... you might even make excuses to leave at first, but you CAN learn those social skills!  I did it around age 24-25 myself. It wasn't long before I was frequenting house parties, clubbing every week, cage dancing & all (sober, even). 

Another good way to build those social skills is to start college if you haven't. You don't need to make a degree choice for life. Just take one class - anything that interests you and not online so you have to show up. You'll naturally meet people with similar interests of all ages doing this. 

And if you're not working yet, go get a crappy service job (e.g. car wash, grocery store, retail). You don't have to make it your career, but it teaches you how to interact with people.

Well you never truly recover since anxiety is an emotion we all experience from time to time. It's just less of it. It's not influencing my life as greatly as it used to.

My panic/anxiety disorder got BAD and I finally said enough was enough. I signed up for a PHP program (partial hospital) and it was the best thing I ever did. For 10 days I went from 9-3‚Ä¶.it was a lot of group therapy which I wasn‚Äôt excited for but quickly realized it was exactly what I needed. We also saw nurses and Psychiatrists ect to get us on a med regime that would work. I had been on the same anxiety meds for 15 years and they ran their course so new meds is what I needed along with the therapy. They also hooked me up with continuous care‚Ä¶.therapist and a Psychiatrist. It seemed extreme when I first started the journey but sooo very happy I did.

"I want to know too. I've gone through so many turbulent life changes recently and being on social media isn't helping at all so I decided to log off. I already took the first step months ago by deleting twitter. I noticed I felt slightly better, currently working on instagram because that's where most of the relatability/therapy posts come from which can really help someone or set them back, and I mean in a way where you become obsessed with self improvement instead of living. So I decided to delete the app. I'm starting to feel a change as I start to dive into the things I used to do like read, journal, finding social groups to ""play"" with. Once you do these things you'll probably feel VERY different and this feeling is ***very very*** scary. lol. Like really terrifying.

"Well recovering from anxiety that will never happens because it is a natural emotion like sadness, anger, etc etc...

But recovering from an specific phobia, panic disorder, anxiety disorder, or just recovering from the loop of being fear to panic attacks which cause you more and more panic attacks, feels like you now growing up and you just stopped to have fear of them because you realized that those fears are complete irrationals and have no sense, once the mid understand that you will no longer have fear, or anxiety

It's like the first time you drive a car, the first weeks you might feel tense and anxious while driving, you could also feel.worried about causing an accident, but once you feel confident, you will drive without any fear, because get used to drive and you won't cause any accident because you have 100% control of the car and an accident is really really unlikely to happen if you are driving

It doesn't mean I never struggle. I still have some setbacks and hard moments, but they are much more rare now. And I can get out of them quickly; I don't get sucked into a deep spiral.

"I wouldn't call recovery necessarily being symptom free... it's more so being equipped with the tools and strategies to identify your habits and prevent further symptoms. You still have anxiety. But now you're equipped with the things to combat it and win.   


I first considered therapy after being sent to urgent care for a really bad week of anxiety attacks that left me with physical symptoms (I thought/felt like I was dying). I did therapy for about 8 months after needing it for years, and it was focused on building these strategies, which mostly consisted of balancing medication, meditating, grounding techniques, journaling, and identifying things in my environment and life style that I could change.

"I know what you're talking about. It's like the difference between sadness and depression. A lot of people think they have depression when they're just sad. Like, if their dog died or they breakup with their significant other.   


Depression/anxiety & panic disorders are deeper. It's a physical mis-alignment in your brain; it's physiological. You're stuck in a pattern of fear and eventually you'll find your way out.

"Yeah, I pulled myself out of it last time. I wish I could remember exactly what I did. I was having severe panic attacks every single night. Shaking and tremors and convinced I was dying. I lost a lot of weight. I just started forcing myself to eat and take my vitamins and started lifting weights and it slowly fizzled out. I still had panic attacks like I said but they would be like from an argument or a plane ride not just from like sitting on my couch and they were less frequent like only once every couple of months. Then I went YEARS without having a panic attack at all.

"If you treat anxiety/panic as a threat (by resisting, avoiding, or pushing it away), you're telling your brain that the panic is a real threat, and therefore your brain will keep sending out more panic to keep you safe (because it thinks you are in real danger). 

That's why overcoming an anxiety disorder requires letting your brain know that you are safe. You have to do that with your behaviour; by being willing to experience anxiety, not avoiding it. Yes, it will be uncomfortable in the short term, but it's temporary. With repeat exposure, your brain will re-wire learn that you are not afraid of panic anymore, and so your brain will stop sending out so much anxiety/panic because it knows you are safe.

I had so much panic/anxiety, it was debilitating, I couldn't eat or sleep. A combination of medication and exposure and acceptance therapy, I was able to overcome it. It's possible. <3"	Mclovelin32234	reply	na	na	na	0.004707851447165012	no	no	no	na	anxiety	no prediction.
What I learned that works for me best is simply letting it happen, as in, learning not to care. I had health anxiety bad so it just came with accepting that I‚Äôm in my 20s, doctors said I was fine, I know I‚Äôm fine, so there‚Äôs nothing to be scared of. I didn‚Äôt leave the room, I didn‚Äôt adjust the way I was sitting, I didn‚Äôt do any crazy breathing techniques, I just sit through it and even through a panic attack it will just go away on its own. Biggest part was never giving up and every single time I felt panic I would make sure I just let it happen. Eventually it went away within the month.

"It depends on the person. I would recommend finding a good therapist, and figure out how to balance strategies. 

It may be worth mentioning that I consider medication a strategy, as I still have meds that I take on an as needed basis (mostly when I identify that I'm panicing/about to experience symptoms), and thats worked well for me."

"For awhile, I‚Äôd say yes, it was fairly under control.  It‚Äôs gotten harder again, and I‚Äôve had to have my meds adjusted and work on some new coping strategies, but even this ‚Äúrelapse‚Äù isn‚Äôt nearly as intense as things were before I gained some control.

The big thing that really helped me first gain control was when I tried smoking weed to help with an anxiety attack, and it worked.  Just the knowledge itself that i had something with the power to stop my anxiety in its tracks was huge for me.  I was able to cope on my own much easier because I knew I had that out if I needed it.  My mom said she had the same experience with lorazepam; she only needed to take it once to take the power back into her own hands. 

I think one of the parts of anxiety that‚Äôs really screwed with me in the past is the uncertainty and lack of control.  That one an anxiety attack started, I was indefinitely stuck in the misery until it decided to end.  And that only fed it.  

(I‚Äôm still learning to stop being afraid of the anxiety attacks happening, because that‚Äôs the biggest trigger for me lately.)

If you can find something that makes you feel empowered to take some control over the anxiety, it may help.  It doesn‚Äôt necessarily have to be a drug (there‚Äôs plenty of things to consider before choosing to try weed OR benzos); that‚Äôs just what worked for me."

"That sounds like pretty classic anxiety.  I‚Äôm sorry that that‚Äôs a battle you have to fight; it absolutely sucks.

Worrying about the anxiety seems to be my worst trigger lately, as well.  And it‚Äôs problematic, because one of my coping mechanisms is to hide at home in my room where I‚Äôm safe and alone and comfortable. So, when I‚Äôm out and about and anxiety strikes, it makes me more panicky because I want to go home and can‚Äôt, so I‚Äôm trapped in this uncomfortable place while the panic rages on.  

It makes travel a pain in the ass, too, because that‚Äôs something that I know triggers my anxiety, so I‚Äôm already afraid of the anxiety before I leave.  Im actually on vacation at the beach right now, and while I‚Äôm enjoying it, I can‚Äôt get over the nagging feeling of how much I want to go home.  It‚Äôs made it hard to eat while I‚Äôm here, which only contributes to the anxiety because I generally have a hard time eating anyways, so my body is not having a good time trying to do things with very little fuel.

"I'm probably going to delete this later and maybe I won't even post it. I also don't think I have serious anxiety, but I still feel horrible over it. Please don't make fun of me. This is a very, very long rant about how nervous I get over sports.

At school, my least favorite subject was always P.E. I'm extremely weak and short. And in everything and anything physical, I was constantly worrying about getting hurt or embarrassing myself and showing how weak I am. I also have had horrible luck and would be hit by a ball on the head at least once a year, it's been every single year without fail since 1st grade, despite the fact that I always hide and stay as careful and away as physically possible. Last year, I was hit 4 or 5 times on the head. Thankfully, it wasn't terribly painful, but I still felt terrible every time. One time in 3rd grade, I was already hiding behind a fence while my friends reassured me that it was safe and it still got me. It hurt so bad that I cried for half an hour. One time in 1st grade, I remember getting hit by something and actually fainting/blacking out and collapsing. So, I constantly avoid sports because of these experiences. 

Every time I'm even near a ball, I'm constantly paying attention to every sound, every movement, trying to stay as far away as possible. Every time one hits a wall, crashes and falls down to the ground, it almost sounds like a gunshot in my head. I flinch and tense up at sounds from several feet away. It honestly feels terrifying at times, while everyone else is practically just running around not having a care in the world about all of it. ""Why don't you walk with us? Come on, it's just a ball, don't worry about it."" I feel like there's something wrong with me. Why can't I just walk across too? Why can't I just stop dodging or flinching at anything thrown? I completely understand that I'm supposed to catch it. Hit it back. Pass it. It's supposed to be easy, simple, fun, and healthy. It's supposed to be. 

Everyone around me either tries their best or just doesn't care at all. I'm trying my best, but do somehow worser than the people who barely care. And this year, I got put in the same period with several people who are known for being very athletic, and they are in a different class. (In team related games, they will always be on the opposite side.) The fact that we would often have to play dodgeball last year, will likely play often this year, and that one of the people on the other class is known to throw extremely hard and fast and was on a dodgeball team, is seriously not helping. Thankfully, you are not actively forced to participate in dodgeball, but you still have to be on the field. Unfortunately, that isn't the case for everything else. 

I honestly can't stand the majority of the activities. One kind, you get assigned a number and have to go against the person with the same number as you. Numbers are called at complete random. While about 60 people from both of your classes combined are watching your every move and screaming. My mind tends to panic and go completely blank, my body attempts to function but I usually end up doing the worst possible performance. At the end, they do a round where all of the past rounds get rendered meaningless and the winner of the sole round makes the whole team win. Of course, they take a while to just pick a random number. Thank god I have, so far, never been chosen for these. I sincerely hope that never changes. I absolutely hate it all. But of course, if you don't go participate up there, your grades go down! Because obviously participation's the easiest thing, I'd just be being lazy! Wouldn't want that, would I? 

Oh yeah, there's also other actual sports. Honestly, I just wish for it to end the whole time. I keep forgetting how it works and usually end up warning my teammates that I will be bad. Usually, I just let everyone else do everything. I really do want to help and participate too, but I always end up dodging, flinching, confused, being a slow runner, and throwing/kicking either weakly or in the wrong direction or both. 

P.E. starts up next Tuesday. Hell is opening up again to swallow me alive. Same thing. I am not okay. The only happiness this class makes me feel is when it finally ends or gets canceled. And sometimes I get to bond with others over how much we hate it. I will never completely understand anyone who really enjoys these activities. (I won't hate anyone who does though. I respect your opinion and think it's great that you're enjoying it.) 

I just feel really stessed and wanted to vent. I'm probably screaming into the void and don't expect many people to read this. If anyone has any advice at all, I'd really appreciate it."	29pixxL_	post	10.978744171070202	female	White	0.9990946054458618	na	na	na	3	anxiety	no prediction.

I have been smoking since 2018, but it was on and off since I wasn't really a smoker back then. But I‚Äôve been smoking frequently these past few months. That‚Äôs when I decided to buy a cartridge because I really liked the high. But there was this one time when I only took one hit and began to panic for no reason and it comes tina point that I was thinking so many bad things. That‚Äôs when I was hospitalized because my heart beat wa so fast and I couldn‚Äôt breathe. I was panicking, and I don‚Äôt even know why. I was crying. After that night, I was fine. I didn‚Äôt have attacks. But last week I tried cocaine for the first time when my friend offered me it in a club. I was already drunk, so that was an impulsive decision. I didn‚Äôt have an attack that night, but my heart was beating so fast. It was like 130+ per minute. When I woke up, I couldn‚Äôt breathe easily. I was running out of breath. I tried to calm myself down. I even cried in the bathroom because I hated how I felt that day. After a few hours, it became worse, and I immediately went to the hospital. After that day, my anxiety didn‚Äôt go away, even when I was sober. :( It‚Äôs so depressing to live like this. I wasn‚Äôt like this before. Is there any way that I could go back to normal? I didn‚Äôt have triggers before, but right now I can feel the anxiety in my body and I feel like any minute I‚Äôll have attacks. I feel anxious for no reason, I can feel sensation or goosebumps out of nowhere and my heart would beat fast. So what I do every time I feel it coming is distract myself to make it go away. But still, I'm not used to it, and I can‚Äôt fight or face what I feel. Last night, I drink alcohol, I was a little bit tipsy and I thought I was gonna have an attack cos i feel my heart was beating so fast and i was so anxious luckily I distracted myself and just kept dancing in the club. Wish I can go back to normal before I took the weed and coke :( Do you think that i‚Äôll go back to normal? Im having a hard time coping, especially now that I‚Äôm sober, I can still feel it."

"I want to say it was the cocaine more than the weed. I had a 200BPM panic attack on coke and 6 months later (I stopped doing it after that) I had another panic attack which I never returned from. 

I Can tell you avoiding drugs and alcohol and caffeine help a lot. What I suggest is to take your time, don't focus on returning back to normal focus on living life and try to take it easy. 

It's been 9 months for me and I haven't gone ""back"" yet so to speak. I've gotten much better. I don't want that to make you feel like crap, it's possible you might go back in a week or a month or a year. I just want to prepare you for the journey.

If you feel like you need to go get checked out by a doctor, that never hurts either. Just don't do it obsessively, it's a dark dark path. I went to the ER so many times and racked up a huge bill cause I thought I was dying all the time

Edit; I DO want to say anxiety can cause all sorts of symptoms! Like an ungodly amount of physical symptoms. Do NOT Google them, if you have to search them on this subreddit. Google always says you're dying but Google is always wrong. 

I completely understand how you feel. Most likely, you're okay and it is just anxiety. If I had to guess, your body is super hypersensitive to your heart rate because of that experience so it's looking for danger so to speak.

"TW: Health Anxiety (parkinsons/carcinoma/rabies/insomnia)  
(I tried posting about this in the health anxiety reddit and it got deleted from megathread and separate post as well)

Hello there! I'm a 35m that's starting to struggle more and more with health anxiety... and it's just making it hard to manage with my daily life and managing my youth onset parkinson's disease.  

  
There's 2 things that get to me; 1 is a fear of rabies (had a similar instance few years ago) and 2 is that brain eating amoeba. Ex: I had (by my guess warrior ants) bites all over both my feet on 7/6 and nowhere else, and that got me to believe that I might have had a bat or something bite me (sleep quality went down, anxiety/paranoia went straight through the roof). So I've been drinking like 4-6 bottles of water a day on top of other beverages just incase of hydrophobia, but if this can help anyone like how another redditor & doctor helped me, by the time you have any symptoms, anxiety and whatnot, you wouldn't be on reddit.
  
Day after that, I jumped in my friends pool during a party, and when water got up my nose, made me instant think of that brain amoeba (it's been prevalent at the lake here in Vegas). Heck, even yesterday when brushing my teeth, when I went to rinse my mouth, some water got up my nose and I woke up with a headache at the top of my head and sinus. Also been more irritable, bouts of confusion/paranoia about my health or being sick. It got my darn head racing again. My anxiety & paranoia about this has just been... shite for lack of better phrasing.
  

  
I have a therapist that actually does help with other issues, but health anxiety is my ultimate struggle right now. I can't shake it. I see my therapist right now for dealing with youth onset parkinsons disease (confirmed with DATscan 2 years ago) and confirmed myocardial infarction due to gastric carcinoma 10 years ago. When I discuss this with her, it feels like I'm lying to myself or making excuses when I try to reassure myself of what the cause might be. It makes it hard to distinguish if this is something for my parkinsons... So for the amoeba thing & rabies, I ended up going to the ER. The doctor said they just found their first bat in the main city that had rabies, but unless it was a coyote or something big, he's ""99.9999%"" sure it's not. He said the same thing for the amoeba, ""Were you actually in the lake? we're you in the colorado river? If not than 99.99999% you don't"". The amoeba issue bothers me a little more at the moment, even if I go through the steps and say,
  
\-- ""it's 105+ outside, the wind is blowing in the valley, that's why I've had a dull headache/pressure past 9 days. My AC is running nonstop in the house, there's probably dust. My sleep has been shit waking up after 1-3 hours, that's why headache and anxiety. The sinus area/top of head is probably because it rained hard 2 days ago in the valley and stirred stuff up. My nasal issue is probably causing my swallowing to act up. Bruxism? It's my anxiety..."" Even today, had some struggle writing and holding my phone, feeling off but I can't ground myself to the fact that in the past 96 hours, I maybe only slept 15 hours. My mind won't accept lack of sleep as the cause for this.
  

  
I need help trying to find something distracting or a suggestion to help get me copacetic. I can't focus on what I need to for my parkinsons. My pcp got me buspirone (10mg 2x a day) but he says my new neurologist might have me try something different because the first 4 days made me feel drunk, and this drug is supposed to take 3-4 weeks for you to notice something different."

"You‚Äôve been through a lot so it‚Äôs not surprising that you are dealing with anxiety but please listen to the doctor and don‚Äôt worry. Anxiety is paradoxical. If you accept that something bad could happen it actually can help. Maybe try to say ‚Äòso what‚Äô to yourself about these things.

Understandable! Slow, deep breaths. Focus on your core. Try to name a few things you can hear, see, touch, & smell‚Ä¶it‚Äôll help ground you. You are safe. Hyper fixation can make symptoms (your heart rate) seem more intense. Try pulling your focus to something else. Preferably something that gives you comfort or peace. I hope that you become more comfortable as you adjust to your environment. Your anxiety should ease up a bit. Maybe seeing the sights when you have down time will help.

"So anxiety is something I‚Äôve always struggled with but I‚Äôve had it mostly under control for the last year or so. That is until a couple days ago. I‚Äôm an avid smoker, and have been for years now. But I wayyyy overdid it the other day & had the worst panic attack I‚Äôve ever had in my life. 

Basically psyched myself out & convinced myself I was having a heart attack and dying. I forgot how to breathe, I almost blacked out and my entire body was tingling. Of course I was alone so that definitely made it worse.

"Yes its normal, your body is recovering the strain the stress hormones put on your body take time to reduce and recover try to relax the best you can I know its easier said then done. Its apart of our flight response system we got from our ancestors when we trigger a panic attack we are triggering this response and our minds and bodies are unable to find a suitable target to place this stress onto and thus we are left in a state of panic and anxiety until our minds and bodies can go into rest and are sure the threat is gone thus leaving us all the easier to send into another panic attack or leaving us in a cycle of anxiety that we can't seem to escape.

"So today I had to go to the er with what me and my mom thought was some bad respiratory issue. Seemingly out of nowhere I was having bad breathing issues and was very light headed and that was when my mom brought me to the closest er. 


Turns out it was actually a bad anxiety attack and my breathing was fine. They gave me Ativan through an iv and I was pretty much fine not long after. 


But the confusion about the prescription I was given started around this time. Because while I was still out of it one of the healthcare people (idk exactly what he was but he was dressed differently from all the other ones, was the one that talked to me about my blood work and other kinds of tests I did results and told me about why they know what I had was an anxiety attack) told my mom, and I specifically remember this, to take the buspirone that I was prescribed as needed after they were talking about anxiety counciling and avoiding more addictive prescriptions. Both me and my mom thought he meant to take it whilst I'm having anxiety attacks. 


But in the actual prescription, what the paper I was handed while I was leaving the er it says, and what the other healthcare worker that handed the paper to me said was to take the buspirone three times a day. Mom wants me to only take them when I think I'm having anxiety attacks since that what the one man said. But the literal prescription has entirely different instructions. I'm supposed to start taking them tomorrow according to the prescription and I'm kinda worried I'm gunna somehow screw it up because of this."	lost_mah_account	post	17.816260708788292	male	White	0.9925814867019653	na	na	na	1	anxiety	no prediction.

"Absolutely.

You're experiencing palpitations and those are totally normally with anxiety. They can present in a lot of different ways, too. It might feel like a skipped beat, a hard beat, rapid heartbeat, or it might switch it up between these.

When I get the skipped beat it takes my breath away for a second too.

But it's all okay. :]

Oh and also, it can happen at any time, even when relaxing. Sometimes your body shifting into bed time mode can cause it too. I go to sleep with palpitations quite often.

"I'm wondering if anyone else has dealt with this. This is my 4th time trying to take escitalopram(Lexapro) 10mg past the first dose. These are the reasons my OCD is giving me to stop:

1. you didn't wait long enough to try again so you didn't see how much better you'd get without the pill(my third try was on 7/24, and now I started again on 8/08, so only 2 weeks later)
2. Pills are a fragile treatment option;
 - you need to keep the pills out of sunlight, at room-temperature, away from moisture, and any mistake can reduce the efficacy of the medication and ruin your response
 - generic manufacturers can willingly change ingredients and change your response
 - if you miss a dose, then the steady-state concentration in your body is ""low"" for an entire week
 - if you somehow don't have access to your daily pill, then you're in trouble
3. you can't tell what is an effect of the pill and what is coming from yourself, so you don't know if you're actually benefiting from taking this or if you're needlessly dependent on it
4. the withdrawal can be miserable and you don't want to deal with that if you ever want to taper off
5. you've skipped two days now, so you've ruined the treatment and need to wait for a couple of months to try again(I took it on the 8th and 9th, and have skipped the last two days for reasons 1-4)

**Please let me know if you've experienced any of the above. Did it take you multiple tries before you finally committed?**

As to its positive effects: Whenever I try it, even with the one dose, I do notice that my mood is uplifted somewhat, and that it is easier for me to ignore intrusive thoughts, for a few days afterward. ERP becomes easier. I am more optimistic and care more about things. I feel like my neurosis goes away, and things don't bother me nearly as easily. The sad, mean voice in my mind seems to quiet itself. I also may have more energy, or physically I feel better. All of this is simply what I perceive, and as I said, it's challenging to tell what is basically a placebo and what is a proper biological effect.

I also notice that, if I perform a ritual by accident out of habit, it's just as bad as it would be before, but the anxiety/stress is gone, which is interesting. When taking it before bed, I become an insomniac and wake up throughout the night with RLS and so on--quite miserable. It's challenging to tell with only 1-2 doses what will last and what will go away after 1-2 weeks, though. I did have flu-like symptoms the last time on 7-24 and became drowsy in the afternoon on the 25th, but this time, I didn't seem to have any of those side-effects outside of perhaps when I wake up in the middle of the night with the shivering and RLS behavior. My anxiety exploded on the 10th due to the reasons I list above, so I don't really attribute that to the pill, but more of OCD catastrophizing. My OCD treats this like it's a life or death situation. I think it's doing that because it does seem that you need to take these SSRIs for life in order to treat OCD, so my mind treats this like a life-altering gigantic decision, and makes it a huge deal."

"I have autism and anxiety and I have had all of my symptoms pretty similarly for most of my life. 

Before this summer I had never really had many times where I was panicking. The first time I remember panicking in my life was in 7th grade because I got suspended and it was so much more different than my regular anxiety attacks. My lips and hands got tingly, my throat tightened, I felt nauseous and my hyperventilating was much worse than normal. I was also shaking a lot. 

I've had times where I've panicked since then of course. Since about late may/early June I've been panicking at least 3-4 times a week. I don't want to call them panic attacks because I know those usually occur out of nowhere, but It's definitely not an anxiety attack because those don't affect me the way that these do. (There are times where there is no stresser and I just panic) 

A couple of them made sense like when I got broken up with or when I freaked out over an assignment that was due. However, some of it was over really insignificant stuff like being unable to make a decision on where to eat or me thinking that my now ex was mad at me. Yeah, that stuff is uncomfortable, but it doesn't warrant these weird extreme anxiety moments.

"it‚Äôs really hard for me to be able to type this, as im currently in the middle of a panic attack but i just really need help.

im 16 (f) and for the past few months i‚Äôve been dealing with depersonalization and major death anxiety. im not really sure why this started. i‚Äôve been diagnosed with anxiety for about 4 years or so now, but i‚Äôve had it since i was a little kid. for the past month, my mental health has been the lowest its ever been and honestly im terrified. i‚Äôm worried that i won‚Äôt wake up tomorrow morning, i‚Äôm worried that i wont get to grow old and wrinkly. i‚Äôm terrified of leaving my family behind and the process of dying and i really don‚Äôt know what to do. it feels like i‚Äôve tried everything. journaling, breathing exercises, meditation, all of it but i feel like nothing works. everyday i wake up and go to sleep anxious. it‚Äôs gotten so bad to the point where 988 is saved as a contact in my phone. 

please if anyone has any tips or even relates and can talk about it with me, please feel free too."		post	17.757187861637668	female	White	0.9948542714118958	na	na	na	2	anxiety	no prediction.
Hi, do you perhaps engage in any obsessive behavior regarding this fear? For example watching for possible symptoms, googling about it, seeking reassurance if everything is okay or something like that?		reply	na	na	na	0.9948542714118958	no	no	strong	na	anxiety	no prediction.
"For one talk but the therapist if you aren't already. Second, I just mentioned it in another post. Death is a guarantee. It's going to happen. We don't know when, it could be today. Tomorrow or 50 years from now. no one knows and will never know.

Enjoy your life everyday. Make plans for the future. Take your health seriously. Try to extend it as long as possible, but remember you're not guaranteed anything so enjoy the moments you can.

When i see someone have a panic attack i feel like im going to have one. For starters its hard to confirm this because ive never witnessed someone irl have one however the other day my girlfriend came really close but i calmed her down, but i felt one coming on while i was and i know if she wasnt so strong i wouldve just died. Idk what it is - just seeing their dread and trying to think about what theyre feeling just sends me. This also happens on a much lower scale when im watching a movie or something where an actor is 'having' one. It doesn't do as much because i just know its not real but i always feel like i, instinctually, just try simulate what they're feeling in my head.

Yes, that's because your brain is trying to convince you that something is wrong or something is coming if someone else is having a panic attack. It's not necessarily your brain trying to simulate, it just equates panic attacks to an emergency signal. So it's understandable how you would start to have one.

"Sigh. 

Typing this as I sit in the ER. Which is like the 5th time in the past year I‚Äôve been to the ER and been told ‚Äòyou have heartburn‚Äô or ‚Äòyou have anxiety.‚Äô I am so tired of how debilitating this is I cannot even function on a daily basis anymore‚Ä¶ 

I landed in the ER because out of nowhere my left hand started tingling and my heart rate shot up to 140, I tried my best to just calm down and breathe. It went down to like 90s and I‚Äôm like ok. This is just a panic attack. Then I just felt so nauseated and felt this rush of heat cover my body and heart rate shoots back up again. I go to the ER because this has never happened before with any anxiety or panic attack I‚Äôve had. They get my blood pressure and it‚Äôs 154/90. Currently waiting on blood results but I‚Äôm 90% sure this was just my anxiety again. 

I‚Äôm at a loss, a year ago is when my anxiety troubles started and I cannot pinpoint what triggered it. I‚Äôve literally experienced chest pains, palpitations, stress rash, ringing in ears, shortness of breath, feeling like hands are around my neck choking me, shakes/trembling, tummy symptoms to the point I was CONVINCED I had acid reflux at one point in time and went through an endoscopy with bravo monitoring only to find out I don‚Äôt have anything wrong gastro wise. So much paranoia and irrational fears- thinking my food is poisoned when someone else prepares it (I have literally bought a meal and threw it away before finished)  , convincing myself I‚Äôm allergic to foods like seafood and nuts when I have eaten them my entire life with no problem, thinking the pharmacy made a mistake and my vitamin isnt my vitamin, staying in a resort and fearing that the damn building is going to collapse, the list goes on. My doctor wants me to take Prozac and I am terrified that my anxiety will worsen or I will have side effects, even though my gene site test says the medicine should pair well with my DNA the best. I don‚Äôt know what to do and I hate my life right now I just want to cry and for everything to be over and back to normal. I had an echo and stress test done less than a year ago and everything was fine. I went a long time (2 years) using alcohol to cope, drinking every single day. I cut alcohol out all together about a month and half ago and it‚Äôs made no difference. I have no health problems besides my diagnosis of generalized anxiety. I do not see a therapist. And I can‚Äôt even tell my doctor how bad my anxiety actually is and how debilitating it feels because I can‚Äôt talk about it without crying. The only meds I take a vitamin D and L-methyl folate because I have some kind of issue with processing folate (gene site test result).

"I'm not going to lie to you. I was in the same position many years ago (3 ER visits in 2 months) You have anxiety and maybe some panic symptoms.

You'll need to talk to a therapist someone who specializes in CBT as that's the gold standard of therapy. You'll most likely need to put in a lot of work, but there is a light at the end of the tunnel and you can return back to a high quality of life.

Anxiety is something everyone has. It's not just going to go away, but you can learn to lower it to the point where it doesn't interfere with your normal life. If the doctors keep telling you nothing's wrong with you, then there's most likely nothing wrong. You'll need to accept this when moving forward.

"I woke up at 530A. I'm on vacation and today is our last day at the beach.

I was jolted awake by my heart. It was fluttering and skipping beats. I remember having some pretty vivid and scary dreams.

I ran to the bathroom and tried to focus on something else. I grabbed my phone, I did breathing. Nothing helped and before I knew it my legs and hands were shaking and shivering. There's no urgent care or ER for at least 40 minutes.

I told my wife I probably have afib. She told me I was just being anxious and she helped me breathe through it.

I finally got through the peak and sat in the shower for 10 minutes letting the warm water rush over me

I got back in bed and my heart was still fluttering but I was so exhausted I passed out for a bit longer.

Maybe it's because we're on vacation and I don't want to ruin everyone's last day or maybe it's because it was my subconscious and I couldn't have done much to ""prevent"" or slow the anxiety train down this time.

"Hi i'm not sure if this is the right sub reddit but... I'm 22M diagnosed with anxiety and depression and all throughout this week i've had this pain in my side and lower back. I'm the sort of person who when anything pain or body related happens, I google it and lets just say google doesn't help as it always says you're dying and it sends me into a panic attack. My chest gets tight, I feel light headed, my heart rate races and I pace around thinking i'm going to die and end up feeling I need immidate hospital help...

I called my GP as I was extremely anxious about my health due to the pain on the 7th but I couldn't get an appointment until the 16th... Anyways I went to urgent care on the 8th as the pain got worse and they didn't know what was wrong after doing a urine sample and suggested asking for bloods at my GP appointment. 

The pain hasn't gotten any worse but I can't stop thinking about it, and I keep having panic attacks. I try to distract myself by playing video games, reading a book, watching a show but my brain can't focus on anything else. I just can't stop feeling the pain and it sends me into panic mode every now and then and feeling like I need to go back to urgent care. This has been happening all week and I keep telling myself ""look you are fine today, the other day you thought you were dying but here you are"" but as soon as a panic attack happens its ""GO TO HOSPITAL"" 

So ultimately i was just wondering if anyone has any tips on how to focus on something, or what to do when you feel a panic attack coming on. My mum told me to get fresh air outside but I end up pacing around the garden thinking i'm going to die lol.

Then close your left nostril with your ring finger and exhale through your right nostril. Inhale through your right nostril, close it, and exhale through your left nostril. Continue this pattern for several minutes, focusing on the balance of breath through each nostril.

"Hello! I (23F) have been struggling with anxiety for as long as I can remember, and recently I have noticed that it has been getting worse, so I finally made an appointment with a psychiatrist to see what I can do about it. 

Over the last few years, I am quite certain that I have adhd, and I have heard that anxiety and stress often comes with having adhd. However, when I raised these concerns with my psych, he kinda brushed me off and said that we need to deal with the anxiety first, and he prescribed the following meds: 

Serta-50 (Sertraline 50mg), twice a day 
Clonazepam (0.5mg) one tablet in the day and two at night. 

He said that Sertraline is the main medicine, while the Clonazepam would be stopped after 2 weeks. When I did my research, I have seen that Serta is an anti-depressant, which concerned me a little because I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm depressed, so I‚Äôm not sure if there are any side effects. When I tried to ask my psych about the possible side effects of these meds, he said that there were close to none. 

I could really use some advice, as I‚Äôm doing my masters in an intensive field, and cannot risk getting into a funk or a bad state of mind.

Feeling sick (nausea)  
Headaches  
Being unable to sleep  
Feeling sleepy  
Diarrhoea  
Dry mouth  
Feeling dizzy  
Feeling tired or weak  


As side effects go, that's a pretty mild list, especially for a psychotropic.

"Hello, 

Anxiety and depression are closely linked therefore the medication treats symptoms of both.

I (30F) started taking sertraline 5 years ago for anxiety during my post graduate studies.

From my own experience, I found a course of talk therapy/ CBT alongside the use of sertraline to be extremely helpful. Identifying root causes and developing awareness with the support of a professional was life changing. 

Sertraline helped me to feel more emotionally balanced‚Ä¶ gradually the daily anxiety started to reduce. I still get anxious about things but the spiralling has definitely stopped.


As with any medication, there are possible side effects. I noted some mild ones initially but they didn‚Äôt last long and the long term benefits outweighed the occasional slight nauseous feeling - if I skipped breakfast. 

Taking sertraline at the same time each day is 
highly recommended - it was part of my morning routine. 

Keep talking to your doctor until you find the right dose for you, this may take some time. I started at 50mg then went to 100mg after a while. 

You are taking steps to change for the better. Be gentle with yourself and allow time to adjust to the medication. It can take up to 6 weeks before the full effect but it‚Äôs very common to note differences way before then. 

I would align the success of your masters with continuing to prioritise your mental health each day- both deserve the commitment.

My anxiety has been terrible lately, and I honestly don‚Äôt know how to cope with my current situation. I‚Äôm staying in a rental property with my parents. The condo doesn‚Äôt have a carbon monoxide detector because there isn‚Äôt any gas appliances so the state doesn‚Äôt require it. For some reason I didn‚Äôt think to bring a carbon monoxide detector with me. I have in the past but I guess I wasn‚Äôt thinking. I barely slept at all last night, and I probably won‚Äôt sleep tonight either and I still have two nights after that. I‚Äôm trying to tell myself nothing bad will happen but I struggle to believe it. Even though it‚Äôs the summer and no storms in the forecast, no one is using a generator or heater. No gas appliances and no attached garage. I‚Äôm going to check what‚Äôs under our unit too. Am I worrying over nothing?	Remarkable-Note5012	post	31.655108607399264	female	White	0.9988861680030823	na	na	na	5	anxiety	no prediction.
"I wouldn't try to fight with your worry but rather see it as a natural consequence of your nervous system being in a state of hyperarousal (fight / flight - sympathetic). Fighting with the thoughts, or trying to rationalize them away, generally won't help much and may even make it worse.

A better approach is to signal to the nervous system that you're safe and it can calm down. If you're okay with working with the breath I highly recommend 4-7-8 breathing, especially for helping with sleep. Inhale to the count of 4, hold for 7, and exhale for 8. You can speed the counting up a bit it's difficult; you want it to be fairly easy and not something you have to force.

If the breath isn't a good point of focus for you, you can try focusing on neutral or safe sensations within your body. The places where your body contacts the outside is a good place to start. Notice the sensations where you contact the surface you're sitting on - is it soft, hard, supportive?

The idea is to shift your nervous system back into ventral vagal. This will quiet the worry some and anxious thinking without the need to directly engage with the thoughts."	Remarkable-Note5012	reply	na	na	na	0.9988861680030823	no	no	no	na	anxiety	no prediction.

"I smiled at your cat comment; I have a few cats and they can be so uncooperative!

As an overly analytical and ""rational"" person myself, I can understand the frustration; it's like I know this isn't true but I can't stop worrying about it. I think that's why this idea of ""state over story"" has been so helpful to me. It means that the state of your nervous system is primary and the thoughts and emotions are largely a consequence of that state. It helps disengage with the thoughts and emotions and redirect efforts towards some of these tools that can shift your nervous system state."

"Hi, I (F21) have suffered from mild health scares during the past few years that only seem to be getting bigger/ worse. For the past month I have been spiralling like never before. This anxiety has completely taken over my life.

I have had a chronic sore throat for months that comes and goes and is usually in the background so I never paid any attention to it. Around a month ago I found multiple swollen lymph nodes in the neck and that‚Äôs what sort of triggered this anxiety episode. Went to several doctors, had my blood work and other tests done and all came out fine. I even went to a throat MRI scan without referral just to make sure there really is nothing. Results came back fine as well and no one could give me an answer as to why my throat is sore. My GP put me on medication against GERD and said to come back if the symptoms don‚Äôt get better in a couple of weeks.

Now I‚Äôve also noticed a stinging pain in the right side of my chest as well as at the bottom of my throat when I breath in and I‚Äôve convinced myself I have lung cancer. I haven‚Äôt been able to live life normally for the past month. I can‚Äôt sleep, I can‚Äôt be around anyone and can‚Äôt keep up with daily chores because all I do is obsess over death, dying, cancer and illnesses. 

I haven‚Äôt been in therapy before and have considered it but I live in a country where the waiting times can take several months because of a lack of workers. 

Does anyone have any advice that could help me ? I can‚Äôt keep myself from googling symptoms and looking up other peoples cancer horror stories. I try but usually give in within a few hours. I‚Äôve never felt this terrible and hopeless in my life. 
Any advice is welcome and also feel free to share your own experiences."	Anon-imu	post	35.00071804023951	female	White	0.9980837106704712	na	na	na	1	anxiety	no prediction.
"This could very well be General Anxiety Disorder. It can make a small problem with your body feel like a huge one, or even manifest physical symptoms.

What you are feeling to me kind of sounds like acid reflux, it can give you a sensation in your chest and throat like that. And is caused/made worse by anxiety (same with gas). There are anti-acids you could try.

Lymph node swelling in your neck happens a lot, but your anxiety is hyper focused on it, which again makes things worse. (Anxious focus on the lymph node could be causing the acid reflux as well)

I would try to figure out some coping techniques for panic.

I'm not a doctor or anything tho, so take my advice with a  grain of salt."	Anon-imu	reply	na	na	na	0.9980837106704712	no	no	no	na	anxiety	no prediction.
"I've had anxiety for a while but my hatred of the telephone has been around for years.
How did you handle it when you hate the phone but your friends  insist on calling you?
I have lost some friends over my hatred of the phone and my reluctance to use it.
I like  to use WhatsApp and I like  to record audio and send it in a message. But I guess to some people they don't like it and think it's rude.
I just really dislike making calls and receiving calls even from friends I've known for 30 years.
I also have an app called Voxer, I talk  to my family in the UK (I live in the USA) All the time and they don't mind, It's my friends in the US. 
I guess it's just also a hatred of small talk I just don't like doing it.

"Yeah, it used to be physically crippling!! - as in, I'd make a phone call, then be SO OVER THE TOP ANXIOUS that I couldn't even have a thought, then the person would answer, and I'd hang up, because I was experiencing so much anxiety that I literally couldn't muster a sentence. My mind was just blank. In pure ""freeze"" mode. 

Ever since I started religiously saying ""Yes"" to what I perceived as unpleasant things, and started forcing myself to be in anxiety-provoking situations, *especially* ones that I know I'll absolutely hate - I've found they're never as bad as they are in my head. Then when I ""conquer"" a new aspect of anxious behavior, other aspects diminish along with it. Now, I can't even imagine being unable to talk on the phone, it's such a nothing, but I 100% understand. It sucks. And people do view voice messages like that. 

Over time, it changed for me by consciously choosing to make the choice of ""uncomfortable things"" every single time I was presented with an alternative option. It all stems from the same source - Fear. I don't think the phone one can necessarily be conquered by talking on the phone more. It's weird to put into words why, though. It's too *niche*. But that's not the right word. 

I guess, tackle all forms of anxiety-inducing parts of reality. Confront them head-on. Then the phone thing will eventually dwindle into nothing. At least that's what happened with me. And I had it BAD. 

Anchors are huge. There are loads of beneficial ways to deal with anxiety. Having something you know you can turn to when the world becomes **too much**, but allows you to still be in the world - that isn't a phone. A book. Or a person. But being able to have a covert, internal response to the external - that grounds you, and allows you to re-access reality."

Yeah panic attacks usually are experienced with more physical symptoms such as increased heart rate, sweating, breathlessness, shaking, etc. When you get a panic attack it feels like you're going to die, so you'd probably be able to tell you're having one and not just an anxiety attack. Panic attacks usually don't last more than 30 minutes or even a couple hours. More than that your body couldn't handle it because of the adrenaline being pumped through your body, you'd just die. What you're experiencing may be panic attacks though, I can't say. Only you can say whether you think what you're experiencing are panic attacks. Whatever diagnosis or label you give it though isn't going to change how you're addressing and managing these events regardless of what they are.

I know this is going to sound super strange, but for some reason, I‚Äôve been experiencing this for many years; every time I get my laundry out of the washing machine, and I set up and start hanging it up to dry, I suddenly get this really uncomfortable feeling in my chest, a classic sense of anxiousness.

"Our minds are very good at conditioning reactions to certain things, and some times it conditions some emotional responses to some behaviours, that just doesn't make any sense. Think of it as a silly brain ""malfunction"".  


I would suggest you try accepting and opening up this sense of anxiety, and try to see if you can sense where you feel it in your body. Try to stay with it and allow with it for a little bit.   


Sometimes these kinds of reactions can come on by a perpetuating loop if we are anticipating the anxiety to come, and then tensing up against and being afraid of the anxiety while it's there. So in order to reverse the conditioning, we have to ""open up"" and try to let it be there, and in time our brain will unlearn that nothing dangerous is happening when we're washing laundry :)"	TwoElectrical	reply	na	na	na	0.9974985718727112	no	no	no	na	anxiety	no prediction.
"So a few days ago I had my first panic attack, I came to the conclusion because now a few days later I wanted to know what even happened to me and I finally could connect the dots to what was happening to me, im glad I could give it a place and that it was a panic attack, and not that I‚Äôm crazy or anything

So it all happened when I was laying in bed, I couldn‚Äôt sleep so I was tossing and turning in bed for around two hours, I always sleep with a window open. It was around 02:00 when I heard a loud thud and a man making a weird noice and then a women screaming really loudly (even writing it gives makes my anxious for some reason) It really was a jumpscare and I was shaking in my bed and just frozen for a few seconds, i then watched out the window and I heard some soft screaming and things when it stopped, no one had lights on so i thought that was really weird. The next few moments I was really worried for the women, so worried I instantly closed my windows and curtains and I just had this weird feeling she was in danger. I couldn‚Äôt think rationally and I didn‚Äôt know what to do, I started panicking and started crying, my room (of course) was dark so I had this feeling I HAD to put some lights on or else I was in danger. After that I was too scared to try to go to sleep again so I got on my phone but I still felt this feeling I was in danger, a really unrealistic feeling of doom and danger, I was too scared to open the windows again because I felt like something was waiting for me outside or that something dangerous was gonna happen. I decided to calm myself down so I tried listening to music, while listening I started crying a few times. At this moment I thought to myself that I was having a psychosis or something because I was so paranoid, I was too scared to even leave my room to go to the bathroom. Then for some reason I HAD to wait for the sun to come up so I could sleep again, so I literally waited 4 hours to sleep again. While waiting those sounds of screaming and that really loud thud replayed in my had so many times that I got even more scared each time, I felt like I was crazy‚Ä¶ when the sun finally came up and it became light outside I decided to sleep (I still couldn‚Äôt) after all that happened I still didn‚Äôt know what had happened to me or what was even real what I experienced‚Ä¶. Now a few days later I could finally connect the dots, neighbours of ours were just moving in their new house, so that loud thud was probably some new furniture in boxes that fell over and them logically getting scared of a loud bang in the night.. in the same morning it happened I saw them working in the yard (that was relieving for me) yet I still can‚Äôt understand I reacted that way to something that seems so innocent‚Ä¶."

"Background: 
I have never taken any medication for my mental health before. Esp coming from somewhat of a strict cultural background when it comes to validating mental health issues. 

Basically my 4 year relationship ended. This is day 2. I work in high stress area. I met my provider for a sick leave note for work because just don‚Äôt feel safe going to work with an unstable mood. 

When I met my provider, I told them that I feel on and off anxiety, sometimes I cry, sometimes I am ok, sometimes I panic.. it‚Äôs not a constant state of one emotion. just range of emotions. 

She asked me if I‚Äôd like anything for my anxiety and I told her sure but something that isn‚Äôt addicting and something that isn‚Äôt making me drowsy.. esp when it is time for me to go back to work. 

She prescribed me ‚Äú10mg Buspirone 2x daily AS NEEDED‚Äù for 30 day supply. 

She told me to try my first pill at home. 

I have NEVER taken this medication and I am honestly bit scared to try it. I am not sure if I should thug it out or use the medication the help my mood temporarily. 

I am looking for some insight on Buspirone. I wish I asked these info from my provider but my mind was all over the place. Woke up feeling little sane today. 

Questions: 
- Esp I was told to ‚Äútake it as needed‚Äù but is that effective that way? 
- I know it works differently for everyone but how is it like when you stop it? Withdrawls? I think it is one of the medications that you can stop without having to taper down. 
- has anyone taken this type of medications for stressful life events for a month or two? Did it help? 
- if I stop, will the anxiety comes back 10x worse?

"I've found the idea of ""state over story"" to be very useful in lessening the suffering from uncomfortable thoughts. The idea is that the type of thoughts we tend to have is largely dependent upon the state of our nervous system.

Thoughts about death are an indicator of being in dorsal vagal (freeze) response; so it's not your fault these thoughts are occurring - they're an evolutionary consequence of the state of your nervous system. Basically their purpose is to cause your being to freeze as an attempt to avoid death (like a possum).

Attributing your thoughts to the state of your nervous system, and reducing the tendency to ruminate and blame, is the first step. Next step is to work with your nervous system to get out of the freeze response.

A simple but effective technique is orienting yourself to your environment. Look around you and take in all that you're seeing, hearing, feeling etc, gently turning your head and moving your eyes about. This signals to the nervous system to come out of freeze.

Also, if you notice a tendency to hold your breath, you can make an effort to gently eliminate the pauses and try to make the in-breath and out-breath about even."	ffederal	reply	na	na	na	0.998847484588623	no	no	no	na	anxiety	no prediction.
I just spent the last three hours of my beautiful wonderful Saturday morning crying. For no reason at all.

"1. Stop googling, it makes everything so much worse. Your just giving your anxiety fuel to keep going and even trigger a full panic attack.
2. So when you first start out exercising, there is a possibility of it triggering more anxiety especially in those with health anxiety. 

My first night back to the gym, when I got done and went home, I was convinced I was going to die of cardiac arrest because I felt my heart pounding after a good workout. So I went into basically full panic mode. After the second time not so bad but still felt nervous after. After a week, started feeling better each time.

"Hello, first of all it would be interesting to know if you suffer from anxiety problems in general or is it just this event, and if you suffered any negative experience before regarding work. I have had anxiety problems for years but they are not so focused, although if going to work at the office creates a big problem for me, with my therapist we have investigated and discovered that going to the office itself is not the problem but the situation itself, that is, leaving the house, socializing, etc. What has helped me is first to land on the problem and ask myself why it causes so much discomfort, when we have a more real perspective of what can happen, the negative ideas (in my case, for example, I thought that I wouldn't vomit on myself while talking, etc.) they disappear as that we noticed how crazy they are, then and summarizing you could start by making a list of things that cause you anxiety about going to the office, then to one side write down why they generate this and what really happens for example:
  

  
Working with people: Negative/anxious thinking: Everyone is watching me, they will see that I am an idiot - Reality: Most people are involved in their work, and if someone thinks something bad about me, it should not affect me.
  

  
Other tips are to eat light and healthy the day before so as not to feel stomach problems, when an anxious thought comes, take a break, close your eyes and try to reason about your fear, do not hold back, if you feel you are having a panic attack, stop and let go all. Give yourself 1 minute every hour to self-check
  

  
I know there must be a thousand ways to combat the issue, my personal recommendation is to try to deal with it in a healthy and conscious way, not feel ashamed and not hold back. There are many of us who went through similar things and with effort you will get through this bad time"	UnderstandingHappy39	reply	na	na	na	0.9988638162612915	weak	strong	strong	na	anxiety	no prediction.

I was once on anxiety meds, and I was so jealous of people living their day to day without their intrusive thoughts ,worst scenarios etc.

"I agree with your therapist that baseline anxiety cannot be eradicated. Anxiety is fear. It's your body fight on flight system (sympathetic nervous system), And just like you can't eradicate happiness or anger, you can't get rid of fear. It is a core function of the human mind/body.

BUT what you can do is treat disordered or clinical levels of anxiety.

So if your anxiety is excessive or you fear the anxiety itself, you start avoiding situations and places that can trigger it, you can treat this by learning to face your triggers and lose the fear of fear itself.

Treating an anxiety disorder is basically about re-establishing a healthy relationship with anxiety. As a result, it's not this debilitating thing that knocks you off your feet anymore. It is just a slightly uncomfortable thing that comes and goes, like any other emotion like anger or happiness."

Everyone has anxiety. The difference is some have heightened anxiety and that's what your therapist is talking about.

"I'm sorry, I don't agree with ""everyone has anxiety.""

No - everyone has worries. Not everyone has anxiety. 
I have a diagnosed anxiety disorder. My worries have had a significant impact on my life and at times continue to do so. My husband does not have anxiety.

For me, people have things that they worry about from time. People with anxiety tend to have their life impacted by the worries they have. 

I have a 15 year old daughter who is due to sit exams next year, is she worried? Yes. Does she have anxiety? Nope. 

I also have a 10 year old daughter, she has anxiety. We believe it has stemmed from Covid but can't be sure. We would notice little things that got progressively worse. She has seen a mental health practitioner to support her through this and given her tools to help herself. Her worries have impacted her and led to avoident behaviours.

I don't think I'll ever live life without anxiety. Once I accepted that I was struggling with my mental health and got help, things improved. Do I have awful days, weeks, months? Yes, I definitely do. Sometimes I feel like I'm spiralling but once I recognise this is happening, I'm able to bring myself back. Whether it's visiting my gp to go back on medication or using the tools I learned in therapy or just by talking things out with my husband. I just carry on. I imagine it's probably similar for a lot of others. There are times I know the cause, other days I can roll out of bed and my chest feels heavy and my heart is pounding and I just know the day is going to be difficult.

"This is my experience with it: Yes, anxiety is a survival tool. However, I think referring to an anxiety disorder as an amplifed normal thing is unhelpful; you have this thing that is running constantly in the background like bloatware on a computer. It's different from what someone without anxiety disorders experience.

The thing that has helped me the most is being practical about it; when I'm crying and hyperventilating there's no way I can logically talk my way through it because my body isn't in a good place to give me accurate feedback. Telling myself it's okay, or that it's just anxiety, does not make it stop, so I just have to wait it out and distract myself with something (video game, a show, etc.).

The things that have helped are:
- Decreasing my stress levels and setting boundaries so that I'm less burnt out. Not working outside of work hours, not agreeing to do every little thing someone asks me to do because I feel like I have to, not taking on responsibilities outside of my job description (""you want a video editor, you hire one""). 
- Don't be afraid to cut people out of your life if they bring nothing positive to it.
- Don't watch the news. Limit social media and be good at scrolling past something when you feel your body start to tense up.
- Mentally, try to work on needing little to no validation from others. Ex) ""I like this goofy song and sure, someone will definitely think that's embarrassing for me but who cares?""

"Realizing this truth was maybe the hardest part of my recovery after being diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder and OCD.

With the help of my therapist, I used a visualization technique that, for me at least, helped a lot with learning to live with my anxiety. I personified my anxiety, visualizing it as a person and giving it a name. I named him Axel.

During intense moments of anxiety, I would visualize him in front of me and I would essentially push my hand out and use The Force(TM) to blast him backwards. At first, I would only get a minimal release of tension. Over time though, it became more effective, and I was able to start literally pushing back my anxiety some, giving me more room to breathe and think.

As my journey continued, Axel evolved into Alexa, and rather than needing to push her back, she and I were able to walk side-by-side.

By no means am I anxiety free, but I have more good days than bad. And processing and coping have gotten easier.

Try to be gentle with yourself. It‚Äôs a process. You will have great days, horrible days, and meh days. Doing your best to love yourself through it helps.

"aIt is indeed a tough life, and this was the same talk I had with my first therapist. It does get better, there are ways to live a good life, and life is worth living.  


What I've found is that you get used to 'shutting down' the negative thoughts and irrational fears, but it's still exhausting just having to experience them every damn day.  


This experience makes it impossible for me to do a traditional 40 hr work week; I can only work 25 hrs a week. Obviously, in this world with this economy, it is impossible to survive on 25 hrs a week in most industries, so you need to find a job and industry that allows you to work less and earn more.  


I put a solid decade into content writing and now I'm earning enough off just 25 hrs a week in order to survive. Do I believe this is a good path to take nowadays? Not necessarily. As AI gets better, it will continue to change the way this job is done and replace lower end work.  


I suppose if you're GOING to do it, getting in now while there are still some companies hiring low end workers (allowing you to get some experience so that you're not as easily replaceable). I only mention all this to say...it's possible to find a job that works with your anxiety disorder. More difficult than your average person will ever know, but possible.  


Even with some kind of structure to my life, I do sometimes still experience panic attacks, and I tend to take out a lot of anger on technology. Not physically, I just flip out when I have tech issues, and then of course immediately feel embarassed about it.  


If you're like me, you've also got trauma, and depression is one of the main side effects. Yes, those problems still exist, but I would say...not often to a dangerous extent. During the pandemic, I literally had a breakdown over losing my father...who passed away 15 years ago. It was entirely out of nowhere, a generalized anxiety disorder classic.  


If you're going to self-medicate, avoid booze at all costs. Having an anxiety disorder makes you far more susceptible to bouts of depression, and alcohol is a depressant; while it makes you stop caring about your anxieties for a little while, it also heightens your emotions, which is like a perfect storm for experiencing absolute soul crushing depression. It's not only not worth it, but it's of course bad for your health.  


I'm using Delta 9, it's a relatively safe alternative. It also exacerbates emotional problems, but I find it's far better for depression than booze, and it's not going to damage your organs the way that booze does. God, I hope I don't get some weirdo trying to claim it's bad for you, there's almost zero evidence suggesting that.  


Of course, I'm sure many of the drugs your doctor can provide would be better, but they might also be more expensive/addictive. Obviously do whatever you think is best, but I will say that at a certain point, if you ever want to feel relatively normal, drugs will be necessary.  


As for random panic attacks, that's all I get. It really sounds like you have Generalized Anxiety Disorder, because the whole thing with this disorder is that the triggers often don't make sense and come from out of nowhere. That's also why it can be difficult to diagnose, because if you can't explain why something triggered you, how can a therapist address the trigger? I imagine it becomes far more of a guessing game at that point.  


A lot of people really want the comfort of knowing they can ""beat this thing."" It's understandable, but that's not usually how anxiety disorders work. Instead, think of it as ""THIS IS ME NOW."" Acceptance is an important step. Next comes creating a schedule for yourself‚Äîsimple,  repetitive tasks to begin with, remembering to do things like brush your teeth or get the mail.   


Give yourself time to learn about yourself, about what things are like when you are at your most comfortable. That is the goal, to be that comfortable as often as possible. Figure out if there is anything special you're doing on those days at those times that might be easily repeatable. Focus on what makes you comfortable that is also healthy, even if only in some small way.  


Like obviously if drinking a lot is when you're most comfortable -- first of all, I feel you -- but obviously that's not a healthy practice, right? But if gaming makes you comfortable, or perhaps watching movies, or listening to music, or fiddling with something...there are any number of either big or small things you can do to comfort yourself that aren't inherently unhealthy.  


I mentioned my job, but the main thing for finding a job that works with your anxiety disorder is just to have something open-ended. You need to find a job where your boss won't mind that you're taking frequent breaks, where your boss allows you to set your own hours, where your boss cares more about the quality of your work than anything else and won't hold your mental disorder over your head.  


I work 5 hours a day, but I take so many breaks that it actually takes me 8-12 hours on average. That's just the way I have to do things to make my life livable and comfortable as much as possible.  


Again, it might all seem impossible, but it's not. You have to put the work in, but it doesn't have to be exactly what the doctor ordered. They are there largely to offer advice and help you learn more about yourself, but the manner in which you implement your own goals is up to you -- and largely up to your anxiety disorder and what aspects of your life it is impacting."

I believe that it's like that with some regular anxiety.	Powerful_Pressure558	reply	na	na	na	0.0016334094107151031	weak	strong	no	na	anxiety	no prediction.

"Living with it doesnt mean you have to struggle with it.

You and I have elevated anxiety. We just need to learn to change the way we think and take extra time to relax to bring down our anxiety to normal or manageable levels.

Be very mindful! Whenever you're triggered, recall what you were thinking about, reading, or doing.

I have successfully been using meditation (nidra yoga), and have resolved past childhood traumas - where I now maybe once in a while get triggered and have the thought but no longer any associated emotion. It‚Äôs basically exposure therapy, where you expose yourself to your underlying emotions within your body. 

Try and lay down in your bed, close your eyes - and let your thoughts simply pass through as they come, and then focus all your attention/awareness on the underlying associated emotion, be with it fully with your whole body, until it slowly but surely starts to subsides. This practice can be very hard/painful even at first, but it needs to be done, if you truly want to overcome your traumas/anxiety etc.

I don't think anxiety ever is random and without reason. But if you aren't properly connected to your body, it can be hard to find out the reason behind getting anxious. I struggle sometimes with this too. For me it is mostly realizing I'm having a bad feeling but I can't remember what I thought about. The brain can pick up on things we aren't always actively aware of as well. So it can be hard to find concrete evidence, and that's why it is so nice having a therapist to go to. Having a dectective with you so you can solve the riddle so to speak. If you have trauma, even a smell can be a trigger, sound, feeling of a material, a name - pretty much anything.

As a therapist, your therapist is being straight up with you, you can get to a place of being able to function better where you learn how to cope through a variety of different tools and techniques and you will probably still feel a mild amount of anxiety even if therapy is done right. Anxiety is diagnosed because of the inability to function (impacts your relationships, work, sense of self etc) whereas the goal is to simply get you to a place of functioning again with minimal amount of symptoms.

">Also do some of you have random anxiety attacks with no reason? Therapist always asks me what triggered it. And sometimes I just don't see a trigger, they just happen.

Yes; this is the part that gets me.  I could do the exact same thing on two separate days under the exact same conditions and feel perfectly fine one day but have a panic attack on the other.

"Your therapist is right. I‚Äôm 23 and have had anxiety since I was a young child (genetics & learned behavior, later on from trauma).

When I learned that my anxiety will be with me my whole life around age 16-17. I was so angry and grieved the life I could‚Äôve had without it. You never get use to it either‚Ä¶ You just learn to get through or around it more. You learn to identify what is anxiety or what will trigger it. You‚Äôre essentially living with a mental chronic illness.

You‚Äôll get caught in cycles - anxiety trigger, physical symptoms from anxiety, anxiety from the physical symptoms, panic attacks‚Ä¶. Then it‚Äôll dissipate as quickly as it came and you‚Äôre body will find a new anxiety trigger to restart the cycle. The key is to identify that this is happening before you hit the panic attack stage. And if you don‚Äôt- it‚Äôs okay! it‚Äôll pass :) 

But here‚Äôs the thing, knowing you have anxiety is already half the battle. There‚Äôs so many people that don‚Äôt know what anxiety is or feels like and that‚Äôs what they or a loved one is experiencing everyday- it would be horrifying not knowing what that is! 

Your next step is to accept. Accept you have anxiety. Grieve the life you could‚Äôve had or that you can‚Äôt have. Not meaning you can‚Äôt do everything you wanted before- but meaning you can‚Äôt do it without feeling anxious or having anxiety interrupt those things. 

Anxiety = fear of the future, depression = fear of the past. Anxiety is an ‚Äúupper‚Äù, depression is a ‚Äúdowner‚Äù - combined you‚Äôll get the ‚Äúfreeze‚Äù response. 

Eventually you‚Äôll see your anxiety as a superpower. It makes me alert! I‚Äôm hyper-aware of everything around me far more than any of my peers. You‚Äôll hear people respond ‚ÄúHow did even you notice that?‚Äù or ‚Äúgood thinking!‚Äù because anxiety heightens some your senses and fast forwards your thinking :) You‚Äôll think of a million scenarios in your head before the average person will think of 2 or 3. 

Tips:
‚Ä¢be nice to yourself. You‚Äôll get frustrated and ask ‚Äúwhy me?‚Äù or ‚Äúwhy does my body hate me?‚Äù Your body loves you- that‚Äôs why it has anxiety- it wants to MAKE SURE to protect you! Fueling your mind and body with negative self-hating thoughts will make it so much worse. You‚Äôll feel silly sometimes like ‚Äújeez body we‚Äôre really getting anxious about THIS?‚Äù but be kind to yourself. 
‚Ä¢Treat anxiety like it‚Äôs a separate little kid that‚Äôs physically attached to you. This sounds weird, bear with me.. When you talk and tend to your anxiety like a little kid, it helps approach the situation with kindness and understanding. If it‚Äôs anxious for a test - respond like you would to a kid, ‚ÄúI know you‚Äôre anxious and that‚Äôs okay. Let‚Äôs go take this test and get it over with! You studied for hours, I know you‚Äôll do your best and I still love you and you are still safe if not.‚Äù or if it‚Äôs anxious to hang with friends, ‚Äúhey little guy! Let‚Äôs go have some fun! You deserve to feel safe and relax, you can trust me and our friends to keep us safe!‚Äù 
‚Ä¢Sometimes you can trick your mind by telling yourself you‚Äôre excited rather than anxious. The feeling is nearly the same, it‚Äôs the state of mind that changes it up. The reaction comes from the same part of the brain!
‚Ä¢Don‚Äôt let other shame you for your anxiety. This happens more often than I‚Äôd ever like to admit, but unfortunately anxiety can be frustrating to some people. Because our thoughts, triggers, and timing can seem silly to those who don‚Äôt struggle with chronic anxiety- they tend to be insensitive. The amount of times i‚Äôve heard ‚Äúseriously‚Ä¶.‚Äù or ‚ÄúI just can‚Äôt imagine getting that worked up about something so small or nonexistent‚Ä¶.‚Äù it gets rough‚Ä¶ Find new people or set your foot down because it‚Äôs especially horrible timing when they say these things when your pre or mid-panic attack.
‚Ä¢finding a trigger for your panic attacks can be counterproductive. You‚Äôll find yourself thinking of what could‚Äôve happened or what usually sends you off and thinking of all those things will make you anxious. When you‚Äôre first starting off it‚Äôs good to identify triggers, but in my opinion, this tactic should not be used indefinitely. The trigger ultimately doesn‚Äôt matter in the moment or even shortly after.. calming yourself down is what matters. When you‚Äôre at a good state of mind later on is a better time to identify the trigger."	Powerful_Pressure558	reply	na	na	na	0.0016334094107151031	no	strong	no	na	anxiety	no prediction.

I‚Äôm very very similar n my mornings are just like yours.

I was taking  Ashwagandha too but dropped it after switching to branded Mexidol. Ash was making me uninterested in life. The tremors suck! Propranolol stops this but I have to keep up with it or the return with a vengeance.

"You are likely being triggered by your dreams.

People who suffer from anxiety typically have an overactive Amygdala.  It misfires by producing adrenaline for you to fight or run from what you fear.  Problem is there is nothing to fight or run from so you are stuck just feeling like shit.

The more you worry the more adrenaline is produced the worse you feel. 

Your ""calming"" thought slow the production of adrenaline.  Anti anxiety meds try to block adrenaline but are only mildly effective a lot of the time.


Anyway..""random no trigger anxiety"" isn't random, it's your subconscious worrying about or reliving some thing that is causing your Amygdala to produce adrenaline.  

There is no known fix on how to get your brain to stop producing adrenaline when you worry.

But you can deal with trauma so it scares you less, you can train yourself how to focus positive thoughts to get the brain to stop thinking negative thoughts and producing adrenaline. (Typically takes 20 min)

You can also find positive ways to burn of the adrenaline when you have it.

It would take a lot and isn't as easy as it sounds but you can focus your anxiety so it isn't all negative.

30 min of positive thinking and exercise in the morning would do you wonders and even though it's hard to see through the pain now, the adrenaline boosts can be used as a positive once you learn to harness it"	Powerful_Pressure558	reply	na	na	na	0.0016334094107151031	no	no	no	na	anxiety	no prediction.

I cant notice my triggers either from day to day but during intense and uncomfortable conversation my mind runs wild to the point I shut down and all i can say is ‚Äúi don‚Äôt know‚Äù, I used to be a heavy smoker and it helped in the beginning but i felt my anxiety got worse the more i relied on it but i also feel like that could be that way with anything you try and use to relieve your anxiety . I would say try and seek professional help but it looks like it doesn‚Äôt work for some people and it‚Äôs just expensive. Another option is to journal (seems so stupid i know) but write everything you were anxious about that day and you can respond to yourself with situations or actions you can do to either think differently or calm your anxiety if it happens again. I try to journal often and it helps me relax before bed but i‚Äôm never consistent with it. I doubt this helps but i hope you can take something from this. You can adapt and learn to control and stop our anxiety, we don‚Äôt have to suffer. It‚Äôs just a lot harder for us to think normally.

"I‚Äôm not an expert on anyone except myself. But I found a doctor who took my anxiety seriously and we went on a journey to understand it. I took a genetic test and I have a somewhat common mutation where I don‚Äôt break down epinephrine properly, and it builds up and burns off as anxiety and panic. There are certain formulations of magnesium that break down the ‚Äúanxiety fuel‚Äù and I‚Äôve been so much better since starting this supplement. I went from 2-4 full on panic attacks a week to basically not gaveling anxiety at all for the past 2 years.

Edit: but yes, I had anxiety since childhood. It got much worse in my late teens. But I would recommend to people with anxiety problems to investigate this in themselves. I take OptiMag Neuro and it really took the full dose to get the full relief. I played around with smaller doses for years before giving in and taking the recommended dose."

"Learning to surrender or willfully tolerate anxiety is a useful tool for treating disordered anxiety. Meaning the fear of fear. 

If you're anxious because you have real financial, work, or loss issues that pose a genuine threat to your livelihood and well-being, this anxiety is not disordered. It's a justified stress response to a life situation. 

That said, our world is full of chronic stressors (i.e., bills, looming layoffs,  violence, etc), which can lead to chronic stress/anxiety. But it doesn't mean that the anxiety is necessarily 
disordered. In this case, I think the best ""treatment"" is not learning to surrender but rather learning to eliminate and manage stressors, practicing self-care, setting boundaries, etc."	Powerful_Pressure558	reply	na	na	na	0.0016334094107151031	no	no	no	na	anxiety	no prediction.
"It sounds like you have the exact same fears that I do

For me, surrendering is accepting that all those fears may actually happen but not focussing on the immediate feelings should they do.

Previously I got caught up in the fear of early stages of grief -which crippled me emotionally.

If it‚Äôs work, it‚Äôs the same logic. I try to focus not on the initial pain of having ‚Äúfailed‚Äù at something work based, and rather, trust that in a few days time, I‚Äôll have let it go and would be too busy working on next steps.

For the fear of being fired,  I focus not on ‚Äúomg how will I live on no money‚Äù, but instead I imagine how I‚Äôll eventually find a new job, and who knows -maybe I‚Äôd probably nab a pay rise on the way.

"Hi, I'm 22F, and I'm severely panicking about a new job I got as a personal online shopper for a grocery store

This is my first job in about 4 years. I last worked when I was 18 in 2019 in a convenience store/ gas station and I loathed every second of it. It was a job where I had to multitask like 10- 15ish things while dealing with shitty management and customers and it gave me crying fits after almost every shift and I started dreaded waking up every day, I only lasted about 2 and a half months. I've been trying to tell myself that this job isn't gonna be AS bad since I don't have to do nearly as much, but my anxiety is telling me that it is, I don't want to feel that way every day again, I'm petrified.

This is gonna sound maybe babyish, but I'm worried I'm gonna be scheduled for more hours than I can handle. I told the manager I can work any day of the week from 9am-7. I didn't tell her this, but I'm only really comfortable working shifts only 4-5 hours, mostly because I have this thing (it's a mystery thing I've had since hs) where sometimes I feel fainty and sick if I stand for too long, especially in the morning. I also do art freelancing on the side so I'd like to keep up doing that, but I'm worried if I'm scheduled for too many hours for the week I'm going to lose motivation. I don't want to tell the manager any of this bc I'm worried I'll lose the job or she'll give me attitude about it

 I applied for this job out of desperation bc I just need SOME work experience on my resume since I haven't worked a real job since 2019. I've been searching for something more up my alley for an introvert like myself but I'm either not finding anything or getting ghosted from the jobs I actually wanted, so I applied to this out of defeat since I knew grocery stores always hire. Online shopping seems like one of the easiest departments but I've read some bad stories from other people and that just makes me more scared. Not to mention I'm not even a fan of grocery store vibes in general, so the thought of spending hours in one makes me cry lol. I want to find a better job (preferably one where I can use my art BFA) or even a quieter retail job and get out of this one ASAP. I'd like to give it maybe 3 weeks or a month before I decide to quit.

sorry about this being lengthy, any advice appreciated, I feel really dumb about panicking over a job even teenagers do tbh :'')"	jjjmos00	post	24.668430731228394	female	White	0.9992316961288452	na	na	na	6	anxiety	ethnicity: no prediction, age: 22, gender: female, explanation: the author self-identifies as a 22-year-old female, however, there are no clear indications of her ethnicity in the text.

"Ever since I got my new job very recently, I want to take measures to fix a lot of the anxiety issues I've had during college: constant unwarranted worry, panic attacks, and just making improvements to my life. I want to make the efforts to actually accomplish it, as my anxiety has still been persisting and it's wrecking me both emotionally and mentally. At the same time, I know I can't accomplish everything all at once, and I'm trying to take things one step at a time.

Recently, I've noticed a lot of my anxiety is coming  up when there isn't anything around me in the given moment. Whether I'm doing normal activities at work or just doing activities when I get back home from work, I get filled with this immense sense of dread and worry. It goes so far as me getting physical chest pains and heart palpitations, and it's gotten to the point of being debilitating and draining. I've had this problem for quite a long time, and I haven't found anything that works in addressing it (exercising, meditation, hobbies, etc.). I've been attempting recently to just not think about anything at all, and it's been working a little bit, but the sensations always come back.

I'm scared about this, because I'm getting to the point where it feels like it's not solvable. I don't know what to do and I don't want to live all my life in just debilitating worry.

"Yes it absolutely is. It‚Äôs part of the nervous system allowing you to process what‚Äôs going on in the body. 

We generally know shaking as a negative thing - when we are scared or in shock. We are taught that these are a sign of being scared or in fear. We tell people that they are shaking because they‚Äôre having a panic attack - but this is not the case. 

YES - they‚Äôre having a panic response, but the shaking is part of the panic discharge instead. 

Shaking and tremoring is not helping us to fight or flee, but rather it‚Äôs part of the body‚Äôs recovery response to help us calm down from stressful situations. This dumps the adrenaline and its the nervous system‚Äôs way of down regulating. 

Spontaneous movements don‚Äôt only occur when in stressful situations or when recovering from trauma - we laugh and cry which moves our diaphragm, we get excited, we do REM while we sleep and this is moved by the tremoring of the muscles that are moving them!

Our body subconsciously unwinds us later on when we need it, and these are where the tremoring/shaking moves in to help. The body has the capacity to move these things automatically."	ButterscotchFun7142	reply	na	na	na	0.991834282875061	no	strong	no	na	anxiety	no prediction.

"I'm going to offer a perhaps unpopular opinion on this so take it with a grain of salt.

Shaking is the body's natural mechanism for calming down when the nervous system is in a hyper-aroused state (sympathetic - fight / flight). The problem is that we've learned to repress this natural mechanism which essentially worsens the issue. The author Peter Levine talks about this in his book Waking the Tiger.

You can actually use this mechanism to your advantage which helps decrease anxiety and prevents these uncontrolled shaking outbursts. One therapy which I've personally found effective is called TRE where you intentional induce tremors and allow them to move through your body.

"I have anxyety, depression and light OCD symptoms. Recently I switched from venlafaxine to duloxetine for a better anxiolytic effect. 2 weeks of taking 60 mg of duloxetine and still sometimes my anxiety gets worse in the evening. Doctor prescribed me clonazepam and told me only to take it sometimes. Is it safe to take 0.5-1 mg once in a week for a long time? I don't need it everyday.   


BTW clonazepam doesn't really makes me sedated or sleepy, 1 mg makes me feel like I just drank 2 glasses of wine. But it gives me pretty strong anxiolytic effect for 1-2 days. No muscle relaxation, no sleep improvement though. Isn't it a bit weird? It's my first benzo. Before clonazepam I tried 600 mg of gabapentin twice and didn't feel anything at all.

and I googled again and saw silent heart attack is possible 

""Oh shit I think I have it"" 

""Shit im going to die!!!!""

And my symptoms are gone 
""Phew it's gone""

Later on:
I watch the symptom video again
And im lifting my right arm while watching it

"So, for some time (about 3 weeks) I was facing an intense spell of anxiety about something that happened in my life. It introduced many anxiety-related physical symptoms I've never had before like waking up multiple times every night in a cold sweat, my heart frequently pounding, completely lost my appetite, and daily heart palpitations. The event causing my anxiety got completely resolved 2 weeks ago, and my mental state immediately improved, but after a few days I started facing inexplicable anxiety, even though I know I no longer have much to be anxious about. Instead of being chronically anxious like I was before, it comes in wave multiple times per day now. I still have daily heart palpitations and recently I've been experiencing a fast heart rate when I stand up and shortness of breath when doing regular things like walking or even going up the stairs. I'm a 20-year old female who has never had this happen before. My muscles also feel quite tense sometimes. The only physical things I can say have improved are my sleep (I rarely wake up at night now) and the intrusive, anxiety-related fears/thoughts.

After your anxiety cleared up, how long did it take for your physical symptoms to diminish or go away completely? Anything that helped?"	clearenity	post	23.76988717998895	female	White	0.9729409217834473	na	na	na	1	anxiety	'ethnicity: no prediction, age: 20, gender: female, explanation: the author explicitly states her age and gender. however, there is no indication of ethnicity in the text.'
"It's important to remember that your body has a built-in mechanism for going back to baseline. It's interfering with the process, trying to force or control relaxation that can actually create more tension and anxiety. 

Even though the life stressor that triggered your initial anxiety is gone, clearly your brain and body were a bit shaken by this episode. That's NORMAL. Your brain is wired to keep you safe from threatening situations. And your brain seems to still be on high alert. 

The worse thing you can do right now is actually try to fight, control and resist the anxiety that's coming up. If you do, you're only teaching your brain that anxiety is a real threat; this will only instruct your brain to keep staying on high alert and send out more anxiety.

Bottom line: just try to allow whatever comes up in your body, as uncomfortable as it is. Thank your brain for trying to protect you. Keep living your life even if you're not feeling great and have compassion for yourself. And again, be assured that your body will go back to its natural baseline if you allow it."	clearenity	reply	na	na	na	0.9729409217834473	no	no	no	na	anxiety	no prediction.
"Hi everyone. I‚Äôve had GAD and social anxiety for many years even since childhood and I‚Äôm 33 now. In my last career, I was pursuing a mathematics PhD and had a psychotic or nervous breakdown and quit. I was also married at the time and just unexpectedly and unemotionally got a divorce as well. That was like 7 years ago.

I‚Äôve always been a loner and always felt misunderstood and different. My only diagnoses are anxiety related but I feel there is more going on at a physical and neurotransmitter level. I‚Äôm on meds. Lexapro 10mg atm. I had increased from 5mg a while back. It worked decently well in the beginning but now I‚Äôm extremely irritable and aggressive and impulsive out of the blue along with almost any change in my routine or the most minor stressor causing a lot of panic, sweating, high HR, aggression. I broke my left hand (boxer‚Äôs fracture a few days ago because I punched a wall as a result of a text message I did not like). This is unusual for me and started a few weeks ago. I don‚Äôt think it corresponded to any major change but I‚Äôve been having health issues (gut related, burping, nausea, gagging) and I‚Äôm fed up with going to doctors to try to figure out all of my weird symptoms which could also be anxiety related.

What‚Äôs going on? Why am I so sensitive to everything all of a sudden when I haven‚Äôt really changed anything and how can I get back to a healthy baseline mood without swings? I can be happy and laugh in the same day I wake up with excruciating ‚Äúgut anxiety‚Äù that causes my stomach to feel painful and butterfly-like. My body starts shaking with more rigidity to my movements. I can‚Äôt smoothly rotate my neck in this state for example. My movements are jerky but not noticeable to others as much as myself probably. I sweat excessively out of my armpits during exposure to stressors even since last year when I went 32 years without that. And I‚Äôve had worse anxiety at times than now in the past. It‚Äôs just all so much more physical and debilitating now. I still go to the gym and try to keep moving and ignore it, but my throat keeps closing up as I do my workout and I feel like I can‚Äôt breathe lol. I‚Äôve been going to the gym for 2 years with no issues either. I‚Äôm very fit and strong but losing weight due to GI issues and anxiety.

Could I have more than just GAD and social anxiety? Like PTSD, cPTSD, on the spectrum? If I did, would it even be worth pursuing a diagnosis or would the treatments for my anxiety be the same for those issues?

Mostly wanting to vent and get some advice. My PCP recommended therapy and psychiatric referral but I‚Äôm waiting on insurance because I didn‚Äôt send income info in time (they only gave me 7 days to mail-in) and I was on vacation and thought it could wait. They terminated it so I had to make an appeal and haven‚Äôt heard back for a month. Our systems are so screwed up but oh well.

I always post stuff occasionally on AskDocs but I basically have to have a large tumor on my penis for any of those posts to get traction, so I‚Äôm posting here since I think you guys can relate a lot more anyway.

"Thank you for the informative reply. I‚Äôll push for an evaluation since I think it‚Äôs long overdue. Fortunately I do have some tools that I‚Äôve found help for now if I‚Äôm in a really bad place. Sitting in the sun, playing acoustic guitar, music, lifting. Without these I‚Äôd not have made it but I can appreciate that this is likely a temporary state of heightened anxiety and will hopefully settle, but likely will return if I don‚Äôt get help.

I think those activities help me feel ‚Äúnormal‚Äù which is why they work. Anything where I can be part of a crowd and feel like I‚Äôm no different than anyone else, no more worse off.

I have had the same issue as you, I used to struggle to even go out to a cafe with a friend at one point for fear that I‚Äôd have an attack which did happen. Fear of fear is a hard cycle to combat, but you can. I just kept putting myself in the situation and eventually it got less, I used to have the attacks frequently. I would recommend telling your friends about your attacks and the fear of experiencing them if you haven‚Äôt already because that will take some of the pressure off. If you are not comfortable with sitting through the attack also you could excuse yourself for a few moments and go for a walk to the toilets or even to get a drink etc. that‚Äôs what I used to do if I couldn‚Äôt sit with it and it did help. It‚Äôs just a case of finding out ways to cope mainly. Also trying to engage in conversation instead of sitting in your head can help. I think if you are quiet and thinking too much that will make it more likely that one will creep up on you. I hope you do manage to go on the holiday with your friends and that you can enjoy it.

Any place can be a safe place even on vacation. I like to be alone when in a panic attack so I go to a bathroom or a place with AC. And just ride it out.

The key to exposure. Is once you start having a panic attack don't leave until the panic lowers. So if it's an 8 out of 10 wait until it becomes a 5 out of 10 then you can leave.

"I think modern lifestyle is a huge factor. But anxiety can be avoided if you learn how to work with it from my experience. What I mean is you must abstain from reassurance seeking about things and also not avoid doing anything purely because of anxiety. 

I don't have symptoms anymore for several years by now. When I did I had just about every fear depending on what I was doing in the moment. But two were much bigger fears, health anxiety and harm/self harm OCD, meaning fear of losing control over myself. And also social anxiety and depression.

"I see. Really sorry about your mom, that must be contributing so much to your anxiety. 

The way to work with specific fears is all about not seeking reassurance. That includes not telling yourself how it'll be okay and stuff like that. Not that you should be telling yourself the opposite. The point is to stay in uncertainty on purpose. Anxiety always comes down to being too uncomfortable with uncertainty. So the solution is to abstain from reassurance and that way slowly become fine with uncertainty, making the anxiety stop as a result. 

So for example with health anxiety, you must not google about symptoms. But at the same time you must get used to the temptation to google. For example by having a phone within your vision ready to google when you feel like you want to, but chose not too. It's the same principle how a recovering alcoholic has to get used to being around alcohol. 

About future and overall worrying about what could happen, it's crucial to accept that the bad possibilities might indeed happen and leave it on that negative note. This way you're making peace with your fear and that makes it powerless. While if you try to reassure yourself how it'll work out, it creates the need to do it again and again, resulting in more and more anxiety. 

And at the same time you need exposure to the triggers. This can be very hard. This is also about getting used to it and overall get out of the comfort zone. It's good to keep in mind that too much comfort seeking makes you more sensitive to discomfort. So comfort can be sort of a trap. 

Do you understand the logic of this? I don't know if I explained it well."	Carebear6590	reply	na	na	na	0.005910564213991165	strong	no	no	na	anxiety	no prediction.

"TW: Abuse, SA.

I don‚Äôt know if he‚Äôs visiting or if he lives here now, but I don‚Äôt know what to do. I saw him pull in. I‚Äôm terrified he‚Äôll see me and tell my ex. I did everything in my power to make sure my ex had no idea where I moved to, now there‚Äôs a chance he‚Äôll find me.

Back a few years ago at the beginning of the pandemic, things started going really bad with me and my ex, we were fighting all the time, unhappy, and things just weren‚Äôt good. During that time I had decided to bleach my hair just for the fun of it. I showed my ex and he strangled me, hit me, screamed at me, all because I didn‚Äôt ask for permission. I was stupid and talked it through and stayed for a few more months and then there was another incident where we got into another argument and he slapped me and held me down. And again I let it go. The final incident happened at around the end of that year where he got me really drunk and SA‚Äôd me. It was the point where I realized that this was only going to get worse and I had to protect myself. I stuck with him until I had money to move, and moved to the next town over and ended everything. I made sure he would have no idea where I live and kept that up for three years. 

But now here‚Äôs his friend. The one who can‚Äôt keep his mouth shut and has no respect for me whatsoever. My safe place no longer feels safe. I‚Äôm terrified for me and my fianc√©. I‚Äôm terrified to walk out the door tomorrow because he might see me. I want to move but my lease just started and I‚Äôm have no money. I‚Äôm so scared. The peace I created and healing I had done over the last three has just come crumbling down. 

I don‚Äôt know how or even if I can do this. I‚Äôm scared for my life.

"You're overthinking things and missing obvious details. It's truly awful what you went through and I'm sorry that you did, but our world has very clear rules. If that is your exs friend then there's nothing you can do about it, and you shouldn't be ""on the run"" your whole life. You don't need to move or even worry about moving. Let's run through the worst case scenario here for a second:

Turns out it was your exs friend. They tell your ex where you live now. Your ex comes looking for you. But from your description above, your ex performed statutory rape as well as physical abuse, both of these especially the first one are crimes, you tell your ex that if he ever comes back you're going to report them to the Police, he never returns.

You've already got a pretty powerful option to make sure your ex goes away forever. Personally I'd be recommending reporting them to the Police anyway considering how heinous and vile that first crime is. Its likely one of the biggest reasons why you don't feel safe now.

Although it would be more difficult, I'd recommend actually going down to the Police Station. It's harder to ignore a problem when it's standing right in front of you after all. My guess is they'd immediately want to take a statement and start investigating. If you've ever taken photos of any of your injuries, bring them with you.

Keep your location shared on google with you friends and family so they know this is happening. 

Also, If your ex shows up, ask for a restraining order. 

On the other hand, try to do some digging. Are your ex and this guy still friends? If not, there wouldnt be much problem. Is your ex dating someone else? If he does, i dont think he would waste energy on you cause more likely he has someone else to mistreat.

"Think about it like this, there's really 2 options:

A) You do nothing. You'll spend the next days/weeks/months possibly years in fear. That may not have even been his friend, but even trying to convince yourself of that won't help. The Anxiety around it will get worse. And even if you do manage to move again, you'll still be in fear.

B) You can go to the Police. Going down to the police station will not be easy, and I won't pretend it will be. Speaking to them about what happened won't be easy, and I won't pretend it will be either. But this piece of sh## is a criminal. And he's taken enough from you already. Chanel that fear into anger and BE angry. Anger is not great for 95% of situations, this is the exception, the 5%. You don't belong to him nor are you his property, so he shouldn't be allowed to have any control over how you feel or how you're affected. Despite how uncomfortable the police station will be, and it will be, it'll be nothing even close to how devastating to your life the alternative would be, the constant fear. Fear can spread like a plague and seep into other areas of your life. Make you believe in the Irrational. Make you distrust the trustworthy. Don't let this vile disgusting puddle of piss who thinks he's human get away with what he's done and get to control your life without even being there. You should be angry about this.

"Corrections incoming:

I saw your advice, weird how 90% of it was just a repeat of my initial advice. Unless you somehow imagined that me advising him to go to a lawyer somehow wouldn't include, you know, the Law and stuff.

My way of thinking about this scenario is pretty simple actually, read -> process -> advise. You should try it. You didn't notice that the OP said his exs friend hasn't seen him yet, you were too busy copy/pasting advice. This means the OP has time to think and plan instead of getting into a panic. Or more so, being panicked by someone like you.

""I have always taken really good (measures) to not (cross) mine again"". Oh good, so you live in constant fear and think that's a great place to be in to be giving advice. It isn't. You can start giving advice when you sort your own mess out and your own disgusting abuser is in jail. I know misery loves company and all, but I'm not the type to let you replicate your scenario.

""If you can't see it"" . Honestly cannot even think of a more clich√© thing you could have said there. Next you'll be dishing out terms like ""Reading Comprehension"" or something just as daft.

Currently I have 6 different family members who work in the Police. 4 in my country and 2 abroad. But please, go on, never mind my own point of view, you go ahead and let me know what the 6 of them do and don't do. I'll just ignore anything they've discussed with me or the stories I've heard over the years. The 6 of them must have collectively met up at some point and decided to all lie. That's rational. That could happen alright. Yeah.


So just to summarise your time in here so far:

- You start an argument for no reason
- Get called out for not contributing anything
- Look at my advice about Lawyers and pretty much copy/paste it
- Continue to argue for no reason
- Are told to leave because you've started the argument
- Come back with the above reply showcasing that you're not in a position to be handing out advice considering your own situation isn't sorted, have no idea what you're talking about regarding the Police in matters like this, and for a third time have decided to continue arguing for no real reason.

Great job. This is done. The OP got proper advice hours ago before you arrived, and hopefully they look into it. Because the worst case scenario is for them to be stuck with a life like yours, bitter and petty and inconsiderate to an amazing degree. You have work to do in your own life, so go do that instead of being a useless scaremongerer."	Flurzzlenaut	reply	na	na	na	0.9990606904029846	no	no	no	na	anxiety	no prediction.

"so i have thought that my anxiety has gotten better but i suspect it is just manifesting itself in different ways after i repress it.

whenever i try to take a nap i am unable to fall asleep because once i start to drop off into sleep because my mind starts racing, my heartbeat increases and i literally feel as if i am in danger, its like im pulsating and my head feels dizzy/light. this can go on for up to 2 hours and i will not fall asleep.

and ive noticed it when i try to go to bed at night too, except its worse when i am nervous about something. an example-- a couple of weeks ago, i had just found out my friend & their family from childhood i hadn't seen in 3 years was coming over to visit the next day, and i remember just before sleeping my heart and head started racing so hard (like i had just been shocked??) and in the midst of my panic and fear i remember i was just having a conversation in my head trying to soothe myself convincing myself it was gonna be fine or maybe they wont come and that night i dreamt that they couldn't make it.

so ive noticed that often i cant sleep unless i am so tired that i just shut down, usually while distracting myself like reading or watching a show, though this messes my sleep schedule up as i dont really get to that point around beyond 1 or 2 am

When the reasonable part of the brain relaxes the more primal parts can roam free, for example wake you up with a racing heart for something trivial‚Ä¶ for me a light calming/ sleeping pill works, or an edible‚Ä¶ Things like a calm walk can help to relax the body and clear out intrusive thoughts before you get to your bed. Also to have some time earlier in the day to let your thoughts roam around and fall into place.	wailwhal	reply	na	na	na	0.9988858103752136	no	strong	no	na	anxiety	no prediction.
I have trouble sleeping because of racing thoughts, so I bought a pair of sleep headphones and try and fall asleep while listening to something to try and distract me. There's music, calm sounds, and lots of free podcasts including sleep podcasts. I don't know if that will help you, but it can help distract you while you rest/close your eyes which eventually makes you fall asleep (rather than watching tv or reading a book).	wailwhal	reply	na	na	na	0.9988858103752136	no	strong	no	na	anxiety	no prediction.
I unfortunately don't have an advice that works for me. It's 1am here now and I feel the same heartbeat feeling whenever I lay in bed. I was getting anxious about the day when I woke up but it started to be the night too. I am feeling ashamed to my family, they are supportive but I can't stop crying. Thankfully I have them, there is nothing more valuable for me than them loving me no matter what. I am working on my thesis and I will present two days later. But I am still not finished and there are so many things to do. But my family is there for me no matter if I succeed or fail. I wish I can just do whatever I can and don't worry about it but I feel worse as time gets closer. Hope we can feel better.

"So I recently started meds, lamotrogine and risperidone. I have bpd, bp2, and autism. The meds gave me a horrible reaction that landed me in the er after only 3 days of taking them. I fainted and then had intense flu like symptoms for 2 hours, nausea in waves paired with the most intense chest pain anxiety i have ever had. I threw up around 20 times before going. I alerted my psychiatrist and stopped taking the meds. 7 days later my anxiety was still hell. I deal with physical anxiety, but it was like all my symptoms x10. I have a huge fear of the doctor but I was so worried I actually went, just for them to tell me it sounds like my anxiety is really severe. My brain zaps, intense cold shivers, painful bowel movements, chest pain, tight throat, tingling limbs, nausea, swollen neck and hot flashes were just my anxiety...

So I met back up with my psychiatrist, she knows about my weed use, and gave me 10mg hydroxyzine, to take up to 3 times a day for anxiety. I took it and felt very dizzy after 30 minutes and went to sleep. Slept for 13 hours. My anxiety has been much better, but I am dizzy. Apparently taking that and consuming weed makes the sleepiness and dizziness increase. Why would she give this to me? She was trying to pressure me into going on another mood stabilizer, but I'm only comfortable taking one med at a time now because we don't know what caused me to react like that. I just need my anxiety medicated so bad so my brain will stop telling me I'm secretly dying. Hydroxyzine is only a short term solution, I'm going to try taking less of the med next time, but even with that I don't think it makes me very functional. So I'm gonna have to try a different anxiety med next time I go to the psychiatrist I guess? It's just frustrating because she gave me some short term solution anxiety med, now I'll have to try a whole other one, and then once I try that one I can finally add a mood stabilizer to it. What a long process. 

I tried to take a gene sight test, but with how mixed the reviews are it doesn't give me much hope. My psychiatrist was treating it as gospel, but neither of the meds that gave me trouble were on there and there is no way the reaction I had was just a result of my meds mixing with the weed. I mean..... I guess it could be ??

"Yeah, don't drink. That's not a lecture, it's a repeat of what your Doctor should have been telling you.

2 specific reasons why Alcohol is joint-first with Coffee as something to stay away from:

A) The Hangover the next day is you basically looking to buy 1 ticket to a free Anxiety/Panic attack without the need for a trigger. As great as alcohol is, chemically its basically poison. The hangover we get is us literally recovering from a version of poisoning. So you feel more vulnerable. If you ever wanted to make yourself have an Attack without a trigger, simply make yourself feel like anything could hurt you easily.

B) Antidepressants and other Anxiety Meds have a bad interaction with Alcohol. It doesn't stop them working, instead it multiplies the effects of alcohol. If someone would normally get fully drunk from 8 pints, now it's from 3 or 4. Although that sounds great, you've just introduced a second relaxant into your body, meaning you can very easily have an accident as your response time is ridiculously low.


Alcohol isn't necessary to ""let loose"" at all. It merely dampens inhibitions. That's more about your social awareness than anything else. If you think you need alcohol to let loose then the real question is around why you care what others, especially strangers, opinions of you are. That's an entirely different rabbit hole though."

"I had similar reactions and even though I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a good idea to get flat out  drunk I recommend drinking with friends you are really comfortable with if you want to get tipsy. Maybe even tell them before about prevoius panic attacs to take the fear away.

I am dealing with the same thing. I am just now accepting it is just anxiety. It feels very like very real dangerous pain. Despite being told multiple times, it was related to panic disorder. I could not bring myself to believe that I was causing it and then made it worse by obsessing about it. Hopefully, now I will be able to make the proper changes. The best cure for anxiety is exercise, which my fear of a heart attack prevented me from doing offen.

No, you are not the only one to experience things like this. Yes, it is very normal if you have an anxiety disorder. So there's this thing called psychosomatic and psychogenic pain. It feels very real but it's your anxiety making you feel things because you read that they are symptoms of something or another. I have pretty bad health anxiety off and on. I can't tell you the number of times that I have literally thought that I was having a heart attack or something else. When your anxiety is high, your fight or flight response kicks in. Your adrenaline starts to rush through your body, your heart will start to beat faster, you will experience tension and the muscles in your body. Sometimes I get cold chills, or feel like I'm going to throw up, I get diarrhea, sometimes I almost pass out. Your body can do some crazy things when you're stress levels are high and your adrenaline is running through your body all the time. It's not meant to work like that and when we continue to fear things, your nervous system becomes confused and it thinks that you're in an unsafe environment. It does what it does to keep you safe. And if this has been an ongoing thing for a few weeks, your body is going to do these check-ins with you to make sure that you have the ability to run away from whatever is putting you at risk. But when we are fearing scenarios that don't exist, our brain cannot interpret that. It's like if you watch a scary movie and then something in the movie scares you even though you know it's not real you still have bodily reactions. You have to tell yourself that you're okay and you have to believe it. You've had doctors tell you that you're okay, you've had machines check you and the results from those say that you're okay. It's up to you to believe it. It's so challenging but I know you can do it.	ShortDirector2372	reply	na	na	na	0.072268046438694	weak	no	no	na	anxiety	no prediction.

"You‚Äôre not alone. I‚Äôve been to the ER 9 times in the past 2-3 months from severe panic attacks, truly believing I was about to die.

I‚Äôve taken Ativan, it helped, but no insurance right now so I can‚Äôt get to the doctor or a therapist, which induces more anxiety and fear. However, a few tricks I learned and I hope helps you is this: 
1. Eat very sour candy when you feel a panic attack coming on. The brain can‚Äôt help but focus on the sour shock to the taste buds, thus, pushes away the panic attack at least for a while. (Beware though, if you use this method every time, the brain will get use to it, and it won‚Äôt work as well). 
2. MOVE your body. If it‚Äôs anxiety, the pain will subside while moving (specifically fast walking). When moving you‚Äôre expelling the energy built up from the adrenaline rush (hence the term ‚Äúrun it off‚Äù or ‚Äúwalk it off‚Äù). I frequently jump up and walk when sudden sensations begin to trigger me to panic. It usually helps unless I‚Äôm too far into the panic attack. 
3. Do not google your symptoms. One time I thought I was going into cardiac arrest (my heart rate was only 80bpm which is actually in a decent range for having a panic attack) and so I googled what that would feel like and it made my body mimic dang near that (ended up elevating bpm to 170 for no real reason). 
4. Remind yourself you‚Äôve survived 100% of every symptom you‚Äôve had/felt. Because truthfully you have or you wouldn‚Äôt of been able to post here. 
5. My wife and I have worked in the fire/ems/medical fields, and to be honest, lots of people survive heart attacks and strokes these days. The chances of you actually dying even if you do have that happen, is pretty low thanks to advanced technology and medical treatments. I watched a guy go from both a stroke and heart attack (basically simultaneously) into cardiac arrest, then back to life in less than 10-15 minutes. No it wouldn‚Äôt be the best experience but he didn‚Äôt die and he had a history of drugs, alcohol, and many other conditions. Someone like you who is probably young and healthy, has zero to insanely low risk of this happening.. 

Staying busy to distract from anxiety/panic attacks is helpful, but accepting you have anxiety and panic is even better. It takes a lot of patience and practice, it can take months to get back to ‚Äúnormal‚Äù which is more like working WITH your anxiety rather than getting rid of it, because you don‚Äôt truly get rid of it unless it‚Äôs a one time ‚Äúoh I almost crashed my car that was scary‚Äù type deal.

The vagus nerve controls autonomic systems, your heart rate, sweating, digestion, etc. When it doesn't work right it causes chaos. I have neuropathy and vasovagal syncope.

"I'm not exactly sure if this is anxiety, but it definitely feels pretty unsettling. The reason I'm hesitant to label it as anxiety is because I haven't talked to a therapist about it, and the thought of getting an official diagnosis for Anxiety actually freaks me out. But the main reason I'm unsure if it's anxiety is this: when I read other people's posts here, they often describe feeling something unpleasant, like this strange, unknown presence... almost like those ""dementors"" flying over them. Why aren't people getting into the nittygritty details of the possible causes?
  

  
Personally, what I'm experiencing is more like... those moments where I suddenly think, ""What if everything is just downhill from here?"" It's like flashback of regrets, wasted youth, and mediocrity come rushing back. I usually try to push those thoughts away, which changes my entire persona. But as the day moves closer to evening, especially after 4pm, things start intensifying. However, that unpleasant feeling isn't the first thing that hits. It comes subtly..right after those bouts of despair and the involuntary ""what-could've-been"" thoughts pop into my head out of fkin nowhere. My heart starts racing, I can't catch my breath, temperature rises up, and I don't even want to make the short trip to the bathroom. Also, that concept of ""Anticipatory Nostalgia"" becomes pretty relevant.

Do y'all ever have a primary Cause before actually feeling the effects of anxiety or does the feeling come unannounced without any thoughts prior to it?"	swws1	post	21.968661924068574	male	White	0.05005664378404617	na	na	na	4	anxiety	no prediction.
Mine is worse at evening/night as well. Usually because I suppressed the feelings all day, and when you go to unwind for the day it comes out of nowhere (or so we think it does). There is times absolutely nothing triggers it, it just is there. I‚Äôd rather have a anxiety diagnosis than a actual physical problem. Anxiety can be worked out pretty well with the right lifestyle changes and understanding of said anxiety, compared to other problems that could be.	swws1	reply	na	na	na	0.05005664378404617	no	strong	no	na	anxiety	no prediction.
"You don't at all need a primary cause for anxiety. It often comes out of thin air with no identifiable trigger. A lot of things can trigger anxiety. Some people have more unique ones (like someone afraid of clowns for example), others might have something hormonal going on, and others are just overly stressed and it manifests as anxiety.

"I need to preface by saying that I‚Äôve been on 200mg of Zoloft 1x/daily for generalized anxiety, panic and depression for about 6 years now. I know this dose is unusually high but it‚Äôs what my doctor and I worked up to and really works great for me. I‚Äôm usually very good at taking it every day, even if it‚Äôs not at the same time every day, it doesn‚Äôt really affect me as long as I take it. I‚Äôve missed a day or two or even three here and there and sometimes I‚Äôll start feeling pretty wonky but once I take it I‚Äôm fine after a few hours of it working into my system.

The last month or so, I‚Äôve been really inconsistent with taking it every day. My mind has just been wandering with lots of tasks and obligations and I‚Äôve been forgetting to take it for 2 days, then I‚Äôll take it for 1 day, then forget for another day, take it again for 3, then forget for 3 and take it for 2 days‚Ä¶..etc. I haven‚Äôt really felt THAT much different given those circumstances but about 5 days ago I told myself that I really needed to get back on track because it‚Äôs not good for me to be so spotty and inconsistent and I was actually starting to feel mildly depressed which isn‚Äôt like me either. So on Sunday I began taking it every day (today is now the following Saturday) so about 6ish days I‚Äôve been taking it consistently. I honestly felt fine felt until two days ago (Thursday) when I woke up and felt exhausted, dizzy, foggy, my heart was racing, chest was tight and just god awful for no reason. I wasn‚Äôt even really anxious but then I went to get a haircut and had a full blown panic attack in the waiting chair (I haven‚Äôt had one of these in as long as I can remember). For the rest of the day that same level of anxiety stayed with me and has now followed me to the next day, Friday, as soon as I woke up along with much, much more. 

I felt completely detached from and unfamiliar with my surrounds, they just seem and feel so foreign. I‚Äôm incredibly agitated and my mind and thoughts are racing all over the place to where I can‚Äôt even make sense of them. Things around me are almost hyper-realistic and just don‚Äôt look or seem ‚Äúright‚Äù and giving me sensory overload. To top it all off I‚Äôm just riddled with profound anxiety and almost a sense of derealization. I mean I know who I am, where I am, etc‚Ä¶.but it doesn‚Äôt feel that way? Does that make sense? I‚Äôm trying to tell myself that this is just me reintroducing the Zoloft to my system consistently and all of this will eventually pass, but I‚Äôm scared that I‚Äôm going into psychosis or something?  

Does anyone have any similar stories or know what could be going on? I‚Äôm not really sure what to do as this hasn‚Äôt happened to me before. I also just don‚Äôt know WHY this would even be happening, especially after 6 whole days of getting the medication back into my system and feeling fine up to day 3? I thought being so inconsistent before that my body and brain would feel great having the Zoloft back on a daily regimen‚Ä¶guess not. I‚Äôm feeling absolutely terrified of what‚Äôs happening and don‚Äôt know what to make of it all.

"Has anything changed recently? Perhaps a lifestyle change? Have you started taking any other drugs besides Zoloft? Often, changes to your lifestyle could cause unprecedented symptoms.
I'm no doctor but I have heard that sometimes, people become resilient to drugs but as you are already taking such a high dosage for six years, I do not know if this is the case.
There may be other factors such as weight gain or loss that could change the way that the drug works on your body.
What I personally think is that since you suddenly reintroduced a drug into your system, it is taking some time to readjust. This also happens to some other antidepressants. For me, I took escitalopram which made me feel absolutely terrible for the first 2 weeks or so but the feeling ultimately subsided as time went by. If you keep feeling this way, I would discuss it with your doctor.

"I feel your pain. I'm kind of the blind leading the blind because this stuff is so hard to implement and I'm still in a world of pain, but my suggestions are the following:

Minimize safety behavior to the best of your ability. In other words, stop giving your anxiety what it wants. Anxiety often works almost like a habit, in the sense that it gets ""rewarded"" when you engage in the behavior it wants you to engage in (avoidance, ruminating, safety behaviors like rituals, clutching, or reassurance). When you engage in these safety behaviors, your brain learns that it's being kept safe only because of that. It hypothesizes that if you didn't engage in the safety behavior, all hell would break loose. So by teaching yourself that safety behaviors are useless, you'll theoretically break free from anxiety. To learn more about this thinking, read a book called ""unwinding anxiety"".

But anxiety is often just a manifestation of a much deeper trauma or narrative. In order to get to the bottom of that, you need to do a lot of exploring about the beliefs you have about yourself, the world, and others that might be making you anxious, and learn to think differently. In other words, replace the anxiety causing beliefs and narratives with more safe ones. Two books you might want to check out along these lines are ""getting unstuck from PTSD"" and ""unlocking the emotional brain"" (though the latter one is specifically about memory reconsolidation, and much more theoretical).

Lastly, sometimes anxiety problems are caused by physical issues. This isn't nearly as uncommon as you'd think. Anything from thyroid problems to UTIs to arrhythmias. Go to a doctor and get a check up to clear yourself from any potential anxiety inducing illness. 

Oh, and if you drink caffeine, cut it out. Some people solve anxiety with as simple a change as that."	Noncringe115	reply	na	na	na	0.9990873336791992	weak	strong	no	na	anxiety	no prediction.

"It's rare.  In general, if that goes on for a long time, you'll probably want to seek medical attention if you can't calm it down yourself.  That's three beats every second.  While the heart *can* do that, it leaves little time for it to effectively fill up again.  But there are people who click into a rhythm called a paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT, fancy way of saying ""the heart starts beating really fast for no apparent reason"") and they survive it just fine.

""Normal"" is simply an accepted range of values or behaviors by the medical community.  My SIL's resting heart rate is about 90.  That's on the upper end of ""normal.""  My resting heart rate is typically in the 50's, and not uncommonly in the 40's.  By medical standards, that's ""abnormal,"" what's called ""bradycardia.""  But it doesn't harm me.

""A healthy heart can tolerate a rate of over two hundred beats per minute for many hours, even days, without evidence of damage.""  


You probably don't want to have that happen, but briefly getting to 180 (during a panic attack) isn't a big deal. And just think, weightlifters and other similar athletes' heart rates can briefly get really high when they're working out and it's fine.

I stopped running and was convinced I was going to die on the side of the road in the rain. My chest was tight, my heart was pounding so hard. I calmed myself down really fast so I was probably at 197BPM for a very very short time. I‚Äôve gotten to 193BPM while not even having any anxiety at all, and I get in the 180‚Äôs fairly often. For me since I‚Äôm young and it isn‚Äôt too out of range for me I‚Äôm okay, and my doctor reassured me that I‚Äôm fine.	sabrinablon	reply	na	na	na	0.8745118379592896	no	strong	no	na	anxiety	no prediction.
Well I have pots so if I'm standing it will easily stay around 160-180. When I had hyperthyroidism after having my first baby I would randomly go into a state of panic and my face would flush.. tingling.. heart rate would be in the 200s. That was scary!!! I continued having panic attacks and now I take ativan and it helps tremendously. My biggest regret is not getting on meds that truly help sooner. A constant state of panic is truly no way to live.

"Every 6 months or so, I hit 130 for about 45 minutes. Usually while I'm sleeping.

I normally ask for someone to come watch me while I suffer just in case 911 has to be called.

I can not imagine 180. I thought I was going to die at 130. Like, I had already accepted death and was just looking forward to the attack ending as my ears rung and my vision darkened.

I would definitely tell your doctor or whoever handles your anxiety meds this. Preferably maybe so that you can have a good rescue medication whenever that happens, assuming it's not often.

I went to cardiologists several times and they said my heart is strong and I don‚Äôt have any issues, just sinusal tachycardia. My pulse is on the higher end, my resting heart rate is 70-80, I am out of shape and when I work out intensely I have 160 as well. I also had a stress test where my heart hit 180 as well where I was monitored and the cardiologist said my heart works fine at that rate, cuz at my age the maximum would be somewhere around 190. He also said after the effort my heart is recovering pretty fast. So I don‚Äôt know if I should worry about that anymore.

"Agreed.  Force of habit.  Tend to make things not sound like absolutes.

"Interesting.  Okay, I'm no doctor (I was an EMT, and I wanted to be a paramedic some 30 years ago, but undiagnosed anxiety at the time brought that dream to its knees).  You've had a medical evaluation by a cardiologist.  That would bring me some peace of mind.  The answer, then, is how you feel.  To me, 180 seems like it'd be pretty damn uncomfortable.  You may technically be able to handle it, but that doesn't mean you have to like it.  Still, you'll know you won't be causing damage.  I'd hold onto that.  140-160 is normal for exercise when you're younger.  (I'm middle-aged and used to hit low-to-mid 140s on my bicycle, before I was put on a beta blocker).  Guessing you're 20-30 years younger than me.  By the math, if you're 20, 90% max heart rate would be 180.  (220-20 is 200, 90% of 200 is 180.)  So the math works of you're young enough.

Almost a year ago (a year minus 8 days), I had my first diagnosed panic attack.  I was evaluated in the ER.  The evaluation showed everything was fine.  In reviewing my chart, they looked at my cardiac workup and everything was good -- CT scans of vessels, cardiac MRI, calcium score.  So the odds of being an MI are pretty small.  When I have sensations that I'm concerned are cardiac, I have to assume it's not a heart problem because of last year.  That has helped keep me calm.

We both have brains that freak out in the face of evidence.  To me, that means we shouldn't rely on them, so we need to put our trust elsewhere.  So I'll remember my previous workup, you remember that the cardiologist said 180 is tolerable with no damage.  Let's both take a deep breath when we start to get concerned and lean on our evaluations."	sabrinablon	reply	na	na	na	0.8745118379592896	no	strong	no	na	anxiety	no prediction.

We won‚Äôt necessarily die, no, but at that heart rate you could faint and really hurt yourself. I was told that at the hospital. I ended up being admitted for two days because having a sustained high heart rate caused my heart enzymes to be too high and my EKG was a little funky. They referred me to a cardiologist, ran blood work, did a CT with contrast, an X-ray of my heart, and sent me home with new anxiety medication. A very high heart rate should be taken seriously whether it‚Äôs caused by anxiety or not. I was told if I continued to have chronic high tachycardia in a couple decades I could be at risk of stroke.

But every time I go to the doctor, they just tell me it‚Äôs anxiety. I‚Äôm also looking into therapy. Does anyone have any tips/tricks when they get to having these panic attacks? Any advice would help tremendously, I‚Äôd love to connect with people on here. If you made it this far, thank you for taking the time to read my post.

Sorry to hear that OP, I am currently going through the same thing except I‚Äôve been to the ER 3 times and have called an ambulance twice all without insurance, I just had one 3 hours ago and am still trying to calm my self down so I don‚Äôt go to the ER my hand still feels tingly and my muscles twitch and ache in places that make me think I should be concerned.

"Hey man, I‚Äôm 22 and literally out of nowhere I got hit with these panic attacks. They got to the point where I would throw up and couldn‚Äôt keep food down for 6 weeks. 

I didn‚Äôt even know they were panic attacks at first. I had to quit work Also i couldn‚Äôt drive due to my anxiety causing dpdr. 

The best thing I do is to get my mind onto a task. For example my phone is with me 24/7. I can‚Äôt really watch YouTube or tictok when I‚Äôm in a attack because I can‚Äôt understand what‚Äôs going on and it freaks me out more.

"yesterday I spent 8 hours at the ER due to mild pain i've been getting behind my eyes and pressure on the bridge of my  nose.

I thought I was having a brain aneurym/tumor.

Had to do a CTA and have extra radiation on top of blood squirting out of my arm due to the person drawing my blood sticking the thing in without locking it so blood starting waterfalling out without the tube even attached to it.

left with more problems then i came in with, I was even worried about an air embolism from the botched blood draw/IV.

Also learned i had a congenital (mostly harmless) anatomical difference in my brain ateries (they split in 2).

"Hey people. I'm on vacation with my boyfriend but I'm suffering from high anxiety symptoms, health anxiety etc. I have my good moments but I have a lot of bad moments too when I want to isolate myself and reflect. 
Today I had a huge fight with my boyfriend where he mentioned he is not having a good time because I'm too difficult to handle and he is always worried about how I am doing.
I know I can't do more. I need my meds (he even mentioned about all these meds), my therapist and my alone time. OK perhaps I am  not fun to be around but now I feel shitty about what he said to me. I feel like I am ruining his vacs and like I am a burdain. I always felt that I should apologize for my mental struggles,  I always felt like I am the weirdo and everyone around me is normal and that at the end of the day nobody would like my company and I will end up alone.
And this fight pushed me harder into these feelings.
Have you felt similarly in any situation?
And how did you handle it?
I want to make my mental health and myself a priority, but then I disappoint people around me.

"It's a bit of a difficult situation. 

On the one hand nobody should be made to feel bad about their Mental Health Disorders. Nobody asked for them and there's no ""1 pill will fix this forever"" option out there.

On the other hand, you do still need to acknowledge and understand that Mental Health Disorders don't just affect you. Look at how you described what he said; ""he is always worried about how I'm doing"". Someone only does that because they care. If he didn't, he wouldn't be worried nor would he be having a bad time.

Instead of asking you to disclose personal details I'll give you the short version of some advice. If you've been taking meds for up to 6 months, it's possible you are in fact doing everything you should be to battle this. If its been longer than 6 months, you aren't. Theres no easy way to put that, you just aren't doing/trying everything. That may not be entirely your fault though, it's possible the Therapist is moving too slow or is not getting you to perform the proper tasks/exercises. Medication for Mental Health Disorders like Anxiety/Panic Attacks are meant to be temporary. Short term. And they're never going to be the reason you get better, they simply calm you down enough to go do the actual things that make you better. CBT, Exposure Therapy, Body Signal Desensitisation etc etc. If you aren't still doing them/doing them at all, you're not trying everything. That doesn't make you a bad person nor does it mean anything bad, it just means you're coming at this from the wrong angle.

Also keep in mind, couples fight on holidays. It's a weird constant rule. It's impossible to find a couple who haven't fought while on holiday or will do on a future holiday. He'll probably apologise for making you feel bad soon, and that'll be your opportunity to acknowledge that your condition is hard on him too. Love has its costs after all."

"I had also had a major depressive episode back in 2018 and  my therapist keeps me on meds to prevent relapse. Plus I had some losses recently which fuelled a lot of anxiety symptoms lately. I was told that some people may require to take meds lifelong. My therapist is not specialized in cbt therapy techniques. He uses psychoanalysis as a form of therapy. I have many past traumas too related to my family. I would like to try the techniques you suggest but I don't want to end my current therapy because I trust him for years now. Yes I haven't seen great progress regarding  my anxiety and panick symptoms but I don't know if it is deep rooted or it could be handled with the aforementioned techniques.

"Although a motto of Doctors is ""prevention is better than cure"", what you described is kind of odd. There aren't any meds to prevent something like that from relapsing. Antidepressants are a ""cure"" in the context of that motto, not a preventative. Used to treat someone who currently has a condition, not to stop one from reoccurring. I'd speak to your Doctor about that a little more if I were you. Antidepressants such as SSRIs and SNRIs are also used for Anxiety but again, current not upcoming.

There are people on meds longterm yes. To put it simply, this happens because they've given up. Despite what many may think, its not a Doctors job to force anyone off medications unless it's absolutely necessary/illegal to stay on them longterm, like with Benzos. Their job first and foremost is ""do no harm"". If a Doctor cannot motivate a patient to go and do the actual work, medications are then basically the only thing holding back the full condition. Most Anxiety meds if used longterm can lead to some pretty bad side effects. Ironically a worse mental state, as well as organ failure. The Doctors are stuck between a rock and a hard place, and have no choice but to address the immediate problem instead of the future one.

As for your Therapist, if anything that sounds more like an attachment issue. Think about what you just said, ""I haven't seen great progress regarding my anxiety"". Every Therapist has a limit. Nobody in the world is trained in every single aspect of Therapy. Some of them literally have conflicting beliefs. So it sounds like your current Therapist did their job, did what they were capable of doing, and now you need help they aren't capable of providing. You need to keep something in mind and I'm just going to be blunt about it, your Therapist isn't one of your friends. And yes, I know the typical response is ""I know that"" but it's not about knowing. People tend to say ""I know that"" to situations like this because they want to avoid embarrassment or looking foolish, but there's nothing foolish or embarrassing about confusing the Therapist-Patient relationship. Here's someone you sit down with, who's genuinely interested in letting you speak, genuinely wants to listen, and normally makes you feel better by the end of each session. Theres even ""transference"" which is basically a mistaken attraction to a Therapist. But this is a business transaction, and your Bank Account gets emptier every time you go. That Therapist is likely just as ""close"" with 5+ other patients. You need to be getting something substantial out of each session or else it's time it ended. It's not easy ofc, but its necessary. And as any actual Therapist will tell you ""The only thing constant is change""."	Velligone	reply	na	na	na	0.9978185892105103	no	no	no	na	anxiety	no prediction.

"Panic and anxiety is known to cause cold hands. It's different for everyone. Some people get cold, dry hands while others may get sweaty.

If your whole body feels cold, it may be due to a problem with your circulation. 
Unless you have had a previous history with heart problems, it is highly unlikely that it is anything serious and is most likely because you are causing your blood pressure to drop due to hyperventilation (breathing too quickly).

Try not to overthink things that may trigger your anxiety and it will most likely make your symptoms go away. Try to distract yourself by doing something you like. I personally enjoy watching action movies that get me invested in the story to keep my mind off of things that may cause anxiety because I too get cold hands.

Probably from anxiety. Sometimes, if you keep thinking that something is wrong, it could make you anxious which may cause symptoms such as cold or sweaty hands which will just convince you feel that something is wrong again. This acts as a sort of domino effect. The best way to stop this is to understand that nothing is wrong and you are just overthinking.

"Healthy friendships rely on boundaries so if you do not want to go out with this friend of yours, you should not feel a sense of anxiety in doing so. Friendships also rely on communication. If you do not feel that you want to hang out with your friend, tell them how you feel. Tell them that you do not want to hang out but tell them the reason why.
From what I see, just the fact that you are so anxious about losing this person as a friend to the point where you are feeling anxiety shows that you really care about this person. Instead of telling this to us online, you should tell your friend. 
Show them how much you care and I bet they will replicate the feeling. I personally would be honoured to have a great, kind-hearted friend such as yourself. What a lucky person they must be!

"So, the place I work is a very small town with little to do and the type of work we do everyday at my company is exhausting, dangerous, but really fun. Because of this, our coworkers have created a tight knit community and in the summertime, we have big BBQs every other week or so. 

These are very fun, but I‚Äôve always had the worst anxiety when attending. I usually end up being on edge the whole time, unable to make conversation with anyone, and within an hour having a massive panic attack and making a fool of myself. My coworkers/friends notice, and they care, but they don‚Äôt know how to help me and to be honest, my anxiety in these situations is overwhelming and out of control.

Today we had a BBQ and I was preemptively nervous because I didn‚Äôt want to have a nervous breakdown. I did two things different: #1 I brought food to share at the potluck (I am relatively new so in the past I haven‚Äôt brought food) and #2 I took a muscle relaxer. 

The BBQ went so well, I didn‚Äôt feel overwhelming anxiety at ALL and found myself engaging in conversations, starting conversations, and overall actually enjoying myself! It felt so good to actually feel like hanging out with the people I love was relaxing and restorative. I guess after so many failed interactions I was beginning to feel like I didn‚Äôt belong and like I was broken and my anxiety would never stop being in the way. Today was different than all the other days in the past and I am so thankful. 

I‚Äôm hoping I get the courage to talk to a doctor about this - I am always so scared to be labeled as a drug abuser or seeker, especially since the muscle relaxers were prescribed for back pain and I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs bad that I used them this way but to me, my quality of life has improved dramatically because of how well tonight went and I have hope again.

Feeling scared of feeling scared and also feeling scared of taking meds are also symptoms of anxiety. You have to stop reading the stuff they post about benzos, that stuff scares me too.

I think most, if not all of us had that fear of being reliant on medication to feel normal. It was one of the reasons I didn't try antidepressants or anxiety meds for the first 9 years of my anxiety battle. I finally decided to start treating it, I did a ton of research and found a medication that seems like a good fit for me. My doctor prescribed it for me and I've been taking it every day for almost 4 years. I finally feel like I am in control of my life again and that anxiety doesn't define me anymore. I wish I could get back all of those years that I was afraid to try. Convinced that I could fix myself and if I couldn't it was my own fault.

"As the other commenter said, you only build up a physical tolerance or addiction with consistent daily use. I was in a similar situation as you, and the issue for me was less of a physical addiction and more of a psychological one. At the start of my treatment, I was so afraid of the anxiety itself that whenever it came back after the Ativan wore off, I panicked. 

I was deep in the fear of fear cycle.

The Ativan prevented me from building my confidence in my ability to cope with the panic. So every time it came back, it came back stronger. I just stopped taking it and waited for the SSRIs to start working. The SSRIs def took the edge off, so I could go to therapy and learn how to practice acceptance and cope with panic on my own.

I'll take an Ativan over having a panic or anxiety attack any day. 30 days as needed(which isn't always 2), you are using it correctly. Feeling good or just not having anxiety? If it works it works and some respite is healthy. As far as addiction is concerned, 60 1mg ativan is not going to make you become one. Dependence is a whole different thing, but that's not where your Dr is taking you. This time I have been on Ativan for about 6 years which is not the norm, but I take it for more than one reason. I started with the three a day and now I have a similar schedule as you. It still works for attacks etc, I never run out early(in fact usually have some left), and dont abuse it.

Watch for needing increasing amounts and taking it daily for a prolonged period of time and you should be fine.

"My mum and my sister got addicted and they only took what was prescribed, never more. All medicines in that class (benzodiazepines) are addictive over time and Ativan happens to be one of the strongest benzo's available. As soon as the medicine wears off, anxiety/panic returns and many people say it returns worse than before starting the medication.

There's plenty of literature online which says the same thing.

 I already had an anxiety disorder. So after a traumatic experience, I was given Ativan for when my attacks got worse. I was to take it as needed.

And now I just keep it with me because even when my attacks get really bad, I just tell myself that worst case scenario, I have my Ativan if I need it. That gives me the confidence and strength to last through the attack, and I never end up taking it.

Your dosage is being monitored by your doctor. And your doctor is trying to make your life easier.

"Hey I think I may have made a post here a couple weeks ago and touched on this a little bit. In the year of 2023 I haven‚Äôt been out of the house much because I started having panic attacks early in the year. 
I was also drinking a lot and all of a sudden stopped because I got a new job then my first week at that job I had a panic attack and the next day I was encouraged to quit because ‚ÄúI could be a hazard‚Äù that made me mad but at the same time having a panic attack for the first time did scare the crap out of me and I basically just hid in my room from the world. 

My sleep schedule is terrible. One day I could be awake at 8am and the next day I won‚Äôt be awake till 4pm. I‚Äôve missed out on my friends life‚Äôs like one of my friends is having a son and I didn‚Äôt even know till recently. One friend invites me to his house sometimes and I always want to go but I now have a fear of having a panic attack and people thinking I‚Äôm crazy or something.

 I‚Äôve gained weight this year and even started having high blood pressure issues. I‚Äôve been put on blood pressure medication and I‚Äôm on and off of anxiety/depression medication because I keep having bad side effects from the medications the have put me on. Side effects like thinking the world isn‚Äôt real or thinking I‚Äôm gonna blink and I‚Äôll be in a different place or weird dreams that feel insanely real. Thankfully those thoughts have stopped since I got took off of the anxiety medication. 

I‚Äôve gotten into politics lately and it‚Äôs actually helping me take my mind off of my personal stuff that‚Äôs going on and helped me have conversations with friends and meet new people via social media. 

I finally got out and got a hair cut that I badly needed but my anxiety was a wreck during it. I was constantly shaking my leg and grinding my teeth and I‚Äôm sure my barber thought I was on crack or something ü§£ 

immediately after leaving the barber shop I kept thinking I needed alcohol I needed it so bad I started sweating and frantically looking around my house for 2$ because I was 2$ short. I asked my mom for the 2$ and she gave it to me but said please do not get drunk just drink a couple and be done. I ended up drinking 17 beers and had a bad hangover the next day and I think I actually made a post here explaining my anxiety and how it started. 

I‚Äôm asking for advice on going out into town and being calm and not immediately thinking I gotta have this or that to calm down. I know people smoke cigarettes and that helps take there anxiety away and it does the same for me until 30 minutes after smoking then I immediately need another cigarette and I‚Äôll go through a whole pack a day. I quit cigarettes this year as well because cancer runs in my family and I‚Äôve watched multiple people in my family suffer with it and it‚Äôs really sad and painful to watch and I don‚Äôt wanna put any of my friends or family through that with me.

 i don‚Äôt have any friends in real life because i move a lot and generally just don‚Äôt have any. 

this year iv been so alone, i did make friends but it only lasted 3 hangouts and the main person who introduced me to the other friends ghosted me. the other ones we just faded away. so that didn‚Äôt workout.

i made a friend in the gym but he liked me, and i didn‚Äôt. at this time i tried medication and faded away from him because i was going through a lot, my ex boyfriend / bestfriend actually visited me from another state to help me get through it. my ex boyfriend were intimate and he didn‚Äôt like that i hung out with this guy because he liked me. he wanted me to stop being friends with him and i respected it, but it lead me to not having friends. after my ex boyfriend left, we had some issues. i tried to be friends with this guy again but it wasn‚Äôt the same and he just kinda didn‚Äôt try to be my friend anymore. so i just let it go. 

i met another friend at the gym who actually came up to me, and we both stated that we wanted friends and how we wanted to progress at the gym. we hung out maybe 4 times at the gym until she ghosted me and never came back. so i let it go. 

now all my friends are online but even then, i get left on read, delivered and i don‚Äôt feel enough at all. i know people have things going on but i know sometimes my friends could answer me. they just don‚Äôt. i just feel so worthless and alone.

"I am on vacation in Europe and on my first night out in Munich me and my friends had a night of heavy drinking. The morning after I was sick to my stomach (to be expected) and went to throw up but all I did was gag.

Xanax is a tool in the box. If it works for you, great. Advocate for yourself. But I'd keep an open mind and see what the docs have to say and give stuff a shot within reason. It's a problematic drug. A lot of docs won't prescribe it, you can run into issues with it being limited by insurance, it can stop working for some people, people steal it. I know people who use it with success but for most it's just kicking the can down the road. If ssris aren't for you there are other options. Counseling might help.

The green is what is recommended that is best for your genes. Yellow is the list that may or may not work and isn't quite the best options to look at. The red is what you should avoid. The Psych did the right thing by not looking at that list. My current meds are all from the green list and work tremendously.

"My Psych who does the genesight test for many of her patients says she always tries the green list first before even looking at the yellow because you have better odds with the green than you do with the yellow. My Abilify I was originally on that worked but could have been better, was on the yellow list and as well as my Propranolol that was working great for the most part for my nightmares, she switched those to Seroquel, Lexapro, and Lamictal off the green list and my moods and my sleep issues have been 100x better.

"I suffer from health anxiety surrounding my heart. I live alone far from family as it is, which makes it tough for me. 

Recently a few friends invited me to a hiking trip, and I agreed even though I have terrible anxiety about being in the middle of nowhere far from civilization. 

I knew it might really fucking suck. But I agreed to go anyway because I felt it was the only way to truly face my fear in a position of vulnerability where I felt there was truly nothing to save me if something were to happen, for example in the middle of the forest somewhere. 

So I agreed to go with them, and the 4 hour car ride was grueling, but I somehow made it. Now I can‚Äôt sleep due to anxiety and I‚Äôm dreading the hiking tomorrow morning. But I know that I‚Äôve got to somehow face it and get through it through positive thinking. Especially since a week from now I‚Äôve got a flight which I‚Äôve got to mentally prep for.

"First of all, try to clear your mind and get some rest. The worst thing that can happen is a lack of sleep. As for the worry about the hiking trip, you can face that problem tomorrow.
If you do not want to go, there is nothing forcing you to go. If you want to go, you can go. If you have any anxiety surrounding any problems that may happen, don't overthink things. Tell your friends or one friend so they may be able to provide assistance on your anxieties.

Tldr; my anxiety makes me feel like vomiting and I was wondering if IBS takes a part in it;


Hello everyone who stables upon my post, it's my first time writing in here because I never got the motivation and courage to seek a group of people like me(despite my girlfriend constantly pushing me to do it)

Sorry if this is not the type of post I should be doing but it's 4 am and I just had a very bad day.



It was a friend's bday so me and my girlfriend drove around 100km to their city in order to celebrate.

Celebration was totally what I did not do, I was already feeling a little nauseous because of the summer heat, but it was only after lunch that my anxiety decided to ruin my day.

I have a pretty weak stomach, and I'm kinda traumatized of feeling like vomiting because of certain stuff in my childhood.

After lunch we headed to the mall and I was feeling so bad that I spent around 2/3 hours in s bathroom stall. I was completely nauseous and my intestines hurt like hell, and to make matters worse (TMI) I couldn't do anything so I just spent time on my phone scrolling or playing some games to atleast distract me.

Meanwhile my gf was with my friends ( I couldn't bear the guilt of them getting their day ruined because of me.

When they decided to head home I mustered all the courage I could to got to them and say goodbye.

I felt like I was about to vomit while heading to the car. It feels weird to say this, and I know she will read it, but not even in the presence of my gf I felt ""safe"". I managed to drive us back, while having the window completely open cause the white noise was filling my mind and I was feeling better, although when she commented on something it would take me back to square zero and not even I could speak about it because my gag reflex would take the better of me.

I managed to drop her home and head for mine.

I went straight to my bedroom and rested for a bit.

When I woke up to go eat some dinner, I remembered something my gf told me about some time ago about irritable bowel syndrome. I searched it a bit and it is exactly what I feel. It either starts from me felling a bit sick or stressed, my bowels start to turn, I get increasingly stressed and so on...

Do you people share the same experiences? If so how do you cope with it and I'd there medication I can take to help with the bowel part?

I'm planning to speak about it to my psychiatrist in hopes of changing something but since it's weekend, I decided to vent out and ask here if you people have any info or tips.

Anyways, thank you for reading. It took me a lot to write this but I'm trying to keep my head up, despite this problem I constantly battle with. Love you all!"	VINCI_26	post	18.017798429601978	male	White	0.998609185218811	na	na	na	2	anxiety	no prediction.
"IBS or not nausea and vomiting can be an anxiety symptom. It can be a ‚Äúwhat came first, the chicken or the egg‚Äù senerio because your gut health can play a part in your mental health and vise versa. 

I was hit out of nowhere with a panic attack (at the time I had no idea what was going on) I threw up and experienced tons of dissociation and derealization. Little did I know it would last like that for 6 more weeks. I got put on some medication and it seems to be helping a tad. 

I honestly relate to when you referred to not feeling safe even with your gf with you. I‚Äôm lucky to have a gf that seems to understand quite a bit, but when I‚Äôm mentally unstable I don‚Äôt even feel comfortable in my own skin. 

Luckily if it is your gut health there should be an easy fix with the right doctors and right medication. Ither way you will get though this!"	VINCI_26	reply	na	na	na	0.998609185218811	no	strong	no	na	anxiety	no prediction.

"I know exactly what you mean. For me, it isn't as extreme. Sometimes when I am standing still, I can feel a sensation of something crawling on my arm or leg but when I check, there is nothing there.
I wouldn't say it is a hallucination of anything of the sort unless you were previously diagnosed with anything like that since this feeling happens to pretty much everyone.
If you have a fear of bugs, don't be worried as they are only disgusting but cannot harm you in any way. The worst a bug can do is bite you but you probably won't feel a thing.
Usually, the hair on your body touches your skin on an angle which gives the feeling of a bug's leg crawling. Unless that feeling moves anywhere, it's probably just a hair.

I have severe health anxiety, and to add on to that, I ACTUALLY have a medical issue that doctors are having trouble diagnosing. All they have been able to tell me is that something is wrong but they don‚Äôt know what. Today I woke up and about an hour later my heart started racing and I was almost uncontrollably squirming around and ready to rip my hair out. Literally the most terrible feeling in the world. I would take any amount of physical pain to rid myself of this disease. I have been stuck in a nonstop state of being short of breath, high heart rate, low heart rate, and a stomach ache which is increasing my heart rate even more. It feels like  I‚Äôm stuck in a pitch black cave with no direction on how to get out. My body is in fight or flight mode daily, and even prescribed Xanax doesn‚Äôt help that much. I‚Äôve tried meditation and other breathing strategies, but nothing seems to work. This all started when doctors suspected I had something wrong with my heart, but no tests showed any results of heart disease. This has led me down a dark path of misery and confusion as to what is happening to me. I live in a pretty remote town, and dysautonomia seems to be the obvious answer to all of this, but I have no access to any specialist near me. I called a neurologist which is 45 minutes away, and they cannot see me until February as a new patient. It‚Äôs absolutely exhausting living this way. I literally obsess about my heart and my breathing all day because they both are out of sync. I‚Äôve tried to see a therapist, but they were no help. She kept asking me if I have suicidal thoughts. Of course I don‚Äôt have suicidal thoughts. I‚Äôm a hypochondriac. I am literally terrified of death. Idk. I‚Äôm just trapped in a corner of misery and suffering. I have been driven to the point where I wish doctors would find something wrong with me so I can address it. I fear the unknown of my mysterious condition.	luke-777	post	24.532520263904868	female	White	0.9976949095726013	na	na	na	4	anxiety	no prediction.
"I hate to be this person, BUT the symptoms you described (unless you have more you didn‚Äôt disclose) can all literally be caused by anxiety. That may be why doctors can‚Äôt find anything wrong. My anxiety materializes as physical symptoms a lot, especially when I‚Äôm having an attack. Spontaneous racing heart, sudden nausea, shortness of breath, even waking up in a panic‚Ä¶ and when you obsess over it, it‚Äôll only become more out of wack because you‚Äôre freaking yourself out. Obviously I‚Äôm no doctor and if it‚Äôll make you feel better, try to get that doctors appointment in February (even if it‚Äôs a long way out) just for your peace of mind. But be aware (and I‚Äôm sure you are) it‚Äôs very possible that your anxiety is playing tricks with your body. I know it sucks, but I hope that can ease your mind! I have pretty bad healthy anxiety as well, and I just have to remind myself anxiety can present itself as physical illness.

Edit because I just thought of this: my brother has even worse medical anxiety than I do and his materializes as all kinds of different physical ailments. He would feel scraping in his stomach, thought his heart was beating irregularly or stopping, throat would tighten so he couldn‚Äôt breathe or swallow well, etc. Now he‚Äôs on Lexapro, and it‚Äôs all gone away.

I would love to think this way, but doctors have told me that my bradycardia is not a possible physical symptom of anxiety.

When I was in middle school I was bullied pretty bad. Nothing physical but mainly mental torture it felt like. The whole class would pick on me all at once and the teacher never stopped it, the people I thought were my friends would constantly use me as the butt of the joke and berate me when I said almost anything under the veil of it ‚Äúbeing a joke‚Äù. To be fair I was not too pleasant to be around. I was annoying, obnoxious, I would try too hard to be funny. General things like that. This was around 5-8 grade and it hurts everytime I remember it. I look at who I used to be with disgust. I‚Äôve basically tried to block out any remnants of my middle school self from who I am today. I‚Äôm a senior now and I‚Äôve definitely improved myself. I‚Äôve studied social cues and implemented them into my behavior, I‚Äôve started working out and generally taking care of myself more, and I‚Äôm overall vastly happier than I was five years ago. But there‚Äôs still this gnawing in the back of my brain. Any time I see people who knew me from middle school I tell myself that they hate me, even though they haven‚Äôt talked to me in over 5 years. I‚Äôve tried to tell myself that it‚Äôs all in my head but that does nothing for me. It feels like I have this constant yearning for validation. Like I want to prove to them (and likely myself) that I‚Äôm not at all the same person that I used to be. Its overwhelming sometimes. I like who I am now.

"Bullying absolutely sucks and can leave a lasting impression on a person. I don't think you should ever hate yourself over things that are out of control. From what I've read, you did nothing wrong so why should you blame yourself? Do not hate yourself.

Change the way you look at yourself. Nothing defines ""annoying"". If your friends made you believe that you were annoying, maybe they were toxic. Don't believe everything that others say. Other people do not define you.

Who cares if anybody hates you? It's their loss. Also, you are not alone in this feeling as many people are often wondering if others hate them as well. 

I certainly think you are a strong person because even though you were bullied, you were able to move on from the past and worked hard to better yourself. 

You cannot control how others think but you can, however control the way you think. The mind is a powerful tool that can either aid you or hurt you.

I for one think your self esteem is just really low. From what I've read, I've already come to the conclusion that you are a resilient and strong individual. Don't let others get the better of you.

"In my experience, It's pretty normal, like any other store. You can browse around in there and look at different bottles if you wish. You shouldn't be judged on whatever drinks you're buying. If you're buying a lot of hard liquor, you might get a bit of friendly small talk from the cashier saying ""big night planned?"" or something. It's rare, but it's happened to me a couple of times. Just be polite back and say yeah or nah, you can ask back if they've got much on too. It's all just friendly small talk.
Usually, that doesn't happen, so I wouldn't worry too much.

As for your ID, if it's legitimate, you've got nothing to worry about. They'll probably ask to look at it since you're only recently of age. Usually takes 2 seconds. Then you pay and get out of there.

I know this might be superstition but i always was a very worried person.I have ultimate fears and can never stop one untill i recive another fear.

A few months ago,i was scrolling on ""famous birthdays"" website and i saw the rapper named ""notti osama"" born January 17,2008 being stabbed to death in july 9,2022.I really didn't think too much about it since it's just one case.I was indeed shocked about the person having such a close birthday as mine.

Two weeks ago,i was watching YouTube and clicked on a recommended video of the documentory of a teen killer.Someone named tristyn bailey was stabbed 110+ times to death by a jealous classmate in may 9,2021.She was born in January 18 2008.

Me being born in January 15 2008 with a strong ability to correlate stuff immediately had fear go all over my body.Two big cases of teens being stabbed to death.Two very sad and disturbing cases.I just can't let it pass as a coincidence.The most ridiculous part is that I get to encounter both victims' news on the internet.And i get acces to both of their birthdays.Another thing,they were both killed by someone a year older than them

According to my logic,while someone born in jan 18 2008 was killed in may 9 2021,and someone born jan 17 2008 was killed in july 9 2022,i predict someone born in January 16 2008 to be stabbed to death in September 9th of this year.And it will be people born in my day being stabbed to death in November 9th 2024.

I have been told to not worry by my family,freinds and therapist but i'm such a thinker.No way I'm going to relax with this.If I plan to not leave home in November 9th 2024 I'd be stressed for over a year about this.If i search for the news in September 9th I'd be stressed for a month before this.

I really want to live longer than around 17 (presicley 16 years and 10 months) as I'm not enjoying being a teenager and want to see my change thorought the years.I want to live to an age people take my opinions seriously.I want to gain more life experience.There's no way I'm going to die so early.This curse is making me extremely nervous,sometimes wanting to throw up.Another thing,since they were both killed by someone a year older than them.Now i have fear of people slightly older than me.

I feel extremely pathetic to be a part of this killing plan set.It seems like I'm a peice of lego of the plan of people dying young. You see,i don't live in the states(where both victims live in)But i was BORN in the states.It seems like the curse has followed me the day since birth, because of my birth.It was planned to have a teen victim born a day before the previous one every year,and the news of the homiscide gotta be big(for the two cases i mentioned).The homiscide rate in the country i live in is real low especially for teenagers.So my death is gonna be big news for my country.Perfect case to make.Also i was warned by seing both victims' news but i can do nothing but worry.

"This is literally been going on week now since last Friday, but I randomly started feeling the urge to constantly yawn in order to get a full breath and every time I breathe I feel like I can't breathe.
Feels like my lungs aren't getting enough air. Started happening after I got anxious and I've had a very rough week.
 Noticed a stuffy nose and a cough and a wheezing.

I'm not any anxiety medication and I don't have asthma but I do have an albuterol inhaler...

So I had:
 Friday when it came out of nowhere after a stranger complimented me on my shirt. (Last Friday)


(Monday)
Incident at work, which resulted in me having a full blown meltdown and had to leave for the day.


Worrying about that the rest of the week.

i‚Äôm light skin and i know i don‚Äôt get a lot of sun so many it‚Äôs just that my hands are getting lighter and that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs more noticeable?

Visible or bulging veins are usually normal and not something to be worried about.

"Sorry for a long post, most people who know me know i suffer from anxiety/ panic attacks.  Here is a good read if you or someone you know also suffers from it.  

I hope this can help you out. 

**What is anxiety?**

Anxiety is a normal and often healthy emotion, characterized by feelings of worry, nervousness, or unease, typically about an imminent event or something with an uncertain outcome. However, when a person regularly feels disproportionate levels of anxiety, it can become a medical disorder. 

Anxiety disorders are the most common form of emotional disorder and can affect anyone at any age. They can include generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and various phobia-related disorders.

**What do people feel during an anxiety attack?**

Anxiety attacks, also known as panic attacks, are episodes of intense panic or fear. They can happen suddenly and without warning. Sometimes there's an obvious trigger‚Äî getting stuck in an elevator, for example, or thinking about the big speech you have to give ‚Äî but in other cases, the attacks come out of the blue.

Symptoms of a panic attack can include:

1. Rapid, pounding heart rate
2. Sweating
3. Trembling or shaking
4. Shortness of breath or feelings of choking
5. A feeling of impending doom or danger
6. Feelings of being out of control
7. Nausea or abdominal distress
8. Dizziness, lightheadedness, or faintness
9. Numbness or tingling sensations
10. Chills or hot flashes

These symptoms can be so severe that people often believe they're having a heart attack or other life-threatening health problems.

**What not to say to someone with anxiety?**

If you're trying to help someone with anxiety, it's crucial to be supportive and understanding. Here are a few things you should avoid saying:

1. ""Just calm down."" This phrase can make the person feel their feelings are being dismissed or minimized. Anxiety isn't something a person can simply switch off.
2. ""It's all in your head."" While anxiety is a mental health disorder, it's a real and serious condition. Statements like this can make the person feel invalidated or not taken seriously.
3. ""There's nothing to worry about."" Even if the situation doesn't seem worrisome to you, it's real and intense for the person experiencing anxiety.
4. ""Why can't you just be normal?"" This can make the person feel alienated and misunderstood. Remember, they can't control their anxiety, and it's not their choice to feel this way.

**How can you help someone having a panic attack?**

If you're with someone who's having a panic attack, here are some things you can do to help:

1. Remain calm: Your composed presence can reassure the person that they are not alone and that they are safe.

2. Encourage slow breathing: Hyperventilation can make a panic attack worse. Encourage the person to take slow, deep breaths, which can help slow the heart rate and promote relaxation.

3. Clear the area: If possible, help the person move to a quiet, less crowded place. This can help reduce additional stimuli and make it easier for them to focus on their breathing.

4. Use reassuring words: Remind the person that they're having a panic attack and it will pass. Reassure them that they're not dying or going crazy, common fears during panic attacks.

5. Encourage professional help: If the person is not already seeing a mental health professional, encourage them to seek help. Therapists and psychiatrists can provide diagnoses and personalized treatment plans, which might include therapy, medication, or both.

6. Practice patience: Remember that overcoming anxiety takes time and everyone progresses at their own pace. Be patient with the person's progress and continue to provide support along their journey.

7. Educate yourself: Understanding anxiety disorders can help you provide the right support. You might consider reading books, attending workshops, or even joining support groups for friends and family of people with anxiety disorders.

8. Encourage self-care: Stress management and self-care are important parts of managing anxiety disorders. Encourage the person to eat a balanced diet, get regular exercise, maintain a regular sleep schedule, and do activities they enjoy.

Remember, the best thing you can do when someone is experiencing a panic attack is to offer emotional support. It can be scary to witness a panic attack, but it's even scarier to experience one. Your calm, reassuring presence can make a big difference.

Anxiety disorders are generally treated with psychotherapy, medications, or both. Here are some of the most common treatment strategies:

**1. Psychotherapy:** This is a type of counseling that aims to reduce your anxiety symptoms.

- Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is the most effective form of psychotherapy for anxiety disorders. Generally a short-term treatment, CBT focuses on teaching you specific skills to improve your symptoms and gradually return to the activities you've avoided because of anxiety. CBT includes exposure therapy, where you gradually encounter the object or situation that causes your anxiety so you build confidence that you can manage the situation and anxiety symptoms.

**2. Medications:** Several types of medications are used to treat anxiety disorders, including those below. Talk with your doctor about benefits, risks and possible side effects.

- Antidepressants. These medications influence the activity of brain chemicals (neurotransmitters) thought to play a role in anxiety disorders. Examples include fluoxetine (Prozac), paroxetine (Paxil, Pexeva), and sertraline (Zoloft).
- Buspirone. This anti-anxiety drug, known by the brand name Buspar, is typically used to treat chronic anxiety and works by increasing serotonin in the brain.
- Benzodiazepines. In limited circumstances, your doctor may prescribe these sedatives for relief of anxiety symptoms. Examples include alprazolam (Xanax) and diazepam (Valium).

**3. Lifestyle changes:** Certain lifestyle changes can also help reduce anxiety, such as:

- Regular physical activity and exercise
- A healthy diet
- Adequate sleep
- Avoiding caffeine and alcohol
- Mindfulness and relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing, yoga, meditation, or tai chi.

**4. Complementary health approaches:** Some people find relief from symptoms of anxiety through methods such as acupuncture or hypnosis, though more research is needed in these areas. Certain dietary supplements, such as chamomile, lavender, and kava, have also been studied for their potential to reduce anxiety, but their effectiveness varies and they can carry risks, especially if combined with medications.

Remember, everyone is different, so what works well for one person might not work as well for another. It's essential to work with a healthcare provider to create a treatment plan tailored to your individual needs. Also, it's important to know that it's common to try several treatments or combinations of treatment before finding what works for you."

"I had just woken up and I have a friend with adhd who often throws stuff at me / tries to wind me up. He took my vape and chucked me a different one that was dead, so I threw the dead one as a joke but I kind of forgot his mega expensive massive TV was right in front of us and it hit it. He got pissed and went wtf why tf would you do that and I said sorry but I could feel myself about to cry so I got snappy / defensive when he started looking in places I knew it didn‚Äôt hit (it hit the corner and he was searching the middle) and was bluntly saying ‚Äúit didn‚Äôt hit it there‚Äù.

I grew up with a mum who shouted at me a lot / parents who fought really badly, and in school I was the golden quiet child and I still remember the couple of times I got in trouble and how soul crushingly humiliating they were.

I feel manipulative for crying. My friend made an off hand comment about how I got upset and *he* apologised and I was like no I did something wrong. I don‚Äôt do it out of manipulation, I just feel an overwhelming sense of shame and sadness when someone yells at me.

"It's a trauma response hun, there's not much you can do except work through it. It can take time, but I mean, I'm 23, and if someone yells at me I can usually handle it fine. But, it took a long time. What's helped the most aside from shadow journaling is being honest with people in my daily life. Clear communication, nothing more and nothing less. My husband, friends, and coworkers all understand that it makes me uncomfortable and they're mindful. 


If I was in your boots, I would talk to your friend and be honest. If they don't like what you have to say or argue, they aren't a very good friend. ""Hey, I wasn't trying to be manipulative when I cried the other day. I'm not sure if you thought that or not, but it was a worry of mine I wanted to put to rest. Now that that's out of the way, I cry when people yell at me due to a trauma response, I just don't feel safe when it happens/it brings up unpleasant memories"". Then tell your friend in whatever way is best to keep their voice down. A good friend will want you to feel safe and they will listen!


*I mentioned shadow journaling but didn't describe it. But it's basically addressing the shadow aspects of yourself you're uncomfortable with to try to heal.

"Yes, for sure. Earlier in my recovery, I would feel a sense of depression and hopelessness when I had a flare-up of symptoms. I would judge myself harshly and feel like I was broken because the anxiety was back. I would wallow and cry a lot. But this attitude was a form of resistance slowing down my recovery.

Now I try to practice Radical Acceptance. When I have a setback, I try not to view it as a judgment of my self-worth. I also try not to catastrophize it, like this means ""I'm not getting better."" 

It's important to realize YOU""RE the one who assigns meaning to things. And that holds so much power over your experience. So I try not to assign any meaning to the anxiety at all. It's not good or bad, it's just there. I try just to let the anxiety run its course (non-resistance) without any judgment of it or trying to push it away. I continue living my life and doing the things I love despite it being there.

"You face the fear and do it anyway. You're panicking when you leave the house because you're avoiding experiencing anxiety. By avoiding anxiety you're sending a message to your brain saying anxiety is a real threat, and that's what's keeping your anxiety alive. 

The only way out of this vicious cycle is to face the panic/anxiety head-on and allow yourself to experience it. In doing so, you will learn that although it's uncomfortable, it's temporary and you can cope. That's how you re-wire your brain to not fear anxiety anymore, and heal your anxiety long-term.

You can do it in baby steps. 

For example, start by challenging yourself with small steps like walk out of the house and around your property for 3 minutes. Do this every day and increase the time spent outside and distance from your house little by little. 

A therapist can help you build a program and support you while you do this. This is what I did. But I understand not everyone can afford it."	sabrinablon	reply	na	na	na	0.9991212487220764	no	no	no	na	anxiety	no prediction.
I had really bad anxiety myself to the point where I had panic attacks and I felt like passing out every time I left my house. Have you thought about taking medication? I've been on 50 mg of Zoloft and my anxiety has gotten a lot better. You have to Force yourself to get out of your house start by going to the grocery store and gradually push yourself to interact and be around people. If you can get a job that would great because it's going to force you socialize and get you out of your house. It's going to be hard but no matter how anxious you get you have to force yourself to face your fear.

"I suffered intense panic attacks for over 5 years. The first year was 24/7. Complete panic. 

Sucks to say but you can't fear panic attacks. They literally do nothing, although as you know it doesn't feel like that. Try facing it one step at a time doing little more each time, the key is when you're in panic mode. Don't leave. Don't run. Wait there till the panic lowers once it lowers then you can leave.

Flooding helps too. This is where you flood all the negative thoughts you're trying to stop and think of all the worst possible outcomes while having a panic attack.

Are you sure your BP is chronically elevated? There's something called white coat syndrome where your BP jumps when you measure it due to an anxious reaction -- often a self-fulfilling fear that it will be high.

Get a blood pressure cuff and practice having it measure your BP. Take deep breaths and relax before you take your BP, and experiment to see what lowers it for you.

"Sure, there are many healthy habits that will help that heart be healthy, and as humans, we should all mind and practice them.  However, I went through my own 'heart anxiety' and spent a lot of time researching and interviewing doctors on the subject. Luckily, I was able to rationalize myself out of my latest bout of anxiety ( I've had a long run of GAD), after running a few tests on my heart. This is also when I had to learn to trust the results (which were normal), instead of the little crazy guy in my head, who was the cause of my anxiety (that little man was me btw).  However, along the way, I learned a bunch of stuff related to the heart and how people with anxiety have these false expectations on what is ""normal"" - our circulatory system is constantly changing, so a quick reading of BP or heart rate doesn't really say anything, as it will change all throughout our day.

"TMI btw! 

I was diagnosed with GAD and IBS 10+ years ago. Obviously I know anxiety causes loose stools because I've felt the effects. Since I was a little kid and was nervous to go to school, I'd have to rush to the bathroom and bam ü´†

Anyways I went to the Dr today just to check in with my IBS and anxiety, I mentioned my worst anxiety/IBS symptom is the fact my stools smell really really bad, like that gross egg smell. He wasn't super concerned but he did say he wanted to test it for IBD and H Pylori. For as long as I can remember this has occured, and I assumed everyone that suffered loose stools from anxiety that there's would be the same? I mean who suffers from ""pleasant smelling loose stool"" üò≠ I'm very confused by the whole thing. 

Does anyone else's anxiety/IBS cause these terrible smelling stools? I honestly thought it was normal in people like me. Thanks."	FloatsAlong0	post	27.560543048427462	female	White	0.9993652701377869	na	na	na	2	anxiety	no prediction.

Yes and I have done since I was very little. I feel like my stomach and my brain are so delicately linked, If one is even slightly upset so is the other one. The bad smelling stools have happened to me since I was as young as 9-10 years old, always due to nerves. So I've always looked back and thought ok well if it was happening back then because of that then that's probably what is happening now. Stomach issues are scary, everything takes time and is invasive. Hopefully one day drs will have access to office tools that allow them to see so many more issues within their offices.

"I have been doing maldaptive dreaming since I was little. Now I realised it‚Äôs my coping mechanism to escape reality and imagine scenarios based on movies or shows. 

It has gotten to the point of me sometimes even acting it out secretly or just a lot of talking to myself but this is just a part of my life. The thing is when I stop maldaptive dreaming I realise that I will never experience anything like my scenarios. My life is boring, I have an alcoholic dad that is not emotionally present, a mom who works constantly. I am taking a gap year and I am scared that is only getting worse. I am obsessed with my scenarios and get depressed when I am grounded by the sad reality. 

I am honestly spiraling and dissociating so bad. I feel lonely, stuck in my head. It‚Äôs a hard habit to break since I‚Äôve been doing it for years in extreme levels. Most likely this was caused by my childhood trauma.

Hi, i‚Äôm not a therapist, but I would say daydreaming is your way to deal with your problems. It‚Äôs kind of an self protection to not get drown by all the stress. It‚Äôs the ‚Äúdelulu‚Äù. Sometimes I don‚Äôt even realise that I started talking to myself, making up scenarios and laughing or start crying about them. That‚Äôs totally fine. I would say as long as you don‚Äôt have hallucinations it‚Äôs okay and you shouldn‚Äôt worry about it too much. If you feel like it harms you, there‚Äôs no need to be ashamed of therapy. To be honest I wouldn‚Äôt say you would need medication. Maybe you could find other ways to deal with your problems together with a therapist.

"I've spent the last 10 years playing a long role play improv (d&d-like) game with my husband. It's a huge part of our life together and part of our best memories with each other. We talk about our characters like they are real people. It doesn't hurt anyone and it makes us happy.

I don't see anything wrong with what you are doing... Also if you wanted to do something with it you could write a book about those characters and adventures.

I'm writing a trilogy and a book of short stories about my adventures with my husband. Already have the first book out.

I remember I made up this new person who was the best version of myself. I pictured many hardships for her, but she was so strong and handled all of them without a hint of victimizing.

"Hey :) maladaptive daydreaming isn't necessarily a bad thing. I personally believe its a protection mechanism. With me I create a lot of different scenarios with the people in my life attempting to visualise situations before they happen. This allows me to generate a response to any kind of trauma that may happen. 
I use mantras to attempt to stop my overthinking and visualising; specifically ""water off a ducks back"" or ""what will be will be"".

Not to mention my other anxieties, the main one being I‚Äôm constantly worried of someone wronging me or someone or something from my past will come back to ruin me.

I just don‚Äôt know how much more i can take, i‚Äôm at the stage where i don‚Äôt want to live but i don‚Äôt know if i‚Äôm ready to die either."

"You really need to talk with a therapist if you aren't already.

I suffered with all the anxiety when I was younger than it really hit me the last decade or so. The best advice I got for my therapist is that at any moment all of us can really go, You're not in control and that's perfectly fine. Try to live a healthy lifestyle, the best you can, and enjoy your life.

Stop trying to seek reassurance, flooding helps as well. If you think something's wrong with you, really think everything that could possibly happen if you had that thing. It sucks during the moment but it really helps long-term when dealing with anxiety."	ApolloPhoenix454	reply	na	na	na	0.9961967468261719	weak	strong	no	na	anxiety	no prediction.
"I know how you feel. It‚Äôs incredibly hard to deal with nonstop anxiety. You should reach out for help. There are legitimate strategies you can learn that will help you. First start with the things you have immediate control over. Exercise can have a significant effect on anxiety and depression. Even light cardio. Get outdoors if possible. Try to eat healthy. Your diet is important to your mental health. Also make sure you are getting quality sleep. My anxiety makes it hard for me to sleep well but I have good sleep hygiene to make sure I‚Äôm doing everything I can.

Next, find a good therapist. They can teach you strategies like cognitive behavioral therapy specifically for anxiety. This helps most people who learn it. Finally, find a prescriber and consider getting on a medication. I will warn you, there are a lot of bad prescribers out there. Some will try to put you on meds you don‚Äôt need. This has happened to me. Find a prescriber that has a good rating on google.

This is going to take some work but do not give up. You are young and have a long life ahead of you. You can overcome this but you have to be willing to do the work."	ApolloPhoenix454	reply	na	na	na	0.9961967468261719	weak	strong	no	na	anxiety	no prediction.

"I'm sorry you're dealing with this health anxiety can be debilitating. But a lot is in your control to at least ease your symptoms. 

- First, stop Googling. This is a super important step to get health anxiety under control. 
- Second, stop checking your body. This sometimes compulsive behaviour is what perpetuates health anxiety. 
- Third, start engaging with the world even when you're feeling anxious. Try getting out, seeing friends, and doing new activities. The goal is to get out of your head!
- Fourth, share your feelings with a close friend or family member. Don't suffer in silence. Share your experience with someone you know who cares about you.

If these seem overwhelming, please seek the help of a counsellor or therapist for support. What you're struggling with is very treatable."	ApolloPhoenix454	reply	na	na	na	0.9961967468261719	strong	no	no	na	anxiety	no prediction.
"You are not alone. I have been experiencing the same exact types of anxiety. In my post history you can see I recently posted in AskDocs thinking I had tetanus from washing a rusty bowl. It made me mad for weeks, and I was literally fired from my job for it. 

My best advice is to take steps to address it is to get in touch with a therapist, *do not Google symptoms*, and find ways to distract yourself when the anxiety hits. For example, if you start to panic because you think you have a disease, take a drive, take a shower, cook a meal. Remind yourself that a *truly deathly unwell* person could not do these things with any amount of ease.

It‚Äôs taken a while to come to this conclusion, and when I say everybody I don‚Äôt mean that in a paranoid psychotic episode ‚Äúeveryone‚Äôs out to get me!‚Äù Type thing. I mean like, whenever I have close friends or partners or colleagues for some reason I can never be fully trusting of them and I always feel like at some point they have bad intentions towards me. I‚Äôm super hyper vigilant and observant and also sensitive (anxiety lol) and I always seem to find a way to turn scenarios or things ppl say into some form of ‚Äúthey are being fake/deceitful/ don‚Äôt wish the best for me/ are going to hurt me/ don‚Äôt care ab me‚Äù. It‚Äôs totally exhausting. I‚Äôm the type of person to have concrete exteriors and refuse to be treated poorly so I end up cutting off a lot of ppl who have done me wrong which I guess isn‚Äôt a bad thing, but I‚Äôve protected my peace so much that I feel lonely and that maybe I overthink a lot of things that aren‚Äôt actually advanced to ‚Äúdo me dirty‚Äù.

"I quit my job last years due to my health (both physical and mentally). I will be having a new job this coming Tuesday and im so nervous. Trying to following all the techniques but still‚Ä¶ the anxiety is still doing their jobs. I known this will happened because i can be worried about anything. It‚Äôa getting better than how i was but it‚Äôs never go away. I also got bullied and teasing while i was at the previous job which traumatizing me still today.  I am not a dummy but im kind of worried on that. 

Anyone having the same issues? How do you guys cope with anxiety in the new work environment? I hate myself for always think that people dont like me or i will always picking some words from others and thought about it in a negative ways towards myself. I tried not to think about it but i really think the brain is doing its job. When I stop worried about one think, i will always move to others."

Basically as title says, I freak out and stress and worry and have very anxious behaviors if there‚Äôs something that I have to do (for example: today, I have to go to work at 2, and  if there‚Äôs other things I want to do I know I have to prepare myself at least 2-3 hours ahead of time to have everything ready by the time that task that‚Äôs going to  happen actually does happen. ) And I actually get ready to leave for work or for that task way ahead of time, but I still can‚Äôt do anything but wait. :(	alleycat0_0	post	12.791781982198989	female	White	0.9993621706962585	na	na	na	1	anxiety	no prediction.
"As the post says, my anxiety is ruining my life and a host of opportunities for me. Aside from just having anxiety, I also have a definite anxious attachment style and no self esteem.

This week I was offered a new job - about 10% pay increase and a week more PTO. My friend already worked on this team and recommended it to me. I honestly was interested/clear minded until it came to the point of almost getting the offer. At that point I was in full blown anxiety - having dark thoughts about myself, wishing I could just get out of the situation, and clinging to what I know - my current job. I kept picturing myself getting fired from this new position or just not being smart enough to learn it. I ultimately ended up being offered and then declining the job. Now that it‚Äôs a done deal, I‚Äôm back to being clear headed and angry with myself.

I don‚Äôt want my life to stay the same way forever but change is absolutely terrifying to me. I was this same way when I almost adopted a puppy last winter. The puppy was precious but all of the sudden I started just wishing I could disappear to get out of the decision. I started thinking of all worst case scenarios - what if she hurts my boyfriends cat, what if my boyfriend won‚Äôt let me come over with her anymore, etc.

I feel like I don‚Äôt become clear minded until the situation is over. And then it just adds to my low self confidence because I don‚Äôt trust my own judgment or self to make a decision."	Klutzygirl101	post	31.001636024923815	female	White	0.9990591406822205	na	na	na	5	anxiety	no prediction.
"Hi, are you on meds? If not, have you thought about it?

"Okay, it's important to understand how anxiety works. It's all coming from having low tolerance of uncertainty. That's all there is to it. To stop it, you must avoid all reassurance seeking and being too safe regarding your fears. Do remember that too much comfort results in becoming more sensitive to discomfort. 

The best technique how to work with specific fears is ERP. The way to practice that is, if you're for example scared you might get fired as you said, you should first accept the you might indeed get fired. And at the same time don't tell yourself you won't. This includes reassurance seeking. Always avoid reassurance seeking, that's probably the biggest factor that keeps feeding anxiety. Don't try to for example search for clues about how likely it is if you get fired or not. The whole point is keeping yourself in uncertainty regarding your fears. That way you will slowly get used to uncertainty, making the anxiety stop as a result. 

Do you understand the logic of this? I can explain further if not. 

And about meds and side effects, this is usually treated with antidepressants and possible side effects tend to be mild and more importantly they happen only during the first two weeks and then they stop. Also you can quit right away if you had some bad reaction to it and it that case it would stop quickly, so you're not really risking anything. But I understand you're scared since you're suffering from anxiety."	Klutzygirl101	reply	na	na	na	0.9990591406822205	weak	no	no	na	anxiety	no prediction.

"hello! 

this just randomly happened out of the blue but for some reason it feels like my lungs arent getting enough oxygen and i constantly have to take deep breaths which are usually unsatisfying. i also keep yawning SO MUCH for some reason. i cant tell if this is anxiety related or heart related. it doesnt wake me up at night like i'll fall asleep normally and wake up fine. i did an x-ray and the results were normal. and i feel this all the time throughout the day.

ive never known if i had anxiety but its concerning since its a constant feeling throughout the day
