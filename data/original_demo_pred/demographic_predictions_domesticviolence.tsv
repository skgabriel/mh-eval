"Hi.

I left my abuser one year and a half ago. I found out he is doing great, great job, lost weight, started a sport. 

Meanwhile I am healing, yes, but after having so many panic attacks that I almost lost my job, I wanted to kill myself till a dr diagnosed me with ptsd. I'm with meds now and I'm seeing the light at the end of the tunnel. I'm starting to be happy again. I'm really well and I can't believe how far from the old sad version of me I am.

But I feel anger, because I feel like this is not fair, why am I the one who has to be with meds to function like a normal person and he is happy? He tried to kill me for the love of god and he is there, without any punishment. Why? I don't know how to deal with that. Sometimes I just want to face him in the middle of the street and yell at him THIS IS NOT FAIR, YOU TRIED TO KILL ME, YOU STRANGLED ME, YOU BEAT ME AND YOU HAVE TO BE PUNISH. I'll not do it, even if I want to I live in a society that says ""well you must've do something to deserve the violence "". But I can't deal with this in a healthy way, my way of dealing is imagining I yell at him, I punish him. 

The other day I read a book and one story was about a girl who found out her abuser has a new girlfriend, so she follow them and then tell this new gf that he was a violent person and all the truth. Sometimes I fantasize with that too, and I'm afraid of losing my mind and actually do something like that."

Abusers aren't happy people. Bet on it. Even if things look lovely for him right now, especially from the outside--he'll fuck it up. The same (probably metaphorical) demons that made him hurt you are still inside him. You can't see them anymore...but he still can.

"I feel you. I was diagnosed with PTSD and decided to leave my job a year ago because I could barely function. Panic attacks, flashbacks, anxiety, depression. He’s now married, in a new city, with a baby on the way. I moved back to my smaller hometown and live with my mother at 33. It was a huge step back for me in my life and his life, well, just kept moving forward. Onto bigger and better things for him. 

I’ve had this same fantasy about telling his new wife. But it wouldn’t make a difference. We can’t warn everyone they come across for the rest of their lives. 

I’m forever changed by the abuse I experienced. Not just my soul, but my brain was physically changed. The psychic pain from the PTSD is sometimes hardly bearable. It comes and goes. But when it comes, I’m frozen for a day or so. Unable to do much of anything. 

How to deal with knowing they are happier? Or if not happier, not as affected? I’m not sure. I’ve never been a religious person but if there is a God, I’ll have a few choice things to say to him. 

I can’t see myself ever being with a man again. I wouldn’t mentally or emotionally survive being abused  a second time. 

The closest avenue I’ve gotten to for dealing with the unfairness is spirituality. Trying to believe in some higher power. Idk what that is exactly, but I try to look for it every day. 

We can heal. He won’t. We just have to keep going. And know that one day things will be better for us."	A1300R	reply	na	na	na	0.01088479720056057	weak	strong	no	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.

"I couldn't believe it when I daw these words appear across my phone screen. I've been gone for almost 3 months now. I took our baby, with our stuff, and I went to live with my mom. He has continued to say and do some very hurtful things during the separation, but he has never once tried to get me back. He's never once texted me that he misses me. He does come over to my mom's to see our daughter about 3 times a week, but we don't speak unless it's about our daughter. Just recently I posted to reddit wondering why he wasn't trying to fight for me or get me back and then a few days ago he says this

""You think there is any hope for us?""

"I had a rebound non-relationship soon after, basically just for the physical stuff.  I did tell him that I left an abusive relationship so he knew my boundaries.  

Later on when I met my husband, on our first date, I told.him about the traumatic past, which he felt really sad for me.  Through the 15 years we've now been together (13 years married), he's heard more details and held me through a few panic attacks (not caused by him).  He's truly been my rock!

"Never stop seeking to heal, but my experience is disclosure won't help. When I tell men about being abused, they abuse me next. Men think domestic violence victims are no longer worthy of affection, love or value as women or as mothers. ""damaged goods"" are priceless to God, not men. Even my brothers see me as ""weak"" and wouldn't protect me to save the world.

"I'm not sure if this is the right place to ask this. So I left my abuser 6 years ago. He was a very physically and emotionally abusive man. In that time I've done a lot of healing, but still have more to do. In those 6 years I avoided men like the plague though. Then I met someone by accident. He is a good man, but I think I messed it up with him. There are trauma responses and triggers that hadn't really shown up since I swore off relationships. I trusted him and was more open with him about my past trauma than I've been with anyone else including my friends and family. I guess I thought doing that would help him understand if I got triggered and tried to push him away, had trouble communicating, and had difficulty showing emotions. I tried not to do those things, but when I messed up and had a trauma response I apologized right away and tried to explain why. But I think I pushed him away for the last time since he's stopped communicating. I think the hardest thing is knowing I hurt him that bad
My question is though why does emotional pain hurt so much worse? Like if I could trade in the heart break and emotional pain for a beating I would in an instant. Has anyone else on their healing journey felt this way? Is it because that's the pain I was accustomed to for so long?  I guess I just want to know I'm not the only one and that I'm not crazy"	Technical_Ad_8917	post	31.04384280376391	female	White	0.9892531037330627	na	na	na	3	domesticviolence	no prediction.
"Hey. That’s really heavy I can’t relate to wanting physical over emotional harm but have thought about suicide because of emotional harm and I guess that’s similar (emotional pain avoidance and self destruction sabotage).

I feel like we need to work on our self esteem when healing from this. Either he’s hurt bad and healing or he’s also not as good a guy as he could be and just decided not to be there for you, either way, he’s not there. Sometimes letting people walk away imo is a good healing for us, knowing we can stand tall alone and live a good life with or without someone who thinks we are easy to leave behind.

I’d seek therapy so this relationship or your next one feel more stable and can be on better footing, to also help you with trauma responses and taking on more than your share of emotional burden. Usually best not to blame yourself exclusively for a break up, and don’t ever worry about his heart more than your own. Tend to yourself first. Be willing to leave people who leave you.

Hey, just know you’re a better person than your abuser. Your abuser also took out emotional trauma on you but most likely didn’t care. You’re an amazing person for recognizing how your past effects others and for caring. I’m sorry I don’t have an immediate answer for you. Therapy is thrown around so much but isn’t necessarily a cure all for everything. I hope you can find something to heal your wonderful self.

I am planning on leaving soon. I have contacted a shelter and I am working on finding somewhere for my dogs. When I leave it will be while he is at work. My question is how do I tell him?

I don’t ever want to get back together with him but I’m scared to say that to him.	babyisback	post	30.630885775985423	female	White	0.9968792200088501	na	na	na	25	domesticviolence	failed

 If you’re not planning on coming back, you have no reason to speak to him again. I understand the urge to explain and justify, but the way I saw it when I left the marriage, if all those years of trying to reason with him didn’t work, why would one last conversation change anything? It wouldn’t. You’re the one leaving, but he’s been checked out for a long time.

If he starts stalking you you tell him WITH other people in the room. Preferably police, and preferably you with the police and the ex over the phone. **It is NOT EVER SAFE TO BREAK UP WITH A ABUSER.**

Don't say anything. Be prepared if he uses Craigslist, some posters share addresses of domestic violence shelters. Police and hospitals know every address. When men show up there, they kick women and children out so they are vulnerable again. It happened to me.

Since you have a child together, after you're safe at the shelter, send him an email or text to let him know that you and your child are not coming back.  That way he can't file missing person report on you and baby.  Also tell him that the dogs are safe (if you're able to find a temporary home for them like foster care).  Don't tell him anything else.  File for divorce immediately so he can be served.  Also file for a protection order so he can't contact you.  Don't block his number or email, in case you need it in court to prove that he's violent and unfit for child custody.  But make sure you do not engage in a conversation nor tell him about your location.	babyisback	reply	na	na	na	0.9968792200088501	weak	no	no	na	domesticviolence	failed

"Keep in mind you will have:   (FOG) Fear Obligation and Guilt.

Research this and understand you dont OWE an abuser anything. Even an explanation.

If an abuser cared, they wouldn't be abusing you in the 1st place.

He will not even be able to comprehend why you would have the audacity to leave his wonderful presence.  

How dare anyone leave the abuser is their thinking.  Get back in line is HOW THEY THINK. THEY ARE TWISTED.

 Lets keep this real. You are brave by leaving. Don't let him destroy YOUR future you need to create for yourself and your baby. 

\#2 If the abuser really cared about you, he wouldn't be hurting the mother of her baby.

When an abuser loses control of the target (they choose to abuse) this drives them over the edge, and they become very dangerous.   

They literally can become out of control and very unstable.  

They are unstable anyway to be acting abusive so take away the one TARGETED, who is supposed to be carrying their b.s. baggage is a no-no to them.  They FLIP OUT. 

YOU ARE THERE TO REGULATE HIS EMOTIONS SO NEVER TELL HIM ANYTHING.  

  Hes a big boy he can handle it.  He did this.  Let him figure it out!

Some judges grant joint custody even to an abuser so that may impact how you interface with him (specifically that you’ll probably have to be face to face with him again maybe in a court at some point).

"Unfortunately when you try not to report it because you feel bad about what will happen to him, to them that says, okay, I can get away with at least this much without serious repercussions, so the next time will be as bad if not a little worse, and it escalates from there. There will be a next time. There’s always a next time. 

I called the police on mine several times, in several different states. He always met them on the porch, to catch them before they spoke to me, had a little man-to-man discussion, where he told them I did this all the time, I had anger management issues, and a tendency to be dishonest, in and out of treatment, wink-wink, eye-roll. By the time they got to me they had already decided I was the problem. 

The 4th time I called the police, I finally got some support, they didn’t arrest him, or making leave mind you, they suggested I take my two kids to a hotel to “let him sober up”, but I was told how to get an order of protection, which I did that same day. Filed for divorce the following week. 

It takes a long time to recover from trauma like this, but I promise you, once you’ve been no-contact for 3 or so months, you’ll have a whole new understanding of what you’ve been through. Because it’s so close to you, you can’t see it for what it is, but after there’s some distance, one day you’re going to wake up literally and say “what was I thinking?”, and all those red flags that everyone else saw will be crystal clear. Doesn’t mean you’re done feeling bad, it just changes the way you interpret the grief.

He made me lay with him holding me and crying that I must hold him and tell him I love him.  If I call the cops he will be in jail for a long time and I am torn. I’m a mess and I know it.

"I'm Sorry that this may not be the right place for this but I'm looking for help understanding the Ohio Stay at Home Program. Any help / advice would be appreciated.

 I have been in a relationship for about 8 months now and we have started talking more about our future together. We were recently talking about houses. She told me early on she owned her home. The next day I was on Zillow looking at houses in different areas around our city. Just seeing what homes are currently priced at and doing some daydreaming. I looked up my house and her house to see what the values were and noticed her house has recent rental but not sale history. I looked at the auditor website and it says the same people have owned the home for over 2 decades.

 I asked her about it and she said it was because she was in a program to hide her address from an abuser.  I have no reason to believe she wasn't abused. I very much believe she was in a very bad relationship about a decade ago and what she went through still affects her today. The thing is though,  I am having trouble making sense of what I am seeing and what the program is said to involve. The program mentions an alias and a po box. Wouldn't there  be some record of the house being sold?  Does it make sense with the Stay at home program that the auditors website would just continue to show the previous owner? Is there a different privacy program where this could make sense? I asked the auditor if they could confirm if their information was correct and they emailed me back stating that they had no record of the house being sold since 2001.  Mail comes to her house with her name and the house address on it.  She is registered to vote under her name and current address.  Her Instagram was public and she uses her real name across social media.  She seems like a really great person. I love her. I am worried she isn't being honest with me. I'm sure I have some trust issues from previous relationships. I really wanna sort this out and try to move forward."

Not sure if this is the sub to ask these questions in. I know dv victims are usually experts on property law. /s I don’t own a home so I can’t tell you about the specifics of the safe at home laws. I do know it’s confidential information so for the safety of everyone involved in that program talking to her should be the only way a random person should be able to get that information.  I do know the laws protect public records from including information about sales and ownership for participants in the program. They tightened that up in 2022 to allow for even more confidentiality and greater penalties to any government agency who releases information without the consent of the participant. Could not tell you what that means for what Zillow will show. Her name being attached to social media has nothing to do with the property ownership or whether or not she was in an abusive relationship 10 years ago. If you want to move forward be honest and upfront about your reservations and where they come from and don’t bring up her having a Facebook profile as damning evidence. Ask her more about the program not a support group for dv survivors. You can keep emailing government agencies but if she’s involved in the program they will not and should not tell you anything.

I appreciate you responding. You kinda miss quoted me but close enough I guess.  I was hoping someone familiar with the program may have some insight. I wasn’t  looking for an expert on property law. I have asked her and she said she would show me the deed if I wanted. I said yes that would be nice. She didn’t and that was a week ago. I asked again today, after she asked if I had seen a planner around the house, and  she said she was busy and hadn’t had time to even sit down for one second.  I didn’t mention Facebook but since you did, there is a post about her signing a two year lease on the house. I am not a random person to the people involved ( I understand I am to you). I apologize if I made you think that was the case. Do you live in Ohio and are familiar with the program? Thanks!

"You are a random to the people who work for the government agency you’re reaching out to for information on whether or not the house has been sold. If they gave every boyfriend reaching out to ask about the information on victims they would be and should be penalized for violating the program that was created to protect people. If you can’t figure out if she actually owns it and she’s in the program and does own the property that means it’s working. If she isn’t in the program that means she’s lying. You shouldn’t be able to find that answer on your own and if she isn’t showing you the deed and you have a bad feeling then stick with it without asking a support group for their insight. No one besides a participant in the program that bought a house or lawyer or government official would be able to provide any more information beyond that. If you can’t trust this woman then there are other problems in the relationship and I have no idea whether this random woman is lying to you. you mentioned having her name attached to her social media in the op. I just used Facebook as an example. I do live in Ohio. I did not join the program I have not bought a house and I rent from family and my ex is dead so my housing issue sorted itself out lol. I still don’t think this is the appropriate subreddit for these questions. I feel like you made your mind up and I’m not going to accuse a random woman of lying about owning a house after you’ve already done your snooping and made your own conclusions when I don’t know the full story and you don’t either. If she won’t show you the deed then ok move forward as you wish to. Don’t try to email auditors and shit trying to catch her in a lie. Just go with your gut or don’t worry so much about it.

Also the fucking lease thing like just dump her don’t be weird and resentful and try to snoop you clearly know how you feel this is just so not the appropriate group to try to get validation for because hypothetically let’s say she is lying about owning property that is weird but also not fucking dv or the point of the group.

Hi guys this is all new to me but a few nights ago me and my ex bf now got into a terrible fight in the car and ended up with him socking my arm several times and leg which became big bruises . I reported him that same night even tho it hurt me deep inside and signed for an arrest . My emergency protective order ends soon and I’m willing to drop the charge even if it hurts me because I don’t want him to serve time . I spoke to the police and they said they will not drop the charge and it’s up to the state . I’m assuming I expect a court date soon and I don’t wanna be in the same room as him . What can I expect ?

The first and best thing you can do for him and for you is to read this book:

The author has been counseling abusive men for decades, and his advice is the gold standard. I strongly, strongly encourage you to open that link and read the whole thing.

Where are you located? Since Reddit doesn’t allow links,  and you likely won’t find someone willing to donate anonymously, I would suggest calling the women’s shelters in your area.

"OP, if you are in the US you can go to this website and enter your zip code. You will be shown a list of the DV Shelters in your area, along with their phone number. Call and ask to speak with an advocate. They will help you create a safe exit plan which will include helping you find work and/or job skills along with a safe place to live, help moving and all that you will need to begin a new life. Don’t hesitate to call them! It is well recognized that domestic abuse is far more than the physical damage that can be seen and measured by the eye. Your pain is real, your danger is real, and they will hear you and validate your experiences. 

If you live in Canada I believe there is a link on that web page to the DV Hotline in Canada. 

For other countries go to the top of this sub and click on where it says ‘Resources’ I believe there are hotlines for other countries listed there.

Yes, I did but it was not positive kind of attention. It was from other other abusive men or men who I thought were my friends until they wanted to try to take advantage of my situation(I was homeless and living in a hotel at the time) by offering me a place to stay in exchange for sex or sexual favors. I stayed in the hotel because I didn't want to be used or abused again. I actually had to file a PPO against a man who I had thought was my friend because he was using my vulnerable time after I left to try to blackmail me into giving him sex. Once I had found my own apartment I had to start over from scratch so he offered me free dishes, a microwave, etc. I accepted them and afterwards he said that I owed him sex.

Clearing brain fog might be a really good first step. You may need to read other stories of abuse survivors and the abusers and the counselor that was trying to rehabilitate them. Most abusers did not rehabilitate at all in any capacity. Some victims couldn’t either.

"@survivedtothrive on tiktok. This is a “reenactment “ of a code used by the police department when you have an abuser with you and you can’t talk freely but you need some help. Most place departments have been trained to identify this kind of trouble and send help. Other videos like this can be found under the creators  account. 

 I am an extreme domestic violence survivor at now I have a coach other survivors. It is an easy leaving but there is so much more help out there than there ever has been before so take it vantage of it and leave a soon as you can. 
Abusers only get worse with time. They never get better and they will hurt you in ways you didn’t even imagine. 

It’s hard for us to wrap our brain around the fact that somebody could do these things because we never would. Nobody is excluded. This happens to the rich, poor, educated, enabled or disabled, young or old, heavy or thin, and absolutely no matter what you look like.

I know we’ve been taught to stay so our children grow up with two parents but those teachings were wrong. Leave for your children. Even if you think you’re hiding it they still have an awareness.

If you are being hurt please reach out to your local Domestic Violence shelter,  www. RAAIN.com or the national domestic violence hotline.org please be safe

I know I need to leave but it’s so hard to want to leave when things are going well. When things are bad all I want is to be safe and free. But when things are good I love him so much and the thought of life without him is unbearable.

What helped me was to realize that I had it backwards. 
I thought the real person was the nice, loving, kind person I was in love with.
And that the angry, mean person was not the real him.

In reality, the real him was the angry, mean, awful person that I occasionally saw. The good person was just a performance to hide his true nature.

"I basically forced my own hand. First I called all my friends and family and told them what was happening (no more shame or secrets—but it would make it harder to change my mind later and stay). A bunch of people helped me out by sending some money, and I immediately paid a lawyer with it (now it’s even harder to change my mind, because I took the money and signed the contract). Then I toured apartments and rented one (no turning back now! Good luck getting out of a lease!) Also had to get the light turned on, get some furniture in there, etc… Each step made changing my mind harder.

I didn’t tell him we were leaving until I had a safe place to take my kids. Honestly, between the “line in the sand” event (he threatened to kill me, the kids and then himself— shortly thereafter he hit me for the first time) and the day I took the kids and left, about two months had gone by. By then, if I hadn’t told everyone, borrowed money, and made all those financial commitments, I probably would have backpedaled. Not because I loved him or wanted to be with him, but because leaving was scary and hard and I kept putting it off “until next year” or whatever.

Even by the time I was leaving (and even still today sometimes) there’s that little voice in my head (“he only hit me once and it didn’t hurt *that* much…” “maybe he was just really frustrated, he’d never really hurt us…”). But, by then the die was cast and the lease, divorce filing, electric contract, etc, etc…were all signed.

"I was stuck in that same loop for almost a year.  One day the ex sent me to borrow money from his step father, who knew of the situation.  He and I didn't usually have one on one conversations so it was a rare opportunity for him to ask me ""is this really how you want to live the rest of your life?"" 

It was truly a wake up call that I needed.  Plus I had recently attempted to take myself out of the world and failed, which to me already made me believe that it was my second chance to make things right.  

Fueled with his words in my mind, I began to think of how and when I would leave.  And committed to it.  When I left, I made sure to put thousands of miles between me and him.  

Honestly, leaving him was the best decision I've ever made.  I wouldn't be where I am now if I didn't leave.

"Hey OP. I posted this earlier, and I think it might help you stay motivated to leave. Wishing you all the best! 

If You’re Thinking of Leaving or You Want to Call Your Abuser, Make A List

I think most of us have been here. Wondering if we should leave, I mean we know it’s bad but is it really THAT bad? Or we are separated, have escaped but we are being love bombed by a pro, and we MISS that person SO MUCH! Right? We can so easily forget, for a few, critical moments, the hell we endured and make a call we could spend years regretting. 
Here is what you need to do. Sit down with a pad of paper. If possible make it a legal pad. Fold it in half long ways, so you have two columns, ok? On the top of the left column write ‘Negative’ and on the top of the right column write ‘Positive’. Now comes the hard part. Start to write down every single bad thing your abuser has ever done to you. Each memory or event gets its own line, alright? Each name they called you gets its own line. Each lie, each shitty statement, each slur, bullshit story, every lazy-assed excuse. No doubling up with hash marks. If they called you a name 4 times, then friend, that’s 4 lines. Every assault, each bruise. If they did something really nice, but you found out later it was to manipulate you? It gets listed in both columns. Have a box of tissue near by, because doing this will hurt, Ima not going to lie. What usually happens, what definitely happened to me anyway is that a whole mess of memories came flooding back that I had managed to bury. It was not pretty. When you get to the bottom of the page start a whole new page, ok? keep going until there are no more memories left. Then do the same thing with the Positive memory column.

What you are going to find is this: Pages and pages of shocking, violent behavior, written in YOUR HAND. Once you see it is extremely hard to ignore. Pages of reminders that there are damn good reasons to stay far away from this person. Reasons that you do not want to call and just hear their voice. Reasons that you don’t give a damn what they are doing now, as long as they are far away from you!  Reasons that you do not want your children to grow up listening to the words on those pages as they are screamed at you, or seeing you treated as you have been on those pages. They will grow up thinking that is normal, and that is what love means, when we know that this is so very far from love and care.

What makes you feel empathy for your abuser? So many reasons, I would imagine. You are a naturally caring and empathetic person, and they are adept at manipulating the people around they are adept at getting their needs met. He or she is a con artist, and as such they pay keen attention, sensing the weaknesses of others and exploiting them. Abusers are ruthless enough to choose women who are mothers, and men who have experienced loss or trauma which make them vulnerable. They enjoy the sense of power it gives to hurt them and create as much fear and confusion as they can. This is not love, OP. This is coercion and emotional abuse.

Whenever you are tempted to contact your abuser?  Pull out your list and look at it. REALLY take it in, every line. The sorry showing of positive things next to the list of horrible fearful hurt that you have had to absorb. That is imbedded deep inside you. That this person dared call love. 

I want to give you all a very hard earned gift: When the abuse started in my marriage I stayed. I sounded very similar to many of you, I was so in love. He was my soulmate, and I just ‘knew’ that somehow things would get better, because he would always promise to do better. He would promise to change. So I stayed. However things did not improve, and everything kept getting worse, and got scarier. Over the years my son and I learned how to be silent, be still until we knew what kind of mood Daddy was in when he came home. We learned to walk on egg shells. By the time I finally escaped I was almost broken, but I thought I had been successful in protecting my son from harm.  I didnt realize that until years later, when he had his first serious relationship as an adult that I was dead wrong. I watched in horror as he became involved with a woman who was just abusive as hell, and when I said something to him he just smiled and said “Dont worry Mom, it really isnt that bad. I know that she can change. She wants to do better.” I wanted to cry. The years they were together were a snapshot of my life with his dad. By staying I had taught him to be a perfect domestic violence victim. Dont make the same mistake I did. Take that list out. Look at it, then look at your son, your daughter. Look at yourself, ok? Believe that you all deserve better than that list, than that poor assed excuse offered up as love. because that is not love, dear hearts. That is abuse."	babyisback	reply	na	na	na	0.002907747868448496	weak	strong	no	na	domesticviolence	failed
"I left my abuser back in February of this year. It was difficult because I was going back to a nightmare I've been trying to escape for years. I've been back for only about 6 months and I'm right back where I started with the beauty of added trauma I did not have before.

After all I went through, it's painful to think that I'm suffering in greater ways than I ever did with the man who lied to me to get me to trust him. A man who promised to help me. A man who used to strangle me during every single fight. A man who tried to kill me every argument. A man who made me pick which knife he was going to kill me with. A man who held the knife to the side of my neck. A man who threw me out of his moving car into the streets far away from where he lived so I couldn't come back. A man who threw me outside in the cold in only a camisole, capris, no bra, and one shoe in the dead of winter. A man who told me his plan of what he would do with my body after he killed me (cut me up an toss me away piece by piece, kill himself so he doesn't get in trouble, eat and store what he could from my corpse). A man who made me help him pick the lock, chains, and cuffs to keep me restrained so I could never escape when he was away, working, or sleeping. A man who isolated me and forbade me from talking to my little sisters so long that one of them forgot me due to how young she was when I left and the other genuinely believed I wasn't coming back and forgot all about her. My baby girl even said she was going to get the boxes of things I had to leave behind and bring them into her room so the raccoons and rain couldn't damage them anymore because mother had dragged all my belongings out of the home.

I left because I knew, without a doubt, he was going to kill me one day. We had devolved to him starting a fight every single day. I walked on eggshells to prevent them, but they still happened because he always wanted them to, We reached a point where him strangling me was a regular, common, sure thing during *every single fight*.

I wasn't afraid to die. I just didn't want to die and for me to never be found because he gladly told me all the time what he would do to my body after I died. I didn't want to end up on some missing persons list no one would ever investigate. I'm not delusional.  I know how it goes. No one would ever investigate or come looking for me. I would probably not even get my own missing persons report, realistically. I didn't want to end up scattered in pieces all over Texas while my little sisters grow up thinking I abandoned them.

It kills me daily to think that I was living in better conditions with a monster than I am now. I had food, I had access to clean water, I had access to a toilet, I had access to a shower, I only had to ""fight"" one person for the restroom, I had clean clothes, I didn't have to walk unreasonable miles everywhere, I had glasses (granted, he always used them against me and would take them away when he would kick me out).

It kills me to know my mother never provided that for me as a child who she was responsible for or now being in her care as a vulnerable adult.

It just stings that I was technically living better with him."	Kay7654321	post	16.38724492182494	male	White	0.9949900507926941	na	na	na	4	domesticviolence	no prediction.

"I totally understand where you’re coming from. I definitely lived better with him. Financially and materially anyway. It’s been 10 Years for me and because I am disabled I am not a whole lot better than I was when I left him with nothing but I’m content. I have what I need is not everything I want.

I don’t know your physical situation but I promise you you can get back all those relationships and even if you’re like me you’ll get back more than you could’ve ever had with him. Whatever he did have he would’ve held over your head. 

My ex had a big house, two vehicles, the house was decked out and I didn’t look at price tags all the time. But one day I came home and he had declared bankruptcy and a lot of it went. I didn’t know we could do that without my consent but he did. Right before I left him he purposely got fired from his job as an RN. he did it with three months left on a lease so that we had nowhere to live. Well except for himself because he had arranged to go home and live with his mom ( at 56) alone and my son and I had nowhere to go in the state I didn’t know anybody except for his family. What they give us they can take away and the only people in the world that we can count on ourselves. I was mad at my mom toO I’m not brothers and sisters resent me because we couldn’t make a better life for them.

Bitterness and hate has to go out the window. Abusers taught us to carry anger for a while after we leave them that’s what we think about.

You are alive. You might be vulnerable and you are powerful warrior. Sit down and think about what you want. What milestones will push you forward. If it’s a place of your own, security with food, better place for you and your family, a job and then a great job and then your dream job. Whatever it is, you heal and get it. If I’ve learned anything I’ve learned that if I can make it by myself no man will ever control me again. There will never be a man that can threaten me, whether I’m in a wheelchair or not, that I have nowhere else to go and that my life won’t be the same without him. It’s a power and you can’t even imagine

"Hey. I posted here a while ago about how I felt like my bf will kill me. After that post we were “okay” but not really. From his perspective I’ve been watching him rot but I’m not here to talk about the problems he’s caused himself. 

August 10th was my birthday so I decided to go out on August 11th. He was upset about me going out because I was “supposed to” get a rental so he can go do something to make money. I had to pay my rent so I couldn’t afford to get a rental but at the least I could goto my birthday dinner I’ve spent forever planning and put a lot of money into my outfit/hair. Over the years I’ve had friends in situations like this and the guy always ruins them on their birthday and mess up the plans so I left and got ready with my friend. I thought I curved the birthday bad luck when it comes to DV but apparently I didn’t. I guess it wasn’t enough that I was depressed & crying for hours on my actual birthday thinking about how my life has gone to crap since being with him. 2 crashed cars and the constant threat of eviction if he’s in my home. My mental health is failing me, especially after this. I got home around 2 and he was sitting on the bed playing the game. I remember going to sleep then being woken up by him turningn on the light. I got up to turn off the light then he came back in complaining about the WiFi and me not paying the bill or whatever the problem was. From there he got to talking about how I goto work and get to go out and leave the house. Its not my fault his friends don’t want to come get him unless he has gas money and he has no job. Anyways. I think this medicine is starting to work so imma try to remember. I think he started threatening the little material items I have left in my possession and I was telling him to calm down. He punched me. Like I’m a man. Over and over. Head butted me. Pulled my bun from out of my head and pulled out my real hair. I’m so traumatized I don’t even want to relive it but I wanted to update y’all. I’ve been avoiding it…I did wanna say that I’m at the hospital getting checked out. He really messed up my neck, my shoulder, and jaw. I can’t really eat and my shoulder and neck hurts like heck. He’s expressed that he wants me to feel how he feels. He wants to watch me be helpless, it’s clear that he’s doing this because his life is crap and I’m supposed to sacrifice my money but if I don’t I’m gonna be beat so he can feel better and less alone. I think it’s best if I do what I should’ve been done and press charges. He’s not at my home currently so I won’t get evicted..right? I hope I’m doing this right because I’ve lost so much because of him and I can’t lose anymore. I cannot take it. He says he’s been thinking about killing himself, I keep thinking what if this makes him do that. But that same thinking keeps getting me beat and soon he’s going to kill me."

I was in the hospital yesterday for my bf of 9 years punching and hitting me in the face repeatedly, he tried to pick me up and smash me into the pavement but I ran and got around other ppl, finally two guys showed up and helped me where the 1 guy actually beat my bfs face in. I put a restraining order on him and he is in jail now. He has been hitting me on and off for awhile and has done some horrible stuff to me as well, he blames me for everything that goes wrong in his life and he says if he is going to suffer ill have to suffer along with him, he told me he would kill my family and me if I left or tried to run and because of this I stayed entirely too long. Put a restraining order on him and get out now. Don't go back it will get worse and eventually he might actually kill you. I hope you get some support groups and surround yourself with friends and family like I'm doing. I'm hurting so bad I really did love him and that's the hardest part to this all, I was told you have to take it 1 day at a time.

"Great job with the hospital.

Yes remembering is painful, but try to allow the memories. Welcome them. Be brave. That knowledge can motivate you to stay out when you have relapses, it’s key to remember unfortunately. 

He’s at a very dangerous low. He is definitely around the level of kill himself and kill you too. Not the worst red flag but very much a giant red flag. He likes mooching off you I don’t think he’ll really kill your. But he certainly will beat the fuck out of you and mess up your body, deform your face, make you go bald, torture you in your sleep, Sabatoge anything important to you, scream and terrify you for your life any day or minute he thinks it’ll be fun, 

Please do leave. 

Maybe make another post on why you haven’t been able to leave and stay gone yet. The car crashes….. I had rhat happen early on with one and I was very deeply scarred (cars are my life) I was so upset I felt just like you, I couldn’t face how upsetting the memories of everyday became. I basically blacked out and moved in pudding and sleep paralysis and reoccurring sickness was for years that felt so short. It’s shocking years passed. Shocking. 

Whatever you need to do to get out—you can do this dude. You can figure it out, hype yourself up, and make it f**** happen. 

Even if not today (but today would be awesome) try over and over again until you’re really out and able to stand up for yourself again. By not being around.

Maybe leave town. 
Maybe leave all of your belongings. 
You might need that space to be safe enough to begin healing.

Because of the level of abuse he’s done and how much he … forcibly owns you and your property he’s going to be very possessive and pissed that he has to find a new person to drain the life from. You don’t deserve this, nor to worry any single day of your life or nighttime that you’re even in the same town with this monster and giant murderous parasite. 


Last thought, in your mind or out loud, call him a spider or a creepy or unliked item or animal in your opinion. Associate him with something as awful and gross as he has shown to be. Or dangerous.

Maybe it was about waiting for something special and getting disappointed? Or just feeling bad for not being able to make the day special. What and however, I always got annoyed and angry.

No wonder those in abusive relationships are afraid of holidays. They seem to be predestinated to be nothing but disasters.

"I’ve had abusers say they’re going to Jill themselves 

1) not your fault, not your circus, not your monkeys. He may kill you if you stay so like if he wants to off himself at a certain point it may seem mean but try not to care. Most of the time the guy is lying about that to manipulate you to stay. I’ve had at least 3-5 men say this to me and to my knowledge all of those assholes are still alive to this day abusing new victims or something doing their drugs under a bridge or whatever they do lol (one of them, true story, I thought he was dead but he found me online)

2) you will probably not be evicted and it sounds messed up but if you can deprogram yourself from how he brainwashed you you may be in a better position than some victims. He’s broke and you are not, so he’s assaulting you and he can and should go to jail for that. You send him to jail, get him a TRO. Do you know anyone you can send his shit to when you kick him out? 

The best plan is save up, get ready to move asap and tell him nothing. Stop paying for anything aside from pretending shit is normal. Let him think everything is normal if he isn’t in jail and you’re figuring out how to move/stuck with him.

Kick his ass out with the help of police asap. There are usually tenant DV protection laws to protect people like you, letting you take a second person off a lease or break a least early. Use all the resources you can to kick his ass to the curb and get a TRO asap. Get it while you’re at the hospital if you’re still there police can take a statement. When they ask if you want a TRO and to press charges you can say yes!

Get a new place asap and possibly a new phone if you think he may be tracking the one you have. Take your good job and your money and disappear.

Let your employers know in case he is capable of trying to sabotage your job (he’s probably likely to do this if he gets desperate) it is illegal for your job to fire you because of his harassment if you talk to them and let them know and ask for help. Police report paper trails will also help with this.

I have been very understanding of his situation and very forgiving of the things he’s done to me to put him there (bc I was his greatest resource). His frustration came from not being able to do anything for me or with me and he felt that the money I used to go to dinner and get myself together could’ve been used to make him money. For once in our whole year relationship I got my hair done and it was MY birthday and he swirled me around like a jump rope using the bun I had in my head. This is pure jealousy, animosity, if I can’t have it, you can’t have it. Even if it’s the day you were born.

"OP — just so you know there’s no threat of eviction.  If you talk with the police while you’re in the hospital, you can get a protective order or restraining order (the name is different in some states).

Once you get this protective order granted, the police will remove him from the house and you will not need to see him or interact with him.  If he comes back, then he will go to jail."	Jazzlike_Ship_6032	reply	na	na	na	0.9990831613540649	no	no	no	na	domesticviolence	failed
Please don’t feel bad for making the moves you made to protect yourself! He doesn’t care about your feelings, so take that stance with his. My stbx husband is trying to destroy me right now through the court system. He’s accusing me of doing the things he has done to our kids. So now, I can’t see my kids because of his lies. He has them, and I’m so worried about them. I miss my kids so much. I cry almost every day because I miss them. Don’t give up on your freedom. Stay away from him. Be strong! You can do this. It took me awhile to get the courage to get mine out of the house via restraining order last year, but I did it. It was a wonderful, yet short time of no contact. (It’s a long story about why my kids were given to him. But trust me, it’s awful.) I believe in you! Hugs to you!

So I (21m) beat up my dad (Early 40s) yesterday after a really bad argument. I got home to get ready for the next day and he had been drinking and on Vicodin. When I was trying to go to bed on the couch in the kitchen of the one bedroom he was loudly calling people, turning on lights and making a lot of noise. I asked him if he could be a little quieter considering it was 12:30 and I had to be up at 5, he started getting upset that I asked him to do something saying how he makes the rules. He goes back to his bed cussing me out calling me a bunch of names, I kept asking him to stop because I was getting tired and eventually he starts saying really terrible stuff. I start getting upset and tell him he’s acting like a child and he blows up and tells me to get out, so I start driving up to my grandparents. On my way there he keeps calling and texting saying how I’m going to be homeless and how no one in the family cares about me or will help me. Eventually I turn around and head back because it’s half an hour less of a drive to work in the morning. I get back and immediately try to go to bed but he keeps berating and insulting me saying he would beat the shit out of me and hit me so hard that I won’t wake up. (We fought already about a year ago after he tried to choke me out twice and I was able to get him off me and I wasn’t trying to hurt him) but ever since then he keeps trying to goad me into a fight. Eventually I said you aren’t going to do anything and I head him get up and start charging me. He is about 3-4 inches taller than me and easily 150lbs heavier. He came up and pushed me back but then I kicked him in the stomach knocking him over and started throwing, I got him a lot of solid shots in and my hand and shoulder are killing me. My dad went from I’m going to hit you so you don’t wake up to, I’m calling the cops and you’re going to jail. So I grab my shit and walk out, but I forgot my car key in the apartment during the fight, so I was stranded avoiding cars and streets until I got a ride to my grandparents. But the cops did come and my dad filed a report but he didn’t press charges yet. Now he keeps calling and sent me a picture of the police report. Ngl though after 19 years of neglect and abuse, it felt kinda good. Ask me any questions for clarification.

I have no idea about the legal side but it sounds like self-defense to me. If I were you I’d talk to a lawyer and maybe the police too in order to file your own report. Beyond that, just leave the POS and move somewhere else. I know it’s easier said than done but maybe talk to your grandparents or ask help from friends. Don’t believe your father. Lots of people are willing to help - you just need to make the first step.	tamb77	reply	na	na	na	0.9989259839057922	weak	no	no	na	domesticviolence	failed
"it is currently 8:28 as i start typing. 
last night at about 9:30 i brought up something that bothered me that my partner does. they told me to “fucking drop it before i make them angrier.” now, in the past when they’ve done this, i’ve cowered away and dropped it. 
but last night i decided it was time for my feelings to come out. 
i flat out told them no, i wasn’t. that they would hear what i had to say, and that i wasn’t scared of them. they’d never hit me before this, but i saw it coming. 
they lunged at me, told me they’d kill me and that i was a bitch and a retard, (this next part makes me feel like such a badass, haha.) i grabbed their fist before it hit me, twisted it, flipped over to the bed and basically kickboxed them in the teeth so they couldn’t choke me. i took a few punches, as did the wall. 
they told me they’d kill me repeatedly, and told me to grab my kitten and run. (essentially telling me they’d kill my kitten) 
they forced me to ride to their mom’s house thinking the mom would take their side, the mom did not, fortunately. 
i went back to their house, they stayed with their mom. i sang myself to sleep and cradled my favorite plushie and packed my things the next morning, thus here i am.

"Four months post-separation. Four months of relative safety.

I read a book today.

I used to *love* to read. I haven't been able to concentrate for the longest time. There have been multiple reasons for this. Lately, though, the main reasons have been crazy levels of stress (and possible tbi).

I went to the used bookstore for a prompted journal (and found one specifically for trauma recovery, whee!). 

Buttt also, a reduced-price work of fiction caught my eye, and I bought it on a whim.

Gail Tsukiyama's *Women of the Silk* is a fucking amazing story of female resilience/sisterhood, set in early 20th century China, with no centered male characters and very little sex/romance. I cannot recommend highly enough, *especially* if you are a woman who is sick of men.

"Yes. Abusers do this. It is a trap. 

One clue is if his apologies are grand yet also vague, i.e. he says he is sorry ""for everything"" or ""for all the pain he caused"" or something nebulus and nonspecific like thar. This tactic a) gives you what you want to hear, b) sounds deeply felt, c) does not actually communicate any accountability on his part because it remains unclear what he actually considers his wrongdoings. Apologies without specifics are not actual apologies.

Another clue is that he contacted you at all. If he truly understands how much he hurt you (suddenly? just now? when you've just become single? convenient.) and is truly remorseful, then the LAST thing he would do is show up again. He would know that the price he pays for abusing you is losing you forever.

At best, he is trampling the boundary that you set 3 years ago and trying to force a conversation so that HE can feel better. That is still a very selfish and uncaring thing to do to you.

At worst (and more likely), he is just testing out whether he might still have some control over you.

Abusers will know when to hit you at your most vulnerable state. Then they will say everything you wanted to hear. This is a lie. Please remember this. 

The fact that he admitted to abusing you means he is desperately trying to get in contact with you. If he is so apologetic and sorry about it, he should turn himself into the police and write a Facebook post about it outing himself as an abuser. But he will never do that because he actually doesn’t want to apologize for the act but to use his apology to gain access to you.

"Hi, I’m a child who witnessed DV between my divorced parents. Broken glass everywhere. Black eyes, you name it. This was in the 80’s fast forward to 2001 my now ex husband who I hate even saying ex husband. I’ll say my sons dad and that is even a lightly used word. His dad has been out of his life since my son was 5, my son’s 21 almost 22. 8 years ago he appeared for about 5 months after getting out of prison. He beat me and literally stomped on my face while my son was in the home and I was outside in the yard. 

I thought I had let go of the past but I keep hearing from others I need to work through the dv and move past the past. 
I’m working with a therapist about how f’ed up I am bc of my childhood. I just want to be over this marriage and forget it ever happened. Honestly I don’t think about him or our past. Meth took over his life and he became the monster that he is.
My mom told me I just suppressed the abuse and haven’t worked through it.

"I didn’t experience the DV as a child as a witness, but as a victim/survivor of DV, anger is a long stage to go through. 

Anger crops up because you weren’t able to react properly each instance of abuse and when you’re in an abuse dynamic, you are focusing on surviving and pleasing the abuser that you have no time to reflect. Years of suppression and finally some space from the abuser will develop these angry feelings.

I have to say that from my experience that shame is a part of this anger. I asked myself. Why did I let this happen? Why was I so stupid? Why couldn’t have I done this? You need to forgive yourself. 

Another side of that anger is towards the abuser. Actually this is a sign of health in the sense that there is no longer love but fury. Your anger shows that you can longer accept his actions. You have some sort of value towards yourself, and the illusions about the relationship have dissipated. You have to write out why you are angry with him. Write out each instance and face them head on no matter how shameful they might seem.

So first step is confrontation and journaling. You have to recognize and name what you are feeling and what happened. Second step is to forgive yourself. Hypothetically speaking, if you had a daughter or friend that went through what you did, what would you say to them? This is what you should say to yourself. Third step is loving yourself. Treat yourself and go to a spa. You need to elevate yourself. And move on but remember enough of the bullshit so that you don’t get stomped on again."

"Random moments trigger the memory of my paralysis. Be it reading about a pop culture scandal on Reddit, washing my hands, or being immersed in a novel, I'm abruptly yanked back to that moment. Like a wisp of smoke, it sneaks in, leaving me gasping for air, my eyes blurred with tears. This is my fatal flashback. Each time, I shake it off, trying to reclaim a fragment of normalcy.

An ordinary April day in NYC led me to my Uber, forgoing my usual subway ride from the upper west side to the heart of the city to visit my then-boyfriend. 'Twas my reward after a 30-hour overtime stint at a posh physician's office. We greeted each other with the same passion and butterflies that brought us together after many years of friendship. Four whiskey sours in for him, a beer for me, and the millionth viewing of Casablanca. Everything was typical until we delved into a touchy friend-related topic.

The deafening silence when he left the other room triggered my unease. My boyfriend returned, his face contorted with rage. His **""get out""** was so hollow, and chilling that, before I could react, I was confronted with a brutal physical onslaught. In that chaos, my voice—detached, yet unmistakably mine—pleaded ceaselessly. I felt primal, alert, desperate, and helpless. But overall, I also felt a sense of calm acceptance that this was how I would die. I became somewhat limp as he attacked me, gritting his teeth, and yelling. It had never gotten this bad before. *He’s going to kill me this time.*

The subsequent minute or two were a mad scramble to quickly get dressed while he mocked my cries and profuse apologies. I'd seek refuge on the bustling NYC sidewalk beneath his walk-up, where strangers gawked at me in the aftermath of the assault. The full impact of my injuries became evident only later, paralleling the depth of my emotional scars.

The following years were a maze of trauma, judgment from loved ones, tangled legal proceedings, and inner turmoil regarding my feelings for my ex. I moved across the country and aimed to distance myself from the fallout and judgments that accompany surviving a volatile relationship. Yet, now years later, in the sanctuary of my aunt’s home, echoes of the past emerged in the form of an unlikely adversary in the form of an older cousin.

A literal simple act of borrowing one of her extra toothbrushes triggered a rage I couldn't have fathomed. Her entry into my room was first marked by a cascade of my belongings falling to the ground. Her methodical, deliberate approach, littered with fallen possessions, was a menacing dance of impending danger. She grew more agitated, the situation escalating to an insane climax with her hands clasped fiercely around my throat. As her grip tightened, that eerie calm settled over me once again. But my survival instincts led me to flee as soon as I found a window of opportunity.

In both situations, my own voice seemed disconnected, voicing apologies while my body and mind felt eerily tranquil. Yet, once the immediate danger had passed, a renewed sense of life overwhelmed me. The juxtaposition of such profound stillness and reinvigorated life is so unique, and harrowing. 

Each betrayal, each fatal flashback— they're like the ever-recurring wisps of smoke, sometimes obscuring, sometimes evoking. They billow, twist, and rise, serving as stark reminders of past pains. But in the quiet aftermath, when the smoke clears, what remains is a profound stillness, a testament to resilience and survival. My voice, once muffled in desperation, now resounds with a potent mix of pain....and hope. While trauma might momentarily cloud my vision, beneath it lies a clarity born from adversity. For every wound that lingers, so too does a spirit, fierce and unyielding, ready to face the days ahead."	-lessIknowthebetter	post	23.341896247367114	male	White	0.029219772666692734	na	na	na	2	domesticviolence	failed
"My bf and I have been together for 7 years now. When we met, we were in college and I already had a bf (who I broke up with soon after). I was young and an attention seeker so when we started talking/dating I'd flirt with guys, lie about talking/hooking up with another guy for months and was just basically a cheater even though I told him the year we met that I wasn't ready for a ""serious bf"" when he asked. Regardless my actions toward him showed otherwise and I was just careless and hurtful at that point. Because of this huge regret in my life he would physically and verbally abuse me A LOT.

He'd push me to the ground, punch walls, destroy my stuff, spit on me, call me a wh*** and a b***h, etc. I regretted my actions and stopped lying/sneaking around. He even choked me one time in 2017 when I caught him texting another girl he'd been trying to hook up with. I confronted him about it calmly and he said I had no right to act that way after what I did. I couldn't breathe. He ended up apologizing that day and buying me clothes. Ick...

Fast forward 5 years, one of my college friends posted a old snap of her twerking and doing the splits. I was hyping her up in the video and he flipped out because there were guys there (mind you this was summer time and we were broken up for about 3 months when this video happened). I told him I was literally just sitting there hyping her up, no interaction with the boys which is clear in the video and he verbally attacked me and wouldn't let me leave the apt, then beat my head with a pillow (hurt a lot more than I thought it would). Then he pushed me into our table and left a huge bruise on my leg which resulted in me staying somewhere else that night.

Fast forward to 1 year later (which is now), he hasn't done anything physical since then and has stopped the verbal abuse as well. For awhile it seemed emotionally abusive (talking bad about my family, controlling & manipulative, made me feel like his opinions are more valid than mine). But I thought I was just being sensitive and trippin' because of the past. Now when I look at him I have resentment toward him and honestly just think about leaving despite the abuse being kinda gone?? I feel guilty for wanting to leave now cause I know he'll use the ""everything between us is better"" against me and flip out. I feel like if I was never a crappy person in the very beginning this would have never happened. 

I should say I have an immense amount of guilt for my actions as well. I haven't been great at communicating or committing to him (in terms of wanting marriage when I know he's ready for it). I tend to shut down in arguments to protect my mental well-being because I'm terrified in saying the wrong thing which will make the argument worse so I either apologize or stay silent. Today, I tried to plan a cute lunch date with him which resulted in him telling me I should've planned this a week ago. Then it went on about how frivolous I am with money (I barely shop but I do get my hair done and get waxed), how I leased an expensive car (a car he encouraged me to get it), and how when he's struggling financially I don't help. Mind you he drives my car A LOT because he doesn't have one and I'm also struggling financially so idk how I'm able to help him more without helping myself. (He made more money than me up until about 10 months ago) He's also mad I didn't help with his lawyer stuff for an accident he got in (he had no car insurance and is trying to sue Progressive) and is upset I don't help with his job situation (he's had major issues with people at the last 3 jobs he's had) Did I not do enough or support him enough? Mind you, he has no issue paying more but when he does it's used against me.

He told me I don't show love and support, which makes me feel bad because I'm not the most lovey person like I used to be. He's ready for the next steps but I'm hesitant because I believe I'm already checked out of this relationship and the pain he's put me through. He told me ""I've been good for a year but the abuse is still used against me"" then proceeded to slam his PlayStation controller which scared our two dogs. I do feel bad that I haven't committed the right way but I believe it's because deep down I know I can't commit to an abuser. I am scared to leave despite the fact that he's pushed me out of our apt during big fights without my belongings and telling me to leave, but when I tried to leave in the past he blew up and it resulted in physical and verbal abuse. What do I do? Am I in the wrong for not being supportive enough as a partner? I could have asked how he's feeling more knowing he's been upset. HELP."

"So one thing I’ve read that is sad but fits well is this: is he better now, or are YOU placating him more. 

Basically, is he only good now because you are so cautious to never do a single thing he will lose it over… 

Which unhealthy relationship that’s fine and that’s your goal is to not do things that bother them but with healthy relationships you’re looking for them to not get triggered over stuff that hurts you such as randomly being mad at you for that video where you did nothing wrong— and you’re looking for them to return the favor Foley and sometimes in tenfold where they never want to trigger you as well. 

So for “healthy” you would be needing to be allowed to get mad a lot of the times when you feel mad as long as you are healthy and typically emotionally regulated so that you’re not just doing pity parties all the time and demanding to be a dictator and asking for apologies all the time. 

And then for them to do the same thing back, which it looks like he’s actually not where he will get mad at you and be angry and aggressive and flip a lid over things where it’s not fair and it’s excessive and he just wants like obedience and servitude, when it’s not appropriate, and very very unhealthy .

Also, something that you might not have experienced before that would be healthy would be a relationship where when you’re mad the other person you don’t take cheap shots of them emotionally or physically . 

And kind of the idea behind why people who strangle strangle you again is the idea not as much do they don’t change, but more that their threshold they hold themselves to is very low and that they’re impulsive behaviors, or some thing that they feed . People do change, but typically when someone doesn’t have the moral high ground, and they like to do things that sabotage their life, such as hitting a loved one and making it, so that the loved one rightfully should hate them and be afraid of them and have brain damage from emotional abuse and PTSD. You know when someone likes their impulsive behavior more than all of that that sabotage their own life let alone hurts other people.— not only would they have to change to have a higher moral ground, which is extremely hard to change once you’re over about a teenage age, they also can’t have impulsive triggers of like their own cheating or their own random things that would trigger them to have a domino effect of that life, self sabotaging, where suddenly they’re accusing you of things, and angry with you all the time not necessarily, because they want to strangle you but more because of their lifestyle and personality, which they’re encouraging themselves to never change because typically people that are starting off as someone who allows impulsive behaviors will typically stay at that moral standing if it’s lower because they just don’t see the consequences and they just don’t see the benefits of going to a higher level of reality, even though most of us would see that our life is easier, and they are loving is easier and our benefits in life easier when we’re not sabotaging ourselves. 

Like, if a abuser makes themselves blind on purpose, a person who does that doesn’t really change because they’re continually handicapping themselves on purpose . If that makes sense?

Like they just don’t comprehend to do better, because they just see short term consequences in the genuinely do not look at the biggest consequences that matter the most such as hurting people who are close to you.

Plus they typically don’t truly feel for you. Which is seen as a foundation piece for any relationship.

Like screaming at you and especially not hitting you for a video where you didn’t do anything wrong and that they’re just trying to change your behaviors— that is really crazy because if they felt for you, they wouldn’t hit you. If they listens to you saying this is an accident, I’m not trying to do anything to attract other people. Don’t worry if they listen to you they would understand how much it hurts your feelings for them to continue to get angry with you, let alone, physically hurting you, which is such a sign of not feeling your feelings. And especially with the context, they’re demanding that you feel their feelings to the point of threatening you and physically harm you. So then it has potential to become unlimited free unbalance because they want tap into how you feel so they will do anything they like. but they want you to be to have dinner how they feel and make you codependent in obedient. and because they don’t feel your feelings, they will literally take things endlessly far with you if they start feeling like it. 

since it has been better for a while, there is a chance that he genuinely cares about you which is great, but , … there’s some families and relationships, where people have never attack each other, and have never even sworn at the other person because it is seen is extremely disrespectful and unkind. It can seem like a really high bar but it’s kind of what you’re looking for if you’re trying to have some thing healthy where people will not make you anxious every day or upset every day of your life."

Trust me honey. You’re so blinded by his presence that you can’t see past it. If a man raises his hands once that means he sees you as inferior and as an animal. He loses all humanity towards you. Don’t be fooled by the days he is not abusing you. He uses abuse as a way to control and once you’re married he will do worst knowing that you will accept it.

I second this OP. He feels justified in treating you this way because of your past actions. Which let me just say he is not justified despite that. If he wasn’t okay with it he should have left. But what’s going on here is that he knows he has something to dangle over your head to keep you compliant. Also the fact that he feels so threatened by other men and fears another man might “take” you from him, it’s no saying what he will do to maintain control.

"No not at all! You are not abusive for that! You are clearly and understandably unhappy! It sounds like he’s miserable and yet won’t leave (typical of abusers) because he won’t give up control. He’d rather be miserable himself in control than have you leave or leave you and lose control. And it’s not you making him miserable. It’s himself. Why would you want to be affectionate with someone who has literally harmed you?! You are having perfectly normal responses. And by the sounds of you questioning it, he clearly has gaslit the hell out of you.

Further, you’re clearly a very accountable person meaning that you had no problem naming your wrongs and questioning how and caring about how your behaviors might have affected others. That is not something that abusive people do. They never admit fault or take accountability. You’re not in the wrong here and when you have been, you own up to it.

"My (28M) wife (30F) and I have been having a lot of issues lately due to increased stress from our careers, our toddlers and a relative of hers that recently moved in that we essentially have to parent in addition to our kids. With her urging I've been attending therapy sessions for over a year now so I can learn to better communicate with her and manage my stress/anxiety. The thing is my wife has a lot of trauma in her past between abandonment issues from her parents and sexual abuse. I've begged her to seek therapy for these concerns as she does not cope well with anger and lashes out. Her usual style of arguing is the louder person wins or keep escalating petty actions until I do something ""unforgivable"" or I get hit.

&#x200B;

She's attended therapy sessions with me and my therapist but she's continuously made excuses for not getting a therapist herself. Even my therapist had encouraged her to. She's also gotten on her family member to seek therapy for her trauma but she herself won't. She's expressed to me on one occasion that she's afraid to face her demons and her past traumas.

&#x200B;

 I'm not perfect myself and we've gotten physical in the past. On one occasion I put my hands around her neck after a particularly heated argument after she slapped my food out of my hands in front of our infant first born. Since then I vowed never to lay hands on her again. There were times I've held her when she was threatening to walk out on me and the kids but I let go almost immediately when I sense I was losing control. In that time I've still been hit on multiple occasions by her, slapped so hard I heard ringing in my ear for a week, smacked in the eye in front of both our kids, and kicked in the head when I bent down to retrieve something from the floor. She

&#x200B;

Today we were arguing again after a particularly stressful week for both of us and she was yelling at me while I was doing something on my phone for our toddler and I asked her to stop yelling at me. She smacked me (not very hard) but I snapped. I put her in a chokehold for about 5 seconds and then stopped myself. I felt horrible, I cried, I felt like almost 2 years of therapy were down the drain. Now she's threatening to tell our neighbors, and start divorce process.

&#x200B;

I just want her get help. I've begged her to not for me, not for herself but even for our kids. I've even asked my therapist to encourage her. 

&#x200B;

I feel like I'm in hell. I want my loving wife back. She just doesn't know how to cope with stress and how to have a healthy argument. I didn't before either but I've strived to be better because the family we're building is important to me.

"You need to enter a long term (26+ week) men's behavioural change program yesterday. Most men are so focused on finding fault with women that the problem seems to be women. It's not; it's misogyny.

Your behaviours won't change and will continue to escalate as you've mentioned if you don't seek urgent appropriate supports.

I have a friend who is more like a little sister  who began seeing someone three weeks ago, this weekend they are vacationing, week two of dating he convinced her not to join ROTC and said he would pay for her college instead, I told her that’s a huge red flag, she actually called my boss crying saying she wanted to be picked up so my boss called me, being someone who has been through relationships that started out this way I decided to just call her and create a story saying I needed to come get her immediately and asked if she could watch my dogs overnight it was an emergency, he got on the phone and said absolutely not and talked to me like I was a child (I’m 35 he’s 32, she’s 20) everything I have heard about him from day one screams controlling.

You are right.
This is moving hyper fast and it sounds like she is already overwhelmed.

"I am now a single mother because my soon to be ex husband refused to just leave and now is sitting in jail.

I found out he was cheating on me (texting and sending MY money to her). I knew about it for a while but knew that it would probably not end well if confronted him. I had enough after he accused me of looking over his shoulder on his phone. I told him to leave and he refused and got physical with me and tried to kidnap our kids to use as pawns. He tried to run over my dad and me with my car. He did leave (or so I thought) when he heard the sirens were getting closer. Ended up being arrested the same night but hours later after he came back and our 16 year old daughter called 911 to say he'd came back.

Now his brother is saying he needs to be in a rehab (I'd only seen him smoke weed and drink). He hadn't been drinking that day so only marijuana I'd thought. His brother says that he was on pills or something. He didn't have any when he was arrested and I haven't found anything in the house yet. I think he is trying to use that as a way to lessen the charges against him if he ""wasn't in his right mind"" which is totally bullshit. He was as sober as he could have been that night. His brother is saying when he saw him he looked like shit and just wanted to see his kids.

I don't believe for a minute that he is remorseful. He doesn't give a shit what anyone thinks and is just mad that he's in jail. I still think with all time on his hands he's came up with a million and one ways to kill me when he does get out. I am not allowing him to see his kids now (they don't want to anyways) and if he does get out he will never be alone with them ever again if I have anything to say about it. He would just talk shit about me and their grandparents (my parents) and not really care about what they want or take off with them to punish me (maybe kill me before hand).

I feel like I have no one. Other than my parents and his brother (best friend really) no one else knows. I want to tell everyone I know but I'm afraid if he talks to any of them he will try to tell a whole other story and I become the crazy bitch that put him there for ""no reason"". He already told his brother I pushed him down our front porch stairs that night (I was in front of him and have my dad as a witness of that). So even with his brother I have to try to get him to understand that he would say anything to make himself look better. 

If anyone wants to chat about anything I would like to just try to get my mind off of all of this."	emptyspaceintime	post	27.01968855341293	female	White	0.9987284541130066	na	na	na	4	domesticviolence	no prediction.

"Hi reddit! I am here asking for advice as a final resort as I feel like my friends will always side with me and I need very honest unbiased advice or opinions.

I’m 19F, I study and work full time abroad. My boyfriend 22M works for the US army abroad. I met my boyfriend back in March and we started dating a week after we met, which I feel like is mistake number one because we should’ve gotten to know each other more. It’s his first relationship and I’m his second body. For the first 2 weeks he was fine, but then he asked me about my body count (9) and I told him the truth because I saw no reason to lie about it. For background I was introduced to sex from a very violent place so I view sex as something meaningless and done just for pleasure or enjoyment, I unfortunately do not view it from the whole “soul tying experience” point of view. I understand that he views it like that but I simply do not. Needless to say, he freaked the fuck out completely, he kept pressuring me to tell him details about exactly what happened in my past relations, he’d bring it up constantly, make jokes about it, “communicate” how he’s feeling in a way that was borderline shaming me, he simply couldn’t let it go, and to make matters worst he found out that my ex was from the same country as him and he was obsessed with him to say the least. He kept asking me very weird intrusive questions about him and just reminding me of him constantly. He said things along the lines of “I feel stuck and I’m only staying because I feel the need to fix you” “The rape in your past doesn’t bother me because you didn’t have a choice but you had a choice with the hookups” “I swore I would never date a girl with a past lime yours” and so on. He’s also very emotionally unintelligent and never listens to how I feel or have to say. I have bpd and my symptoms were very much quiet until he came around because he would ‘unintentionally’ do everything in his power to break me down mentally. mind you he was doing the absolute bare minimum and I was so invested in our relationship that I was going him above and beyond for him. I felt like he was a job that I had to attend to, I quite literally was his mother figure. He also began pressuring me into sex, he would not take no for an answer, he would also make me feel guilty for saying no. One time I was on my period basically handicapped because of the pain and he just started jacking off because “i couldn’t help him”. 2 months into the relationship I found out my mom who’s my absolute best friend and love so dearly has 2 brain tumors, that genuinely broke me especially that I’m so far away from her. I couldn’t deal with all the family issues, university issues, work issues, and then his issues I had enough and broke up with him through text. He tried to help by telling me “everyone dies” and “everyone has problems”. I felt guilty and got back with him, then broke up with him again, then broke up. He would not leave me alone during our breakup and insisted he will be there and that we’ll heal and fix our relationship. I told him everything and he swore he wouldn’t do it again and I rejected him. However one day I was going to travel for a bit (2 weeks after we broke up?) so he came over to say goodbye (do not understand why) and he discovered recent sexual messages between me and my ex while I was showering and he freaked the fuck out. He claimed that I was cheating on him, threatened to beat my ex up, started saying let’s have sex right now, basically went insane. I told him to save it because I’m going to be late to my flight. he proceeded to harass me about it for a month saying i’m horrible for that and that at least he did what he did unintentionally and because he loves me. I just let him be because I genuinely didn’t care anymore. 2 weeks later I find myself in the same position of forgiving him and trying out our relationship again. So far he’s changed and everything’s well but I literally cannot stand him. I’m always tense around him, don’t feel safe around him, repulsed by his touch, just overall every negative emotion in the book comes out when he’s near me or talking to me. He’s suggesting therapy but I don’t know if that’s what I need or if I just need to get the fuck away from him. He swears up and down that he loves me and wants nothing but me but I don’t know how to feel at this point. 

TLDR: My boyfriend lacks a lot of emotional intelligence, borderline mentally abused me and coerced me into sex multiple times. When I broke up with him he started acting right but now that we’re back together I cannot seem to forgive him or love him anymore.

"Unfortunately most people don’t change even if they promise. I am not surprised he was the same after you guys got back together. I found it quite concerning that he questioned you about your sexual past. It tells me that he is very insecure. In my opinion it’s the past and it should not be held against you. He seems unstable to me and especially since you have BPD I would say try to find someone who is stable, I think especially with bpd you need someone who is patient and understand, AND has emotional intelligence. You two are fire and gasoline. I think it’s best if you leave especially since you resent him at this point anyway. I know people with BPD have a fav person but it needs to be someone you can trust and feel safe with, which he is not. In general it’s better to do therapy before engaging in a relationship

I don't think any questions needs to be asked. It doesn't matter who's right or wrong. It's clearly over. Leave. Staying when your repulsed is not OK to do to him or yourself.

"OK, first thing. Any man that asks about your ""count"" early on in the relationship should be dumped. You have no obligation to tell anyone about your personal history, and his being so obsessed with it should have been the deal breaker.

Break it off and then BLOCK HIM on EVERYTHING. Stop letting him manipulate back into your life. This is going to end very badly, as there is NO WAY he has changed, and it is just a ticking time bomb at this point as he is ramping up with his behavior. This is all bad. END IT."

"It really helped me to understand the cycle of abuse and how it is designed to overwhelm you and confuse you. I know you listed out the facts and it makes it so clear: what is hard to convey is how they constantly put you on the defensive and in reaction mode so that you can't think clearly.

Therapy can't help him because he will just manipulate and control the sessions. But specifically domestic abuse therapy will help you. Caveat if you ask/tell a regular therapist that you need help with domestic abuse, they will say sure but they have no idea what they are doing. You will waste so much time and money.

i was in an very toxic abusive relationship about a decade ago. verbal, physical, mental. he used every trick, in what i now know is the abusers handbook. i have been on a healing journey since getting into a healthy, stable, and joyfilled relationship. i have “forgiven” what i could, accepted what i couldn’t, and have tried to overcome as much as i can in regards to his actions and my ultimate choice to leave. the one thing i’m stuck on is who i became in the midst of the abuse. how do i accept what i did to survive? how do i forgive myself for the things i did and said? how do i look in the mirror and know that while it wasn’t really me, it was? i NEVER want to be that person. and i want a long amazing relationship with my partner but i’m terrified of what i can become, because i have seen it. any help or words of wisdom and encouragement are greatly needed.

"To be honest, this is the hardest part for most survivors. It’s one thing to blame someone you can distance yourself from, but you can’t really distance yourself from, well, yourself. It takes time, a LOT of time, so please be patient with yourself. 

In the psychology field, we call this “moral injury.” It’s the way someone acts out of character when they are desperate and afraid and it is commonly one of the last things survivors tackle. So, know that this is a normal part of healing, and now that you’re to the point of identifying it, you’ve really done a lot of work so far. 

The best way to fight moral injury is to first have a very stable and deep sense-of-self. Anything that helps increase your knowledge of who you are is worthwhile. This will help lay the foundation of what was “out of character.” I would personally recommend the movie “Where the Crawdads Sing.” It helped me get over some of my own moral injury. I would also recommend daily positive affirmations, like “I am a good person,” or “I can do anything.”

Finally, please understand that your literal brain chemistry under the stress of being abused is different. The decisions you make and emotions you feel are caused by your reptilian brain switching on your panic fight-or-flight response. You COULD HAVE DIED - keep that in mind. Your behavior, although out of character and shameful to look back on, SAVED YOUR LIFE. Try to practice gratitude for that. I know it’s really hard, but if you hadn’t been the person you were, you might not be alive today."	Traditional-Dig1518	reply	na	na	na	0.04598098248243332	weak	strong	no	na	domesticviolence	failed
"OP, one of the things that abusers take fiendish glee in doing is trying to make us so angry, so scared, so befuddled and off center and panicked that they can push us past our endurance. Then they scream that WE are the abuser, the bad ones, the ones filled with hate and harm. They twist reality with lies and gaslighting until we are no longer standing on solid ground. That is the evil of emotional and verbal abuse. They make us see ourselves thru a lens that is broken, because they created it. The voice we use to speak to ourselves in our head is harsh and critical, because it is the voice of our abuser, so deeply imbedded in our brains and the way we view ourselves that we can’t even see it. 

Watch your self talk, the way that you refer to yourself when you are working, are frustrated, are scared, alone. Are any of those things, the words or phrases familiar from when you were with your abuser? It helps to be aware of this, because once you are mindful of that you can begin to change those words. The other thing is something a friend told me. We were talking, and as usual I was beating myself up for not doing things I should do, and I was very harsh on myself. She finally said “Stop! Would you talk to me the way you just talked about yourself?” I was shocked, because I would never talk to anyone in such a way!  So she said “Then don’t talk about yourself that way, you are abusing yourself. Start imagining you are talking to me whenever you begin to beat yourself up, and that will help change that pattern of self talk.” 

OP, she was right. I was continuing the abuse my abuser had been doing years before, without knowing.  Possibly you are doing the same? Just a thought. Be kind to yourself, OP. You have been thru a lot, and who you were is not who you are now. Trust that."	Traditional-Dig1518	reply	na	na	na	0.04598098248243332	no	strong	no	na	domesticviolence	failed
"I totally understand what you mean.  During the abusive relationship, I became someone very different... meek, submissive, weak, lost confidence, etc.  Like you did, I did what was necessary to survive.  There were points that very dark thoughts entered my mind... but I pushed them out and just kept on surviving.  

I remember telling my therapist that one thing I resent is that the naïve and innocent part of me is forever gone.  He took that from me.  I used to believe that everyone has a good heart and was a lot more trusting.  Now I am a lot more cautious, which in itself isn't a bad thing.  I just sometimes miss that naïve girl that I used to be.

What I have always done, since leaving him, was first of all, thank God/Buddha/any higher power for giving me a second chance at life.  Secondly, I believe that everything happens for a reason, good or bad.  What he did was inexcusable, but I also walked away with a lot of lessons, like red flags to look out for, what I wanted and didn't want in a relationship, etc.  After spending two years healing, I was finally at a point that I felt ready to find a new partner in life.  

My husband is everything I wanted and more.  He knows about my past and gives me 100% support.  He's always teaching me different ways of self defense (he's in law enforcement), and we go to the range together.  With the right person, you won't have to worry about that side of you coming out ever again.  I've been married almost 13 years now and even during our worst argument (which doesn't happen often), I never felt threatened or scared to bring out the dark side of me.  I am always able to stand my ground and make my point, then we calm down and discuss.  

Sorry for rambling... I don't know if any of this helps... just wanted to share my two cents."	Traditional-Dig1518	reply	na	na	na	0.04598098248243332	weak	strong	no	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.

Self talk is extremely important. This extends to your thoughts. When you are unhappy with things about yourself, change them, or at least try.

"u/Fabulous_Cobbler_404 's answer is marvelous! 

I'll be bold enough add my $0.02: we are all changing and growing as long as we live. Some of our past versions don't live up to our current values. I, for one, am appalled at the person I was as a teenager. But I recognize that that person was the product of her upbringing and environmental and had not yet learned to do better. 

In the same way, I am ashamed of some of the things I did and said while in an abusive marriage. I especially regret that I didn't see that my attempts to protect my children were futile and that I didn't leave much earlier for their sakes. I own my responsibility for the damage that did to them and the hardships they will face in life because of my choices. I also know that I was doing the best I could and I made what seemed like the best decisions at the time. 

I have more information now and know better. The person i am now would choose differently. Dwelling on my guilt would make it harder for me to help my children overcome what they call their ""spicy"" early years. Instead, I focus on being the best mom I can be today. 

I'm pretty sure that in another ten years I'll look back at who I am right now and think, ""Gee, how could I have been so wrong about [insert whatever topic here]."" But I'm doing the best I can and actively trying to learn and do better. 

That is the best any of us can do. We are human. We are fallible. We will do stuff we regret - especially when we are in stressful and dangerous situations. Shame is a message that our actions don't align with our values. It's not a blanket condemnation of who we are. It's just a signal that we have the chance to grow, make amends if needed (*not* to our abusers!), and keep striving to improve. 

You've changed so much from the person you were in that relationship. Be kind to her. Give her a little grace. She did the best she could. And spare a little kindness for who you are now, too.

"In a tv show they showed a kid going mad because his dad abused him regularly. His friends watched him waste thousands of dollars on a hot tub for no reason because he wanted to spoil his friends. They all got in the hot tub and held him while he cried his eyes out. He didn’t want the hot tub, he shouldn’t have spent crazy money, and he didn’t have any rational choices to make, so unfortunately he just made crazy decisions. 

Luckily he had those tv show friends who saw him and said “oh he’s gone mad” and went to comfort him and pull him back to reality. A reality so sad that his brain had left. 


When I watched myself in my latest relationships I found audible cracking spots where my brain gave up and I knew I was in for endless torture. Just hoping the days would end somehow, and being literally helpless. Just hoping one day I get out. 

A lot of those times where I went from healthy to completely a shell of myself, it was the middle of the night, and the hundredth argument of multiple days. 

The times I was promising myself never to let anyone take money from me and then after a few days of him being back he would scare me into giving him my card I needed for gas money to go home. Then he would spend it on anything he wanted, and I would wake up and my head would hurt so much and I couldn’t do anything to leave because I was not only broke now but so so unbelievably upset that I couldn’t get the money back or fix the time he started taking things again. 

Abuse isn’t just abuse. It’s being trapped so you can’t leave even if you want to. Emotionally trapped even if you want to leave. 

It’s not you, it’s a version of you who has gone stir crazy and mad from living in a invisible cage. Alone. Isolated. And not health left. Just going mad. 

That’s how I see it. I try to make sense of some things, like safety and comprehending abusers, but not that so much. I did my best, but I was not myself at all. 

BPD is a common and pretty crazy seeming result of abuse. Not everyone with bpd has been abused, but a lot of people who have it have, so if you wanna look up any traits to change you can always look through their advice forums. Help yourself find grounding. 

But just be honest with yourself imo. Dinner be shy from who you have ever been. You don’t need any more mental issues. Just be honest. It’s okay. You can accept yourself even if it’s hard.

It's so hard. You have to be tough on yourself and gentle with yourself at the same time. You had to accept defeat to be able to get out. My reframe is best through kids, so I hope this helps - Consider a baby learning to walk. He knows that's his goal months before he can do it. He watches everyone around him walking. He tries and *can't* do it. He builds up the muscles in his legs until he can stand, but he still can't do it. He falls down and hurts himself and gets scared, even stops trying for a time.  He hangs onto nearby things, but still can't do it. He goes through months and months of struggles and accomplishments before actually reaching his goal. You think he looks back and thinks ""I could've been doing this from 6 months old"" or ""how dare I fall down trying""? No, he was *always* working towards the life he wanted, and so were you! The goal was to make it out alive, and you did! Thank that other version of you that never gave up! You **needed** her to get where you are now!"

"By realizing that my unfavorable reactions were actually trauma responses.

By loving myself the way they wouldn’t.

By going to therapy and/or having a support system with which I can process my  own guilt and shame and all the complicated nuances that go along with it.

By allowing myself to be angry and knowing that’s the part of me that loves me & cares about how I’m treated. 

By extending kindness to others with intention because I never know what that person is going through behind closed doors. 

By realizing that abuse is a learned behavior and having gratitude for the fact that despite having grown up in abuse and then in an IPV situation, I was the one trying not to continue that cycle while everyone else dug their head into the sand.

Also that being abused is a “learned behavior” aka…we learn that’s what love looks like when we’ve been exposed to DV as children. So I didn’t know better until I did and when I did know better, I aimed to do better.

By having gratitude that I am capable of treating people with respect and kindness and I can take accountability and I don’t have to hide who I am unlike my abuser who is living a constant lie. 

It’s a hard road and I see you. 💜"	Traditional-Dig1518	reply	na	na	na	0.04598098248243332	no	strong	no	na	domesticviolence	failed

I got out last week and my dog and I found a hotel that I paid a week ahead . The hotel gave my abuser a key and told him my room number when I clearly let them know that I wanted nobody but me to get a key. The dv shelter is full and the homeless shelter won’t let me keep my dog and she’s my heart and she keeps me sane she is also traumatized herself . He was able to catch me by surprise and blacked my eyes choked me and I was finally able to run out the door . The hotel told me I had to leave and he was gone by time police arrived . They would not give me any money back due to the damage he caused in the room . Again they gave him the key wrongfully.He has been able to dodge being served protective orders due to his connections in the dept . I’ve been in my car now for 3 days but I’m scared he’s gonna find me and finish me off . It seems like everyone knows him in this town and he has everyone believing he’s a great guy. I feel like I have no options and I feel so alone . I have no idea what to do next as I can’t get a room until I get paid next week . Any advice greatly appreciated .

Do you have any friends/family that you can stay with? I’m sorry you’re experiencing this but know he is a horrible guy, and people will see that soon enough. He hides it pretty well but don’t let that discourage you from what actually happened. I’d also never stay in one place or places that he’d know you go. If there a protective order keep a paper copy on you. I hope some of my advice helps🩷	OptionFabulous2510	reply	na	na	na	0.9988762736320496	strong	no	strong	na	domesticviolence	failed
"I am so sorry you are going through this. 

I worked at a large chain hotel and we were trained that if the name wasn't on the reservation you DID NOT give them a key. I am in U.S. so rules may be different. And I don't know if you have the energy right now, but I'd try to take that complaint higher up the chain. Call them out on every socail media site if necessary. They are complicit with him assaulting you. They should return all of the money paid, comp your entire stay. Find out who actually owns and manages that hotel, if the on site managememt won't assist you, call corporate. The place I was at was a franchise with a management company running it, so compalints could be made to the chain, the management company, the investors, and on site management - and the higher up the complaint the faster we had to fix it! 

They let him in, you didn't, that is not your responsibilty. If you paid with a credit card, contact their fraud department and tell them you were overcharged - they can do a chargeback and the hotel has to fight up. American Express almost always won when I tried to fight thoss chargebacks, so I really hope you paid with Amex!! 

Wyndham Hotels should be concerned with guest safety, they let a dangerous person in your room! They, and they alone bare the liabilty for all that happened, not just the damage to the hotel but to you as well.

This reminds me, I was in a hotel shortly after leaving my abuser. He found out where I was, came to the hotel (it was a Marriott) and was refused at the front desk. They told me the next day that they had to ask him to leave when he started wandering the halls yelling my name. Thankfully, I was unaware of his actions and safely in another area of the hotel. This is just to reiterate that hotel employees KNOW BETTER than to give someone who is not registered a key to your room. 


I hope you find peace. Truckers can be some of the most protective people around, you should be safe with them. Take care of yourself and your furry friend!

I know this wouldn’t be ideal, but there are vet offices and animal shelters who will temporarily care for and return your dog to you so that you can establish safety/stay in a shelter yourself etc. Might be worth looking into locally. Also, contact a DV agency if you haven’t already. The advocates will know the most about options and local resources and can help you. Good luck!

Thank you for advice. I did reach out to legal aid to see options I have . Wyndham basically told me it would be my word against the hotels but I assumed they could check records and camera and see they gave the key to him . I  became isolated from everyone no family or friends . He must have had that planned so when I hit bottom he thinks I’ll need to come back to him .As far as the shelter , it doesn’t have spots . I have videos and screen shots that show a lot of his abuse yet still people cant see thru his facade . I called 211 and the places that they listed all have no vacancies. I feel so defeated . I have copies of protective orders but they say they aren’t effective until he is served which he has always eluded. I feel like the system is broken and it puts people in situations they feel so hopeless and vulnerable. I’ve been parking at truck stop since they are always open but that scares me also. I would post screen shots but I think it’s against rules . This town is so corrupt I wish I could get out of here . The looks I have gotten the past few days when my eyes were so swollen and bruised made me feel so judged . If people only knew how low I feel already . I feel ashamed I allowed him to abuse me in first place.	OptionFabulous2510	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9988762736320496	weak	strong	no	na	domesticviolence	failed
I did contact the customer service line for Wyndham . The representative was very condescending and I just wanted to cry . I already feel defeated enough . She said someone would be in touch . I would think the least they could do is refund me the money that I had paid for remaining days to at least help me get in another place. The general manager denied any wrong doing on their side when I tried speaking to him about it. He had audacity to be upset that my blood was on wall as if it was something I did intentionally. Why are people like this? I hope they never go thru the hell I have been this week. I really hope things start looking up soon .

"They were just shitty people, excuse my language. Go higher. Keep calling until you get someone who listens. Do not let them re-victimize you!

"I think most of us have been here. Wondering if we should leave, I mean we know it’s bad but is it really THAT bad? Or we are separated, have escaped but we are being love bombed by a pro, and we MISS that person SO MUCH! Right? We can so easily forget, for a few, critical moments, the hell we endured and make a call we could spend years regretting. 
Here is what you need to do. Sit down with a pad of paper. If possible make it a legal pad. Fold it in half long ways, so you have two columns, ok? On the top of the left column write ‘Negative’ and on the top of the right column write ‘Positive’. Now comes the hard part. Start to write down every single bad thing your abuser has ever done to you. Each memory or event gets its own line, alright? Each name they called you gets its own line. Each lie, each shitty statement, each slur, bullshit story, every lazy-assed excuse. No doubling up with hash marks. If they called you a name 4 times, then friend, that’s 4 lines. Every assault, each bruise. If they did something really nice, but you found out later it was to manipulate you? It gets listed in both columns. Have a box of tissue near by, because doing this will hurt, Ima not going to lie. What usually happens, what definitely happened to me anyway is that a whole mess of memories came flooding back that I had managed to bury. It was not pretty. When you get to the bottom of the page start a whole new page, ok? keep going until there are no more memories left. Then do the same thing with the Positive memory column.

What you are going to find is this: Pages and pages of shocking, violent behavior, written in YOUR HAND. Once you see it is extremely hard to ignore. Pages of reminders that there are damn good reasons to stay far away from this person. Reasons that you do not want to call and just hear their voice. Reasons that you don’t give a damn what they are doing now, as long as they are far away from you!  Reasons that you do not want your children to grow up listening to the words on those pages as they are screamed at you, or seeing you treated as you have been on those pages. They will grow up thinking that is normal, and that is what love means, when we know that this is so very far from love and care.

What makes you feel empathy for your abuser? So many reasons, I would imagine. You are a naturally caring and empathetic person, and they are adept at manipulating the people around they are adept at getting their needs met. He or she is a con artist, and as such they pay keen attention, sensing the weaknesses of others and exploiting them. Abusers are ruthless enough to choose women who are mothers, and men who have experienced loss or trauma which make them vulnerable. They enjoy the sense of power it gives to hurt them and create as much fear and confusion as they can. This is not love, OP. This is coercion and emotional abuse.

Whenever you are tempted to contact your abuser?  Pull out your list and look at it. REALLY take it in, every line. The sorry showing of positive things next to the list of horrible fearful hurt that you have had to absorb. That is imbedded deep inside you. That this person dared call love. 

I want to give you all a very hard earned gift: When the abuse started in my marriage I stayed. I sounded very similar to many of you, I was so in love. He was my soulmate, and I just ‘knew’ that somehow things would get better, because he would always promise to do better. He would promise to change. So I stayed. However things did not improve, and everything kept getting worse, and got scarier. Over the years my son and I learned how to be silent, be still until we knew what kind of mood Daddy was in when he came home. We learned to walk on egg shells. By the time I finally escaped I was almost broken, but I thought I had been successful in protecting my son from harm.  I didnt realize that until years later, when he had his first serious relationship as an adult that I was dead wrong. I watched in horror as he became involved with a woman who was just abusive as hell, and when I said something to him he just smiled and said “Dont worry Mom, it really isnt that bad. I know that she can change. She wants to do better.” I wanted to cry. The years they were together were a snapshot of my life with his dad. By staying I had taught him to be a perfect domestic violence victim. Dont make the same mistake I did. Take that list out. Look at it, then look at your son, your daughter. Look at yourself, ok? Believe that you all deserve better than that list, than that poor assed excuse offered up as love. because that is not love, dear hearts. That is abuse."

"I am so glad. Our relationships are complicated, with so much promise in the beginning, that even if there are red flags waving in the breeze, we see them as wonderful harbingers of the joy to come, like happy ships bobbing on the water. As the abuse begins its so…odd, and off feeling, isn’t it? I wanted to look at my partner and say ‘Hun, take a bromide or something. You’re clearly not well.’ Of course it didn’t help that I came from a family where verbal abuse was commonplace, so things had to get pretty harsh before I even noticed it as abusive. 

As you write your list, beware of becoming hard on yourself for staying in your relationship, or ‘allowing’ the abuse to happen, or any variety of self criticism that starts to creep in. If every person with abusive intent were to be transparent when we met, and began our date with “Hi! My name is Suzanne! It’s SUCH a pleasure to meet you, because you look like a guy I can pretty much manipulate easily…yep. Very trusting, sweet-tempered, vulnerable, have had a few bad experiences and you still wear your heart on your sleeve?? Well, My Sweet! Are you ready for a Life In Hell?? I plan on making you crazy, jealous, taking all of your money, making you feel awful…”

See, they never do that, do they? It’s the long game that they are playing. The long con. Con men and women, which I recently found out stands for Confidence Men or Confidence Women, people who gain the confidence of unsuspecting others for the purpose of taking advantage of them. So essentially our abusers are emotional gangsters, they are thieves and con artists who steal away our trust, love, faith, joy and hope. Not for always, but for a time. That this happened is not because we are ‘bad or ‘stupid’ or any other negative bit of self talk I hit upon myself… it’s because we are people who had open hearts, who trusted and cared.

"Your protection order was already signed by a judge for a full year? Or you are waiting for your next court date?

Unless you got the order the day or week before your birthday that is odd. You could try walking into your nearest precinct with the physical order printed and show them the text your abuser sent you. 

Also reread the order to make sure it includes all contact , not just harassing contact. 

It never hurts reaching out to a victim advocate center either, they often have free legal help.

Reach out to an advocate for help finding out. Once a PPO is granted by the judge, it’s then your responsibility to have the other person served. This could mean hiring a process server, having a friend/family serve them, having an officer serve them, etc. Only once that happens and the court receives documentation that it’s been properly served does the PPO become valid “in the system.”	EyeConscious2650	reply	na	na	na	0.9991412162780762	no	no	no	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.
My cousin was physically violent towards my aunt and grandma and so my aunt filed a restraining order against her. Nobody in my family will take her in because she has physically harmed people and no one wants to be physically harmed by her. She was living with her boyfriend who she consistently gets in fights with. He has physically abused her and now she is also pregnant with his child. She is with a teacher from her high school right now but the teacher can’t keep her for longer than next week after her planned parenthood appointment. My cousin refuses to go to domestic violence center or homeless shelter because she thinks she’s beneath it or something idk but I don’t want her on the street but she can’t go back to her abusive boyfriend so I am trying to find out where she can go that’s not a domestic violence shelter or homeless shelter but that can give her a place to stay and get her life back on track and maybe some counseling too.

"OP, do you know if she is has applied for Medicaid yet? I believe she is eligible for WIC program, and there might be an expedited program for housing available for her since she is expecting. That she is unable, or unwilling to control her anger, and directs it towards people is a real problem. Is reacting with physical violence within her range of ‘normal angry’ behavior in past years? If this is something new, I wonder if she has been seen by a doctor for a complete physical work-up. Things like having problems with thyroid not functioning correctly, or heaven knows what may be causing her shift. If she hasn’t been seeing a therapist yet to learn how to manage her anger, it will be very hard on her once she becomes a parent to handle the stress that comes with being a new mother.

It’s a very popular genre and MANY non-abusive people watch crime shows so I can’t see how that would be a red flag although I’d keep an ear out for what his assessment is of whatever it is he’s watching.  If for example he usually blames the victims or gets some kind of enjoyment out of seeing the pain/suffering, laughs and treats it as no big deal when someone’s hurt etc then I’d be concerned	Newlywed2021	reply	na	na	na	0.9938651919364929	no	no	no	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.
Idk, I've always loved true crime. My biggest binge watching forensic files was when I worked night shift at a seedy hotel. I found it just made me pay more attention to details in case something happened. Honestly, if you think he's studying to kill you just leave, cause either way you'll always be suspicious.

"actually i had a relationship with an absolute psychopath. he wouldn’t watch true crime shows. he said he preferred vanilla sex. 
because he wanted to cover up that he is a walking true crime show and a sex addict. he also never hit me to make it hard to believe he was abusive. psychological abuse is awful. 
but in the end when he was really trying to kill me he warned me by playing these songs about being in love with a woman and then murdering her, and said it makes him think of me. “well the love part” 
i said not even when you are frustrated with me? “no i could never hurt you” “but you do every day anyway so i don’t believe you”
i have a restraining order and i am alive. 

true crime shows are interesting and entertainment, psychology is fascinating. i wouldn’t call that a red flag, i would watch how he treats animals though. all of them. and other people. and if he tries to control you or insult you, especially in a passive aggressive way."

I'm just wondering how much, if at all, does thinking about them become less? Some days he's just background noise in my head, and other days I can't stop thinking and just have to take the day as each minute and hour come.

Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind was one of the movie I referred to a lot, during the healing period.  

Truth is, yes it gets easier.  I kept myself really busy so that helped pushing the thought of him and all the ""what if's"" away.  Frequency of nightmares declined over time.  It never completely stops, but it has now become a distant memory that doesn't hurt me anymore.  Rather, it motivated me to bring more awareness to the seriousness of domestic violence.

The one thing I wish I had done differently, is that I should have gone to a therapist sooner.  Because PTSD is real.  Mine was just so suppressed for 13 years, until an angry client shouted at me.

"I just pressed charges on my ex. he sprained my wrist and gave me a chest contusion by trying to make me stay, holding me down, and pretending he was going to punch me. there were some sexual assaults in the relationship. I learned he had 2 ex wives and a kid -- he told me he had no kids and was never married. we were only together 9 months.

the reason I was brave enough to press charges is because I learned his first wife -- he almost killed him, her and their 3 month old intentionally in a car accident when she wanted to leave him. the day she left him, he beat her up and dragged her into his car, she jumped out in traffic -- his intention was to kill the both of them on the expressway. she said she didn't press charges but he got arrested. his second wife he financially exploited. she paid his child support, a downpayment for his fancy Japanese racing car and basically gave him a place to live while he smoked weed and fucked around. 

with me, he got sober (so he said) and was very codependent. the abuse set in after several months. I realized he never had a stable job in his life, he got angry over me asking little things like not to scrape the pans with forks or to close the lid to the washer. he said I was belittling him. I began asking him to leave 4 months in and that's when he began cornering me, holding me down, etc. 

I'm scared now I am his target. I am trying to pack as fast as I can with a sprained hand. I just didn't want this to happen to another woman. I'm scared of court as he will humiliate me and use all the deep secrets I told him in the beginning against me. 

has anyone been in a similar situation? can you please share advice on what to do? I'm having to build from the bottom up as he wrecked my finances. yes, therapy, I KNOW, but I could use some HUMAN to human chatting on how YOU survived. reading through this thread... it seems like most go back...so...who hasn't? for those of you that didn't go back, what did you do?"	kittypaintsflowers	post	27.062752260732807	male	White	0.9976340532302856	na	na	na	36	domesticviolence	no prediction.
"DV prosecutor here. I recommend you speak with your prosecutor office’s advocate and the prosecutor assigned to the case. Your fears about him “humiliating you” with dark secrets you told him are unnecessary. Courts have very strict rules about what is admissible and what is not, and nothing that you may have told him will be admissible, meaning that a judge would never let him bring it up. 

Also, if you have a protection order in place, don’t feel like you need to flee like some of these other comments are saying. They likely mean well, but that kind of attitude serves only to cause you to reconsider whether you can stay strong with leaving him. You can. If you have a protection order (and you should), call 911 the second he violates it. Get good locks and doorbell cameras. Consider self defense weapons. But you should be able to stand your ground and stay in your home. You are powerful."	kittypaintsflowers	reply	na	na	na	0.9976340532302856	no	no	no	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.
"I’m rebuilding too. I didn’t have anywhere to go permanently or have the option to infinitely appease my abuser that wouldn’t jeopardize my child’s life. 

I’m relocating. That will be a temporary safety fix because private investigators exist. Relocating is helping financially because of the job being higher paying. Not that I was broke before but single parenting with daycare expenses is flexing the credit card to float month to month. I’ll be able to save again with the new job even before my child ages into school. 

For when abuser breaks in here or there or wherever I turned my weekend gun hobby into full time carrying concealed. Police can only help me when his violations are communication based. They won’t be here fast enough when he attempts his revenge. 

The attempt to embarrass you with secrets literally doesn’t matter except to you. It’s not going to change the outcome of the criminal case for him. I know the fear. It was hard to shake at the beginning of the legal processes not knowing what mattered and what didn’t. My abuser did the typical creative fiction writing where I was crazy, actually the abuser, attacked him, tried to kill my unborn child, etc. literally doesn’t matter. He’s a broke felon living on mommy’s couch with no visitation. 

Therapy has helped a little. More than I expected. It can’t remove all of the PTSD but it helps keep me grounded on the right amount of vigilance and supports me when my family makes stupid comments about gender, relationships, and my situation.

"i know better than to take mine back and my family and friend would fight me tooth and nail to make sure I never put my kid back in that situation.  I think I might have stayed with no kid, but i think he wouldnt have started beating me if we hadn't had a kid too.  I would advise telling people the truth, like, not oversharing, but be frank about it if it comes up.  Screw feeling any shame about this (i am saying this for myself to read too...its hard), so many people from all walks of life fall into this trap.  I want to see the best in everyone and i have suffered for this off and on for most of my life.  But overall you'd be surprised by how many people are sympathetic and how many of them went through this or had friends who did.  His actions since I got the protective order have kept my mind on track as far as not taking him, back, too.  Iwent through the first few days feeling horrible about leaving after his last violent tantrum, he texted me to half apologize for ""being mean"" and I felt validated for the first time in years.  3 days later i re-read it and wondered why i found that validating at all, i think i just needed some reassurance from sane people to start thinking it through.  Knowing that he is now trying to claim that he was abused and lie in court  i regret not pressing charges, in theory i still could but i don't bruise easily and i can't convince myself to ruin his life that thoroughly, I would love an uncontested divorce but he's going to try to pry every penny out of me that he can, which will possibly cost me tens of thousands to fight.  Considering i will never see a dime from him in child support he's just stealing even more from his own kid when i feel like he already stole years from his kids childhood.  Focus on the negatives when it comes to your relationship, the good times were at worst a complete lie, and at best just gone...there's no going back to those days they are over.

The folks at the women's shelter have been a godsend, so if you have not called yours yet please consider it.  They found me resources for legal services and mental health support, and even arranged for me to talk with a lawyer, and had an advocate accompany me to court on very short notice.  I feel bad using those resources because I feel like i should have the means to sort this out without them, but on a psychological level i need them right now, its hard to keep my head straight and not panic about court dates (he's already trying to amend the no contact order, i have two court dates this month).

First time I got black eye I took him to court but I asked for case to be closed like a dumb ass bc I “loved” him. Then it just kept happening. Trauma bond is real. And girl I get what u saying 100% I told him secrets too. Embarrassing ones. I’m over it now…. If he tells people ima tell them he made it up or forced me to comply to his sick lie. Fuck it.

"I did not go back, fought a court case and faced my abuser for months throughout the process. I was lucky in the sense I had a support system and moved in with my parents which provided safety. so I was able to give my victim impact statement without fear of retaliation at least in the immediate future.  My motivation to show up to every hearing even though it caused great pain was to make sure there’s a paper trail for the next woman. I fought for that felony charge to stick and it was exhausting but would never go back. I felt like I had my power that was taken from me “back”. 

I found myself longing for the connection again, I became addicted to the high highs and even low lows. He ALMOST killed me one night, locked me in a closet and broke into my apartment. I went back several times despite police interferences until that night that almost had taken my life.  I saw my life flash before me and once he finally left I thought to myself - there’s no next time. I need to get help or I’m dead. 

It will get better, and you have to fight like hell every day.  Yes, therapy is a necessity. you will find great healing by pressing charges and a profound sense of empathy by experiencing true hell and back to help other women. It has been 5 years since the abuse and I do not regret pressing charges criminally. 

You’re a survivor.

 Best  advice I got: 
If you’re moving to New York tell everyone (aside from family/safe space) you’re moving to Texas.

Block and go NO contact. You do not want any paper trail that could affect your case. They play dirty in the court room. 

If you can, deliver the victim impact statement in person. The judge can see directly the impact it had on you and they WILL remember."	kittypaintsflowers	reply	na	na	na	0.9976340532302856	no	strong	no	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.

Get your ducks lines up. He will make up all kinds of nonsense; let him. You have EVIDENCE which can't be ignored.

Police, lawyers and prosecutors will try to tell you the court doesn't want to see it but remember that it's your statement not theirs and his lawyers will claim no evidence so prepare. Print it out, notarise it and treat that statement like an essay you need an HD for. Get your evidence before the court. Seek copies of medical reports, work records anything you can secure to support your claims. There's more evidence than you realise and it all needs to be before the courts to show a consistent pattern of behaviour. Physical, mental, financial, sexual abuse and violence all of it. Ask the police lawyers and prosecutors to show you the personal violence, assault and DV legislation in your jurisdiction. Ask for the definitions of the terms. Become familiar with it because all of them know it but they also refuse to enforce it. If there's a women's legal service do your homework prep early and fit your statement into the legal definitions. Judiciary are playing academic games and prosecutors, police and defence lawyers are all messing with gendered violence in horrific ways to defend perpetrators rights. Know and understand your rights and how the state is SUPPOSED TO BE Protecting US ALL Equally BUT REFUSES TO Protect VICTIMS OF CRIME.

"(BIG HUGS) 

It's good that you pressed charges and that you're leaving.  I'll be honest, I went back a few times, because I was thousands of miles away from family and the only place I knew to run to was HIS mom.  She would let me stay for a few days then convinced me to give him another chance.  So I stupidly did... only to go through the cycle again.  He would be nice for a while, then somehow I was always doing something wrong again, then he lashes out on me... 

After a year of this, I was done.  I up and left with my purse and the clothes on my back.  Booked a flight on borrowed money, and got him out of my life.  I regret nothing!  It was literally the best decision I've ever made in my life!  Life only got better from that point on.  Yes the road to healing was long but nothing beats living a life without violence and constant fear for my life.

"I had some similarities with my ex. I internalized the constant belittling and held onto a lot for a long time after. It will take a long time to really understand the effects of the abuse but it is good you are taking a good first step.

My ex also held many secrets over me and threatened to use them against me. However, everyone is flawed. A judge will probably not act against you but realize how your ex is using this to control you. If the secrets are incriminating I would share them with you lawyer or a domestic violence advocate and they can counsel about how to defend yourself. 

I understand some things about your past can be sensitive. I have a close family member who had schizophrenia and my ex would say that I was ""crazy"" like that family member and the judge would see that and take my kids away. In hindsight I can see how false and irrational this is but it shows the depth of manipulation and mind control that abusers use.

"did your dad say he did things in love? I was trying to leave and my abuser pried my keys out of my hand, one finger at a time, spraining it (still can't fully use it almost a week and a half later) -- saying I couldn't let my trauma win, that I had to stay. that he was mad with love for me. 

then when I said he was abusive, that's when he slammed me on the bed with his whole body weight and gave me a chest contusion -- saying he was going to shower me in kisses and show me what abuse is. that's when he began to pretend he was going to punch me. was it warped like that for your dad in the way he justified what he did?"	kittypaintsflowers	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9976340532302856	no	strong	strong	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.

"Its part of the mind game twisted manipulation the abuser pours on the target.  

Slowly pick away the mind because it serves their purpose to control and abuse you. 

 You slowly lose your self-esteem (they chip away at you) not able to see what they are doing. 

 (You are unknowingly at the time, trying to survive so you won't be beaten walking on eggshells when around the abuser).   Its all part of their game. Psychologically mind @@@@! 

When instead you should be planning the escape.   They know what they are doing is what Iam saying you cant help it when you are in it.  Its awful.

"moreso he's \*trying\* to pull a darvo on the courts and for some reason i think this isnt their first rodeo :D I know whose fault this is, i have not been perfect but i never hit anyone or called them every slur i knew or threatened them.  I am glad I thought to gather what evidence i could before the last meltdown, i honestly thought things were getting better but i knew my 'better' was probably biased in his favor.  I was shocked when he told the judge he was afraid of me, but i did expect him to deny all of it.  Its why his text only apologized for being ""mean"" to me, he wanted to make sure he didn't say something i could use later.  He won't tell a soul what he's done and i expect the only way he knows how to sound convincing is to convince himself that his lies are the truth, but he's no dummy, he just thought i would keep putting up with being hit, even though i told him that was a deal breaker after the first time.  it took a bit longer to get out than i'd hoped but i did mean what i said at the time.

we broke up 25 years ago, too, he cheated on me and gaslit me about it and i told myself not to take him back then, i wish i'd listened.  he's had his second chance, and there's no turning back now, i accepted it when he cheated this time but the abuse was on another level.  i thought i knew him better than that, we'd been friends for so long.  but the flags were there i suppose. now i get to re-evaluate how it is that every single male friend of mine that i can think of was a narcissist and what got me there, that's going to take therapy."	kittypaintsflowers	reply	na	na	na	0.9976340532302856	no	strong	no	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.

YOU DONT WANT THIS. You basically have to sacrifice yourself for the narcissist. Who would willingly lose themselves for it?   You will have to carry inside you what the narc is inside himself.  Nothing a block hole.  He goes down you go down with him.

"***\*\*all context can be found in my original post*** [***here***](https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/15m6ijq/i_left_him_2_weeks_ago_and_i_cant_stop_breaking/)

I'm making this post to be separated from my original in hopes that some of you have gone through exactly what I'm feeling/thinking and know how to combat it so that I don't keep hurting myself by communicating with my abuser. We even have a temporary no contact order in place until his criminal hearing, but we've both broken it. I want to stop. I need to.

I swear, it's like a drug. I try so hard, I block him everywhere but he finds ways to reach out to me and he assumes I'm ""cheating"". I've already tried a friend's advice and called him and told him I didnt want to be with him anymore, to which he threatened suicide. It was so scary he literally was telling me to call an ambulance and everything. He's insane. He literally makes new email addresses, downloads apps to get a new temporary phone number, etc. 

But here's the thing: I did truly, and fully love him. I never did him wrong, I never wanted to. All I wanted was to be treated as someone of value whom he adored, and he only did that to kiss up for doing something wrong or to kiss ass so he could go out by himself.

I try to remind myself of how horrible this person is, how many times he's left me to cry alone after he said/did something that hurt me, etc. The catalyst to all of this was him beating me and strangling me, but I ***STILL*** can't help but want to talk to him. Like what the hell??? I advise you skim my original post to see what all he did/context on who I'm dealing with here. He's definitely a narcissist, no doubt about it. 

Please, I NEED to cut all ties for the sake of myself, my sanity, and my 3 month old daughter. She does not need to have trauma of seeing her daddy beat her mommy.

But what is it that makes me feel bad for him? Why do I get upset thinking about him with someone else potentially in the future?

How do I stop once and for all? How do I keep my mind from wandering and hurting thinking about being without him? "	dstine9	post	23.39643954377224	female	White	0.9966292977333069	na	na	na	12	domesticviolence	no prediction.
"OP, here is what you need to do. Sit down with a pad of paper. If possible make it a legal pad. Fold it in half long ways, so you have two columns, ok? On the top of the left column write ‘Negative’ and on the top of the right column write ‘Positive’. Now comes the hard part. Start to write down every single bad thing he has ever done to you. Each memory or event gets its own line, alright? Each name he has called you gets its own line. Each lie, each shitty statement, each slur, bullshit story, every lazy-assed excuse. No doubling up with hash marks. If he called you a name 4 times, then girlfriend, that’s 4 lines. Every assault, each bruise. Have a box of tissue near by, because doing this will hurt, Ima not going to lie. What usually happens, what definitely happened to me anyway is that a whole mess of memories came flooding back that I had managed to bury. It was not pretty. When you get to the bottom of the page start a whole new page, ok? keep going until there are no more memories left. Then do the same thing with the Positive memory column. 

What you are going to find is this: Pages and pages of shocking, violent behavior, written in YOUR HAND. OP, once you see it is extremely hard to ignore. Pages of reminders that there are damn good reasons to stay far away from this person. Reasons that you do not want your daughter to grow up listening to the words on those pages as they are screamed at you, or seeing you treated as you have been on those pages. She will grow up thinking that is normal, and that is what love means, when we know that this is so very far from love and care. 

What makes you feel empathy for him? So many reasons, I would imagine. You are a naturally caring and empathetic person, and he is adept at manipulating the people around him to get his needs met. He is a con artist, and as such he’s adept at sensing the weaknesses of others and exploiting them. He is ruthless enough to choose women who are mothers, which make them vulnerable, and he enjoys the sense of power it gives him to hurt them and create as much fear and confusion as he can. This is not love, OP. This is coercion and emotional abuse. 

Whenever you are tempted to contact him pull out this list and look at it. REALLY take it in, every line. Now I am going to give you a gift: When the abuse started in my marriage I stayed. I sounded very similar to you, I was so in love. He was my soulmate, and I just ‘knew’ that somehow things would get better, so I stayed. However things did not improve, and everything kept getting worse, and got scarier. Over the years my son and I learned how to be silent, be still until we knew what kind of mood Daddy was in when he came home. we learned to walk on egg shells. By the time I finally escaped I was almost broken, but I thought I had been successful in protecting my son from harm.  I didnt realize that until years later, when he had his first serious relationship as an adult that I was dead wrong. I watched in horror as he became involved with a woman who was just abusive as hell, and when I said something to him he just smiled and said “Dont worry Mom, it really isnt that bad. I know that she can change. She wants to do better.” I wanted to cry. The years they were together were a snapshot of my life with his dad. By staying I had taught him to be a perfect domestic violence victim. Dont make the same mistake I did. Take that list out. Look at it, then look at your daughter, ok? Believe that you both deserve better than that list, than that poor assed excuse offered up as love. because that is not love, OP. That is abuse.

"Personally, I would say start doing affirmations to yourself to say that you’re going to be with people who love you and treat you like they love you and that when you love them, they acknowledged that you love them. I would either repeat that in your mind multiple times a day or say it once in the morning or once at night very seriously if you are safe to say things out loud. 

I think this would make it very helpful for you so that when you naturally are looking for love, you will start to not reach for him just naturally, because the way that he reaches to you is not loving and it does not fit what the affirmation is that I wrote out . But it would make it very painless for you, because you would actually start drifting towards healthy relationships for your emotional regulation.

Abusers make it so that they not only ruin your emotional regulation, but they abuse you, until you have to depend on them to stop abusing you therefore they own your dopamine they own turning off your stress they own turning off like your end of your rope feelings, and you’re s**cidal feelings . They make it so that emotionally when you feel happy you want to go to him and when you want to feel happy you want to go to him so when you’re sad you go to him as well. 

It is maladaptive, and it’s very complicated to rewire, if you look up emotional regulation and se**al health things that could help you. 

but just keep telling yourself you can absolutely figure this out and you can do this!!!!! Try new methods until you find something that works!

You need to change your phone number tomorrow, make yourself a new email and start transferring your personal stuff to it and most importantly you need to call the police and report him for breaking the no contact order every time he does it.

I understand fully loving someone who is awful, but at a certain point you have to draw a line. I DIDN’T have a baby to protect and I drew the line. You just HAVE to, there is no other choice.

"TW: abuse, csa, suicide, homophobia

I've never posted here before but I found this subreddit and I have nowhere else to go.

Having said that, I am going to do my best to summarize the situation. This is my first time doing this so I apologize if I break any rules/guidelines, please bear with me. I don't know where else to post this so if this is beyond the scope of the subreddit topic, it was not intentional and I apologize.

Basically my parents have been abusive my entire life. They spent my childhood violently arguing with one another to the point police and a social worker were involved, and they blamed me for the entire thing. I spent years with a savior complex as a young child and teen trying to save my family from fighting because I genuinely believed I was responsible until I got burned out and finally gave up. 

Fast forward a few years and the abuse continues. I see a doctor who diagnoses me with PTSD but I assume it's just from the fighting my parents did. Unfortunately the real reason was much much worse but we'll get to that. Said doctor recommends I get on medication (I have other issues besides PTSD that she diagnosed me with including clinical depression) but parents won't give me any. Eventually a therapist literally threatens to call the police on my parents for child neglect and put me in the hospital for a forced wellness stay. I was 17 at the time.  So I got my meds but only because it benefitted them to not be in jail. 

I tried to make things work with them I really did. I tried being nice to them, apologizing even when I didn't do anything wrong, and doing what they wanted without questioning them. They taught me that their approval is the most important thing I could ever want. But it was never enough. They kept berating me, insulting me, and asserting I was the problem and that they could do no wrong. And to make things worse they pretended it never happened at all unless I could ""prove"" that they actually said anything. When I brought up something they did I was always lying unless I basically held court of law and outsmarted them and forced them to admit they had said the hurtful thing. Then it was ""Ok maybe I did say that but you're overreacting, it's not a big deal"" and I got berated and demeaned for my intelligence in figuring out how to trap them in a lie. They would viciously insult me and when I called them out on it they would say I was the problem for being offended. Because of course, they can do no wrong. 

Some of the things they told me are (keep in mind the TW at the beginning, here's where it gets rough)

To kill myself

Threatened (and attempted) to physically attack me

That I would die of AIDS (because I'm bisexual)

That I was an ""embarrassment""

That I'm ""sad"" and ""pathetic""

That I'm a ""pathological liar""

The f-slur, pretty self explanatory 

Called people I associated with the f-slur, called my boyfriend at the time the f-slur

Accused me of having an incestuous relationship with my younger brother (as a way to retaliate, they don't like that I stick up for him because he has to deal with the same things I do, this incensed me to no end and they knew it because he and I are very close as a result of the stuff they put us through and I would do anything for him and the very thought of that accusation makes me want to vomit.)

That I'm a failure

That I'm ""sick"" and ""disgusting""

Keep in mind they never will admit to doing or saying any of these things and if they did they would downplay it.

&#x200B;

I will clarify that my mother is mostly the insulting one here, but my father is complicit and supports her actions. Every major act of abuse perpetrated against me however, they were both responsible for. My father on the other hand is the one who threatened to and carried out physical violence against me and continues to deny it to this day. I avoid talking to him because he is extremely violent and every disagreement with him carries the risk that he will hit me. 

I eventually started standing up for myself because I saw that nothing would satisfy them. This made them EXTREMELY angry. They don't like being called out or being held accountable. Having said that, I anticipated their wrath would end up in them throwing me out so I reached out so some friends I made online and they said they would help me if anything went south. It goes exactly as you would expect, parents kick me out and I go to stay with them. Unfortunately I was both desperate and naive in choosing these particular friends, I had no one else to fall back on and they were always supposed to be online friends that I could distance myself from if any toxic behavior emerged. I imagine my parents being abusive didn't help either because I never had an example of what a good friend/relationship should look like. Things didn't work out and I became homeless.

The entire time my parents were stalking me, constantly terrorizing me with nonstop calls, email, and texts. They attempted to hack into my email, they succeeded in breaking into my bank account, and by their own admission they hired a private detective to hunt me down. They also tracked down my best friend from high school via tax records and showed up unannounced at his home and interrogated him and his girlfriend. He had no idea where I was so they continued to harass him for weeks. I found a social worker who helped me with getting a job, housing, and schooling but somewhere along the line I made the mistake of reading their emails. I caved and gave into their guilt-tripping because at this point, they had no one else to manipulate and emotionally drain so they needed me back at their house so I could be their emotional bloodbag. So I went back to their place to endure even more abuse.

This backsliding is even more of a surprise when you consider the following: I had a therapist while I was away and he was extremely helpful. We made a lot of progress and he helped me process a lot of what happened. Eventually I told him about my PTSD diagnosis and where I thought it was really from, and he said it was blatantly obvious just by looking at me I was right. Apparently I had been sexually abused as a child, not just by anybody, but by my father. When we finally discussed this I broke down crying in his office. It was a hard time for me. He recommended I meet with a legal counsel to file a cease and desist letter to my parents, and the counsel who I eventually met with said if that didn't work she could actually file a restraining order against them. So basically I have doctors, therapists, abuse hotline people and a literal law expert telling me not to go back, yet I did anyway. In my mind their approval was the only thing that mattered. I was a fool. To top things off, my mother insinuated that she knew about my sexual abuse but just didn't care, all she had to say was a statement about how that was the only reason I was bisexual because she thinks all queer people are like that because they were abused as kids.

Eventually they put me in this Christian College I didn't want to go to but they made me go anyway (I'm not even a christian, it was the conservative evangelical type and I'm literally bisexual so do the math) because I wanted their approval. My mental health was beyond the breaking point already but now I had to keep up with classes and homework, which I of course did not do well at. I had a boyfriend, once, but he was one of the people I met online I mentioned earlier. Seeing as things did not work out with him, I eventually lost the battle I was fighting ever since I broke up with him, the battle to not attempt suicide. I placed my entire emotional well-being on his subjective opinion of me because I was looking for an escape from my parents who made me feel like less than nothing. But I see now that was a mistake because I traded one master for another. He initially told me a bunch of nice things to butter me up but when it wasn't convenient to have me around anymore he tossed me aside like a used toy. You can imagine the shock and horror from an abused kid who placed all his hopes on one guy, blindly believed his lies out of desperation when in reality all he wanted was some cheap entertainment.

&#x200B;

So I attempted suicide. How is not important but I was put in the psych ward after being discharged from the hospital. All my father had to say when I called him was that he was angry at me for trying to kill myself. No concern, only anger. Not even the anger that comes from someone who is worried about you, just anger. He then went on to say I was stupid because I would have gone to Hell if I died because I'm not a Christian. My mother was no better, she just made things about herself and completely ignored the fact I was in immense pain. They don't even being it up anymore except to throw it in my face when they tell me I failed my classes. 

&#x200B;

Fast forward a few months and I make the mistake of meeting someone else online. The same exact thing happens where he tells me I can stay with him if they kick me out. So this time, they find my Facebook page where I had innocuously posted some things alluding to my sexuality. They found it and immediately attacked me, they busted down my door and demanded I remove all the ""offensive"" posts. I told them no, it's not your Facebook account and that they had no right telling me what to do with my online presence. They came back saying if people they knew found out I was bi, I would become an ""embarrassment"" and ""tarnish their image"". They said they didn't want to ""give the illusion"" they were ""associating"" with ""someone like me"". So I told them that's their problem that they think this way and that maybe they need new friends who don't really care about other people's personal business. So they kick me out over a Facebook post and had the audacity to blame me for it. I once again move in with a less than ideal person because I had no other options. 

A few months later and I'm stranded at a hotel having just run out of money. I have nowhere to go and I'm going to be sleeping on the sidewalk if I don't do anything. My father suggests over the phone I come back, again. Which I do. Because I'm an idiot. 

&#x200B;

This brings us to the present where things are escalating once again. It's the same cycle, I stand up for myself, they get mad and kick me out, they have no one to abuse so they act nice and guilt-trip me into coming back, things are ok for awhile until they start behaving badly, I stand up for myself, I get kicked out. 

&#x200B;

But the last two times completely exhausted my resources of fake ""friends"" and money. I have a part-time job but it doesn't make anywhere near enough to sustain me living independently. I am out of contacts, out of money, out of willpower, and out of options. I have no idea what to do. Do I suck it up and continue to allow them to abuse me just so I can have a place to sleep? Do I sleep out on the sidewalk and potentially get robbed/arrested for loitering/raped/freeze/overheat to death? I am beyond broken at this point. I can barely take care of myself as it is and I have my mother on one side constantly degrading my mental health with her incessant verbal abuse, and on the other hand I literally have to live with the man who sexually abused me as a child and got away with it. I don't know what to do, someone please give me some sort of advice. "	AlmightyRizMoe	post	21.234634269190334	male	White	0.9767491817474365	na	na	na	3	domesticviolence	no prediction.
You can do this. You can get through the tough part and make a good life for yourself. It’s time to be free from your damaged parents and their abuse. Look up every possible resource in your area that might possibly give you temporary shelter and go from there.

Thank you. I am pretty isolated so I don't get much support but this helps knowing that someone out there is rooting for me.

I’m sure this is terrifying, but look at all you have survived, with your humanity and spirit intact! Nothing out there is as bad as what you are leaving behind. Over the next months, you will find a place to live—maybe sharing with other kids just starting out, maybe renting a room with a nice family—and finding your people and starting to think about what you are going to do with your freedom. Your whole life is ahead of you and your godawful parents and everything they put you through is in the past. You are going to triumph.

"Hi, I've never posted to here but I'm lost. My ex who I was with is now in jail for several charges. The night of the incident we where bolth very drunk, he was charged on many things some being not true.  They placed a 10 year no contact order and now as much as I know im better off it hurts. I don't wanna see him go away for years I want him to get help. He is not what there making him out to be, but he also has his own issues. He needs help not this. I'm okay but then I feel bad. 
It hurts. I made it clear to the courts that I was in fact drunk and did invite him over to my home, 
He is being charged with residential burglary! It's not true I just am not sure how much I can help. Aside from that he will face what he actually did.

"No buddy. It’s okay. This is quite literally the best thing for you. The best thing for him would be prison time. Instant gratification addicts and abusers need time to stop hurting people. Time to actually sit and be forced to think a real thought without a greedy thought popping up or a painless tought popping up when learning and responsibilities are painful. 

And no. I’m so sorry but No he doesn’t need help, he doesn’t LIKE help. He doesn’t WANT help. He doesn’t WANT to be good to you. He loves telling you he’s broken, he’s sad, life’s too hard. He likes your response when he says things like that. He likes using you. 

What he does want is excuses and reasons to continue living how he does Scott free. 

I’m sorry you probably miss him and I’m being kinda super blunt. And I apologize because I know you don’t wanna feel any worse than you do. But maybe just shut off the shame. Maybe just tell it to stop. Stop questioning yourself. Stop asking how to fix this or see him again. Those are not good for you or him. Don’t enable you or him to hurt yourselves or other people. 

Try to focus on the positive minor things occurring around you in your daily life that aren’t from this volatile roller coaster relationship. It’s less exciting, it’s almost painfully boring.

It’s standard in most jurisdictions to make pretrial no contact orders last for many years. That way if a defendant fails to show up for court and goes onto warrant status, the order remains in place and can be prosecuted if the defendant is caught violating it years later. I used to draft my pretrial no contact orders to last for 50 years, though now I typically just go for 10. The order doesn’t actually last that long—it’s only in place until the case is resolved, at which point a new post-conviction order may or may not replace it.

Maybe just use someone else’s address at this point who you don’t live with. Idk. Or take drastic measures. Ffs it os so exhausting when they stalk you I’m so sorry. 

What are the only things that helped my soccer take a break? I’m actually probably had between 10 and 20 in my lifetime so I just have one of those faces and personalities and everything I guess. — do actually not just one two of the things that helped is a friend signed up their original email and phone number for tons of spam. Apparently abusers get distracted by literally anything if they get attention from literally anything they might put less harassment into harassing you. 

The second thing that I think is very important, is breaking the abusers limerance . They live in a fake world, and they tell them selves all kinds of things that are completely not true. So things like he or she loves me so much.. they want me to stock them because they love me so much. 

Basically, if you end up in any contact with them, or would like to break that limit, I would say directly telling them I do not like being around you and then give them specific examples where they would tell them selves and tell you oh, I did such a great job and you tell them I did not like this and this and this that you did it hurt it was uncomfortable I told you it was bad you did not listen to me. I did not like it and I never want to be around you because you did that to me .

Hi everyone. I reported domestic violence about an hour and a half ago in my apartment building on the neighbor I share a wall with (I’m in the Los Angeles county). The police showed up an hour later and knocked but there was no response so they left. The screaming and hitting/throwing of things had stopped by the time they arrived but I’m a bit confused. Is this usually protocol? Knock and leave if no response? This is the second day in a row I hear things escalating and I will continue to call if I need to, but feel it’s useless if they just show up and leave if no one answers the door.

I am literally also fighting to not be suffocated and thrown and hit by someone that is three times bigger than me. When it escalates I have my hands full. 

I was really wishing on neighbors to help me and we moved lots of places at different times, and no one called the cops on him not even a single time.

Guess what has gotten us seperate. One of the MANY people he’s also attacked, they called the police for themselves. Got us kicked out of our housing, and we miraculously split without him forcing me to be with him. It’s been a while and I’m so relieved that the abuser is out of my life. I have been breathing normal and life is great. And if anyone had called the cops effectively earlier, maybe I could have years of my life back??

"My(40f) situation is complicated for various reasons. He's(49m) verbally, psychologically, emotionally and physically abusive. He's likes to use so much against me. I had a mh crisis in 09 and he'll routinely use that. He's had me by the throat and pushed me into a wall. 
I asked for a separation in February, he didn't like it but I was steadfast. Because of my disability I had to wait on housing which has taken a while but I may have a place. Going to be another 6/8 weeks but the ending is in sight. 
The cracks started in November of last year. His favourite insults and nastiness to get me to bend to his will is ""you are unlovable, unfuckable, ugly, fat smelly cripple bitch that should do us a favour and die!"" And for years I believed him. He never wants to touch me but talks about fucking people he works with and the ex of two of his friends and his other friends step daughter. But not me. He wanted to open the marriage, I agreed. He asked and got permission for a few people. I ask for one and you'd think I'd asked him to die for me.
 In November I had a friend (m36) voice interest in me, I was attracted to him, he's the one I asked permission for. But him voicing he thought I was attractive formed a crack in the bs my abuser says. A big one. During Xmas I opened up to this friend and he helped me see my situation as abusive and highly toxic. 
I've gotten closer to him and he's helped me a lot. He wanted to to try n make it work, I asked my abuser to get help, it never happened, I've been trying for years. But I am done. 
He doesn't realise once I'm out its no contact,  none at all. Any contact will be via my mum, who he hates, or solisters. His family hate me and are taking his side even though he scared his mum and his brother and irl best friend have had to pull him on his behaviour. 
He's pissy because my online support group have banned him from all thier platforms but its so I have a safe space. 
It took someone saying your don't deserve that and your worth more to wake you up. I'll be out soon and I'm excited to start a new chapter. I'm in therapy to deal with this. I'm so used to his mistreatment that when people treat me nicely I don't know what to do.

"Hi everyone! I’ve written here before regarding my abusive ex who strangled my son last year and who has also strangled me (left bruises) years ago. I stupidly got back together with him but now we had an argument and he left and said he wants us to separate to which I agreed.

We argued about sharing finances. I let him know that I wasn’t ok with him not contributing to our expenses. He has been jobless for 6 years and I am the primary breadwinner. As you know, discussing these things don’t go well with narcissists, so we started arguing. He told me I belittled him because he doesn’t have money and all the guilt tripping.  Somehow we also got into a discussion on his abuse and shocker he blamed our son for being strangked and he also said “I did not strangle him too hard”. He was angry that I still bring up this as he said it’s in the past. He also told our son it’s his fault that we are fighting.

"Let the strength come from the fact that if you go back, and every time you go back, ESPECIALLY with a child involved… you’re closer to losing everything. 

CPS will deem you are not keeping your child safe and the way they portray it most of the time is like you are complicit in the abuse even if you don’t mean to be. Don’t lose yourself to this Man and your child to the system. Loneliness can get better, being collateral damage to your parents relationship (in most instances) can’t. You are showing your son how he is being treated is how he can treat others and be treated.  Do as I say not as I do, is one of those phrases that never works with kids.

"Every time you try to leave THAT IS GOOD. You don’t need to count how many times you’ve tried to get out imo. Just keep trying and at one point you will get out and you will stay out. 

Somethings that abusers do is get us to focus on the negative and what’s wrong and what we didn’t do right last time and how will never get anything, right . Some thing that really helps me to stay as far away as possible is that I did affirmations to focus on positive things.. I actually did them eventually after years I did them in front of my partner I said I’m imagining success, and what it feels like before I go to sleep. I told him I want to be successful. I want to save money. I want everything to be OK and I wanna have a good job. . Eventually, there were so many times where he would agree that he wants something successful and then he would go back and ruin everything by being lazy or angry, or greedy, and stealing things or time, or all number of things to sabotage even a good feeling. 

Even hope or happiness is so not allowed, even though he would just say that he wanted that. He wants happiness for himself. He wants to feel good for himself. He wants and never work a day in his life for himself. 

Giving myself positive affirmations genuinely helps me get out of catastrophic thinking out of shame spiral’s, and I have a very firm tone of voice when I start going into thinking I miss him or that I love him or that he loves me . I tell myself very firmly like I have a kindergarten teacher teaching a kid not to stab anybody I go. No, you do not hurt yourself. You do not hurt anyone else and you do not go be around people who hurt you. 

I did read the free PDF of Lundy Bancroft book. Why does he do that, I did not finish it. I don’t think people need to read everything just a couple different stories, and I read it out loud because it was hard for me to concentrate especially with all the brain fog I have had.. 

If you are really in this for the long-haul to help yourself and help make sure your son doesn’t end up in this exact situation with a partner in his future — I would totally suggest googling around for that free PDF, and starting to read that book because your mind will start to not be in pain anymore and your brain fog will start to clear up and all of that in limerance that Limerence and fake love that he gives you will just start to clear up and things will feel better. Every aspect of your life will start to feel clearer and better.

Yay, you are free!! Congratulations. I know it’s hard and it is a cycle, but you can do this. You can be free of him and his abuse. I am so sorry that your child and yourself have experienced his selfish traumatizing behavior. If statistics help you at all: A man who abuses and is not the father of the child(ren) in the home, he is 5X more likely to kill you. If you get choked by a partner, you are 10X more likely to be killed by them….Please don’t let your family become another death statistic. He doesn’t care about you, not in a healthy way, or we wouldn’t choose to behave the way he does, which is 💯a choice. Leave that man where he is, do not let him back in and consider a call to CPS on him…he shouldn’t be around children, like at all. Hitting a child and choking/strangling are not the same thing.

"So I have an order of protection against my mom. She attacked me last year and the court issued one. It expired in April and she started harassing me again so I renewed it and have a court date in October. Yesterday I was served with an order of protection from her and have a court date for that in September. I have not been around her at all. Neighbors have told me they have seen her in my building in July and the day after she texted me for the first time since the attack I went straight to court to get it renewed.

 I just need advice as to what to do because the statements made for the order are completely false and I just feel trapped because I literally just want her to leave me alone yet I have to go to court because she’s claiming I’m harassing her when I’m not."

"Yes you can get OOP against someone who has one against you, however in your case given you have already had one for a year, your Mom's will likely look as retaliation and most likely won't be signed if what you are saying is true that you havent been around her — however you can still be issued an OOP if you are harassing someone through the phone, social media or digitally. Her OOP might be signed temporarily prolonging it, but likely when asked for evidence and if she keeps trying to renew it I highly doubt it will be signed for long term. If your building has cameras try to get the footage of her trespassing. If not, then put up cameras yourself outside your apartment, even just a ring camera or something so if it happens again you're prepared. 

Btw if your order expired in April you don't have one unless when you renewed it it was signed temporarily until your court date in October. Just be sure to read the fine print on your order. 

Dont worry about her order if everything is false, the judge will see through that pretty quickly if you hopefully have a semi-coherent judge. Be sure to have representation, if you rent and are under a certain income bracket you can get a free pro-bono lawyer assigned by the court.

If you are this concerned about your Mom then no matter what she does with her own OOP, keep going to court until the magistrate orders one for a year, 18 months, or sometimes for 5 years if there is good enough reason."

I need to apply for ssi disability because I have cancer and cirrhosis complications and I cannot work or support myself and my children. I have no income and ssi would be a huge relief. I have put off applying because I am still legally married to my abuser. I have not seen or spoken to the abuser in nearly 12 years. He has been out of the picture since he threatened to murder suicide us and I got an order of protection. He violated the order and thus has a warrant to this very day. I have put off getting legally divorced because I have lived in fear all these years that anything I do might trigger him to kill me. I know that sounds extreme but I have extreme ptsd from the whole of it and the fear is warranted. Does anyone have any experience with applying for disability while still married to the abuser who you haven't had contact with in over a decade? Will the Social Security administration take domestic violence issues into account to protect my safety or will they not give a crap? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

I've been to the ER twice this year.  I went in the spring because I had been football tackled into a wall hard enough to break the (exterior) wall. At the time I was told I had no broken bones and only torn cartilage. I had forgotten the password to my online access so I was like, gee ok. And they sent my ass straight on home. And then I spent *weeks* waking up literally screaming in pain.

I had a CT of my head and neck today. ""Scan looks good, what do you mean your neck hurts?"" Yeah, why would it, I only got lifted bodily off my feet by the throat and *thrown.*

The ER has my email so I was sent a link which I used to reset my password. From there I was able to see the actual written results.

Lo and fucking behold.

Not only do I have a fractured cervical vertebra, which is clearly stated on my head/neck CT...

THE SUMMARY OF THE SCAN FROM EARLIER THIS YEAR STATES THAT IT SHOWS FOUR DISPLACED FUCKING ACUTE RIB FRACTURES.

Please tell me wtf. I just need to know wtf."	dreamcat000	post	31.427365854652486	female	White	0.9989376664161682	na	na	na	4	domesticviolence	no prediction.

"Dear my angel, 

how I loved you. your laughter. your embrace. the way we sang songs aloud to each other like ""iris"" by the goo goo dolls. you stopped the car in the middle of the road just to sing it to me. or ""such great heights"" by the postal service -- we sang it to one another. I saw the happy little boy in you. the one who got abused and broken by the world. and I thought -- me, my love, I can heal this like a glue. I can put him back together. 

I'm typing now with a sprained hand that you gave me and a contusion to my chest wall where you held me down. it's hard to breathe. you are in jail. but I am in jail too. my bars look a little different. they are memories of you. memories I wanted to always keep. 

but I have to look at the memory of you choking me. 

I have to force myself to look at the memory of you raping me. why did I not leave? the cops asked. he showered me with kisses. he held me. he promised me he'd never hurt me. I wanted to believe. I want to believe. classic fox mulder. 

my mind has been raped. you raped me on every level. energetically, financially, sexually, emotionally. 

but I want to thank you. because now I am open. I am on the edge with my spirit. 

thank you for teaching me I had low self esteem. I now know what I need to build. 

thank you for singing, painting, dancing and laughing with me. all of those things were me. you were just mirroring me. so all that I loved was me amplified. and so I don't miss you exactly because you lied about having a kid and having two ex wives and STIs and the list goes on. no, who I loved, was me, and you lured me out to manipulate me, but you lured me out nonetheless. 

now I know where to turn to as I process this rape of spirit: myself. 

and what is beautiful about the human spirit is that it is indestructible. I hope you have the courage to heal. I hope you have the faith to face your pain. 

I do. 

and I will never see you again in this life. maybe our next life it will work out. when we are both fat cats. I think you will be more calm and I will say no more. 

I loved you with my whole heart. I didn't know it was possible. thank you for showing me that it was. and I let you go in love. and I hold you accountable because that little boy has an abuser living with him in that body, and I have to show that little boy that what you did was wrong because no one ever showed him it was wrong what happened. and I hope you release this poison in you. I hope you let it go. because it killed our relationship. 

and it will kill you too. 

I understand you were what you were running from. but you could only consume so much of me before you had to kill me. in the end, that is always the final act. and so I hope you have courage to love yourself. to free yourself from that story. 

I am going to free myself now. I let you go under grace in the perfect way. and it won't happen overnight. for either of us. I have to let go of your poison. and you have to let the light you took from me alchemize you. both are so hard. I wish I could have lived my whole life with who you pretended to be with me. the fact is that I don't know you. the man you showed me would have never done this. 

and what's hard is that I know other relationships will never feel like this. because they will be real. with real people and real boundaries and real love. that is why it's hard to let you go. you were a fantasy made reality, and it's easy to overlook the bad. because the bad and the boring are always there. the world feels hollow. but it's not your job to fill me up, it's mine. all you gave me was poison, in the end. and what will I do with this love in my heart? I am going to share it. I am going to give it away. and I think more people will appreciate that. 

I don't deserve to be in that cage with you. I never did, and neither did you. but only you can free yourself. I see now that my love could never heal you. but I tried anyway. how human. how beautiful. I love me. I can heal from this. I can heal from what you did to me. because I am not you. I am not full of poison like you. that's why you chose me because of my big heart and surplus of light. 

but I will regenerate my light and it will hit the hearts of everyone reading this post and we will all glow again. I'm the angel here, not you. "	kittypaintsflowers	post	26.560640515741742	female	White	0.0022414973936975002	na	na	na	2	domesticviolence	no prediction.

"It's all going to Hades now. A couple of weeks ago he told me that we had to spilt up, after I told him flat out based on what he wanted (essentially complete subservience)  I wasn't the woman for him. I simply could no longer try and fail to get him to listen to my needs and be told to shut up, walked away from, or engaged in a circular argument, without fail every single time. So he's been chill. Even shed some tears about ""failing to understand me"". Took me to dinner for my birthday, really played on being the good guy, I guess because he felt bad for ""dumping "" me. 

But I've been trying to discuss the terms of our impending divorce for over a week and i finally caught up with him tonight. Stupid me I think really though we could talk about divorce amicably. I've been on edge anxious because he's been intimating that he wasn't going to ""leave me stranded "" which meant he was putting me out. Of the house I half own. And work out of. And care for the kids (INCLUDING A FULL TIME SD) alone 75% of the time. And pay almost everything but the mortgage. I just was not going to really ever be emotionally prepared to leave this house and this community. I told him all of this. Told him I NEEDED to stay not that I deserved to stay. 

His response? ""You don't respect me"". I clarified because he wouldn't, that he was not willing to let me keep the house because of ""respect"". And after ALL he's put me through my pride just couldn't let the house go because of that one statement. So I committed a fatal error and asked him if he was prepared to get a lawyer to keep it from me and he said he was no longer going to talk to me about it. I began begging Shaun yelling him I didn't want to involve a lawyer that we can't afford lawyers I just needed to be here. And then I straightened my backbone because I have years of pictures of abuse. And tonight I have a recording of it as him trying to physically put me out of the bedroom escalated crazily. And the police will get here eventually. 

But I'm so ashamed. And I can't help but feel like I did it WRONG.  Like maybe I should have just taken his money and left quietly, but I can never keep my mouth shut and I'm so tired of his need to be in total control. And my poor daughter was right in the middle of it. Me screaming like a banshee telling him I was calling the police DEMANDING that my 12 year old baby call the police for me,  and I just feel like absolute trash. I hate myself for all these years I put up with it, for all these years I exposed them to it. I'm afraid I desensitized them to our cycle of abuse and now they will accept it. I'm sick to my stomach because I know he's going to hate me forever now that I finally called the police (he claimed INCREDIBLY in front of me and my daughter he didn't do what we just experienced/ witnessed) . I'm afraid that my reactive emotional outbursts will make me seem like a perpetrator in court even though I never laid a finger on him. 

I'm afraid neither of us can afford an messy court battle. I know that I can't pay the mortgage by myself abruptly like this, until I get my bonus in January, so I have to figure that out, and how to prepare this home for sale with my limited funds and what's going to happen with the kids and school and just....

I can't help but think I messed up. I'm just so tired."	PaleontologistOk3120	post	35.048576763197765	female	White	0.9991914629936218	na	na	na	6	domesticviolence	no prediction.

My head is swimming. 

He assaulted me yesterday during an argument. Shoved me multiple times and broke my fingernail in half. And told me it was my fault and I deserved it for trying to leave. It isn’t the first time but our daughter saw.

That was it for me. There’s no coming back. It’s been a long relationship with ups and downs … but I deserve better. 

Our daughter and I will live with family. I am the one moving out of our apartment. I am covered in bruises from where he shoved me. I am shaken, scared, heartbroken, sad, guilty ashamed, disgusted, tired.

"dude I'm gona be hella honest with you. 

I re-read my ER report and photos of the abuse. he literally choked me, assaulted me, almost broke my hand, etc. 

HE WATCHED ME GIVE HIM ALL MY DARK SECRETS AND TRUST THEN HE MADE A FAKE CHARACTER THAT I FELL IN LOVE WITH. THAT FAKE CHARACTER WOULD NEVER HAVE HURT ME. 

but the actual REAL PERSON HE IS, I don't know that person. AND WHO HE REALLY IS WAS CAPABLE OF HURTING ME AND MORE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

do you KNOW that when they strangle you that means they are WAY MORE LIKELY TO KILL U ONE DAY. 

what is sad is all of us here are fckin brainwashed into thinking that these idiots LOVED US and we are whining about what to do. these men didn't fckin love us AT ALL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

**I'm missing the equivalent of a book boyfriend.** it was like an elaborate role play where HE pretended to be a man I could trust and love ALL THE WHILE he SLOWLY wore down my boundaries, my self-esteem and self-worth, my finances, etc. 

bitch you are lUCKY TO BE ALIVE DO U UNDERSTAND. you were mentally MIND FUCKED. this guy has you crying that you love him. YOU DON'T LOVE THAT GUY. ***THE GUY YOU LOVE DOESN'T EXIST.*** 

it's as MORBID and simple as that. respect your damn self. file a police report. HE DOESN'T CARE. if he CARED he would have said, ""hey babe I'm kinda gona lose my temper I'm going to head out and take a walk"" or something THAT WOULD NOT HAVE CAUSED YOU HARM. 

THIS IS HOW I AM TALKING TO MYSELF and it's helping me. this dude didn't have to sprain my hand pulling away my keys or pretend to punch me in the face as he held me down. THE GUY I LOVED in the beginning who sang with me and danced and laughed -- that guy wouldn't have done this, but that guy isn't real. 

*the man WHO PHYSICALLY HURT ME is very fckin real. he will do it again.* 

the mind game was also fun coz he knew it would break me later to truly accept he never loved me at all, but I have to accept it because I love myself and I am WORTHY of being freed. 

do you REALLY want to be like some of the women here with missing eyes and chopped off hair who go back and defend him in fckin court coz they ""love him""? do you not realize how he is just thriving on his control of a person, to where they don't even have self respect. they don't even have a sense of self. do you not see how ABUSERS self hatred just is POISON and infects those of us that THEY STRATEGICALLY CHOOSE. 

oh yes, he chose you because you are loving and kind and soft. that is why he did it. to you. that's why he is doing this to you. and he loves it when you grovel and come back. you AFFIRM TO HIM you aren't a person. you are his to use to DESTROY for fun. 

be a damn person. get a damn hobby. go to the library. this dude doesn't deserve fckin' even a text from you. find another dude who is boring and lame and wants to watch movies and just IS REAL BUT NOT PERFECT. that is how they hOOK US IN by being these fake perfect men. no one is perfect on this earth. find someone imperfect like you!!!!!!!!!!!!! 

you are not special. he will not change. you will end up dead. that is always the final act in this play. that is your role in this drama. to die for him. to love him enough to let him kill you. all the while he never loved you. he just needed someone to use as a punching bag for his hate and anger. and he lied to you until finally you stopped saying no, stopped voicing your thoughts, believed you were the problem, believed he would change, understood it was your fault, that you did deserve to be hit, etc. until finally he has his last fun night with you. the big reveal. the last boundary. your fucking right to live.

I have a post to write about an abusive older brother, but for some reason the sub won’t let me post about it. I’ve had an abusive brother for years but can’t do much about it without ruining my family and potentially making myself homeless. He’s left me alone for now, but said a few weeks ago that he wishes he followed through with an attack he committed a few years ago, and concerns linger in the back of my head.

"Hello everyone. A throwaway account is very much needed. 

I’ve just entered my late 20’s and live with my mother (early 60’s) and my older (half-)brother (mid 30’s). I’d like to genuinely think I love my family and for the most part I think I do, but it’s true that every family has a black sheep, and it’s in the form of my half-brother. Both of us grew up without a father. My older brother’s father died when he was just a baby and my own father walked out on me when I was just 2. It’s not so bad because my mother raised me alongside her parents. 
My brother abused everyone in my household, but I think I can safely say I got the worst of it. We’ve all been physically and verbally abused. It’s bad enough that it lingers in the back of my head, but I’m also mindful that it’s not as bad as it could have been. Before I go on, a bit of a disclaimer. I hate my brother and regard him as a monster, but that doesn’t mean it’s a good idea for you to do so. I have these feelings because I don’t know how else to feel. I’m not his parent, so I don’t feel the same obligation to love him as my mother would. In no way did I choose to have him in my life, and whether it’s true or not, he’d have me believe that he is not sorry for a single thing he’s done. 
There’s 8 years difference between us and he had epilepsy not long before I was born. It seemed to work itself out by the time I existed, but my mother thinks it’s possible that his brain and thus his behaviour has been permanently changed. He could still retain memory and do school even though he doesn’t want to. He can hold down a job and outside the house, he comes off as a normal person, but he comes off as delusional and I’d dare say narcissistic at home. I’m not happy to be hating a potentially mentally ill person, but I can’t see him any other way."	Throwmeaway1863	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9986088871955872	weak	strong	no	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.
"I was 8 years old when he set his sights on me as a target to bully. He didn’t want to try at school and truly believed that everything should be done for him. To this day, he believes he shouldn’t have to work, and that my mother and myself should be funding his lifestyle while he stays at home, smoking pot and playing video games. (Technically I don’t have to, but when I’m working, I pay my mother rent, which I’m sure would be going towards the cost of supporting all 3 of us.) It’s a shame he’s managed to get laid, because he matches the stereotype of incel quite well - fat, lazy, never set foot in a gym, zero care for his appearance, zero care for his diet, not willing to do any work, but wants beautiful women and money to fall into his lap, wants love but isn’t willing to give it, thinks people doing remotely better than him need to be cut down to size. I’m starting a new job soon, but if I ever move up the ladder and I intend to, he can never know how much money I earn or else he’ll go into a rage.
Anyway, while he messed around at school, I took it seriously and was subsequently praised for it. He got jealous and advocated that as my mother’s first-born son, he should be treated as a superior, and I should be treated as a slave. Naturally, my mother and grandparents weren’t happy, but he didn’t care. He insulted me anyway. First, I was ugly, then I was fat, then I was retarded. It’s delicious that he’s now the heaviest person in the house and that I’m the one with a scientific degree. It’s worth noting that our grandparents are both dead. 
Then he called me a f****t for not having a girlfriend. That insult has been upgraded to incel. I was 12 at the time and that wouldn’t stop until I turned 21. He had been abusing me since I was 9. No broken bones or sprains or anything, just punches and kicks, but as a kid, I saw this as a problem, and he often liked to remind me that he was capable of much worse. He often got me when I was alone, so with noone around to help me, submission was my best bet. My grandparents were home, but he made a habit of putting his hand over my mouth so I couldn’t scream and warned that he could do a lot more damage before they intervened. I’m sure that’s at least partly why I wasn’t hurt as badly as I could have been. 
He had bullied other people too in school, but this often led to him getting his ass kicked, so I was his favourite target. We couldn’t report the abuse, because there was a chance I could have been taken to foster care, where my treatment could have been much worse. On top of that, my mother works in education, so even with me in adulthood, with her as the main breadwinner, she would be associated with my brother for living in the same residence, and it wouldn’t be fair for her to lose her job because of his actions."

"You could argue that she could kick him out, but because of the potential mental illness he may be harbouring, she’d feel guilty doing so. We could never force my brother to see someone regarding his mental health, and despite the fact he knows something may be wrong with him, he always refused to see someone, partly because he feels he’s still better than his family, and so that he could continue to play the victim card. He hates taking responsibility for anything. Also, he knows, he’ll never be able to afford a better standard of living in anyone else’s house. 
The abuse gradually got worse with him using his nails on occasion to try and claw skin off of my arms. He’d continue to make himself angry about his life on purpose, so he’d have an excuse to insult or attack me, either doing so for the most trivial reason, like me brushing past him in a corridor, or simply for no reason at all. The worst and final fight we had was 6 years ago, when he cornered me for doing something my mother wanted me to do. He threatened to make my life a living hell before giving me an unwelcome kiss. I pushed him back and he responded by attacking me, eventually spitting in my face and actually trying to bite my thumb off. Thankfully it didn’t work but it hurt a lot and I have a permanent scar. But I was shaken up. In self-defence, I managed to give him a black eye, which enraged him. We spent the next few months of that year demanding my mother do something about it. I wanted him kicked out. He in fact demanded my mother let him cut off the thumb he tried to take from me. But the anger eventually died down. I try to stay out of his way anyway but I made extra sure at the time by either being out of the house as much as possible or locking myself in my room when my mother wasn’t there. That option saved my ass on a couple of occasions. I was a university student at the time.
We did make peace eventually. I got mugged 3 years ago, and he seemed to feel sorry for me. I was standoffish for a while but eventually reciprocated and we managed to get on, with him even seeing me as a friend. It wasn’t easy to put all this behind me, but I did. Unfortunately I wouldn’t be writing this if that’s where we left it. We got on relatively well for the past 3 years but he instigated a verbal fight with me and actually would have physically fought me if my mother had not been there.What really grinds my gears was when he said he wished he finished the job with his attack 6 years ago. I don’t always praise my mother’s diplomacy but was ecstatic when she told him he’s forbidden from touching me or talking to or about me. Even when he wasn’t being cruel, he liked to touch me when I didn’t want to be touched. Even when he’s being friendly, I’m not a brother or human being to him. Instead, I’m a toy he can play with whenever he wants, much like I was when the abuse began. I’ve taken to completely ignoring him, which wasn’t easy but I make it a mission to pretend he doesn’t exist, and luckily for me, he has no reason to be interacting with me at all. This wasn’t something he was willing to honour in the past, but luckily for me, he seems to be willing to honour it now. If he keeps it up, we’ll have no problems. But I’m still angry. I hate him. He knows that if I got the police involved, the authorities would more likely make my mother and I suffer than him. He outright said he’s untouchable and could always play the mental health card to get out of a jam if it came to it. So there’s no way I can MAKE him stop doing something. He’s not worth becoming homeless over. 
He’s leaving me alone for now but ignoring him was enough to get a rise out of him before. As messed up as it sounds, I just have to hope he keeps his focus on my mother. She’s not being abused but he has made a mission of punishing her by annoying her everyday about how much he hates work, and that it’s her fault for making him get a job. I don’t want to tear the family apart, although I no longer consider my brother my family, and I don’t want to make things more difficult than they need to be. I’m relatively happy to just continue ignoring him so long as it works and he doesn’t interfere with any part of my life. I’ve successfully avoided him for 3 weeks. But I’m not happy with this. Is it wrong that I would want better options? Is there a way I could put my foot down without making things worse? I do not want to live my life being careful that working towards what I want wouldn’t anger him, which I know it would. At the moment, he’ll just bother mother. He’d physically abuse me before dealing to abuse her because she’s the hand that feeds him and because he permanently views me as his inferior. I’m not proud that mother effectively has to be a human shield but I can’t have anything to do with him. It's my mother's house, not mine, so I don’t have any authority, and I can’t make myself homeless should he turn his sights on me again. I could be worrying over nothing, which would be true if he carries on as he is now, but his past behaviour and lack of remorse gives me cause for concern.

My mother wouldn’t call him ugly but I  certainly would. True say, he’s average at best. He doesn’t think he’s the best looking man in the world. Just better than me. Having said that, he was infuriated by the fact that a guy with eczema wasn’t being shunned by women, even though the reason why was because he was confident from hitting the gym. My brother looks more like your typical incel. Poor hygiene, beard grown out and overweight. He’s in fact self-conscious about that but isn’t willing to do anything. He just wants to be seen as the best, and only has the balls to go for me.	Throwmeaway1863	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9986088871955872	no	strong	no	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.

My husband dropped an eggshell on the floor. No big deal, just clean it up.  Instead of picking it up, he quickly made it my fault because I had cracked eggs in the carton. I tried to get him to take responsibility for picking it up (I’ve been dealing with his anger and gaslighting for years.)  He couldn’t take responsibility. He kept diverting the conversation back to me leaving a couple used shells in the carton.  He stood a few feet from me with his finger in my face shaking it while exclaiming “F___ you”.

Yes, they make everything even the little things our fault. Yesterday I was at the farm show with my longtime bf/abuser and our 6 year old as it was our sons birthday. He drove and when it was time to find the car, he couldn’t find it. Well that was my fault because I didn’t pay attention and I act like I have no responsibility. If I drove, I’m sure I would of remembered my surroundings but I was busy talking to my son about the farm show. He also dropped his phone which was somehow my fault as well. Tried to say I kicked it out of his pocket. I really don’t understand their logic but needless to say he made me cry like he does Everytime we go anywhere cause he calls me names and everything that goes wrong for him is my fault. I recognized this as abuse a long time ago, and I now call him out and tell him he’s an abuser Everytime which he stutters and doesn’t know what to say Everytime I do. But I am done just letting it go. I’m tired of being made miserable because everything has to go just right and the smallest things set him off and it’s all my fault.

I really hope things get better for you!! Virtual hug! And if you ever need someone to talk to, I’m here!

I have made the mistake of thinking a girl was my friend and texting her to vent and she showed him everything I said (which was about him physically abusing me) and he came home and choked me and hit me.

"It will be 4 years in November since I called the police on my abuser. 

I have had a difficult time recently with my mental health after accidentally having a break from my antidepressants and realising I wasn't doing as well as I thought I was. I think I may have PTSD.

I have started counselling again, with the view to hopefully having EMDR therapy, which is supposedly good for PTSD. 

But I hate counselling. I've never been a fan of it. I've had it a number of times in my life and have never found it beneficial, only painful. And I always dred my sessions because I know they will be emotional, hard and unpleasant.

"Try other counselors? 
It makes sense to dread having all the emotions, reliving all the $h!t, but therapy should be healing. If you aren't benefitting from the person who is supposed to be helping you then you need to find someone with whom you can be more comfortable.

I am sorry you're still dealing with your pain, I'm out about 2 years. Yesterday I had to drive within blocks of where I lived then, past the places we went together...memories of the wonderful times intermixed with feelings of terror and horror. The trauma stays with us, I'm focused on healing the physical still, until I can afford to work on the mental. 

Best wishes for your healing. One of the most important things I've learned is that healing is non-linear. Two steps forward, three steps back, five forward, and one back - it's never the same.

"This man was my fiancé, the father of my first baby girl. He’s much older, 30, while I’m only 23. He’s been married twice, has 3 other kids (boys) and is not allowed to see them. He also doesn’t pay child support. He was a sergeant in the army and was in the army for 10 years. He’s had a consistent record of being abusive, from smashing my phone on the ground to punching a hole in the wall to throwing a tv and driving recklessly with me in the car (while pregnant). Not to mention all the times he smacked me, shoved me, punched me, or threw me to the ground. This was not a common occurrence, but if you made him mad enough, it was a real fear.

I believe he’s a narcissist. Anytime I would cry, he would just blankly stare at me. He’d fall asleep next to me while I sobbed. We used to go to bars together until I got pregnant. Then he decided to start going alone. It broke my heart everytime and I even told him that. He’d promise to come home at a certain time, he rarely ever did. He never stopped. Not even after he cheated on me on a night out while I was pregnant. 

I left twice. The first time was only a week before the second. Two days after we went to Vegas together (for a weekend so we could “fix things” )he lied to me about going to work and I found him at the bars. The catalyst to me leaving was because he refused to show me his pin on his phone a couple days later . He tried to gaslight me and say as he punched it in turned away “see! You watched me do it”. I had enough. I shoved him and called him a liar and he punched me twice in the gut. I called my folks who lived an hour away and they packed up all of mine and the baby’s things in the house then left while he was at work the same day. He started off very evil. Angry at me on the phone, then crying, then begging for me to give him a chance. I gave it. I visited him a few days. It seemed like he was sincere. I then packed a bag of stuff and went back.

Here’s why I left the second time:
A few days had gone by and it didn’t feel so bad. He proved his phone was completely open to me(I’m sure he wiped it all clean before he saw me) and he was actively trying to speak kinder to me and give me affection. I was still a little indifferent and hurt. I’d get a pit in my stomach everyday that I woke up. Then we decided to go out together for the first time since I’ve had the baby. I’m 3 months postpartum and we got her a sitter. We went to a place we had never been to before that gave away free beer till 11. We drank a lot. I said something in the car on the way home that made him furious. He punched me twice in the car. We got home and I was so furious I charged at him in the house. He punched me multiple times and slammed me to the ground. I attempted to defend myself but he kept beating me, punching and kicking- it was a hellish blur. At one point he held both his hands around my neck against the wall and I feared for my life. The fight stopped after this when I fell to the floor and sobbed. He carried me to the bathroom where I threw up from being thrown around plus the alcohol and he gave me a bath. I was so in shock I simply went to sleep. The next four days we’re a blurry haze. I was covered in bruises. I left because we had an argument over his child support and he told me to go to the bank (my account) and “get my money bitch”. He slammed the door to the house, my daughter and I were in the car, so I drove back to my parents. 

We filed a police report and in my state, the state automatically presses charges. He’s looking at a class c felony of aggravated domestic assault. I got a temporary protective order with no contact. He and I have broken it several times. He swears he’ll “go to church “ and “go to therapy” and fix our family but I know it won’t happen. Everytime I try to stop contacting him, he finds a way to reach out to me and always claims I’m being “disloyal”. I still love him and don’t want to hurt him. It breaks my heart seeing his tears. I’ve finally implemented blocking him on everything today with no explanation. He managed to reach out again, begging for the truth. All my friends and family say to just let it lie. Im going to buy it hurts so bad. I just wanted us to be happy and a wholesome family.

 Am I wrong for feeling bad about not giving him another chance? Am I wrong for wanting to talk to him? Am I wrong for loving him?"	dstine9	post	23.725899230347977	female	White	0.9985828399658203	na	na	na	13	domesticviolence	no prediction.

Okay sweet girl I come to you after having experienced exactly what you are going through. I’m much older than you, but my experience happened at your age. I hope you can receive my advice in the spirit it is given.  To protect you and your sweet baby from a life of pure hell.  I have been to counseling and so has my daughter.  It really helps.  What you have right now and before and after is a toxic relationship.  The best part of your relationship is your precious daughter.  Please look at her when you think of breaking the no contact order. Ask yourself if you want her to recreate the relationship you are showing her.  Would you dream of her being beaten and tossed around like someone of no value?  Of course you wouldn’t. Yet you are showing her that is normal. That her precious Mama isn’t worth a healthy, unconditional love one that is without violence and full of mutual respect.  The next thing I want you to recognize is what he is doing to you.  He now has you breaking the law. So as to basically bring down to his level so that in future fights he can throw this in your face. You have now put your hands on him (by shoving him) and have broken the no contact order.  What you are feeling now is trauma bonding.  Not love. You may feel like he has no one but you (there is a reason he has no one) and you can save or fix him. You can’t.  He is a broken GI Joe who needs to be permanently put in the garbage. Speaking of trauma bonding and toxic relationships….my then 3 year old little girl came into our bedroom after being woken up by her dad trying to kill me. He was on top of me choking me and screaming bitch die!  Her little self came running in and began screaming daddy please don’t kill my mommy!!! This snapped him out of the act. She still carries that image even after counseling.  Sweet girl value yourself and your baby.  I beg you to stay away and like her 3 half brothers don’t let him have anything to do with her.  I promise you there is a bright future for you both.  Watch the movie waitress. I know it may sound stupid.  It will give you strength.  Please love yourself and your baby.  Please see him as the evil he is and always will be. Feel free to DM me.	dstine9	reply	na	na	na	0.9985828399658203	weak	strong	no	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.

You're not wrong for feeling bad, as it is normal for DV victims to feel that way soon after leaving.  However, for your child and your own sake, do not contact him again.  Disable your social media, change your phone number, etc.  He's going to swear and promise to change, but the fact that he's had history of DV, and did it with you, it shows that he won't change.  Even if he appears to change, it's temporary to win you back, then he'll go back to his old ways.	dstine9	reply	na	na	na	0.9985828399658203	weak	no	no	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.

So me and my wife are always having these fights in which things get physical. Nothing like punching or slapping but pushing. Today I came home from work and the first thing my wife talks about is how a cat took a crap on the lawn. She asks me to help her get it up which generally means she will be watching. I told her why did she wait for me to get home to do something she should have easily done and tells me she just didn't want to do it. I go upstairs to take a shower but she tells me I'm not taking a shower and to clean up the poop. I told her to wait until I take a shower but she kept pushing the door open. She then puts her foot in the door while I'm telling her that I will do it when I'm done. She keeps trying to basically punk me into doing it by not letting the door close so I push her out the way because I'm sick of trying to convince her to let me take a shower. Now I know I shouldn't have pushed her but I was really getting frustrated and felt like she was trying to bully me into doing it her way. I close the door and get into the shower then she comes flying back in and rip the shower curtain down grabs me and storms out. This is the issue every time we fight. I will attempt to leave the disagreement and even compromise but she will follow and do things until she gets a reaction out of me and then tell everyone I abused her. This has happened at least 5 times. I've even recorded the type of behavior she does to escalate situation but everyone just excuses her behavior because she's a woman. My wife isn't a terrible woman but she has this vicious side when she gets mad.	seem92	post	19.2645112373582	male	White	0.9990409016609192	na	na	na	5	domesticviolence	no prediction.

"Hello,

I fell in love with a man and did not see the red flags until I was already in a situation where he was controlling my finances, isolating me from friends/family and physically assaulting me. It did not happen over night but I felt stunned by how quickly I was in a situation that I had no idea how to navigate. 

It all sort of came to a head in January of 22’. My neighbors called the police when I fled to their home after being threatened, strangled, and suffocated. I remember in the moment the only thing I could think was that I may never see my mother again. 

I know how this sounds, but at the time I was terrified to leave. I was uncooperative with law enforcement and the DA but I was still subpoenaed to a grand jury- another situation in which I refused to speak.  He was still indicted on three different felony assault charges. I stayed with him through the court process and I can not really explain why. I remember feeling as if I did not exist. In a way I just completely shut down and it is hard for me to even remember those first few months.

 It has now been 18 months and there has been no violence.  He has made many positive changes- including getting a therapist and staying completely sober. I know that statistically this situation does not look good l, but I have always believed in peoples ability to change- especially if they are willing to recognize that there is an issue. 

I am now 25 weeks pregnant and I’m honestly terrified. I want to give him a chance to do the right thing and to be a father to his child, but I understand I am no longer making choices just for myself. I do not want to traumatize my child. 

My family has hated him since the incident. I’m their minds he put me in the hospital and just wasn’t successful at ending my life. Every time I speak to them, they bring up what happened and make it clear they will not forgive him. They also make it clear they believe it will happen again. I am heartbroken that my child will never have his family gather in one place. I am afraid my family will always speak this ways about their father. 

I believe that the changes he has made are genuine but I realize we have been living under a microscope. I still just doubt that he could fake it for this long. I am not saying we don’t still have issues. There is still a lot of unfounded jealousy and sometimes the controlling stuff comes up. I feel more comfortable letting him know when something upsets me- there was a time I never would have felt safe doing that. 

His sentencing court date was supposed to be a week ago but it was continued another few weeks. He willingly remanded himself early so he could start his time because he desperately hopes to get out in time for the birth of our son.  
We were living across the country from our families and he is now in jail in that state. I decided to come home so that I would have some support for the rest of my pregnancy. I have Hyperemesis Gravidarum which has basically meant I have barely been able to keep anything down. I was afraid to stay alone in our apartment and be so sick. 
Even though both of our families have been supportive of me- I have never felt so alone. There is a very specific emptiness when going through your first pregnancy without your partner. I think it’s even worse knowing where he is and why. 

How do I make the right choices for my unborn child? How do I make boundaries with my family? Is it okay to forgive the father of my child? Can I truly trust that he has changed?
I had an amazing advocate in Alaska but now that I’ve moved back home- I don’t have one. I feel weird trying to contact someone here when I am not currently unsafe. I really just don’t have anyone to talk to about this stuff. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this and for any advice, wisdom, and experience you have to offer. I really appreciate it."	Calamityqueen33	post	31.106516109419083	female	White	0.013265795074403286	na	na	na	25	domesticviolence	no prediction.
hey girl i don’t normally post or comment anywhere but this sounded too familiar. my boyfriend had been abusive for a while until i found out i was pregnant. he choked me once while i was pregnant and i left him for it. he “got help” and “changed” for a while so i took him back so i could keep our family in one piece. the abuse continued after i had the baby and i now have left him again. now hes saying hes gonna change. see the pattern? i know you want it to work because hes the father but i would suggest you listen to your family	Calamityqueen33	reply	na	na	na	0.013265795074403286	no	strong	no	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.
"Hope. We certainly cling to that, don’t we? Hope can keep us blind to the danger that we already face, allowing us to minimize the threat. It’s still there, OP. Nothing has changed. Once you have your baby? You will have delivered a living hostage into this situation that you will forever have to consider every time this man walks into the room. What kind of mood is he in today? You will find yourself suddenly quiet as you listen intently to see if you can suss out by the way he puts his things down- thrown or placed on the counter- is tonight going to be a ‘good’ night, where you and your baby will be safe? Or will you be walking on eggshells again? Terrified that a single misstep will cause an outburst of anger… and where can you go with your child if that happens? What do you do if he has been drinking? Or if he grabs the baby and puts him in the car and takes off down the road, driving like a maniac?
That’s what my ex did. That was my life, for many years. I kept hoping that things would get better, oblivious to the fact that life was becoming incrementally worse day by day. Somehow I was convinced that children were ‘better off with two parents’ in spite of the abuse I endured every day. I became so scared of him, of what I knew he was capable of doing, that I was paralyzed. 

Once you have your baby your priorities will become very clear, you will do whatever you need to do to make sure your baby is safe. The baby’s father can and will make your life very, very frightening, because he is absolutely aware of your mindset. This makes you extremely vulnerable and easy to manipulate, and creates a situation that will become very difficult to escape from. Besides the physical abuse there is also the more subtle emotional and psychological abuse which can simply paralyze, potential financial abuse, coercive control, yikes! 

OP, you don’t have to wait to be in danger to contact an DV advocate in your new residence. I urge you to contact your local shelter so you can find someone now to get the support you need. You are facing so many life altering situations and the only way you can feel secure regarding your decision is if you have complete information at hand."

"As someone who spent 25 years in the same type of situation, I can assure you that he has not changed. 
The jealousy. The insecurities. Behaving in positive ways, for as long as he needs to.

He sounds a lot like my ex-husband.
The guy would tell me whatever I needed to hear, to manipulate me into doing his will.

My ex almost strangled me to death, and I spent over 20 more years with him.
I understand where you're coming from.
All I can do is tell you that he's just a ticking time bomb. It can be weeks, months, or years between his fits of rage. What if your baby is there, the next time ? What if the next time, is the last time ?
What's your baby going to do without his/her mother ? 
I feel horrible for letting my kids witness everything that they did. It didn't happen a whole lot in front of the kids, but they always noticed the busted lips, the black eyes, the bruises on my throat and the cuts on my head. My boys. 
I don't want them to think it's okay to treat a woman that way.
 My daughter. 
I would never want her to accept being treated like that. As a mother it's your job to protect them from danger. Even if their father is the danger.

I've been out for a few years now. Here's my post if you're interested. Just the tip of the iceberg.

"Get. Away. From. This. Man.

He has proved that he is capable of hurting you badly. He has proved that he is willing to put your life at risk. 

You say you didn't see the red flags at first. That's because he was probably not waving them in the air at you and screaming, ""I HURT WOMEN!"" 

Those red flags were hidden in the bushes, tucked in corners, disguised as bouquets of roses. He hid who he was from you. He is hiding it now.

Your story sounds exactly like mine, right down to stumbling to the neighbor's house, bloody and injured. The only difference is the baby. I don't want to have children.

I didn't call the police that day, and no one else did either. I called my mom to come pick me up. 

He had stolen my car and fled, ten hours before, leaving me semi conscious, strangled, and with my face destroyed. I can't live in my own house anymore. I have flashbacks going through the door. I am crashed in my parents' sewing room, in pain, having nightmares, crying daily, and trying desperately to remember who I once was.

I wanted so badly to forgive him. I tried. He didn't hurt me on purpose again, but he did hurt me carelessly, and when I very politely asked him to *be careful with me,* he got upset with me. He showed me that although his actions may have changed, *his attitude has not.* If that underlying attitude is still there, the actions will match it again someday. 

I cut him off and I have gone no contact again. I am miserable, destroyed, and alone, but I am SAFE.

I just woke up from nightmares (again) and checked my phone to see this. The similarity is really chilling.

Ask yourself. If he hadn't been *forced* to stop hurting you--if he hadn't been forced to get a therapist--if his behavior had not been so scrutinized--would he have stopped this on his own? Do you feel safe? If you don't feel safe, your baby will not either.

Please get out while you can. Don't wait for him to hurt you more. Don't wait for disaster to strike again. Your baby's life is precious. YOUR life is precious. Don't risk either of those lives. It is not worth it."	Calamityqueen33	reply	na	na	na	0.013265795074403286	no	no	no	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.
"I am so sorry about your experience, but glad you reached out here.
The ex did a lot of song and dance about improving, too. Got a therapist, got an anger management workbook. Then said he needed to put therapy on hold so he could focus on the workbook. He even went to a DV support group for abusers but quit because he was better than the guys there. (Hah). He got a DV therapist (and lied to him). Didn't blow up for a whole year, etc.
They are wolves in sheep's clothing and can do an incredible performance to show change and improvement.

I wanted to believe that he could improve. I wanted the kind, loving, wonderful person to come back. The thing is: no truly kind, loving, wonderful person could treat another person with contempt and disrespect. It's not possible. So the only possible explanation is that the kind person that they are acting like is just a performance. 

It took me awhile to realize that the prince charming that I knew and loved was a relatively easy performance act. Hiding underneath that was a horrible person. 

Lundy Bancroft's book Why Does He Do That (highly recommend, check the library) describes Prince Charming and asks: who would go to that much trouble and effort? Only someone who has a lot to hide.

Please do reach out to get local help from a domestic abuse organization. You definitely qualify. I'm still getting help from 2 DV organizations and all of the help is free.

He “changed” and is “working” on himself only because his case is not done. After I called the police, he almost stop the physical assaults but became very psychologically and financially abusive.

"I was raised by a sadistic strangler.   

You are in deep deep trouble and need to escape while you are young. If this baby is raised by this monster I hope he gets resources he needs because he will need HELP IN HIS FUTURE BEING RAISED BY SOMEONE LIKE THIS.  

If the baby is exposed in a violent household. You having only 18 months of no violence by him (he deserves a cookie) is nothing.

 Your baby WILL STRUGGLE IN SCHOOL AND NEED PSYCHOLOGICAL TREATMENT IN THE END. HE WONT MAKE IT.  He will wonder why his own mother did this to him.   Its a sick world to bring a baby up in! 

I am not kidding I was raised in this crap and how dare people continue to bring children into this world as bad as it is, and then bring more violence in to a family.  People need to wake up.

There is no way on Gods, green earth I would let him near my child.  EVER!  

Right choice for you and your child is to get OUT and run fast while he is in jail.  Who cares hes in jail?  (Good hes there keep him there)!   Leave him there! Learn about psychopaths real fast honey you are in for a fun ride now! 

Your family is right. They are using their brains by standing and saying, "" they won't tolerate this behavior.""

 You want information about boundaries in dealing WITH your family?  WHY?  You have to be kidding right?  Come on.  

Hes got your brain twisted and this is how they operate. Oh girl its only just begun you think you are tangled up now give yourself a few more years being 30 and looking 60.

If u survive him.   Untwist it fast because you dont have much time until you are changing diapers!   You dont need a twisted mind caring for a baby and have a manbaby husband to care for too!  Dont even think you can change him that your big big mistake my friend.  Noone changes someone like this.  Of course hes putting on a show of change hes in jail!   Its waht they do. Morph in to Ima changed man.  Nope dont believe him- it takes more than this to change a strangler.  Good luck.  

Have you tried setting up boundaries from the abuser?  Hes the one WHO NEEDS BOUNDARIES!  

My father strangled my brother and mother so dont get too high hopes he wont someday hurt your baby.  YOU SHOULD BE TERRIFIED!

"After having numerous women in my life deal with men, who are exactly like this….. let me be blunt, because in my opinion, you sound like you need a push. 

My wife was previously in an abusive relationship, my 3 step kids witnessed the abuse. 

She told herself staying for the children was the right thing. Maybe he was getting better, sometimes he is nice, etc etc. After all she was making sure they didn’t get abused right? 

Abused women tend to go through this loop of justification, they even attempt to protect the abuser. She realized AFTER she left just how much damage was done to her and the kids. They are STILL dealing with the trauma 4 years later. 

The psychological damage done to both her and the kids was immense. You become codependent and normalize way too many things. 

So, here is the blunt part. 

You WILL damage your child by staying with this man, he WILL always be abusive. Your family is trying to protect you, and it seems they understand how vulnerable you are mentally to this abuser.

Speaking from experience, an abusive father is MUCH worse than an absent father.

If you do the right thing, expect him to somehow make it your fault and attempt to make YOU feel guilty. It’s standard in the playbook of abusive men. 

Don’t lie to yourself and use the baby as justification. You seem to have your family’s support. Do NOT throw that away for a man that WILL hurt you and that child. 

Staying is tantamount to abusing your child. Neglect at best. You are willingly looking for a justification to damage your child."	Calamityqueen33	reply	na	na	na	0.013265795074403286	no	strong	no	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.

I keep telling myself that at the first sign things are going back to the way they were- I will leave, no questions asked, and for good. 
I just feel so afraid of making a choice like that right now and I also feel so guilty. I feel so guilty doing that when there hasn’t been any recent violence. I know that this will be the father of my child no matter what and I don’t think they would give me custody since the charges are from before I was pregnant but I truly just don’t know.

Thank you for taking the time to respond. 

When you describe that anxiety inducing feeling of walking on eggshells and listening for clues- it gives me goosebumps. I know that feeling very well but I do not know what it feels like to also have a child to protect. I do not want to do that to my child. 

When I met him, I had not been long out of another problematic relationship- not abusive but just not healthy. I had broken off an engagement and moved across the country and I felt so much sadness and guilt. I think that once things started to get bad- there was a part of me that felt I deserved to be punished (I know logically this is not true) and I think the longer it went on- the more I felt that way. I know that I have a lot of work to do on myself and that I really haven’t done it yet because I haven’t been away from him before. I am hoping during these coming months that I can get some clarity and help- and that I can be much stronger for when my child arrives.

I am very lucky to have some time away from him- and I think I have needed that because it is hard for me to even think about when we are living together- much less make a post like this. 

I want to be a good mom. That is all I want to do and I don’t want to be afraid for my child.

"I am so sorry that you had to go through something so terrifying. I am also at my parents house and I am finding it very difficult. I cut so many people out of my life these past few years that it feels so lonely to be back here. I am sorry you are plagued with such terrible memories, but I am glad that you are safe. 

Thank you for taking the time to share your story with me. I wrote this because I am feeling so alone, and I needed to hear from others that could relate to my situation. 

If I am being honest, it is really hard for me to hear because I think I desperately want to hear a success story. I know that sounds so delusional. I hate that I logically understand what the safest, smartest choice is but it feels so difficult to even think about. 

For the first time in years- I have some time to myself. I know I need to find some support here and try to set myself up to be as safe as possible. I don’t know what that looks like right now but I do know that I want my child to be safe.

"of course. i 100% understand the obligation to keep the family together. and  feeling the need to make a decision. but you dont have to decide right away. i can promise once you have your baby things definitely change too. i dont think i would have left him if i didnt have his baby. personally, ive never been good at being alone. i love love. and i love giving love. and i stayed in relationships because of it not realizing how codependent i could be. but once you have the baby and you feel that unimaginable love for them you realize you dont need to be with anyone else. i could never be with anyone again and id be okay with it because i have my baby. which is why i was able to leave after i had mine. hopefully yours will give you strength to do the same.

as for saying you will leave the first sign of things going bad, i say the exact thing too sometimes. and i wonder if i should take him back everytime he begs and just leave if it happens one more time. but i try to remember if i do that i might be too attached again to actually follow through with it, or brainwashed again and not realize its happening.

hopefully you could relate to some of this and maybe it can help. whatever you decide to do i know it will turn out the best for the baby. i see the way you love them already <3"	Calamityqueen33	reply	na	na	na	0.013265795074403286	weak	no	no	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.

"It was my honest pleasure, because I so strongly feel that nobody should ever endure the soul crushing hell that life becomes. I admire the courage it has taken for you to be open and ask for advice. Given the judgement you have received from your family this could not have been an easy decision. 

After leaving, I still thought that I was in love, and that we had a chance at happiness if only he would… I in no way viewed myself as abused! He was under so much stress, just needed help, more support than I could give. Excuse after excuse. In time I began to realize just how incredibly dangerous and… well, that love really isn’t supposed to cause pain, right? Or terror. Men who love you don’t create fear in your life. They don’t put you in danger, etc etc. I also began to understand the level of dysfunction and abuse that my family of origin functioned within and considered normal and acceptable. Dots continue to connect. 

Take a look at this website:

It breaks down the aspects of abuse, of what healthy relationships are, what boundaries are, why we need them. It is helpful as a guide to assist you in figuring out what you actually deserve as far as the way others treat you. It’s taken me a long time to understand that I really do deserve to be treated with kindness and respect. OP you do to, you know?

"Tldr; my boyfriend (31 y.o m) spat in my face (30f) during an argument. I told him to get out of my house. 

That was 4 days ago, and the last time I saw him. The fight happened because this was our first night together after another, particularly nasty fight. I asked him to get off the Xbox and come upstairs with me so we could spend time reconnecting, it was like 1am. He ignored me. I went upstairs to shower and cool off, and then I sent him a string of angry texts about it. He comes upstairs, menacing me from the doorway, screaming, getting closer, until finally he spat in my face. He turned around and went downstairs without another word. I collected myself, rinsed my face, and went downstairs and told him he needs to gather his stuff and go home. 

That’s about it. It is over. I sent him a letter today, one final release. I’m feeling like it was too harsh and now I feel even worse that I may have hurt him with the letter. Silly right? But I still care. I’m totally sad, but I know this is the right thing. Reddit friends, will you read my letter and provide me with some insight, support or whatever it is that you feel? Here it is:


Dear (boyfriend)
Our relationship was an abusive one, you are abusive. The conversation cannot continue until you acknowledge that.
Breaking my windshield is abuse, locking me out of the house is abuse, throwing my purse into the road is abuse,  calling me a c*nt is abuse, blurting out “your genitals are ugly” is abuse. Changing my wifi password is abuse. Putting me in harms way on purpose when you’ve been entrusted to protect me, is abuse. Spitting in my face is abuse.
This is textbook, and will escalate. You have left me no choice.
Before you stop reading – my guess is that you feel I am berating you, or “gaslighting” you. That is a problem, I am stating facts. Just because you don’t like them, or you don’t like how I’m telling you, does not make it unfair, or less true.
I didn’t always react in a saintly way, but let me be clear – I was reacting to mistreatment. I am not perfect by any stretch of the imagination, but something you could always count on receiving from me was an overarching tone of respect, and empathy, and believe it or not – a commendable degree emotional self-control. These are the hallmarks of a loving partner. In return I received antipathy, contempt and harm. I am walking away from this more traumatized and damaged than I was when it started, and I didn’t realize that was possible.
I wouldn’t bother writing this if I felt you set out with the intention to harm me so badly, or if I believe you are a bad person. You’re not. But you’re a large, adult, man –  you no longer have the privilege of unbridling your emotions and expecting unconditional tolerance from those around you.
I don’t question that you loved me, but the facts indicate you never really cared about my wellbeing, my experience of the relationship or my needs. You care most about yourself, and what you are getting out of the partnership – if my wellbeing was ever a concern of yours, I feel it was only so that you could return to enjoying all that I do for you as an intact partner. That isn’t really love.
In my darkest hour, you act surprised and enraged by my reactivity and louder and louder pleads for support. I begged you to love me in every way I know how. I felt like if I could only say it differently, or again, or louder, maybe you’d finally hear me and understand. I’d sell a kidney for a listening ear, a kind touch, a compliment or words of acknowledgment, encouragement. I now realize that you heard me the whole time, but you just don’t care. My needs were like a mosquito whining in your ear that you kept trying to swat away. And when my “whinging” got louder, you become furious and tried to kill the mosquito.
Your experience with strong women that love you can only have come from your mother. You are searching for a mother in a partner. The relationship between a parent and child is completely one sided. The parent meets the needs of the child and the child is shielded from the struggles their parent goes through, and therefore concludes they do not struggle. Your mom maneuvered domestic violence, legal battles, multiple jobs and single motherhood. All the while, she showed up and loved you through your bad behavior, disrespect and explosive temper. She is a wonderful mother and strong woman, but make no mistake she suffered behind closed doors.
This is what you look for in a partner, but you are wrong. Partners do not ignore the struggles of their loved one just because they act “okay.” They consider their struggles objectively, reach out to help, provide patience, understanding and a safe place to lean, and it is not seen as a burden or an inconvenience. Their partner doesn’t have to repeatedly announce “help, I’m drowning” to receive care. And really, when I did cry out for help in plain language, I still never received the care I needed. I hoped that by pouring myself into you and being the best partner I can be, even when my own cup was empty, I could elicit a change in your heart. I failed. If I had only earned your respect as well as your love, I believe things would be very different.
You had a tough childhood, and I assume, you were made to feel less-than. This may have motivated your incredible achievements – you are brilliant, and you worked so hard for what you have accomplished. As a teen mom with the odds stacked against me, I can relate to having something to prove. I look at you and beam with pride, and cheer you on. You look at me and belittle my work, and minimize my accomplishments. It saddens me to think you may still feel inadequate, despite your great achievements, and perhaps need to make someone else feel smaller than you do. If so, you succeeded. I am completely deflated, exhausted and heartbroken.
You are an amazing person, I don’t hate you – in fact I continue to love you independently of myself or our relationship. Please go to therapy so you can get out of your own way and enjoy the best life that you are so close to unlocking. I will strive to do the same.
I know there is a lot to unpack in this letter, and you may not know where you would even start to work on yourself for your next partner, but these things take time, and changes are not all made at once, nor are they all too difficult. You can do it. – girlfriend (me)

"Wow. Your strength and determination are incredible. The pictures I can see by reading your words, are as vivid as if I were watching a movie. 

Getting him out of your life is huge. Don’t flinch in your determination to leave him behind because there is no chance that he’s ever going to change. And you know that, but he’s going to try to make you believe that he wants to change. For you. 

If you haven’t already connected with a DV victims support group in your community, please do that for yourself now. You need to be surrounded by others who have been where you are, and others who are at all stages of recognizing their partner is an abuser, and gaining support to recover and heal. 

You can do this. You are even stronger than you already know, but no one leaves an abusive relationship without damage that needs to be treated and supporters to cheer you on. 

Someday you will move on to a placee where your experience can help others recover. That’s how you know he didn’t destroy you. He tried, but you saw what he was doing and refused to accept his abuse.

I’m trying to find things online on why they try and make you make the house spotless. It’s a non stop battle with his complaints about the house and cleaning.yet they never clean up themselves . He will become violent if I tell him to clean or if I just say one word back to his 1 hour long rant.

"Well. For what it’s worth I didn’t know this was a pattern. I thought this was specific to my partner, so I don’t know why, but you are not alone at all. They will have violent outbursts if the house isn’t clean enough and I’m at the point where I sweep twice a day and am constantly cleaning the kitchen in order to avoid being yelled at or worse. But they will not lift a finger and leave all their dirty laundry all over the place. 

I guess it probably comes down to control. It definitely has the effect of keeping you on eggshells if things aren’t clean enough. But it also limits your behavior and ability to do things for yourself rather than for your abuser. I don’t know if it’s fully conscious, I’m still struggling with understanding that aspect, but it definitely has those effects. It might be that he is just trying to find ways to break your self-esteem as well.

My boyfriend has anger issues which he’s admitted to. He’s never hurt me or even tried to hurt me, but when we get into heated arguments he often does things to physically intimidate me or control my movements. With him, it is typical for a small issue that I’ve raised turns into a massive argument. He has trauma from his upbringing that he’s very open with me about but it’s never been resolved.  Nothing incredibly intense; his parents divorced and both kind of left him to fend for himself. His emotional intelligence is very low which makes sense when you understand how he was raised. Anyways, all to say he does not know how to communicate his emotions well, if at all. When he gets upset, I can only compare him to a child that doesn’t yet know how to speak and simply throws a tantrum. The other day I asked if we could chat, which inevitably led to a blow out(always does, regardless of the issue). He slams doors and has broken many items in our apartment over the years. When he gets aggressive, I get upset. I went to our bedroom where he followed me in a rage. When I try to tell him I need space he grabs me and pins me onto the bed. I wiggle and squirm and try to get out of his grip but he doesn’t let me go and just kept telling me to calm down over and over. In the moment this infuriates me even more because he’s the one that needs to calm down. And him grabbing me doesn’t help me calm down it makes me feel worse. This is probably the 4th time this has happened. Sometimes he just walks me into a corner and holds me there until I eventually stop yelling at him to let me go. He doesn’t hit me or intentionally try to hurt me but I feel like this must be still considered abuse?? I told him that this last time it happened and he absolutely disagrees and says it’s not. Which is expected. But I really don’t know and I’m not sure if I’ve mislabeled his actions. Can someone help? I just want to be able to explain this to him but can’t seem to. FYI He’s 35 and I’m 33. we’ve been together almost four years now	Brilliant_Bell_7468	post	22.17742808455833	female	White	0.9986999034881592	na	na	na	2	domesticviolence	no prediction.
This is definitely abuse. Mental and physical. Him gaslighting you, forcing you into a position against your will, it’s not good. You aren’t overreacting. But take warning- this is not a good sign. It may take time but it WILL get worse. You think to yourself “how he’d never do that, not in a million years “- until he does it. That’s what happened to me. Mine was on a much faster route to destruction though, he’d have a rage fit at least once or twice a month. It got more gradual over the long haul. Don’t be me- save yourself. I was beat, thrown to the ground, and strangled. Yet I STILL love him. It’s a horrible place to be, and we were only a year and a half in. You will thank yourself later if you get out NOW. Someone that loves you will NEVER do something to intentionally hurt you.	Brilliant_Bell_7468	reply	na	na	na	0.9986999034881592	weak	no	no	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.

"I posted here about a month ago after my wife threatened to kill me when she was angry. She has BPD and goes into rages seemingly out of nowhere sometimes. I understand that BPD is hard to live with and have tried to accommodate her to the best of my knowledge and ability, though sometimes I know I could be doing more.

A few days ago she got really mad, I don’t even know what she was angry about (she told me afterwards but I was so shaken up that it didn’t stick). I don’t pretend to be perfect and I know that I didn’t do everything right in the situation, but she stole my phone out of my hands because she “didn’t want me to shit talk her with all of our friends”. This is something I have never done and will never do and she looked through my phone during this argument and admittedly found no proof that I had. 

Well I took the phone back because she had set it down on the counter and I saw an opportunity to get it back. She proceeded to punch me on my arm multiple times and tackle me, breaking my phone case and cracking the back glass in the process. Over the course of the following hour she tackled me multiple times trying to get it back, she punched me in the face (on accident) but also threatened to do it on purpose multiple times. The whole time I was begging for her to allow me to take our cat to the vet (he was deathly sick), she sat in front of the door and wouldn’t allow me to leave. This entire time I did not lay a hand on her to push her off of me or try to get her out of the way.

She finally snapped out of it and we took our cat to the vet and ended up having to put him down that same night. So now I’m heartbroken for multiple reasons and don’t know what to do because she seems remorseful (she sobbed when she saw the bruises she left on my face and whatnot and told me that she felt like a terrible person). 

I just really don’t know what to do and I know that if I go to my friends she’ll get angry again and no one would even take me seriously because I’m a man.

"BPD isn't an excuse to be an abusive POS.
No amount of accommodation will make the rage outbursts actually stop for good. The more you give up in the name of ""accommodation"", the more the rage will rule the relationship, and the more you will feel like shit.

"People here take you seriously OP. I’m so sorry this happened and I’m so sorry about your cat. 

I don’t think her remorse or her mental health condition justify what she did. 

Even if you keep her secret by not talking to your friends, there is nothing you can do to prevent this from happening again. Doing more to accommodate her will not prevent this from happening again. You did not deserve what happened regardless of how much or how little you accommodate her.

I’m sure this feels like a complicated situation to you, but it’s really not. She’s not a safe person. You’re not safe around her, you’re not safe living in the same home as her. She has demonstrated repeatedly with her actions that you cannot be safe around her.

"It came out of nowhere. I didn't expect Sunday morning to go the way it had. There was no physical abuse before, but now it occurs to me that he was manipulating the situation and trying to exert complete control and dominance over me by masking it as BDSM.

I am not in great shape. Physically I have bites, scratches, and rug burns. My neck and back hurt. So does my chest. My right pinky toe is broken.

I'm at a loss and don't know what to do anymore. I feel guilty and lost and torn.

"I’m so sorry you’re going through this. 

Safety issues within BDSM relationships can be particularly tricky to navigate and abuse is unfortunately common. Start your journey of healing with forgiving yourself and turning your attention and effort to your needs. 

I hearing you saying you want help for him and his pain, but now is the time to focus on your pain and recovery. DID can be managed and you’ll heal from this traumatic experience. Be kind to yourself and don’t give in to despair. You can do it. I’m sending you love."	HelixFossil88	reply	na	na	na	0.9981935620307922	strong	no	no	na	domesticviolence	failed
"someone healthy that is into BDSM will respect boundaries. 

I don't have DID, but this is what I would do. you need to find your strongest personality and bring it out. if not the strongest then make one. watch Jessica jones. pull yourself up.

"So, for 4 years I was in this relationship with someone older than me. We were never an official couple cause he was a serial cheater, my daddy issues kept me in it( this was definitely a Freudian type relationship), he was all I had, no friends no family. Things started getting violent. Everyday was something, the insults were never enough for him, he would get loud and it would take hours for it to end. Drug addiction was also a thing between us and keep the relationship standing, it was the thing that brought us together.He punched me in public and nobody helped me, while is new side piece was in his house. He did so many fucked up shit I can’t even process them. Like putting people in my house( his sidepieces) without me knowing. So much happened and I’m so tired embarrassed to tell those things. Just seems surreal. Four to five months ago I managed to run away after he came to my house and broke my dishes and at that moment I didn’t recognise him and really feared for my life. Since then he’s been trying to talk and make me feel like I’m in the wrong and telling me that we can still be friends and still insulting me at the same time. 

I stayed for so long cause it felt like I was having a front row seat to something so surreal and so interesting at the same time I just couldn’t look away. So I stayed and watched him use me while he did what he always did, living his life has he pleased 


Why do I miss this person? I still feel sexually attracted to him. This is literally the person that as treated me the worst in my life. Why??"	Vegetable-Mirror7701	post	29.93976235357711	female	White	0.9975549578666687	na	na	na	19	domesticviolence	failed

Yeah you absolutely correct. Dealing with him meant that my own life and my own problems were swept under the rug. He made everything about him and that was comforting cause it was a distraction from my actual life. Seeing him reject me in real time with other people while saying the most horrendous things was like a kink. Was like my fear of rejection was watching the rejection itself in real time and was analysing everything to try to perceive it better. It took me months to process all the fucked up shit he done and convince myself that what he did was wrong and not something that somebody that cares for you would ever do.

Well in my head I was exclusive to him, but like I said part of the attraction to him was my lack of a parent figure in my life. So he was like my friend/lover/father/abuser. So it makes everything so much harder trying to unravel this whole thing. I tried to be just friends but I would easily obsess over him and just fall back into that. It’s so fucked up.

Hi everyone !
My best friend is in a horrible marriage that she feels trapped him.  10+ years, 2 children, he's the sole provider for the family..ect. me and her other friends worry dally that he is going to hurt her eventually. His recent tactic was turning off the internet and her phone because she told him she discovered he was cheating. This is just one drop in the bucket...he's done so much more and worse mental abuse than this. Anyhow, I'm encouraging her to leave her husband. I was wondering if there was any books or movies that you felt was inspiring to your story. In example, maid on Netflix felt really empowering to me when I left my son's father for drug abuse. I want to give her all the tools she needs to feel empowered and capable🩷.

I recently read should I stay or should I go? Surviving a relationship with a narcissist. And it really opened my eyes and proved to me that my  bf of 7 going on 8 years is a narcissist. And it gave tips on what you can do if you decide to stay. Like what to avoid in certain situations so you don’t get more emotional and mental abuse from them. Just keep supporting her, one day she will be strong enough to leave and she will need your help when she does leave. Having no money, car, or place to live. (I’m not sure of her situation and how much he limits her. My bf doesn’t let me work, sold my cars and I would have to go to a DV shelter but regardless it will be hard no matter what so she’s gonna need you most definitely. She will get tired of the way he treats her and feel like she’s wasting her life being with him. (I know I do, and I’m getting to the point of becoming strong enough to leave but that’s because I’ve had my sisters and a friend support me all these years and tell me I was good enough, I didn’t need him, that they will help me, etc)	allysweetaspie	reply	na	na	na	0.0021014444064348936	no	strong	no	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.
Honestly I never felt the need to get into movies about it. I try to avoid that as much as possible.. kinda kicks in the PTSD.. the only thing that helped as far as movies go was What’s Love Got To Do With It.. it was very empowering and she ended up leaving and living a great successful life. In these relationships their goal is to bring you down and any story about the woman going up instead of down should be inspiring.

Thank you so much for your thoughtful reply. He's  made her stay a stay at home wife/mom for years and has held money over her head the whole time. He's even told her that the kids would stay with him as he has the money and she doesn't. He has ostracized her from her whole family. Has made them assume she's the one giving them the cold shoulder. He has text me to tell me she was upset with me on several occasions just to see if it'd damage our relationship. I have told him that I'm never leaving. He sees me as a huge threat. She's starting to finally find the courage to leave him now. I just hope she doesn't go back to him after she does leave..it's so easy to do. I fear he will threaten suicide/ change/ ect. It's all a false narrative to get her to come back.

"My husband beat me up about two nights ago. 

He works til 12 most nights of the week, and I’m left alone during the day with our baby, and the majority of the time that I’m alone, I have no interactions with anyone. I have no friends in my city; we just moved here. Around 1:30am he came home from work, and I was angry that he took so long to get home. He showed up with three of his friends, and when I asked who one of them was, he just smirked and pointed at them, and it pissed me off so bad that I yelled at him in front of them. 

He then left the house with his friends and said that I was “trippin”, and it did nothing but make me angrier because I had been waiting for him to get home all night, like I always do. So I took a walk, and then I decided to turn around and go back home to pack a bag so I could spend the night elsewhere and cool my head. As I’m walking off with my bag down the street, I see my husband running after me yelling, asking me where I’m going, and he grabs me by the bag on my back and throws me on the concrete. I tell him to let me go and he picks me up by the jacket I had on and my bad and drags me back to the apartment complex. At this point, I’m screaming for him to let me go, and we’re now fighting in the front of the apartment complex. He takes my bag and I run away from him, then turn around for my bag and belongings because I was basically barefoot running down the street at 3am. I needed something. 

I’m at the apartment complex again and I see him walking towards me and my bag is gone. I hold up my hands and I say don’t touch me, and he says “I don’t care, get away from my apartment”. My name is on the lease and I was the one who secured us the apartment to live in. He won’t let me walk into the parking lot of the apartment complex and I’m screaming leave me alone, get off me, stop touching me and he’s just grabbing me and dragging me and pushing me onto the concrete over and over again as I try to run into my apartment. Then I break free from him and run towards the apartment once more, he spins me around and starts punching me in my head and then throws me on the concrete and I hit my head. There were two people standing outside watching us and they ran over and told him to get off me. He used my head as a stepping stool to get off the ground and called me “bitch” while he did it. Who can do things like this to the mother of their child? 

The bystanders called the police and he walked away. He left the apartment while our baby was in there in her crib alone, so I took our baby and ran down the street. I was able to get one of my bags before I left. I stayed out til 8 that morning and he found us at the bus stop.

I haven’t told these details to anyone because it’s too hard for me to tell anyone directly. I’m still angry. I’m still in shock. Everytime I think about it, it makes me so angry to the point where I want to cry. I just can’t believe I let him do that to me. I raised my hands up and didn’t even try to fight back, and I’m so angry that he took advantage of me like this. I have no one to defend me, he won’t let me use the family car to drive myself anywhere, and everytime I want to leave the house, he drives off in the car so that I have to stay with our baby at home."

Call the police and report it. Get a instant restraining order and poof he’ll be out of the shared lease home or they will refer you to help. I hate to say this but I know that less is more with these kinds of situations. I would just start going to sleep at night instead of stressing yourself out by staying awake to see what time he gets home. Sleep will help you have a sound mind. If you awake from people being over then have something to say politely the noise is loud and the rest of the house is sleep. Abusers have tarnished egos and misogynistic ways so you yelling at him infront of people embarrassed him n made him feel less than a man. I’m in no way saying it’s your fault.. It’s not. I’m just explaining the mind state of these types so you can know what you’re dealing with. There’s nothing you can do that will be good enough if he’s that far gone. I would recommend getting outside help. If you just moved to this new city, maybe it’s time for him to come home to an empty apartment and you on a flight/bus back home. N don’t talk to him until you get level headed again. It’s not easy but it can be done. Good luck.. it’s not your fault he’s damaged goods.

Look the sooner you realize the world revolves around him and decide if that’s acceptable or not acceptable, the better off you will be. There’s a lot missing from your narrative from a comprehensive standpoint, my guess is the baby actually was left alone at some point, for an unknown length of time, and you are adjusting the story to omit that fact because you know it was wrong, and you’d be judged harshly for it, and you came here for support and not judgement. Which is understandable. This is abusive controlling behavior and has all the indicators for a repeat performance, so he may be saying he’s sorry and it will never happen again, but it will, there’s scientific data that supports a reoccurrence. You need to remove him from your life, you should have filed charges immediately after he assaulted you, if it’s still possible, you should do so now, to have an official record of the event. He doesn’t get to abuse you whenever things don’t go his way, but he will if you allow it. That’s not the kind of life you deserve, or your child deserves, but it’s the life you’ll get unless you leave.

Well at the moment she was more in danger and scared, she provided an explanation that her child was being watched by a friend but the truth is she owed no one an explanation.

"Hi people, 

I am from India, my sister and brother-in-law shifted to England last year in July. Brother-in-Law has a history of physical abusing my sister in India. This year too he again started troubling my sister (controlling mentally & financially), my sister called the police, and they registered it as a non-crime domestic abuse incident. This was back in April. 

Me and my parents want my sister to come back to India, but my sister decided to stay back. Mainly because of my 18 months old nephew. She is in a toxic relation; we know the guy is going to relapse and take it out on my sister for complaining to the police.

I had this idea of reporting the police incident to the corporate where my brother-in-law works. But the HR told me that even if I make the call anonymously, they will have to reveal to the guy why an investigation is taking place (keeping my identity anonymous). It will just cause more trouble for my sister, since he will immediately imply that someone from the girl's family made the call. 

Can someone complain to the corporate on my behalf? My idea is that whoever makes the call will disguise as some Women Help NGO.

It would be so great to have a roof over our heads but also this problem of the job would still exist.

"May I ramble at y'all? I am still searching for a support group.

Yesterday I went to a family reunion in my great-grandfather's home state. It was a 4 hour solo drive over a route I've never travelled alone, into country with no cell signal. 

I have been staying with my parents. They left out several days early, to spend some extra time with friends and family in the area. I met up with them at the reunion venue, a wee community center in the middle of absolute nowhere.

My abusive relationship ended at the end of April this year, in what I don't like to think was an attempted murder...but it kind of was an attempted murder. He left me bleeding profusely from the face, badly injured and semi-conscious, with a broken phone and broken glasses. I am functionally, not just legally, blind without corrective lenses. And then he stole my car and fled, leaving me alone in a house with no landline and no water. It was ten hours before I was able to gather myself up and make it to the next house over to ask to use their phone. I could easily have died.

I lived. (Surprise!) I have since reported this incident. There were witnesses.

I have been hiding from the world. I have been so dependent and so broken that I had panic attacks doing anything alone. I was so afraid. Afraid of living. Afraid of dying. Afraid to be alone and afraid to be near anyone. Almost afraid to move.

He pulled me back in for a minute with promises that he had changed. He didn't hurt me on purpose this time, but he handled me carelessly and then started an endless argument while I was literally crying in pain from him aggravating an injury that *he caused.* I am devastated at his behavior, his unchanged attitude of ""actually, I'm the real victim here,"" and my own foolishness.

I wanted to see my family *so badly.* I have not attended the annual reunion in almost twenty years.

I am still injured. I am in pain. I was terrified in a half dozen different directions. I went anyway, following printed directions like it was 1999.

And I made it to the reunion. I got hugs from cousins and great-aunts and -uncles I have not seen since I was in college.

I have cried so many tears of utter misery. Yesterday I cried tears of joy. 

Long ago, I spent some purely happy childhood summers digging my toes in the country dirt and chewing wild sugarcane with my cousins. Those memories now feel like almost the only part of myself or my life left that my abuser has never touched. I cannot describe how joyful and healing it was to go back there and hug some of the folks who made those memories with me.

Today I came home to a letter from the circuit court. I don't want to open it. Everything came crashing right back in.

Now I am crying again. 

I want off this rollercoaster, but the ride hasn't ended yet. I know one day it will. I wish I knew when. 

I know I am not alone in this.

Stay strong and stay safe."	dreamcat000	post	29.230956510622654	female	White	0.9974887371063232	na	na	na	1	domesticviolence	failed

"My recent ex discarded me not very long ago (as a way to manipulate me) im trying to take this opportunity i have to recover from the abuse so i stop going back.

One of the things ive been ruminating on is how he had recently started to hit me. We always play fought a lot when we started i always thought it was weird how when he would put me in a head lock he would choke me really hard and he would still hold on even after i would tell him it was hurting but at that time i assumed it was an accident yk.

Fast forward to the second time were together. We still play fight and one day were in the elevator on the way up to my dorm when i playfully slap him. I know this sounds bad but to explain hes a boxer so we would pretend to box or street right bc we thought it was funny during this though id hit him bc im not vry strong and he would pretend to hit me bc again hes a boxer and a weight lifter so he could accidentally hurt me. This is why i slapped him bc it was our usual mo. 

In response he punched me in my face. He punched me so hard i thought it was atleast gonna bruise. At that time he was like omg im so sorry i didnt think it was gonna connect. I just laughed it off bc i didnt think any thing of it. This happened two more times before we broke up were he would accidentally hit me in my face and apologize.

Looking back on it now im starting to question the validity of these accidents. Hes a big guy and knows how strong he is how is it only that recently hes started hitting me my face.

I talked to my mom whos a DV survivor about it and she thinks its a red flag and even before i told her that she told me hes going to eventually hit me. He reminds her a lot of my dad whose her abuser.

I trust her opinion but idk i just feel so over dramatic. Other people have said the same thing but ig im blinded from the abuse. I hope this all makes sense"	Cultural_Sky8758	post	20.66608320822104	female	White	0.9917616844177246	na	na	na	8	domesticviolence	no prediction.

"I completely understand when you say “hard to see him for the person he is because it becomes scary”. This resonates with me so much. 

Are you familiar with the concept of **[betrayal blindness](https://www.relationalrecovery.com/betrayal-blindness/)**? This is not done consciously, it’s a way our brain tries to protect us while in an unsafe environment/relationship. This is why we often see red flags in hindsight. 

> Betrayal blindness is not allowing yourself to see what is going on, to connect the dots, or to fully engage with reality, because if you did, the information would threaten your relationship with the person who is most important to you.

Now, I just learned my sister might be going through same. Her husband worked for my parents. He just randomly quit and then during his exit interview claimed the job working for my parents was effecting his mental health so bad he was taking it out on my sister.

I am livid right now.  This screams manipulation. Also, what the hell is going on with my sister?  I know my brother in law had had drinking issues in the past. Was treated. Now this? 

I am at a loss.  I’m afraid to reach out directly to my sister."	burner_1993	post	26.639939486734246	female	White	0.9991739392280579	na	na	na	5	domesticviolence	no prediction.
Are you able to get your sister out and take her for a coffee or out to eat? Then you can talk to her in person and find out exactly what is going on. Just remind her that you have been through DV, and you just want to make sure she is safe. (I am currently going through it now so I know how hard it is to get away from your abuser, as I am still having trouble) but she may get defensive or mad, you just have to remind her you are her sister and you are worried about her and just want to make sure she is okay and nothing bad is going on at home.

I was in a similar situation where everyone was blaming his addiction for the abuse. Addiction doesn’t cause abuse. I’ve known addicts and alcoholics who were never abusive, and I’ve known abusers who don’t have addictions. These are two separate issues, and the abuse can actually get worse after they get sober. It’s not your fault and you did nothing wrong. I think you made the right choice by leaving him and you’re safer now.

"Hey all. Posting on behalf of a friend…

She has an abusive (physically, verbally, emotionally, etc.) spouse that’s been going on for some time. Recently he’s been threatening her and the kids, to hurt himself, and other things…

He has all of her electronics cloned and she’s afraid for him to find out she’s trying to get out because he might snap and do something crazy. 

What do we do here? She is able to leave the house to go to the office but is being tracked etc…

"This sounds hard and my heart goes out to you both. I'd start building an exit-plan ASAP for her and the kids. 

 I'd recommend looking into domestic-violence nonprofits and advocacy centers in your area and reach out to them on behalf of your friend to see how they can help. Many might be able to assist in an exit-plan, both informally and formally and logistically. I'd recommend to her to get a burner flip phone or a 2nd smart phone when she goes out to the office and to leave it at the office, somewhere safe and hidden and to put it on silent when she's not there. 

Start brainstorming places your friend and their kids could safely escape to, any place that her spouse has information on like the address or phone number isn't safe. 

Start building an exit bundle at the office. Include things like copies of the kids' documents and any things you can't live without. Also include some clothes for you and the kids, toothbrushes, comfort items, etc. Remember that at the end of the day, even valuables aren't comparable to a human life. 

What's most important is your friend and their kids getting out of this situation alive and swiftly and staying protected after they exit. Once they exit, the spouse will obviously be on the hunt, so it's important to prepare as much as possible and then take fast action and don't look back. 

Start thinking about the best time to escape, does the spouse go on any business trips? Weekend fishing trips? Are they a heavy sleeper? You need at least 2-3 hours of time to safely escape, ideally when the spouse is not at home for a day or two. 

Immediately after your friend and their kids are in a safe location, they should file an emergency custody petition along with an emergency restraining order and include the children on the restraining order. Emergency petitions like this are typically signed the day of or next day and then you have a first court date in a month or so, this would give your friend about a month of legal protection and to possibly relocate somewhere more stable within the state's jurisdiction. Once you start going to court, evidence is paramount, so it's very important that your friend has documentation and can prove their abuse. But what's most important is getting to a safe place and locate the nearest precinct for ease. 

Definitely reach out to as many DV organizations that you can find and see how they can help you. There are many out there that can provide free support, help build an exit plan and an exit package, temporary housing and legal support. 

Much blessings to your friend and their kids."	Temporary-Car2136	reply	na	na	na	0.1680344045162201	strong	no	no	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.
"Hi everyone- using a throw away because this isn’t my story.  

I have a friend (40 F) who is having a hard time, she is intrigued by Reddit, but doesn’t have an account.  She is dealing with circumstances that I don’t have any experience with, and have seen Reddit comments give great advice to people in need, so I’m hoping I can share basic details and maybe show this to her depending on how it goes.  

Please be kind, I feel that one thing stopping her from posting on Reddit is being judged.  

Married with pre teen kids (husband is father of kids)

Have a business together, sounds like the majority of business debts put in her name

Rent co op apartment in HCOL area, their rent is at least 1000 under market value, so leaving would likely mean having to leave the city.

She works so so hard- does it ALL:  kids meals, husbands meals, cleaning, planning, majority of dog walks / care with their puppy, full time on their business from home (if not more).  Not infrequently working all weekend and late into the evenings to catch up.  She has told him how overwhelmed she is with no change.  It sounds like she has brought up counselling and he was not interested.

He is emotionally/ verbally abusive frequently, and it has got physical (not sure of frequency, but at least 3 times that I know of).  As far as I know, the kids have never been physically harmed or witnessed him harming her.  

She feels like she has no options because of how intertwined their finances are, and I don’t think there is a safety net/ savings.  I don’t know specifically what happened but she is responsible for the household shopping and this week he moved most of the money from their joint account.

Her support system is also far away, and I don’t know how much they are aware.  Which is why I’m making this post.

Please be kind if you are going to comment or provide advice as I would like the option to show her this post if I get helpful feedback.  

Even if you’ve been in a similar situation, and can share anything about that- I think it would even be nice for her to read those as I know she feels isolated.

"We’ve been separated for a year now. I was able to get a DVRO, in the process of divorce, and getting ready to renew the DVRO. Once he found out I was going to try to get it renewed his demeanor changed. He started getting more involved in coparenting. 

The next morning after my sons visit he was walking with a limp. I did notice some scratches on him. So I assumed he must have fallen. He’s a toddler so it happens. I asked his father if he got hurt somehow because of his leg. He replied that no and that he’s always safe with him and nothing like that happens. I simply said I understood and know that our son can be a bit clumsy. This seemed to send him on a rant that he isn’t clumsy and he’s never shown clumsiness with him and that he isn’t happy with the level of stress and anxiety our son has. And that if anything is going on when he’s with me. That only once he’s having fun does he start to laugh and let loose. I told him it’s mostly separation anxiety and once he’s comfortable he’ll be able to have fun. I also let him know I noticed a change in our sons behavior. 

When visits first started it was so hard for our son. He would cling to me and cry at each drop off. I reached out for help from a friend and after about 7 months he started getting better and would look forward to the exchanges. Then three weeks ago after his visit he had a horrible nightmare. It took a long time to calm him. The next two weeks he was hesitant to go to his visits. Clinging on to me again and telling me no. I only told him that I noticed that he was reverting back to how it was. 

He then sent me a large text telling me that it’s not separation anxiety and that our son is scared and he has issues with diaper changes. That something must be going on at my time and that he’s always safe with him. 

My son has a lot of anxiety. When we were together and I’d go to work, his father would watch him. It always ended in disaster. He would scream at our son to shut up, send me videos of him crying and him making an angry face at our child. Then threaten to bash his head and throw him against the wall. Ever since then my son hates when I’m not around. After we left, my son was scared of loud noises, men, and the sound of doors opening. I’ve worked so hard and now he’s getting better. The only trigger now is doors. However, he still gets really anxious and scared when I leave the room. It’s so frustrating that he’s putting it all on me when our son is like this because of him.

Sounds like you have more than enough evidence and justification to go for full custody. When you renew the DVRO, you can also ask to include your child in the restraining order. It sounds like your son would be much safer with you full time, and I would do everything to be able to make that a reality ASAP. I personally don't think you should consider coparenting with someone who is clearly abusive. In the interim, as unfortunately you do have to coparent until you can get full custody, I'd recommend a coparenting application that can document everything for you and be one place for all communication, schedule and finances. There are many out there. If you have a DVRO you shouldn't be texting, that will only invite problems and stress, I'd recommend going no-contact except for a coparenting application and trying to get full custody.

That’s where he’s pushing that my son doesn’t want to go with me and lying that our son is hesitant to go with me during pick ups.

"I see. I would make a petition to change the visitation supervisor. His father is not appropriate as he is biased, not a neutral 3rd party nor is he trained. 

Visitation supervisor in a DV case should be someone either from a court-affiliated agency, a family mediator, someone from a DV victim support nonprofit, or a mental health professional. 

Dont be afraid of any false accusation, especially parental alienation. As a DV survivor with a DVRO you dont need to explain or prove to him or anyone else that you are trying to coparent. There is no coparenting with abusers. And you're doing more than enough in the meantime, I'm glad to hear you're using a coparenting app in the interim, I would restrict \*all\* communication onto that platform and explicitly state your boundaries. For example: Please communicate with me solely on Talking Parents for all related matters. Please do not contact me outside of the application unless of an emergency. 

To further nullify his false accusations, start keeping a very detailed journal or audio record initial conversations with your son once you pick him up to prove that he is actually happy to see you.

Fast forward to now and she hired an attorney, who first thing, fired off a few motions about how she should have the house because I abused her, I am trying to hide what I did to her blah blah blah. 

The hiding part is because I put in for a motion for injunction to get her to stop saying this crap. I filed that under a motion to seal because it is the only documentation out there that has the police report and court case flow from my arrest.

"TLDR: I(32F) have been with my long-distance boyfriend(41M) for over a year and I cheated repeatedly for most of the relationship and now he is saying things that make me feel unsafe daily like ""I'll hold you and have my sister bash your face in"" ""go kill yourself"" ""the sooner you drop dead, the better it will be"" ""go get hit by a bus"" but constantly begs me to come back after he says things like this using my cheating as an excuse to talk to me and control how I live my life.

&#x200B;

I have known him for over 5 years. We were getting along well but the distance was difficult, I acted on impulse and I cheated with my ex, slept with him and my current boyfriend found out. Since then, old messages of me flirting or being ""too friendly"" to people have come up. It has taken a toll on us and I know that is my fault. I have apologised repeatedly and have tried to fix things but am constantly met with anger and hateful messages. He's told me to kill myself or hurt myself repeatedly despite knowing that I struggle with mental health issues and suic!dal ideations. He has called everyone in my family names, including my kids (luckily when they're not around), and threatens to disrupt what little stability we have in life (my children and I have been victims of assault prior to us being together).

&#x200B;

He would constantly ""lovebomb"" and act loving or caring when it suits him but then flips out as soon as he thinks or feels something is off even when all I'm doing is watching a show or texting him. He records me in my sleep without my consent to ""keep an eye"" on me. He refuses to let me go back to work in fear that I would be ""messaging men on your lunch break"". He's threatened to hurt himself and jump off a bridge more than once and being in a completely different country, there's not much i could do. I know I hurt him and I want to fix things but now I'm having a hard time deciding whether to leave or stay because in one hand I know I caused his paranoia because of that I've done, but I also don't know if I have the mental capacity to constantly be immersed in the daily hateful arguments and threats of hurting me or telling me to kill myself. Please help...

If cheating was the issue he would have left. What you did was wrong, but he is seeing it as an opportunity to abuse you, there is no excuse to abuse ever.

"This is manipulation, do not stay for that reason. As has already been said, put that responsibility onto someone else, the police, family members. Tell him you've done that, that he is no longer your responsibility, and then walk away and block him.

You weren't happy in the long distance relationship by the sounds of it and cheated.

You call the police and tell them he is telling you he is going to kill himself and sent you a picture of the bridge. They will go and if he is attempting suicide they will save him.

this story is probably going to sound crazy, so please please bear with me. so about a week ago, me and my bf got into a fight and it ended up escalating pretty bad. he took my car, made me get in, he did put his hands on me once and i jumped out of my car cause i didn’t know how else to get out of the situation. i did hit him as well before he put his hands on me (this was before he took my car). i did get my car back, nothing major happened to it thankfully. he ended up reaching out to me friday. he asked if he could see me, he swore that he would not act up, raise his voice, or anything bad. he said if he feels he’s going to get upset that he will walk away to let things cool down. & i promised him i would do the same and we both agreed to let eachother walk away if that ended up happening. he said he just wanted to talk. so i did end up going and we did actually talk, the conversation went very calm surprisingly. he let me express how i felt about the situation and my point of view, i let him express how he felt and his pov. he says he wants to be with me and wants to fix our relationship. i told him a lot of change would need to happen for me to even consider. i set alot of boundaries, i told him i would like for each of us to go to therapy individually cause i know we both have internal things to work on, and that i’d want to do therapy together too, told him he would need to take anger managements classes, he would need to stop doing drugs, and he needs to get his stuff together. he agreed and told me he’s willing to do anything to fix it and that he’s all in with my conditions. he also set some boundaries as well, he said he would want both of us to stop drinking so excessively cause we think alcohol could be a problem when we fight. we both agreed we need to respect eachother more, talk to eachother better, etc etc. i can’t lie i do want to give this relationship one more shot.. i just feel the people who were involved in our situation (my mom, my bestfriend, his mom) are very against us seeing/talking to eachother and stuff rn which i understand completely. i don’t blame them at all for feeling the way they do. but i don’t want to let how they feel dictate my decision because this is what i want. i feel like a couple of my friends i’ve talked to about it would probably stop talking to me and i hate that feeling cause i don’t want to lose any of these people in my life…. it’s such a messy situation and i hate that it got to this point but i truly do have hope that he can change. and i know i need to see actions, not just go based on words. what do i do about my family & friends?? am i stupid ?

"Your story isn’t crazy. Abusers are formulaic. 

Your abuser is not going to go to therapy and do whatever else you’ve asked of him because you’ve already given him assurance that you’re staying in the relationship. All he had to do is go “I want to talk” and you showed up earnestly.  

No contact is important because it allows you to deprogram from the abuse dynamic and associated delusions that abusers are salvageable romantic partners.

If you're both serious then time away to grow will change nothing and will only help your relationship and it'll show your friends and family that you're taking their concerns seriously because right now the only thing that is certain is you're planning on getting back with a man who's just the same as he was before. He hasn't done any of the work. It's just words.

Also please keep in mind that someone who hurts you is not worth losing genuine friends over. People who are against you getting back with him are saying it because they care about you and don't want you to get hurt or be killed whereas he doesn't have that same regard or care for your wellbeing.

If he can change overnight it’s not because he couldn’t do better, he was choosing to be abusive. This means it’s calculated on his part. This is called hoovering and it’s a tactic abusers use all the time. He’s looking for a new supply as we speak, but he’s hoping he can just get you back so he doesn’t have to break a new person’s spirit. Instead he can spend two weeks being perfect for you and then he can slip into doing nothing for you again. That’s way easier than spending maybe a year convincing someone new that he’s a good guy. Only to slowly do less and less for her and cutting her off from her peers until she’s THRILLED when he puts in the least amount of effort possible while never paying bills, never doing chores, or anything.

My abuser was also a drug addict and I heard so many times that he would quit to “save” our relationship, but he never did. The violence just got worse and worse. And when you add drugs to the mix it escalates things so much more. It’s not just psychical abuse too. It gets into emotional, verbal and financial abuse. Leave while you can.

Walk away, given there are drugs and alcohol involved, change is even harder. People naturally revert to usual habits/behavior when emotional/angry. If he is going to change for the better, it will take a very long time for him to change those toxic behaviors.

"Honestly while it's possible in the future he could honestly change and be better if he committed to therapy, he will never be able to have any other dynamic with you.

Abuse isn't just about his behavior. It's about codependency for both of you and a toxic dynamic. His instincts are to abuse you, definitely. And he can work on those maybe. But your instincts are that if you have a conflict he's going to abuse you. 

We as victims learn techniques to redirect these conflicts, or even sometimes move them to another time. Sometimes we learn that if they're going to happen, it's better we almost provoke them under our own turns.

Even if a light switch could magically flip where he was never going to abuse you again, you'd be waiting for it.

Giving him another chance would be a mistake. Calling yourself stupid isn't going to be productive.

From what I can tell. First draft it sounded like he took car, forced her in and she hit him in self defense.

"If she hit him after he took her car and ""made"" her go in hitting him it's premature to say they're toxic to each other. You might be right might not be based in evidence.   That being said if she snapped and hit him before just getting out of the vehicle she does need healthier responses. And   this is going to get dangerous even more quickly if after any threat she starts getting physical before just exiting- because he will see it as green light to go ahead."

I think there must have been an edit as I didn't see that part in parentheses. Or else I missed it.

When I made the post it was because of the part in parentheses.  I'm a domestic violence survivor and do not condone any violence.  If you are going to hit someone first you are not helping the situation.  That's why I said it's both of them.  He could've been emotionally and verbally abusive but when she hit him she took it to a different level.  If it isn't physical sometimes you just need to learn to stand down to try to deescalate the situation to protect yourself.  Hitting is the opposite.

"I dont know if this belongs here but im looking for any guidance on what the hell just happened to me.

I the abuse from my ex feels so calculated. Im spiraling because idk how to feel. For example everytime we breakup he comes back in mid October like clock work. He uses his mental health to make me feel bad for him even though he dosent care hes never going to kill himself he just knows ill take care of him if its what i believe. 

My ex was obsessed with me 4 years before we started dating. When we were friends it was a similar but more discard love bomb cycle but he was also really possessive of me and would get aggressive when he felt other men may be able to get with me.

As we where together i found out during our friendship he had secretly taken pictures of me to have. His excuse was that he did it with all of his friends (which is not true ive been through his phone) and i was dumb so i let it go. He also kept a group picture we all took when we were friends in his wallets just so he could look at me. He told me himself he was obsessed with me. 

Hes also a sexual sadist and without getting to into it sexual abuse was the biggest factor in our relationship. He promised that hed be gentle because ive been assaulted in the past but very quickly pushed every boundary i had around it. Hes into some sick shit like watching woman crying or rape/beating woman and told me he doesnt feel guilt or remorse. I feel he would specifically go out of his way to trigger my ptsd while we were having sex. I told him i couldnt do a certain position without having a flashback and hed say ok thats fine. Then hed eventually ask or beg to do that position and it would hit a point where he would either just start doing the things i told him i didnt want to or id give him and say yes. Hed get really aggressive and shame me without us talking about it before having sex

He was abusive in other ways too. He was very emotionally and mentally abusive. Everything was some kind of mind game and i feel like an idiot for falling for it. My mom (who was in a physically abusive relationship with my father) has said if i keep going back itll get physical. In some ways it already has he “accidentally” punched me in my face three times and at that time i laughed it off bc i didnt think he would do it on purpose but being out of the relationship has made me question the validity of a grown man who lifts weights and boxes accidentally punching his gf in the face so hard i thought i broke my nose. 

Hes gotten more comfterable with yelling at me and was testing the waters on what ill take.
Hes violent and aggressive when hes angry hes punched his car radio out but he hasbt done this while we argue yet.

Im trying to see the situation for what it is and the more i do the more it freaks me out. Every time we break up he stalks me in one way or another. He told me the thought of me with other men makes him want to kill them. 

It just all feels like he leaves so i become more dependent so im more broken than before. So i need him so he can control me. He will have other supply when we break up but will still chose to manipulate me into coming back. I want to move on but im so stuck. It feels like i cant live without him and yet im also terrified of him. I dont know why it just feels like a sick game. It feels like im waiting in time out until he comes back. Im to scared to even dye my hair because i dont want to make any wrong decisions while hes gone. In my guy i feel like thats what he wants and im so tired of the abuse."

"Your whole story of this guy's behavior is disturbing, but the sexual sadism in particular is really worrisome. 

Also trigger warning for sexual weirdness.

My abuser was a sexual sadist. I'm mildly kinky myself and enjoyed a moderate spanking among other CONSENSUAL kinks, but he pushed and pushed my boundaries and made me feel guilty for ""depriving him"" of what he wanted to do in bed.

He liked to put his hand around my throat during sex. At first he was gentle and this was consensual. It eventually stopped being so gentle. Eventually he started doing it out of the bedroom when he was angry at me.

Guess who has been violently strangled unconscious  several times now? 

I used to sing first soprano. It was one of the keenest joys in my life. I can't do that anymore. My larynx is damaged from repeated injury. For a long time, even my speaking voice was ruined. I can sing again now, but I have lost my top octave and it is probably permanent.

"**This will be long and possibly triggering so TRIGGER WARNING!**

&#x200B;

I messed up very badly last night and I'm hoping some women survivors could give me some honest feedback or advice.

&#x200B;

I will need to preface this with some background for context. I'm not looking for sympathy, but I do think it's important to give background about where I am mentally. I will also specify that I have never once laid a finger on a woman and never could even conceive of such a thing. I'm a man with a pretty long history of being in abusive relationships. Some tip of the iceberg highlights are - 

\-Being beaten up by my GF at the time and when trying to leave was kept in the room at knifepoint forcing me to jump out of my second story window to call the police. The police arrived, laughed at me, and told me I would be arrested if I didn't drive her home. Once I got her home she refused to leave my vehicle and beat me some more.

\-Locked in a car with this same GF during a snowstorm while she drove extremely erratically eventually leading to her going into a ditch in the middle of nowhere without cell signal where she proceeded to rape me.

\-I was falsely accused of rape after a woman had sex with me while I was basically unconscious and drunk, in front of many witnesses who can corroborate. There were no legal repercussions, but I did lose many friends and dignity over this.

\-My then GF who I had broken up with for all of her abuse broke into my house while I was sleeping on the couch, gave me two black eyes and a split lip, then proceeded to tell all of our friends that I assaulted her, which caused most of my friendships to deteriorate.

\-My now ex wife beat the shit out of me and then called the police saying that I was beating her. When the police arrived and saw my swollen face they told me I had to leave my own house with only the clothes on my back in almost freezing weather with no money or place to go. This was just one of many times she physically assaulted me, but probably one of the worst.

\-This same ex wife told all of our friends and family that I routinely beat her, which is a 100% lie and once again ostracized me from my entire support network other than members of my family who saw through the lies.

These are just a small smattering of incidents to help explain my experience, and those relationships add up to around 20 years of my life dealing with abuse. Needless to say, I've been in some pretty intense therapy for years and take a plethora of wonderful medications for c-ptsd.

For the last few years I've gotten very close to a woman who has become one of the closest friends I've ever had in life, and my biggest support. I'm also her biggest support for intense things she is dealing with. We hang out almost every day and talk about very hard things constantly.

For the past few weeks we've been getting into some intense arguments. Last night she blew up at me over some pretty minor things and began speaking very nasty and abusively to me which triggered a whole lot of things relating to my experience. I told her how these things were triggering and activating towards me but she kept going until I had to leave the situation. When I got home I started receiving walls of text with her continuing to berate me caused by some very minor things that were truly just misinterpretations of things that had happened. She started talking about wanting to punch me which made something snap in my brain. 

My therapist specializes in abuse/trauma recovery and ptsd. A theme that has come up often is how abuse is treated within society differently for men and women and how men and women experience abuse differently. An example being that if I did any of the things done to me, I would be in prison. It's a very sensitive topic to address in a world of the patriarchy and women's oppression, but luckily my (woman) therapist is very good at recognizing the need to talk about these things. One sensitive thing that has come up which is often unique to men's experience is knowing that  you are physically stronger than your abuser but have very little recourse. There is a certain level of unique sadness knowing that you would never do what they are doing to you even though you are completely physically capable. It's also uniquely sad that they know it as well and hide behind the fact that you wouldn't, and are empowered by that fact. It's a very nuanced thing to talk about, even with a mental health professional and far too complex to type out here.

After my friend saying she wanted to physically harm me I was severely triggered and began speaking about my experiences and how much that was unacceptable to me. I also tried to explain the above concept, but in my triggered brain fog, it came out completely sideways. I should never have tried to bring that up when emotions were running high, but I did and what ended up coming out was rightfully interpreted by her as essentially ""you should be grateful that men restrain themselves from harming you."" That was not at all what I wanted to say and would never intentionally say anything resembling that sentiment. My intentions obviously don't matter at this point as I said something horrific and I'm not sure this friendship will survive.

I'm very much at a loss as to how to repair the damage I've caused and I'm not sure if that is even possible. I've obviously apologized profusely, but of course that isn't remotely helpful. If anyone has any sort of insight as to what steps I could take to maybe start rebuilding this friendship so dear to me, I would be forever grateful."

"I’m not a woman but I am a DV victim. Dude you don’t want this relationship to survive. She’s just another abuser. I believe you that you weren’t intending to threaten her and yes I understand what you mean about feeling weird about being technically able to defend yourself but being unwilling to do so because you’d never hurt a woman even if they were violent.

You didn’t mess up. She’s just verbally abusing you and making it out like she’s a victim to hurt you more.

"I got out at the end of April this year. I am safe, but I am so sad.

My past self did not see me as beautiful. When I looked at my body and face, I only saw flaws.

Now when I look at old photos all I can think is, *I was so beautiful.*

I have been through hell and it shows. I don't recognize myself anymore. My face is scarred. My nose has been broken more than once. It was never very cute, but it's less cute now. My jaw has been broken multiple times as well and it is a different shape. I was vain of my jawline. 

I had thick, waist length curls that my abuser began using as a convenient handle to snatch and throw me by. I cut it shorter and shorter and shorter, all the while lying to myself about why I was doing so. It is easier to care for buzz cut, but it was so pretty long. 

I'm 20lbs underweight on a 5'3"" frame. It was 30lbs, but I'm trying to gain. It is slow going.

During the worst of the abuse I suddenly went through early menopause. (Stress? I'm only 40.)

Just a few years ago I looked beautiful and young. Now I am gaunt and old, with hollow cheeks and angry eyes. 

I am trying to take care of myself. I do the things. Maybe things will improve. I don't know.

I'm aware that my looks are less important than my life. I escaped with that. I'm grateful, but I feel such a sense of loss.

I don't know why I am posting this.

"My ex recently had his sentencing hearing for felony stalking. He is very mentally unwell. While he has been in jail I have sold my home, moved, and am in the process of changing my name. The judge during sentencing disclosed that we moved and said the defendant would have to pay the fees for our relocation. I used victims assistance to cover the cost of moving and the Safe At Home program. I am incredibly upset the judge disclosed this information in open court. If he had generally said that the defendant owed restitution, that would be OK with me but this is different in my mind.

I wanted my ex to be under the impression that we still lived in the same location so that his main objective when released wouldn’t be to try to find us and that I could provide that address for his GPS tracker. 

Marsy’s Law says:

4) To prevent the disclosure of confidential information or records to the defendant, the defendant’s attorney, or any other person acting on behalf of the defendant, which could be used to locate or harass the victim or the victim’s family or which disclose confidential communications made in the course of medical or counseling treatment, or which are otherwise privileged or confidential by law.

"I was physically assaulted and left an abusive relationship about three years ago. My daughter is 3.5 yo. He has not seen her or made any attempts other than showing up to the restraining order court date and claiming he was going to seek visitation but so far has done nothing. I didn't get the restraining order. He only gets supervised visits once a month per our dependency order. Hasn't even tried to see her. Other than that I have severe PTSD and wake up every night from nightmares and flashbacks of being left for dead and beat within an inch of my life on more than one occasion. 

I really could use some support financially. It's not fair that he gets to move on with his life freely and I am stuck with 100% responsibility raising a child on my own. But I am afraid that if I seek child support , he will come back into our life's seeking revenge for me putting him in prison for three years. Also I fear for the safety of my daughter. I almost would rather leave him and his demons alone.

What should I do? I'm in the state of Florida if that helps. If I was to seek welfare I know the state would make him pay child support either way. Me and my daughter are currently only on Medicaid. I don't qualify for food stamps due to my income. I don't make a lot but it's definitely better than minimum wage. Anyways I'm just going around everyday with a grudge and very bitter that I'm footing the entire bill and all the support for this child that he helped make so why am I the only one suffering after all he put me through.

I love my daughter by the way in case anyone says anything she is my world.

A police case of domestic violence was opened against my partner and an avio was issued. With the given AVO, he committed illegal actions against me twice more, about which new cases were also opened in the police. The case was sent to court, several court sessions took place, he did not admit guilt and no decisions were made. The next trial was scheduled for 07.08 and I had to go there. I was given a court notice. But today I was informed by the police that the case is being closed, since my husband behaved about this time, he was given good characteristics from work and I do not need to go to court, because there will be no trial, since the case is being closed.

"Gaslighting is any situation in which the gaslighter/abuser responds to a reasonable request by the victim with anger, shame, or accusations directed at the victim. They do this to make the victim feel like they are the one in the wrong. Common gaslighting tactics look like this:

Victim: “Hey (abuser), I’m really not feeling well - would you mind if I skipped date night tonight?”
Abuser: “Just because you stayed up too late last night doesn’t give you an excuse to ignore and disrespect me. We had plans, and it’s dishonest to go back on them.” 

Victim: “can you pick up your dirty clothes?” 
Abuser: “after all I’ve done for you, you can’t even take 5 minutes to help me out for once.” 

Victim: “why did you hit me? I thought you promised you’d never do that again?”

"Mine is always the victim. It does not matter what horrifying things he has done to me: any time I expressed the slightest disapproval of anything he did, he got massively upset and started to justify himself. He would continue to justify himself until I agreed and just shut up, or he got angry enough to hurt me again.

The last time he saw me, he picked me up around the ribs. It hurt me terribly *because all the cartilage holding my ribs to my sternum is torn* on the left side, by him smashing me into a wall with a full force flying football tackle earlier this year. I weighed 95lbs at the time, and he weighed 150lbs+. When he picked me up, my fucking chest collapsed. It hurt so badly that I cried.

After his incredibly careless action in picking me up that way--I do believe that this time was purely careless, not malicious--I gently asked him to please be mindful and not do things like that *because it would hurt me.* Ok, yes, that is a bit obvious, but he did do it, so I thought it would be pertinent/acceptable to say that. 

No. I was being ""condescending"" to him by saying that, so off he went. It started a six hour fight while I was still weeping tears of pain, because no matter what I said to him, he compulsively picked it apart and justified himself and justified himself and justified himself, and I fucking CAN'T. He has literally almost killed me more than once but I couldn't even calmly and politely ask him to be considerate without triggering *him,* and *his* subjective hurt feelings are more important than my objective life.

This week my husband abused my 17 year old son physically. I feel so guilty, and every time I look at my son my heart sinks to my stomach. I can’t change what’s been done, but I am feeling guilty that I knew he wasn’t great at times, and I didn’t leave. I didn’t protect my children. Charges have been pressed, my kids are going through the wringer with investigators. I feel like the worst mom on the planet. Things I thought were normal behavior wasn’t. Coming from an abusive past myself I guess I just didn’t realize. Now that I know I feel so flipping awful. How do I cope? How do I look at my kids everyday knowing that I had them in a bad situation without realizing how bad, and now one of them was really hurt? What if I wasn’t home? So many what ifs? I am devastated. How do I move past the emotions. I can’t stop crying, I can’t sleep, I can’t eat. This low is a low on a completely different level. I am limited as to who I can talk to. Unfortunately some people love to talk garbage and poke at what you’ve been through instead of being helpful.

You should absolutely feel guilty and should regret it deeply. You wouldn’t be a mother if you didn’t. You can make excuses but you failed to keep your child safe. You husband is responsible for his failures and abuse, and you are responsible for somehow convincing yourself it was okay to have your children in a violent home.

You should feel guilty. When you don't protect your children that's natural. But you should also feel extremely angry because he caused this. Both the damage to your son and your emotional state right now. Use the guilt to do better and use the anger to go after him legally and push for the largest consequence possible. Yes, I would guess guilt is normal, but you want your children to see that you've woken up and you are going to FIGHT for them and FIGHT to give this man what he deserves.

"To the people telling you to feel guilty, remember, how is guilt productive? The only thing guilt serves is reminding us to never do something again. So use it for that, and for empathetically consoling your children.

I feel compelled to remind you it was he, not you, who deliberately harmed your son. So many victims are brainwashed into shouldering all of the responsibility for violence. Don’t shoulder more than what was yours, as it seems you were being controlled and manipulated by your ex too. 

It’s fine to feel complex emotions and feel for your kids, but it’s also possible they need you more as someone who can get up, dust off her face, and show them how to happily, safely and confidently build a new life again.

Remember you are their only stable parent now. Don’t let guilt and shock consume you into checking out. If that then the abuser has won. Your kids need you. Only feel as bad as it seems appropriate to remember never go back and make sure your kids are emotionally healing from it, you were probably a victim of this too and also deserve some grace."

"I have a lot of this same guilt, I failed to leave when i planned to this spring and he started to get physical with our 7 year old to get his attention fix because i was starting to check out mentally.   i got stuck in a depressive loop because it was my fault we were even still there, my kid wasn't injured but the psychology toll is there, and there was a lot of his screaming at the kid for minor issues that led up to it.  Eventually he didn't give me a choice, which i suppose was what i needed, but i hate myself for needing to get beaten up again to make me get us out the hell out of there.  

I am still struggling with this too, its only been about six weeks since we left and I don't have much advice here, but you're not alone in this, it will get better, and none of us are perfect.

I did a no contact order and dcfs got involved. I was dealing with substance abuse issues and after going to rehab really thought every fight / issue we ever had was just my fault due to to my mental health problems. I ended the injunction and reached out. He was willing to get back together if we had a domestic disciplinary relationship.  I am all for this if done properly. It’s not everyone’s cup of tea but we were a classic nuclear conservative Christian household where the husband should be leader and wife submits to god and him. Those who don’t understand don’t need to comment. It’s turned physical a few times since reconnecting. Past the corporal punishment I agreed to. I am in dcfs referred services for DV counseling and am starting to see it all. He’s using this DD as an excuse to abuse me. Today he snatched my phone out of my hand. We had a clear understanding he could see my phone at any time. I don’t know why I reacted this was but I tried to get it back. He pushed me away with my newborn in my arms. I grabbed his hair. He immediately turned around and grabbed me by my neck and lifted my off the ground. My newborn son, in my arms. I nearly dropped him from going unconscious. I have bruises all around my neck. After he continued down the it’s all my fault path. And that I was in trouble for what had happened. It has never escalated this far. I’m having trouble understanding if he is the problem or if it’s me, and I need to continue more aggressive therapy. Am I actually the abuser? I shouldn’t have grabbed his hair. I have trust issues since he called dcfs about the substances and tried to take the kids from me instead of getting me help. It was the best thing possible though because dcfs did help me and kept my kids with me while I healed. But now I just always wonder why child services could want to help me, but he wanted to destroy me. That’s besides the point though. Is this still domestic violence even if I’m the one who gets aggressive first? I never intend to hurt him. And I’m sure he never feels like he is going to die when I push etc. I’m just so confused right now. I couldn’t breathe and had my son in my arms. I shouldn’t have escalated things but I really thought he was going to kill me today.

""Reactive violence"" is something a victim does when they're pushed to their limit, they fight back and stand up for themselves.

Please please please talk to a social worker or someone who can help you because I'm very concerned for how he has no care for your or the baby's safety.

"Listen. They push to the point of reactive violence was for a reason. He wanted you to react physically and first, that was his goal, it was to get you to “start” it, because that gave him a alibi for what came next. If you hit him, that means he gets to hit you, that excuses his actions, “She hit me first…She was attacking me, I was just defending myself…She just went crazy…she just had a baby and she’s mental…She knew what she was doing, she signed up for this…I never touched her…” 

Let me share something with you, my husband strangled me too, multiple times. He worked his way up to strangulation, started by slapping me, moved to punching me, but after the first time he strangled me and saw how badly it scared me, that became his go-to move. First, he would do something that he knew would provoke a response, like calling me a cunt. I’d tell him to stop, he’d come get right in my face and say cunt, over and over. If I tried to walk away, he’d back me in a corner. He’d continue this until I put my hands on him, and then he’d strangle me. I would have bruise necklaces, and my kids noticed and asked about them. The next time he strangled me, he changed his technique and used his arm and elbow, a choke hold used in wrestling. As he was strangling me, I was thinking “Hmmmn, this is bad, he’s adapting his technique so he won’t leave any bruises, that means that he intends to continue, no matter how sorry he claims to be afterwards, and since each time has been progressively worse, it’s fair to think he’s going to kill me, he may even kill me right now”…This was when my 17 year old daughter walked in the room and caught him doing it. He strangled me unconscious. She wasn’t supposed to be home. In 4 out of 10 cases, the strangulation occurs in front of children. Mine did. Yours did.

Do you know the statistics regarding strangulation by a significant other? If you are strangled by your significant other, there is a 750% likelihood they will kill you within a year. If there are multiple strangulations then those numbers exponentially increase. Strangulation is a unique behavior that indicates escalating violence 100% of the time. 82% of individuals who have murdered a law enforcement officer, cop killers, 82% of them have a strangulation history. 45% of attempted homicides against women involve strangulation. I could go on and on, the numbers do not lie. You need to grab that baby and you need to go right now, and not look back, this is abuse, and it is abuse of the most serious sort, the kind of abuse you might not live through. Your baby deserves more than a mother murdered by her father legacy, you owe her better."	Shoddy_Elk9182	reply	na	na	na	0.9979528188705444	no	strong	no	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.
"No matter which way you look at it this is a violent relationship. I actually fully understand the DD relationship as I was in one for many years away for my husband to abuse me with backing, as a way to look at it.

The fact that the man put his hands on your throat is attempted murder. Almost every state that I know of it is considered choking even if one person puts the other in a sleeper hold so this is attempted murder and child endangerment along with many other crimes.

I think it’s important for you to spend a lot of time in specifically trauma therapy. They aren’t your typical therapist. They understand PTSD and all related trauma.

See if you can get your local domestic violence shelter or woman’s agency involved. Get yourself away from him and never go back under any circumstancesL

Do not get into it relationships for a very long time. Focus your attention on healing yourself and taking care of those children. There’s a great book called “why does he do that” by  Lundy Bancroft it will understand more than you can imagine.

And if you ever get yourself back in another relationship with biblical references to marriage, focus the attention what says the man is required to do before earning the right to have a woman who submits to him. Because he better be damn well perfect and the man who does what you described is not it.

Thank you for this. I called 911 and then hung up. When they called back I said my daughter must have done it. I know from experience that he would say I attacked first, and I would be arrested. Then a no contact order would be issued against me and he would get the kids. We currently have an open paternity case and we were fighting for custody against each other before we reconciled.

Hi, I've posted a few times. But the court have granted me a non-molestation order. Which is like a restraining order here in the UK. If he comes anywhere near me, the solicitor says he can get up to 5 years imprisonment. The housing officer is also looking for a 2 bedroom accommodation for me and my daughter. So we're finally going to move out of my dad's house. My father now understands communicating with my abuser is wrong, and is now supporting me moving out. He's cut all contact with him. They offered for me to move to a women's refuge, but it would be out of London. I wasn't happy moving that far away from my dad and aunt. So I refused it. They said by next Tuesday, they should have somewhere for us to move to. It will also be in another area. Somewhere he can't find me. I'm 23 and have never lived away from home. So this is new for me. Also, police are still investigating him for rape and coercive and controlling behaviour. So things are looking positive for me.	ghanaianbrit	post	26.083505080629035	female	White	0.025674374774098396	na	na	na	1	domesticviolence	no prediction.
"So my abuser and I separated last year, and I had been having medical issues which led to frequent severe dizziness. We had joint custody of our child at that point. Earlier this year I had passed out and luckily a welfare check was done in time to save my life, but my abuser had the only spare key still and apparently they found him to be able to let them in. I was told by hospital staff I had overdosed and I told them that’s definitely not true (I would have no problems admitting it if I did), but didn’t think much beyond that. 

My abuser informed me upon release he was getting full custody, and sure enough I checked my email and there were the judge’s orders. 

About a month later, I was informed by my family doctor of over 3 years (that even treated me for my medical conditions) that he would no longer see me or prescribe my much needed medication “due to the overdose.” I was obviously very upset by ALL of this. 

I wondered how everyone could think this when it didn’t happen- the only things that could have been in my system were normal levels of my prescriptions. So I looked up my hospital records, and there’s a statement from EMS that I “tried several times to overdose on pills in the past.” Well, since that did not ever happen even once, the ONLY person that could have led them to believe that was my abuser…in a supposed attempt to make me look unstable and gain full custody. Which he succeeded in. 

I am so, so upset and disappointed, and don’t know what to do to fight this. My family doctor even knew what had been happening with my abuser. I feel like I am screaming into the wind :( Any advice or support is appreciated."	ZtoA_Limited	post	38.42196940654624	female	White	0.9992369413375854	na	na	na	1	domesticviolence	no prediction.
I'm sorry this is far too common. You need to ask for the blood lab work from EMS that supports their assertions and have your Dr support you in getting the evidence to support the claims.

"     My mother and father are separating what seems to be real this time. My mother has wanted to many times before and could never bring herself to do it until possibly now. My mother has been with my father ever since they were around the age of 18. He has abused her and his oldest children both physically and emotionally. (She has 1 toddler, 1 teen, and 3 adult children.) No sexual abuse as far as I know. My father is an alcoholic, has been ever since she met him. Almost every month of the year he causes problems to thw whole family and especially to his wife. (We all live together). He emotionally abuses her almost all the time and she comes to me (24) and tells me all about it. We all fear/hate him because of this and much MUCH more. She now wants to leave him and I of course agree with her but the only one who will have a job at the end of this will be my oldest brother. I have a foodtruck but it is now closed as my commissary is his brother's restaurant and they, ofc, are on his side even tho he's violent and horrible with them as well, and my mother and I no longer feel comfortable being around them either as they're all as toxic as he is with thwir own families. We have around 4k-5k hidden away for emergencies, we could've had more but he has a hold of our bank accounts for the business and spent everything in there and the extra cash we had at home from our sales. He would tell us that everything we have such as the house we rent, the business, the cars, the money, the kids, everything is all his, but then oh when it's convenient for him he retracts his words and says everything is ours. Typing this out is helping me realize just how much we should leave him, but it hurts so much as he's our father. He has worked so hard for his family but i know this doesnt make up for all the hurt he causes for everyone. Are there any tips you can give with us? Anything and I mean anything will help.

Should I convince my mother to file a divorce? Do we just leave? File restraining order? I'm now worried, as many times before, that he'll say we kidnapped his Childeren. They're both undocumented. But his side of the family has enough money for a decent lawyer while we don't.

If needed, I can share more info incase I don't make sense.

(Extra: We tried to leave him a few years back and he would tell us he'd just drink himself to death. Now he tells us that he'll turn himself into the cops. We figured out that he's probably planning on moving out from my godmother, his sister,  as he spoke about it with her)

"Kinda in the title, but, how do you break away from the love you have for a abuser? A little bit of history. 

My partner and I have been together for almost two years. We've been friends for 7 years prior and he helped me out of a previous abusive relationship where I was rxped.

Current partner made me feel so safe and secure with them during our friendship and then our relationship. However jealousy regarding my ex snuck in with him. (I have a child with my nex) and one night current partner turned when drunk. 

He kicked and hit me. I tried letting it go thinking it was a one off. Almost a year later (earlier this year) he broke my nose after I found out he cheated on me. And two weeks ago become physical for the 3rd time brusing my arms. (My child has never been present during this) but i keep telling myself it's time to end it. Its time to leave? 

But I can't seem to do it. He was someone who's been in my live daily for 7 years. And for some reason I am so scared to not have him around anymore? I can't make myself let go of the love i have for him which sounds crazy after all he's done. I'm hurt if I stay. Because it isn't okay. But the idea of leaving seems to hurt so much more?

"I stayed until I suddenly went dead inside. It was like there'd been a cord connecting us. I felt it break and it was like my heart had been ripped out. It took years of contempt, hatred and affairs on his part to achieve that.  

I bawled my eyes out that night, letting out all the years of stress, misery and pain I'd had from him, and letting go of all hope I could ever have a life with him. He celebrated, thinking i was completely broken but: ""the king is dead, long live the king!"" Part of me died that night; another part of me was born. I slept on the couch from that night and began making arrangements so I could take the kids somewhere safe. 

I stayed so long because I wanted our kids to grow up in a stable, loving, two-parent home, and I worked my guts out trying to keep him calm and happy so he wouldn't hurt them. I was a fool, led by a dream. 

I stayed so long I could never again contemplate sharing a house with a partner without wanting to vomit.

More general answer - I remembered very very much that the loser Was Not Abusive when we met or for the first couple of years together. You need to really sit with the fact that he Knew How to Make You Feel Safe But is Actively Choosing Not To Now so He Does Not Love You. Unless you idolize unrequited love you will recognize reciprocity as a requirement for continuing the relationship. Do you like having a fulfilling romantic relationship or are just avoiding being single. You may not be okay with being alone but being alone trumps having an ingrate beat you and cheat on you with impunity.

"This is a little cliche but I think my relationship with God/self/higher power helped me. At a few times in bad relationships I really felt I had no one but God and myself and just acknowledged that. —everyone let me down. But not me I won’t. 

You ever see that TV show Maid? Trigger warning but she is so so alone through that and it’s just her and her kid and I think she has that same relationship in their two person family. It’s self love.

A lot of us as kids I think we’re trained in codependency and self-denial. So to me it wasn’t that surprising to realize my family also wasn’t helpful, supportive, there, and weren’t going to re-trigger anxiety and pain for me. They were part of the reason I attracted and accepted so many violent intimate partners in the first place.

What’s happened -is happening to me now- and got me out of the last one was like a mental flip. Their face, which used to remind me of love, just scared me. I felt it with my husband yesterday and it makes me sad because I want us to work on some level still too. 

Once his face reminds you more of fear than of love, it’s like this spell is just broken. That’s how it’s felt for me anyway. I have a fair amount of cptsd trauma and am kind of neurodivergent, but it actually alarmed me yesterday when I felt my love for him just go out like a light switch. His face reminds me of terror, not love. It isn’t my job to wait for him to earn trust back really anymore either. If he does, awesome, but I often doubt he will honestly. 

Don’t let yourself forget the times he hurt you. And when he’s kind, remember that’s love bombing. For me even the love bombing actually makes me revolted now. Him pretending to be cute or soft is a fake side of him I know he will drop when he’s lost control, is drinking or threatening me. He’s not who I fell inlove with.

I thought of it today kinda like in zombie movies… he’s turned. He looks like your loved one and maybe a sliver of that man is somewhere in there but who sleeps next to a zombie? Even if part of their brain sees you and loves you, more of their brain is on autopilot to hurt you.

No matter what an abuser says, they know they’re hurting you. Regardless of “reasons” they give and the way they spin things, really loving someone doesn’t include knowingly causing them pain and allowing it to continue. Because they don’t have to abuse you. They want to. Maybe not 100% of the time but when they’re upset or want to control you or anything else, they are *choosing* to hurt you. 

That’s not love. That will never be love. 

It’s not that leaving doesn’t break your heart sometimes. It can. I sobbed. I broke down in the middle of a target while buying things I needed to escape. Literally had to sit down and just cry.

Leaving was the rational and objectively right choice for me. The love cravings were intense.

Every time during my escape and after my response to doubting myself or love for my abuser was met with what I knew to be the reality of my expirience.

"I realized I needed to make a choice to protect my family, and that even though I “knew” how much it would hurt him, for the good of us all I had to make that choice.  I left almost everything behind possessions-wise. It took a couple of times of leaving and then coming back and even though I still loved him with all my heart, I had to make the rational decision. 
In the end, once there was physical distance, I told him he needed to go a full week without disrespecting me and he couldn’t so I blocked him. My dreams died so that my child doesn’t get raised in that environment and suffer that abuse and it’s worth it every day I wake up and see my child being happy and my dogs unharmed."

There’s two base emotions at the root of every other emotion, fear and love. You gravitate towards who and what you love, and avoid who and what you fear. For me, it got to a point where the fear far outweighed the love where there was no love left for him at all and I was operating on 100% fear that made me want to run away from him.

"I got very real with myself in the mirror, black eye, top lip looking like a thumb, & 2 fingers dangling from my hand. I told myself out loud "" the next hand that is raised to me in my home by this someone who clearly Does Not & Cannot love me & do this to me, will be my exit from this hell or my entrance into the womens prison system."" & I meant that. That realization, that moment, stirred something inside of me. I told myself you know those two or three days of being gone every time this happens could easily turn into six eight 12 or more but would anything change? Would there be a new lie? One that I hadn't heard before? One that I would believe? NO! Looking in the mirror I now look like the monster on the outside that he is on the inside.

We ALL DESERVE for me to be able to tell My story of my decision to get out. Who knows, maybe it will inspire another somewhere on down the line. As My children are grown, with now families of their own, (my husband died in an accident at 39) i only had to worry bout getting me and my dog out. Easier? I guess, but no. I had no plan but just as I told myself, the next hand rises to me... Wasn't about to make a liar out of Me to Me so I asked my daughter to take my dog for a while, which she agreed.

"This similar advise helped me when it first happened years ago. “It’s just an addiction”.

It’s also a powerful and more pure on that we all have as humans that helps us survive. Loving ourselves was the healing salve. So often we pour love into people who don’t deserve it to make up for the deficits we felt in our own childhoods or relationships.

Love exists to help us survive, but if you imprint on an abuser -or even just a cheater/shitty person- it’s time to redirect all that love back to yourself instead so you can get out.

"We didn't own our home, just left in a rented place, so there was nothing of significant material value to worry about. When I started sleeping on the couch I contacted Social Security, telling them I had split from my husband and was now a single mother. I was very lucky. They started giving me a single parent allowance from that date. This was Australia, early 80's, that might not be possible even here these days. 

I found a ""fixer-upper"" to rent in walking distance, so I could just carry everything we needed. Husband had said several times in the hearing of mutual friends that he couldn't wait for me to leave and take the kids with me, so he could hardly have me charged with kidnapping when I did. It took a horrible, tense month to save enough for the rental deposit, and he prevented me taking any beds, furniture or kitchen things, so we moved in with nothing but a bag of clothes each and some doonas I'd snuggled out.

Hello, I (21 yr old female) and my husband (22 yr old male) are in a domestic violence case. I decided not to press charges and did not want a no contact order because it was very minor (not excusing his actions) abuse. We have been married a little over a year and half. The judge placed a no contact order where he is not allowed to contact me until the judge determines whether he can or not at the court hearing. I am wanting this to work and I am willing to forgive him since this was the first time this ever happened. My mom (unbeknownst to me) called him and asked what his intentions are with me and whether or not he wanted to be with me because she stated “I see how my daughter is and she is not okay so I needed to hear it as a mother so I know how to help her heal”. My mom told she did and told me what he said. He said “I love and care about your daughter, but I can’t think about being in a relationship with her” “ I could be facing jail time”. I love him, but I am going insane over here because here I am paying for his attorney, paying for all our shared bills ( minus the rent & utilities) and I get basically an IDK. I feel it’s wrong of me to expect him to have an answer, but I still have that expectation because I love him and I want this to work….. I am wrong to expect an answer from him?

I realize self-sabatage, when intertwined with a domestic violence situation in all senses that fall under that umbrella, dashed with a  sprinkle of codependent drug abuse, garnished with unresolved mental health issues is the perfect concoction to a slow miserable death.

"As per title. I'm all alone. 

My abuser gradually cut me off from nearly everyone I knew. I didn't even notice it happening. When he turned verbally and then physically vicious, I had nowhere to turn. 

I was with him for 7 years.

He has beaten me until I almost died twice. In between there was obsessive love bombing alternated with sceaming, strangling, football tackling, and full-force punches to the face.

I am physically and psychologically destroyed. 

This relationship ended in April and I have had little contact since. I have gone no contact again, because this is not going to change. The 6'1"" man with the martial arts training and the near-impossible narcissistic manipulative finesse is *always* the victim of the 100lb autistic female in this scenario, at least in his own mind, and he likes it that way and he will bend reality however he can in order to keep it that way. 

I am privileged enough to not have to worry about feeding and housing myself. I am thankful for that, because I can't, so otherwise I'd just be dead.

I am entirely isolated.

I recently gathered up all my courage and made a police report of the incident in April that ended the relationship. He chased me through the house, snatched me up off my feet by the throat with one hand, and beat me repeatedly in the face with the other fist while my feet dangled.

I just had to narrate the whole thing over the phone to a male detective.

"First of all i'm so proud of you for sucessfully leaving and for filing a police report. Please know that what you are feeling is normal and there is 100% nothing wrong with you.

Now comes the part of unlearning the toxcicity and learn what it's like to love yourself. Understand that this process is a long and very emotional journey where you'd feel defeated all over again and it is normal. It is very normal to feel all the emotions you feel. What is important is that you do not let those down times pull you back. You do not let those low emotions allow you to go back to your ex. And know that you may have to repeat your story time and time again to many different people because investigation is a very long process. And most importantly, stay no contact. If your ex tries to contact you ignore him and report those attempts to the police.

Now as for what i did to help myself because at the time i left my ex i was alone with 2 dogs and not enough income and i was depressed and lived very far away from families and friends. I tried therapy but that backfires on me and made me feel worse. I never went back. I did cut my hair (my ex loves my long natural hair). I chopped off all 14inches of hair i grew, bleach and dyed it blue and then red (my ex was a religious freak and won't let me dye my hair or cut it or anything). I changed my clothes (he won't let me wear anything revealing meaning polos and jeans are the only thing he'd allow me to wear) i wore skirts, dresses, spaghetti straps, i bought what i like and wore it. I ate what i wanted to eat (my ex won't allow anything remotely frozen or fast food so i'd always have to cook even in the midst of the night).

I did a lot of things that are the opposite of what he forbids me from doing things that are in my control. I watched my favorite shows, played my favorite games, i took myself to the library and found books to read, i imerse myself in things that are new to me like hiking and going out with people i call aquaintances at the time and now my good friends. 

All of this is very scary it feels wrong it feels like i violated a law or some sort and it takes time and repetitions for me to feel like it's okay or even remotely normal. So please understand it's not something you have to do it right away it's something that it's going to take time for you to be able to learn for your brain to understand that this is good and not bad.

He beat me, choked me, broke a porcelain sink with my head and raped me. And that was just one night and the following morning. Turns out I was pregnant during the ordeal. Not sure how I didn't miscarry. I was so isolated and so scared of having a baby by myself that I stayed. He promised he'd never do anything like that again, though we didn't talk about the rape and I pretended it didn't happen/it was a misunderstanding. He mostly kept his hands to himself while I was pregnant. He did shove me and spit in my face towards the beginning but I left and nearly stayed gone (except we were in a new state and I had no way to get to my home state and no idea what I'd do once I got back) but after that no **physical** issues. I finally broke things off in January of this year and I feel such relief, but the scars run deep. If you need anyone to talk to I'm here! 

If you can, I would try to get into counselling/therapy. If you qualify for Medicaid, then I would start by getting on that. I have found several places that accept state insurance that do EMDR and other PTSD focused treatments in my state.

I would suggest a therapist who specializes in DV. The precent should also give you resources (not sure where you are) that help you move, change locks and group therapy for battered women. You should also reach out to the people you lost during these 7 years that meant the most to you and tell them you love them and need their support.I also heard somewhere wrting the pros and cons on paper helps, I suggest journaling in general. Loving yourself is the first step or learning how to do it with books and videos from women who have been there. Thats all I have and I wish you the best.

"Isolation is one of the first tactics they employ to gain control. you need to have no doubt in your mind that you are a complete warrior and if you made it through that then rebuilding and restarting a network is going to be a piece of cake

Oh I went to a different church every Sunday until I finally found one that I could donate my time and energy to who had classes I could take so I could regain contact with people again. 

I called my local library and join the book club. I started volunteering at an animal shelter, nursing home and hospital in my free time because it is important for us to regain our sense of worth and purpose. Places like that are always happy to see us and always engaged And rebuilding who we are.

There’s so many other things that you can do to end the isolation!  And this time there’s so many people in our same situation because of Covid and the isolation it forced us to have that you can relate to people on other terms other than Domestic Violence but there are also domestic violence shelters and women’s groups that either have support groups, free trauma therapy and volunteer opportunities.

It’s hard when you make friendships and your entire recent memory is filled with trauma so it’s important to make as many new positive memories as you can so that you have things to talk to you every day people about and rely on your trauma therapist and fellow survivors for what they called trauma dumping .

I am super proud of you for getting out and I am super proud of you for turning him in. He’s the one that you obviously have to have no contact with and find your isolation. 

As an extreme trauma survivor and now coach to others, I want you to know that the isolation can end. You seem healthy enough to understand that the isolation wasn’t because it was something you deserved or that you did. It was completely his way of controlling you so other people wouldn’t help you realize what happened.

What a brave human being you are, I am so proud of you for not only escaping this evil person's grip upon you, but also being brave enough to share your story of survival, You are here for a reason, You are a child of god, you still stand through all the tests and trials, That thing that abused you on the other hand, will pay for his despicable sins, Now it is time to get back to you!! doing things for yourself, that you enjoyed doing before you met IT, Things that used to bring you joy, even something simple as sitting in a forest, and just listening to silence, helped me. Or perhaps trying something new? it doesn't have to be anything big or expensive, Just getting yourself out to new locations, or areas where you have zero memory of the past abuse is also a good way to help recover!!! sending so much love to you, you are an amazing soul, recovery energy, and blessings sent your way !!	dreamcat000	reply	na	na	na	0.9982587695121765	weak	no	no	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.

She is in denial. It is *so tempting* to believe that if you just change your behavior/yourself enough, then the abuser will change, too. It is so tempting to believe that they will eventually give back what they have taken from you. It is so devastating to finally accept that your time, effort, pain, hope, and sacrifice have all been in vain. It is so hard to start over when everything you are has been systematically destroyed. Trauma bonding is so real and so hard to escape.

I used to sing like a bird. I was repeatedly strangled by my ex which caused serious damage to my voice.

Tonight I did an unheard of thing: I took my own self out to a small, relaxed local bar and grill for karaoke and I sang my heart out. To my surprise (and utter delight) my voice is back on point.

You can read my posting history for more background but long story short, I left my marriage, went a couple states away, and ended up giving birth early. Baby spent some time in the nicu and we’ve been home a couple weeks now. 

This past Friday, ex showed up at my aunts house. He was… different. Nice, respectful, etc. I expected anger but he just asked to meet his daughter and I let him. He was NEVER left alone with her and my aunt was always present during these times. He spent 3 days in the town I’m in (he did not stay with us) and came over several hours each day to see/bond with our daughter. 

He said he would not fight me for custody but would like to have a relationship with her. I don’t know if it was all bullshit or if he’s changed? Trying to change? It made me feel incredibly guilty that he’s missed the first month of her life.

They don't change. Do not fall for this. You have ZERO reason to feel guilty (not invalidating your feelings, just letting you know it's not your fault.)

I'm familiar with your backstory - your abuser is a police officer. Returning to that town and that relationship **will not end well.** Keep yourself and your baby safe and safe is AWAY from him. You and your child are a family without him.

DON'T go back.
And don't let him see her again.
After what he did to you (and by extant to her) he lost the privilege to be in her life.

It hasn't been decades since the abuse, just a few month.
No one changes this fast, especially without actual consequences.
I know that it is hard and that a baby is a lot of work, but he will only make it harder.
As soon as you go back, you will have to watch your back again and your daughter could get harmed.
What if she screams to much for him?
Or you can't take that much care of the household because it has been a rough day?
I understand that you think that it would be easier to have more money and a loving husband.
But you wouldn't have that.
He would still be an abuser and would only chain you down.
Keep your baby safe, don't let him manipulate you.
He hurt you when you were pregnant and that, plus the stress could be a reason she came early.
What's means he put her in danger even before her birth!
He doesn't want to have a relationship with his kid, he wants a mean to control you.

"Abusers, especially to this extent do not change.  How did he find you?  I would be concerned that he is watching your every move right now.  He wants you to feel like he isn't a threat to you and your baby so you put your guard down.  Then he gets you to come back.  If that doesn't work he starts to gather evidence of why you are an unfit parent and you are not looking for it because he has you thinking he isn't even interested in any custody of your baby.  Please keep your guard up and remember everything he did to you, a tiger doesn't change their stripes.  Trust no one and never leave your baby with someone you don't trust 110% and that would only be if you have to work to provide for her.  If your aunt all of a sudden seems to be on team ex start questioning your relationship and interactions with her.

I would talk to a lawyer about filing for sole custody but I personally wouldn't do it on my own.  My concern is that he is going to retaliate.  He told you he wasn't going for custody but now you are pushing it which is pushing him.  Abusers do not take kindly to being pushed.  Right now he is not on the birth certificate so you should be fine for the immediate future.

Please I am begging you, get a therapist.  The fact that you are even entertaining the idea of a family with this man is very concerning.  You need someone to help you think clearly for your safety and the safety of your daughter.  He has altered the way you think and it needs to be fixed.  I do not know how to put it without being blunt.  You've experienced trauma and your brain needs to be trained in how to think properly again.  I was there and am still there at times.  Many therapists refer to it as trauma work.

I hope you take what I've said to heart and know that it is coming from the heart.  It's been almost 10 years since I left my abuser and if I can share things I've learned in those years and the years prior that might make a difference I will.  And yes you read that right, I'm still trying to retrain my brain after 10 years.  I have been in therapy off and on and I'm considering starting another round of intense trauma work again as I'm starting to experience more triggers again in my life despite being in a much better place with an amazing man that loves me unconditionally."	iwillgetoutokay	reply	na	na	na	0.9926204681396484	no	no	strong	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.
"My abuser who I have a DVPO against works in the same industry as me and in same union. I made a previous post describing some of the issues I’ve had with me being removed from calls last minute or him being prioritized for calls because of the seniority  system used for dispatching. This is a complicated issue I’m working to address, however I’ve always had the understanding that if we were to physically show up to the same call, he would have to leave. 

I told my job steward this the other day, and the response I received was that it was not up to her but up to dispatch and I will have to be the one to leave if we end up in the same place by mistake, and was not listened to when I said otherwise. I later talked to a victim’s advocate who reiterated that the defendant would need to be the one to leave, he is violating the order if he does not leave of his own accord once he is informed that im on-site and if he doesn’t I’m within my right to call the police, that it’s solely his job to avoid me, I’m not restricted from being anywhere and the Union seniority situation does not trump the legality of the situation. They said that sending me away may be a violation of the protection order in itself. All of this is the same as what my attorney that I used during the court process said. 

I was told to reach out to a community advocate who could talk to someone in the union for me, however I’m very concerned still because I am not being heard and listened to here. Even if I were to stand my ground, say he needs to leave, and call the police that doesn’t prevent dispatch from removing me from the call and I’m concerned security would try to throw me out. My understanding is that once he is within 1000 feet of me it’s not up to the Union to enforce it, it’s up to the police but I don’t have any power in the situation and I’m uncomfortable that they’re taking my autonomy away in enforcing the order. They just see it as keeping us separated, not him away from me. I even had to clarify that I have the right to attend any Union meetings, and that it’s not up to them to decide who can attend if we were to both show up to one. 

He almost walked into my job the other day but was turned away by security only during that one instance because he took the role last minute to fill in for a no show, but in any future situation they would make me leave. I also freelance outside the union and saw his car parked near mine while he worked in another building this week, and was informed on another day that he was supposed to be in the same room as me on a call working for a different company than me, but wasn’t there bc he messed up his schedule. I’m trigggerd all the time and on edge and I’m not sure how much more of this I can take right now. My workplace is protected in the protection order as well as  my car but workplace seems to be really loosely defined in my industry. I’m hurting financially and just feel at a loss and completely powerless."	climber619	post	33.71518442334957	female	White	0.9979156851768494	na	na	na	1	domesticviolence	failed

"

So I’ve been with my boyfriend since march and it was going alright at first , till I had a ptsd hell hole from where I was staying at the time  , blacked out for 3 days and apparently cheated on him , I don’t remember anything and that’s still a sore spot for me , because when he found the messages , I didn’t even know it was there and I still don’t remember anything from those days I blacked out . This was needed for context I think . Eventually we talked it out and everything seemed good . ( trust me I know I’m also the bad guy in the situation , I just don’t think i deserve this ) 

On to my current situation,
Since that day , we’ve had 2 instances,both times we were drinking . 
The first time , he started going off on me , yelling at me , he took my phone , so I couldn’t even call anyone to leave , eventually I found my second phone , and as I was trying to leave , he pushed me into the bbq that was by the front door , like full on pushed me , while I was on FaceTime with the person who was going to pick me up , 

I eventually got free and left , but obviously I went back or else I wouldn’t be here 

A few months had passed , and then randomly, while we were having a drink , he started going off on me hard , 
And it got to a point , where he was threatening me with the axe that he had by the bed , I was fully trapped on the bed , while he had my phone and an axe in his hands , and he was threatening me with everything and anything he could think of , you know what got him to stop . Me looking him in the eyes saying “ A , I think I’m going to die” , “I’m so scared I’m going to die right now  “ and he put down the axe . I don’t remember anything else from that night , all I know is that I got it to stop . 

I don’t remember much from that night but all I know is that got him to stop , I’m just so scared that one day I won’t be able to de-escalate the situation.
 I blame myself every day for what caused all this anger in him (like I know I don’t remember cheating but it happened and I still own up and talk about it even though it’s super triggering to my ptsd, because I know he wants to talk about it and I want to try and fix this as much as possible ) , but I don’t think i deserve to get hurt or die . 

I asked for help when the first instance happened and didn’t get like any support, no help , nothing , so I’m sitting  here a month after the axe incident, and I’m stumped , I’m having panic attacks every time I leave the house because I don’t wanna go back , but I currently don’t have a choice 

I tell myself as long as he dosent drink I’m good , but every once and a while I want a drink and of course he has to have one with me , this is how the second incident happened 

I’m so scared to tell anyone because they didn’t help the first time , so what’s the point in trying this time around , im so sacred he’s going to kill me one day , but honestly what other choice do I have rn , he’s all I have 

Not looking for advice because honestly there aren’t many options , shelters don’t work due to my ptsd , and my family dosent care that I’m staying with someone , who I thought was going to kill me , just needed to rant a bit 

I hope this gets better soon , hopefully the more we talk the anger goes down"	Illustrious_Bi	post	12.292153919504852	female	White	0.9942230582237244	na	na	na	1	domesticviolence	no prediction.

"Music has always been medicine for me. I left my abusive husband 2 months ago. I took our 11 momth old baby girl and we are living at my families. I heard a couple songs the other day that really lit a fire inside me.  I go back and forth on how I feel about him. One minute I miss him and want to go back, but the next I'm so angry with him and have no desire to go back. I love listening to these songs super loud, alone in the car. It reminds me of why I left and makes me feel empowered to stand up for myself and have strength to not go back. It helps me to feel like I made the right decision when I feel like I constantly doubt myself. 

These are my 2 favorite songs at the moment that help me to refocus and prevent me from just feeling sorry for him and returning because I miss him. I need more songs like this. What are everyone's favorites? What should I add?

I love those songs that spark that fire. I'm finding I really need those reminders. I know the feeling all too well. You want to go back so bad, but you also know what it means if you do. Eventually, the honeymoon phase will wear off and you're stuck again. It already took me a long time to get out, and I'm afraid of getting stuck again.

Working 50-60 hours a week to stay in airbnbs. It’s not really much more than rent. I tried to stay with my mom but she is meaner to me than my ex. And my brother beat and abused me when I was young and my mom knows that she disowned him years ago, but she never stops yapping about my brother and it gives me horrible anxiety. No one in my family knows about the abuse because my ex and I together made enough money to go on lavish vacations which we posted pictures of, so everyone assumed we were so happy. I miss those happy times but he is crazy and flips out suddenly over nothing and hurts me and breaks all our stuff. I got tired of protecting him from police. Neighbors called 911 many times because he would be outside screaming he was going to kill me over crazy made up reasons. He still wants to get back together which is even more nuts. If I piss him off so much that he destroys our entire home every couple months, why would he ever want to see me again?

It's been 6 years for me but I have been reporting him from the start and he has had significant time in jail. I had almost 2 years of him being in jail which I think really helped me to feel safe enough to heal which has helped me immensely. He has breached VRO recently but I am almost at the point where I don't even feel like I need to report it and give him the attention! I still have some ptsd and stress but I can't even recognise myself now things have improved x100. There is hope and stalking is a crime that is taken very seriously, keep all evidence and start making reports! They may help link you up with services that can help you go into hiding or remove any access he has to find you. I am so sorry you are feeling so exhausted, I know it can be so horrible but just know things can get so much brighter! I love my life now and am thriving.

"My husband punched a wall… any advise from people who have experienced this?

I confronted my husband about some jokes he’s made with his guy friend I don’t like and he got really angry and started yelling that he didn’t want to talk about it.

His eyes have looked weird and cold lately. I wondered if he was drunk or on drugs (says he isn’t he gets tested for work but was drinking). He lost his dad this year also and we’ve had some financial stressors. 

Eventually he punched a wall, and called me a stupid bitch and said to “go make some money” when he was storming off downstairs. 

I gave up a job to move cross country when we got married and am definitely job hunting more urgently now (initially the plan was to take my time starting a home business and he told me he wanted me to stay home). Now I know I can’t really trust this and probably should have been more urgently job hunting before this happened even though he kept saying not to. Anyway… 

He apologized and I told him to quit drinking for a month and to do anger management or counseling and if it happens again I’m leaving. Im hoping to get into therapy too or go as a couple 

I guess I just needed to vent this a little and ask how urgent this is, if people think I’m over or under reacting and if anyone’s ever had a marriage go through this and repaired it. My plan is to take the month job hunting and saving up while seeing if he can follow through on the sobriety and counseling request. I feel a lot less love for him now, less attracted if at all. That’s probably a self protective mechanism and it feels weird. Like I’m pretending to stay safe and not rock the boat. 

I really hope my husband changes. I love him a lot and can understand we’ve been under stress. I’m also so angry that I think he waited (maybe subconsciously) for me to be more vulnerable financially and maybe disconnected from family before acting out like this. 

It feels like mental gymnastics pretending like we are fine overall (we are not but this seems safer since I don’t have the money to leave yet). 

I know some people on Reddit think punching walls isn’t a deal breaker, but it wasn’t just him doing this and me having ptsd from past violent relationships reacting. Yesterday he said “we really got out of hand” when I mentioned wanting to go to couples therapy. I’m so shocked he’s using the royal we for him violently threatening me when I was just asking him (pretty calmly honestly) to stop saying sexist jokes and expressing my hurt over that. I don’t think I escalated that situation at all. And how he acted seemed totally crazy to me. I’m angry he wants me to share the blame. 

His “whatever” attitude about this feels like as much of a red flag as it happening in the first place. I don’t know if a therapist or anger management counselor will actually get through to him if he even follows through with going to one longer term. 

I appreciate any insight or advise people may have. I feel at a loss and really heightened and sad. My ideal is just to work on my financial independence and an exit plan while also hoping counseling and quitting alcohol might help us salvage this.

In the interim this feels like purgatory. I think it’s safer to pretend everything is fine with him and that’s also mentally draining. The last abusive relationship I was in the only way I got out safely was pretending I wasn’t leaving when I was planning to. I feel like I’m right back there again and it’s such a mindf***"	Turbulent-Physics77	post	20.56266349961227	female	White	0.9988784193992615	na	na	na	2	domesticviolence	failed
"Yes, him saying “we” got out of hand instead of him taking full responsibility is absolutely a red flag. DO NOT SHARE THE BLAME. 

I too loved my abuser dearly and looked past him punching walls, then through doors, eventually smashing several of his own phones and car windshield for years (years too long).

Last year he hit me, then attempted to smother me to death with a pillow. I’m lucky to be alive and to have gotten out with the help of friends (though I’ve unfortunately still had to suffer through his bullsh*t because we share a child). Please get out NOW.

I received a year DV restraining order against my ex. I am now going back for the renewal and I’m hoping for a five year renewal since he has not had any violations. My ptsd symptoms have alleviated a lot and I want to ensure legal protection for longer. Is there any advice going into the renewal session I should be prepared for? Also anxiety relief tips?	nicestars	post	25.34300446284761	female	White	0.001921196817420423	na	na	na	5	domesticviolence	failed
"It depends on your state and/or country. I am in North Carolina, and there needs to be continued fear in order to be applicable for renewal. I tried to ask for two years (the max here) and keep getting one (he has fancy attorneys). 

Mine tries to plead “good boy” by his attorneys claiming he has not violated the order (their excuse to get it dismissed) and my attorney just tells the judge “the order is working, that’s why he’s staying away.”

I also work with a DV charity since day one. Can you find one? Mine helps with the court process, finding *potential* pro bono lawyers, support group, etc. 

oomph the anxiety. It takes a lot to train my brain in the present moment, cross each bridge as it comes, but I feel more at peace doing that…and sleep🥲omg around court time each year my girlfriends know im going to “checkout” and I just go to bed as early as possible and sleep 11-13hrs each night. Its better than self medicating and you go into another world without the ptsd or anxiety. I am also a runner so exerting anxiety through a workout helps. 

Reading The Body Keeps the Score helped me understand me better, more self compassion/understanding can help in deeper ways than you may know.

"We've been together for 2 and a half years, both successful early 30s. When we met it was love at first sight and we couldn't leave eachother's side. Couple months into our relationship, i found out he had cheated several times - his excuse was that everything was so quick between us, he wasn't ready yet. after 2 months apart I forgave him. Then, the same thing happened at 1 yr - he hooked up with someone in a bar while drunk because he felt wasn't right for me and was pressured into having a family one day after a fight of ours. He seemed very remorseful so I took him back 2 months later with the condition of him doing therapy (he was abandoned by an emotionally, very physically abusive father, and his mother doesn't care much about him - it is true I met his family, he also has untreated ADHD). his 8 sessions seemed to help alot, everyone saw a difference in him, he accepted his childhood, and even did hypnotherapy. Finally we ended up moving in together, everything was great but my lack of trust creeped up. Winter came and things became a mess again, I was very critical of him, alot of resentment, and our personalities would clash and he went on a downspiral again, this time with alcohol. Things got really bad between us, and between his moments of love and attention, he would disappear at night and come home extremely drunk (and drove drunk). One night he came home, and was very clingy and trying to get me to hug him in bed, i was disgusted that he hadn't answered all night, and was this drunk again and drove, so I pushed him away because he wouldn't leave me alone. He responded by punching me several times in the arm, enough to leave bruises. This happened 2 more times. He never wanted to speak about it and pretended he did not remember. eventually, he stopped drinking like that, got back in shape and things got better between us. I had my own set of issues from an abusive mom that I worked on with a therapist during that time - and it seemed to help us alot (as I would usually be verbally explosive with him too). One one hand, when things are good, they are very good - he is supportive of everything I do, spoils me with gifts, activities, trips, flowers, plants, you name it, does everything for me. Very affectionate and we can talk about anything, never possessive or controlling. We have so much fun together and laugh non stop. But when things go bad, and he gets triggered, it is hell. He turns into a monster that I don't recognize, he over drinks, can't control his reactions and emotions, and downright scares me.

I feel stupid because I know I need to leave him, but I love him so much I don't see myself without him. sometimes i convince myself we both trigger one another, and that if we both worked on our demons things would be great. I feel embarassed that I allowed this, but can't seem to leave him for good. I feel ashamed to be in love with someone who hurts me, and to weak to call it quits even if I am usually a very strong willed person."

"How many times did you cheat on him in the beginning? How often do you just disappear and are unreachable? Probably never because that’s not how you treat people you love and respect. An abusive childhood does not make one a cheater either. Many people have abusive parents and don’t grow up to be violent. Many abusers do, however, grow up in homes where they watch their fathers treat their mothers terribly and learn to have no respect for women.

My ex always framed his mother as mentally unstable (she was) and his father as absent. His mother, out for his dad’s money, writing bad checks all over town towards the end of their relationship. His dad, a womanizer. Funny thing was, his dad seemed to have the same effect on every woman he dated. They were all “crazy” and would “use him for his money” and “write bad checks,” but his dad was just a “teddybear of a guy.” What his dad was doing was financially abusing these women and emotionally abandoning them. Cheating on them and staying out all night. He taught my ex to have no respect for women by having no respect for them. By being absent when my ex was growing up, my ex was allowed to run amok, no accountability for any of his behavior. Another feature of abusive people, they’re not accountable. Your partner blaming his upbringing and ADHD is a way to side step accountability. Blaming *you* for his cheating (girl, eyyyyye rollllllllll), that’s not being accountable. Therapy is not designed to address that properly.

And don’t ignore that he’s physically hit you. If you have to watch your step to avoid his anger, that’s walking on egg shells. It is a form of control. Not all controlling behavior is direct - wear this, don’t say that, don’t talk to them, etc. He knows some of his behavior has a negative effect on you and that’s why he does it. Staying teaches him his behavior is acceptable. The consequence of his behavior should be to lose the relationship completely but he is still around and his behavior is escalating.

Stop looking to share the blame with someone who isn’t playing fair. Unlike him, you don’t have a problem with accountability. Instead of saying, what part did I play in this? Say, would I ever treat someone I respect like this? Raising your tone is not equivalent to cheating, disappearing, being unaccountable, disrespectful and selfish. It may in fact be responsive - you responding to him not being accountable for his own behavior. 

I’d also look up intermittent reinforcement because that’s what leads to unhealthy “strong bonds.” The lovebombing with occasional punishment keeps you stepping lightly around him and reflecting on your own behavior so you can avoid punishment next time.

Don’t waste good years on a guy who doesn’t treat you with respect. You’ll miss the time more than you miss him in the long run."	Straight-Effect-8049	reply	na	na	na	0.01445569097995758	no	no	strong	na	domesticviolence	failed
Thank you so much for taking the time to write all of this. It really hit deep, especially the part with intermittent reinforcement. You are absolutely right that the bond gets reinforced by the punishment vs love bombing. You are absolutely right that he takes zero accountability and follows in the footsteps of his womanizing abusive father, who had no respect for anyone, and thus doing exactly the same thing to me, that he hated his father for doing to him.

">my current partner doesn't really understand it and doesn't think it should be impacting me this much a year on (after a recent trigger). He doesn't believe PTSD can come from a relationship either, only war and thinks these situations arent comparible.

That is a red flag, sweetheart. Even just reading this was creepy because that is exactly the kind of thing my abusive ex used to say to diminish or dismiss my past trauma.

You may not want to hear this, but it is not your job to teach your partner how to treat you compassionately. That is a hold-over behavior pattern that you learned for survival when you were abused. Honestly, *just telling him* that these are your issues and this is how it hurt you should be enough for him. 

**Please consider this: if you feel the need to scour for resources to back up your own lived experience, then this is NOT the kind of relationship environment you need right now to properly heal.**

The lack of empathy isnt something you can educate people away from. He doesn't care and you can't change that. You don't need a project you need a partner. And TBH you don't even need a partner.

"You sound like past me. I was in a physically abusive relationship. I left it and my next relationship was physically safe but emotionally abusive. I think the bottom line for me is this: if I say something hurts (my body, my feelings) or ask for care, my partner needs to stop and care for me. Care should not be conditional on them understanding why, or validating, my pain. You can expect a partner to care for you without understanding why you are hurting. 

If he is genuinely interested in learning about your PTSD and how to care for you he will seek out his own resources. We can't teach partners to be motivated to care for us. 

If this resonates then I'm sorry, I know it hurts like hell to accept that someone just isn't interested in caring for you, it feels much better to think they just don't have the right book or education.

Thank you. I think he does care, he has started reading the book my therapist reccomended and is always there for me and supportive when I'm anxious or upset. I just think that underneath that he doesnt really get why, and sort of thinks I should be over it or doesn't understand why I stayed with my ex.  I just really feel he doesn't get it, but maybe that's a big ask of someone that has never been abused themselves.	betteringmylife123	follow-up	na	na	na	0.03137307986617088	weak	strong	no	na	domesticviolence	failed

"so i had recently told my parents about the fact that i drink socially. my mom was not okay with it and she kept overthinking over it for months. i came back to home from college and my mom was constantly talking about drinking drinking and drinking calling me a drunkard and what not, inspite of it being pretty much controlled and moderated on my end.

my dad was initially okay with this but mom kept provoking him to DO SOMETHING about it. then my dad’s ego triggered and he’s a narcissist and he asked me to cancel my flight tickets back to college or he will break my mac. i canceled the tickets but asked my bf for some money and booked fresh ones for today. dad asked me to show the bank details for who paid and i cant show because they are also not okay with me having a boyfriend. so i kept begging them to just leave it and let me go. if he got to know about the bf he would abuse him or beat him up like he did to my last bf. i was scared. i just wanted to take my flight for today and leave. he threatened to break my phone so i ran from home. he locked my mac in an almirah. he tracked me down hunted me and brought me back home, again asking for bank details. i didn’t share. i booked cab so that i can leave for airport. after the cab came, he threatened me that if i sit in the cab, he will do something reallly realllyy bad. i begged him. he pulled me. and threw my luggage outside the cab. brought me back home. told me i will never go back to college. i cried and begged to let me catch my flight. he told my how i was sooo wrong to have the audacity to book the flight and an uber all whilst he was against it. i said i am sorry to cater to his narcissistic ego. i cried to just let me go. he said ill stay, show him the bank details tomorrow and then leave after 10 days. i didn’t want to show the bank details. i asked him to pls understand, it’s private. he said what private? wtf are u hiding from me? he slapped me. i went to my room started crying. he locked my laptop and phone in an almirah and locked me in another room. i kept crying then my aunt knocked. i told her everything about why i cant show the bank details etc. she said she will try convincing them. she went and talked to them and told them that she thinks whatever is in the statements is fine. she asked them to trust her and let me go. they said fine- they will not check my statements and i can only go after 10 days. then i didn’t go for my flight and stayed against my will. today they stealthily took my passbook and they have gone to the bank to get the statement’s printed . once they get to know about my bf they are going to do the same thing to him, abuse him on call, they will also abuse me and enforce a break up and they will threaten him that if he keeps any contact with me, they will screw him and his family over. and they are also not booking my flight tickets for after 10 days as of now, saying they will see. i don’t want to stay here. i want to run away to college. my dad is a narcissist and mom has some other issues in which she gets sadistic pleasure everytime i am hurting because she thinks i am learning a lesson for drinking. i dont know what to do. should i file a complaint? but i am not financially independent yet. should i call women’s rights (i am based in india btw). or should i just live with it?"	uwillnever_know	post	24.715951749409953	female	White	0.9983343482017517	na	na	na	4	domesticviolence	'ethnicity: asian, age: early 20s, gender: female, explanation: the author refers to being in college and dealing with parents, pointing towards a younger age, likely early 20s. the fact that she mentions her dad threatening to hurt her boyfriend implies she's female. being based in india, she likely belongs to an asian ethnicity.'

"also tw for threats of violence

my (18f) brother (19m who we’ll call adam) groped me when i was 15 (in 2021). naive me told my school about it thinking i’ll just get a bit of counselling and it will be over. but no - i forgot that safeguarding exists and bc i was a minor, my school called the police to come to my house. i feel i should also add that they didn’t tell me or my parents that they had called the police. the police just showed up at our front door after my mum had a conversation with the “safeguarding leader” at school which ended early because he “had to get back to his kids”.

anyway, since around 2019, adam has been.. emotionally turbulent. my parents blame his autism and say that he doesn’t understand what he’s doing is wrong. one time i was on holiday with adam as well as our parents. we were in a car and he slapped my thigh in one of his rage fits. i was 14 and it really hurt bc he’s a big guy (over 6ft and a gym bro). my parents saw and did nothing and i was trying not to cry. i couldn’t go anywhere bc we were in a car in a foreign country. 

there have been many incidents since then, nothing that violent but just stuff like threatening to punch my mum or fight my dad. 

then there was the most recent incident which prompted me to post this. about a week ago, adam was going on another one of his sexist rants at dinner saying how women are over emotional yadayadayada. my mum and dad were trying to calm him down and tell him he shouldn’t be saying that sort of stuff. his argument was that was he was saying wasn’t illegal and then i said the law doesn’t dictate morality and that he should probably shut up. granted, that may have not helped the situation but he was really annoying me and i had to say something. he then called me a rat multiple times, told me “you’re dead” multiple times, and did a throat slitting gesture. i got scared so i took my dinner up to my bedroom. i then come back down after i *thought* things had calmed down i then see him trying to tackle our dad to the ground because me dad confiscated his brand new phone. 

both me and adam are still living at home but i’ll hopefully be going to uni in september so i won’t have to see his stupid face for a while. 

this post was more of a rant to get everything off my chest but if anyone has some advice on what i can do for the next month while we’re both still at home it would be very much appreciated. my POA for now is just avoid interacting with him bc it never goes well."	thr04w4y12345678	post	11.096499369544832	male	White	0.9982513785362244	na	na	na	1	domesticviolence	no prediction.
I'd be scared too. i think he does know what he's doing. he obviously has the ability to read that andrew tate guy stuff or wherever young men are getting their words to express their hatred of women from these days. can you get a lock on your door? can you refuse to eat with the family? your parents are naive and they already possibly can't physically restrain him every time. if you can stay with a friend as much as possible. being emotional right now is about listening to your fear, and taking sensible steps. maybe speak to a domestic violence helpline. we have strong emotions for a reason, such as the danger larger people present.	thr04w4y12345678	reply	na	na	na	0.9982513785362244	weak	no	strong	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.
"hi, sorry if the question has an obvious answer. im conflicted. i barely talk to anyone about my groomer, but four years ago online when i was 12 we met. i don’t have many memories of that long ago, but we continued to talk for a long time and basically had a full romantic relationship. he would tell me how he would rape me, abuse me, kill me, etc in detail. he would tell me how he manipulated me into loving him and how he was glad I’d be with him forever. I didn’t tell anyone because I love him, and I didn’t want my friends to report him.

Six months ago he disappeared. Didn’t answer my calls, texts, desperate pleads, messages, anything. I kept trying to reach him for those six months, until I finally searched up his name in hopes to find anything. I found his obituary. On July 17th, he shot himself. I reached out to his wife pretending to be an old friend, and asked what happened. She seemed closed off and distrustful, said he left no note and she basically had no idea what happened, and that he refused to talk to her preceding that; he also left behind two young children and they now have no source of income. 

I don’t know why he did it either. I didn’t get a note, but he would talk to me about his guilt often. I suspect he had a mental break and it all built up to that. 

On my end, I don’t know what to do. If I ever wanted justice, it’s now out of my reach. Maybe if he domestically abused me, I could’ve been happy, but he didn’t. The last three years all he did was love me. I’m grieving still. I don’t know if it’d help to tell his ex? If it’d drive her to suicide too? Would she feel better?? Would it give me closure?

Been dealing with a domestic violence situation for a year and 7 months. About 10 police reports and a protective order, and chest contusion, two strangulations, 4 cases with the DA’s office. 4 iPhones, 3 TVs, laptop, kindle, lcd on my car, rear view mirror. So bailed him out of jail twice from the domestic violence cases. Ankle monitor twice. Both times now as soon as the ankle monitor came off he starts acting crazy again. Yelling at me and calling me names. The first time he broke my laptop and that’s when he tried to strangle me again. My neighbor called the police because they could hear us. He has a history of drug use. Up until he went to jail last September for the first strangulation charge. Was in jail almost 3 months and unfortunately his addiction became poker. But wanted to smoke weed at first I didn’t think it would hurt anything because it at least it wasn’t crack. But he fell off the wagon and I left angry with him but eventually he came with me to my new place (long long long story but have moved 3 times in a year because of him) he got picked up at the extended stay the day I signed my lease for the new apartment. Went to jail for another month. Ankle monitor up until 2 or 3 weeks ago. But there are so many things I just let slide and made excuses for for months. None of my friends or family even know he is still with me. Except one friend. His temper is starting to escalate again. I can’t handle being yelled at and that’s starting to come back and the name calling and he left last week and ended getting high on ice while he was gone. He used the debit card separate account and lied to me about what he bought. I I caught him lying. He is hiding stuff on his phone because I see partial evidence. But there hasn’t been any intimacy. I pay for his cigarettes (a pack a day) poker money, everything and he complains when I am trying to pay rent that he wants wings from Hooters won’t eat hardly anything I cook. Won’t eat left overs. Uses the good shampoo instead just Sauve. Sleeps all day. Stays up all night. I ask to go places with me and he refuses. A guy that pulled a gun on me in my apartment complex he didn’t want to even talk about it. But gripped at me that I was starting trouble with the neighbors. He does nothing to benefit my life but I can’t get rid of him. I am wanting to pack up just clothes and necessities and leave my entire apartment behind and move across the country because I have tried everything else. I swear he is like a leech sucking the life out of me. I am on anti depressants and anti anxiety meds and take something to help me sleep. His sneezes trigger me. He yells at his poker game and I flinch. Any time he yells I hide my phone. I give in to him to keep the peace by this isn’t any way to live. Any recommendations on staying over in a new state?  What are some resources I can look into? Words of advice? I want to leave this life behind and make a fresh start. I am freaking out but I know I need to break out of this cycle.

"So, I am a victim of being repeatedly raped and beat by my brother as a child and my parents did nothing about it. My brother threatening me physically is the reason why I had to flee home and become homeless a few months ago (I’m a young adult). 

I spoke with a victim advocate and I decided I’m gonna report my brother and my parents tomorrow at the police station. I’m so scared too. I keep hearing how it’ll turn out poorly for me (I was told things would not turn out well from family when I had to talk to CPS as a teenager about this).

I don’t have words to describe how angry this makes me. My mother was abused as a child and she’s been a lil fucked up her whole life. I wouldn’t listen to anyone that’s telling you not to tell on your abuser. Idk how long ago this was. And I hope there’s not a statute of limitations on something like this! I think this behavior is just as bad as murder bc now you have to live with it for the rest of your life. It’s going to affect your relationships going forward. Trust issues. I really feel bad for you when I don’t even know you! You should talk with a professional about this. Your parents should be charged as well for knowing about this, and doing nothing to protect their child.

"I’m so sorry you had to go through that and I’m sorry the people in charge of protecting you failed you. 

You are absolutely doing the right thing. Make sure you have a safe place to go afterward where they can’t find you."	Apprehensive_Bug5651	reply	na	na	na	0.1696806401014328	strong	no	no	na	domesticviolence	failed
"First, are you safe? Are you in a place where you are safe? A friends house or a domestic violence shelter? Do you have somewhere safe to be after you go to the police station and do you have somebody going with you.

Ask if they have an advocate or
 call the SA or Dv shelter ahead of time to see if somebody can go with you. No doubt they will have you take out a restraining order. That will keep him from going anywhere near you. Make sure you have any evidence with you when you go. So text messages, pictures, times and dates and descriptions of what happened.

2nd, my heart is with you. I was molested by a local growing up. I never reported it and nothing ever happened to him. I’ve always regretted it and it led me to several abusive relationships since. You are brave and strong.

I have reported other people though and I am an advocate that goes with people to do it.  I’m sure they’re reminding you that your brother is the one that committed the crime and why they probably will find that he had some sort of mental illness it’s still his responsibility.
As they say, the ball will roll pretty quickly after your report. It might seem like chaos for a little bit but it will even out. 

Either the police or CPS will decide how much involvement your parents had in the situation, that can be very very complicated but your main focus is on healing yourself. 

As far as Going bad for you, legally the only way it will go bad for you is if you’re telling a lie. So just tell the truth, tell them what you remember and as many effects as you can give them.
As far  your family concerned, I’m sure it’s going to be a very difficult time. That’s why you need to be somewhere where you feel safe. When these things happen a lot of times the parents and family are in shock. They don’t always behave the best when they’re in shock. Sometimes they expressed their anger at you. Sometimes they will call you a liar or come up with a reason that you’re making this whole thing up. As a mother I can tell you there’s not many worst things you can hear about your child either being molested or being the one that did it. It’s a nightmare but that’s not on you.
They will have to get their own and deal with it. 

It’s hard to predict but I’m sure it will be emotional for you no matter what.


I know that when I finally told my parents, at dinner one night, about what my uncle had done to me ( my dads younger brother) I did cause a big rip in the family. My dad didn’t want to believe it. That’s a really complex emotion and reaction, please know it’s not cut and dry or your side or his side. In my experience it may take time and possibly therapy for them to come to grips with the fact that your brother could’ve done such things.

They’ve got to decide what to do and how to react with him. Because if he’s arrested that’s going to be like a crisis moment. And they’re probably going to scramble to try and figure out what their role responsibility. 

In the meantime, if you have a support group through that advocacy or a trauma therapist to talk to you, that’s what’s best for you right now.

Some parents react better than others and are able to support you as a victim. But throughout your healing it’s gonna be easier to rely on people who understand what you went through.

When my son was 10 my sister accused him of touching her five year old son. My sister is an evil person much is a thought she made it up, my job as a parent was to take it seriously.  I was blindsided because the police just showed up and started talking to my son about sex with a male, which I had not had a talk with him about at that point so it’s very hard. But the minute that officer left I was racing to find a therapist For my son. The police didn’t tell me what they were going to do right away but with my family history of sexual abuse, I wanted to know if my son was capable of that. As a mother, if it had happened especially on several occasions that she was accusing him of, I had no inkling of it whatsoever. That really ate at me. It turned out that she didn’t lie and the circumstances she was reporting was actually impossible to have taken place but I don’t rule out that my nephew may have been touched by somebody. I love my nephew unconditionally and as an adult I think he’s wonders what went on. I’m only telling you this because some parents, especially at this time in our world react positive and some negative

It’s never a good thing in a family and there is a lot of shame involved. As a young woman, telling your story and reporting him might save other women from going through what you did. Down the line as you heal you look at the whole situation more clearly. If you can’t speak to your family for a while it would make sense. Don’t carry the weight of all of their expressions, shock and shame. 

Please remember you didn’t cause your brother to do anything. It isn’t your fault.
You didn’t make him do it or keep him from stopping. I don’t know his age but as I said mental illness sometimes offers an explanation. What I learned was that my uncle chose me just because I was the only girl that he could be around without people suspecting.

Some advice and wisdom for a little bit later on, you’re going to be OK. It won’t be so loud and so focused. Keep going to trauma therapy and getting support from other survivors.  You are not just a victim, you are a survivor and your body in your brain did what you needed to do to get through it.

"TW: mention of physical assault 

Hi hope this is the right place 

Recently my grandfather passed away and he had a LOT of children with different women. 

Went to his funeral and they all have fond memories of him. My mother is his eldest daughter and it was her, her siblings and her mother that got the brunt of his rage. My mother also had children from a previous marriage who he was especially violent with. He used to beat up my grandmother so bad that she had to run away. Her finger is still bent from when he beat her with a broom and her face is still numb from where he punched her over 40 years ago. They were never married but lived together. My mum eventually ran away from home at 19 and didn’t see her dad for another 35 years and then again at 40 years at his funeral. 

At the funeral I met loads of aunties, uncles and cousins that I never knew I had (he has over 30 children) and they never had that experience. Hearing the relationship that they had with him made me kind of sad that I never got to know him. I’ve also missed out on getting to know my cousins. Growing up I never felt like I belonged but at that funeral, I felt at home. I was around people who have the same last name and who also look like me. But I am also conflicted, knowing how badly he treated my grandmother and how unhappy he made my mum as a child. 

Why he beat on her only? Why did he treat her so poorly?"	CocoNefertitty	post	37.43689579347231	female	White	0.006259592715650797	na	na	na	1	domesticviolence	no prediction.

Every time I have a family event he says he is sick, he is hurt, he can’t go. It’s these threats, he knows that I rely of him for support around them. He has made me scared of my own mother, sometimes when I would be mad at me, he would mention my family and point out something that would make me think they don’t love me. I have laid here for the past 7 or 8 years taking this. He doesn’t consider how I feel, what I want, there is no compromise or even thought of what he is going to do. He always has chosen his desires over my feelings no matter how many times he has done it before and i cry and tell him it’s not okay. It’s unacceptable, I won’t allow this.

He gives me approval temporarily if he “approves of my behaviors” but that hardly ever happens and it normally has to be in front of other people. He can’t even just do it while it’s just us.

"Yes, my husband is a covert narcissist. Very similar experience aside from mine not being physically violent. Covert narcissists are powerfully manipulative.

Here's my advice. 

1. Stop participating in arguments. They regulate their shitty emotions through you. Once they see you are upset, they feel better. Give them nothing. Use the BIFF method of communication (Brief Informative Factual and Friendly). Do not take the bait. I call them word witches because the more words you give them the worse you feel because they twist them and nothing ever gets resolved.

2. Record your disputes. Mine would gaslight me into believing I was asking for too much, I was insulting, I yelled -- none of it was true, but I believed him. I believed I was an awful person and no one loved me. After the heat of an argument I went back and listened and I was calm and reasonable but I noticed something, every sentence he uttered was to throw the conversation into different directions, every word served the purpose of getting heat off him and diflecting it to me.

3. I found anti-depressants very helpful and I started talking to a therapist. You cannot do what needs doing if you are weakened by these years of abuse, your therapist and meds can help you stay strong.

4. Find support from narc groups online. They're everywhere and just start sharing your experiences.

5. Start a journal and write down instances of abuse so if you need a protective order you can have this record. You absolutely should get a protective order.

6. File for divorce, and just show up and provide everything you can until the judge turns it into a default divorce. If you want a divorce he has no choice. Make sure everything is served by a process server or sheriff's office and at some point if he doesn't want you to win everything, he will show up. Expect the worst fight of your life.

7. Put your ego in a little box and kiss it goodbye for a good while. You will do better without it. You will endure the most embarrassing smear campaign of your life. Stick to your goal and try not to let it bother you. Do not engage in mudslinging. Take the humiliation and just keep going.

You can do this. I promise it's so worth it. I am so much happier now."	SnoooooozyQ	reply	na	na	na	0.9987764954566956	no	strong	no	na	domesticviolence	failed

">I go no contact, file for divorce, so all the paperwork and then he never does his paperwork, he not once has done what he needs to to get divorced.

File for divorce regardless of whether he does his side or not. Divorce does not require two people to want it, just one. File, separate from him, and go no contact. Reconnect with friends and family for support and, if possible, get therapy. 

>He has me convinced my family doesn’t love me, like he doesn’t, I am unloved, all idea suck, he isolated me from my family.

Your family and friends don't hate you. If anything, some of them have probably noticed he's shit and just don't know how to approach/help you. Reach out to them. Those who believe you, lean on them for support. Anyone who isn't supportive, stay away from them. 

>I am Going to try some new lines I read about. Does anyone else have any experience or advice on how to get this person, who is the kindest man I have ever met to everyone in the world, except me.

Unfortunately that won't work; nothing will. There's nothing you can do that will make him stop being abusive to you except leaving him for good.

Ok, so it's clear that this guy is unstable and he's manipulating you (essentially brainwashing you) into thinking that your family doesn't love you and not only that but he wants you to be covering up for him whenever he puts his hands on you because he's a coward and none of that is ok. And I'm really sorry about that but you know what he's doing because you say it right here and look, even if you sign the divorce papers and he doesn't that doesn't mean that you have to stay and put up with his shit, so get up, get out and go to your family.

I feel awful and all my other support systems have crumpled on me. I feel all alone again. I first met him when I was 17 and my mother was going through very serious life saving and life destroying cancer treatment. I was so incredibly lonely at that time. I had absolutely nobody. And he picked me up and then he dragged me behind him. I left him. I am alone again. He would pick up.

Have you ever been to a co-dependants anon meeting? Can you find out if there might be one in your area? If not can you go to one online? Or any post separation/dv support groups? I think it would help you to surround yourself with people going through something similar. What could that look like for you?	prozacprosperity	reply	na	na	na	0.9991525411605835	no	no	strong	na	domesticviolence	failed
Even if he would be there when you call, it comes with a violent price.  It's not worth it.  Loneliness is temporary.

"Ended the relationship after all the mental, verbal and emotional abuse turned physical. 

It’s been 5 months and he’s still trying to contact me after I asked him not to (he also stalked me for quite a while). 

Question:

Did things get better for you (or worse) after filing an official restraining order?

I’m scared because in my state they make the person surrender their firearms. My ex loves his gun more than life. I’m worried about retaliation."	torturedDaisy	post	9.588132976298073	male	White	0.9988454580307007	na	na	na	2	domesticviolence	failed
"The restraining order makes it easier for legal professionals to act since it’s a lower standard than criminal conviction. Other than that your ability to avoid your abuser and thwart retaliation attempts is more important. The order itself cannot help you physically and assume your abuser will still have access to guns even if sheriffs relieve him of his personal collection. 

My first restraining order made things worse because it angered him without keeping him locked up (so I was still in danger). I dropped the restraining order then went for criminal charges successfully. Because he’s out of my life physically the restraining order I have from his conviction makes my life better because it gives me the ability to possibly send him back to jail over violations or gives me justification to delete him if he tries to kill me again."	torturedDaisy	reply	na	na	na	0.9988454580307007	no	no	no	na	domesticviolence	failed

"Hey y'all. 

A month ago I moved into a new apartment and everything was going well until the first night I stayed. Underneath me I heard constant yelling and super aggressive movement. It was hard to make out the words other than ""Get out, get out , get the FUCK out!"" in a man's voice. The incessant barking does not stop and every few days that episode plays out over and over. I do not have any proof of physical violence but there is sometimes banging as if furniture is being abruptly moved.

"My ex-wife raped me. 

It has taken a lot of work to admit to what she did. We divorced 3yrs ago now. I am in such a better place today.  I am thinking about it tonight as it was exactly 3yrs ago the wheels started falling apart with respect to our marriage.

In the moment, it didn’t feel like ‘rape’.  I was asleep and woke up to her on top of me.  This was a few weeks  after I asked we take a break from sex so I could deal with some health issues.  I had developed ED due to the anti-depressants she claimed I needed (whole story on its own).  I couldn’t get erect and was embarrassed I asked for no sex until I could work things out with my Dr.

A few months later, she did it again!   We had just watched ‘Bridgerton’.  A few weeks later I wake up to her on top of me. Pinned me down, no condom, no birth control. Refused to get off me until I came.

The month that followed was so hard. Non stop fighting. I eventually take off for a couple weeks to hang out with my sisters. I described what happen and my sister said I was raped. It didn’t sink at first, but that was what happened.

I am just shocked that it felt normal but wrong at the same time. 

After going through 2yrs of trauma based therapy, it got easier to see other insidious behaviors around sex.  

Lucky no kids came of this situation.

"This is awful. I'm so sorry it happened to you. 

Partner sexual abuse sucks (not that any kind is great) specifically because you never really get to prosecute even if you wanted to. I still have physical and emotional trauma over one time in 2011 and we've been divorced 5 years now, plus it wasn't even the last time he assaulted me, but it was the time that in my head was the worst because I hadn't started dissociating yet. After that experience it takes active work *not* to dissociate and then the active work feels like a performance. The only way to avoid both is weed but then you worry you're only enjoying it because of drugs. It really fucking sucks. It makes intimacy hard forever, even with therapy.

She should’ve respected that boundary and she didn’t! That’s rape!! And the fact people brush it off because your a man, is disgusting. If this happened to a woman, people would be livid and telling her to go to the police. Im sorry, you weren’t treated with the same respect and dignity and sympathy.

"Thank you, it was hard to live through.  Quite a mind trip. It wasn’t the violent “holding a knife to your throat” event.  It was a lot more calm, but I did take away consent when I asked for no sex, at least to let me initiate when I felt better.  I was asleep when she started. I told her no when it was going on…  she didn’t have a right to do that.

It really hurt when I had to listen to her lawyer say this was consensual. That I didn’t push her off.

"After 10 years of marriage, countless fights involving physical and (daily) emotional abuse.  Numerous times leaving only to come back.... I have finally walked away for the last time.  I'm absolutely done with his temper, his PTSD and his lying.
This last incident involved him putting his cigarette out on my arm.  When I responded ""why the f**k would you do that to me"" his response was ""you should have moved"" and he walked away.

So my question is this.  Every time I try to discuss these incidents, I'm accused of either exaggerating everything or I'm flat out lying.  I really think he believes his own bullshit....he has never, ever admitted to anything regarding physical abuse.  Emotional abuse...he has no problem admitting to it and explaining in detail why 'I'm a cunt, I'm a piece of garbage, a worthless mother.....""  I could keep going for hours about his daily morning temper tantrums and the words he uses to beat me down.

Why won't he admit it?  It dawned on me that he really believes his own bullshit and when that fact sunk into my brain, I became scared of him for the first time.  So I left, again, but for the last time.

Even now, almost a month later, he is still trying to get me back, to come home.  I demand he admit his abuse and have accountability for his actions, but he keeps insisting he is innocent and I am making everything up.

WTF???

Has anyone else gone through this?

Edit: I'm not asking him to admit his guilt to a court or divorce lawyer...just to me.  I want to hear him say that ""yes, I did those things"".

"The first six months are the most dangerous after leaving. The risk is the abuser is losing control and will likely escalate in those six months but the other risk I feel should be mentioned is what’s happening right now. You’re still talking to him, thinking you can reason with an unreasonable, unaccountable person. The risk is also of you returning.

Abusive people exist because they are never held accountable. They take no responsibility for their behavior, even from a young age. And society generally supports them in avoiding being accountable. Whether it be the church, the media, the courts, cops, their families, etc, all reinforce it. Abusive people are selfish, entitled, victim blaming, manipulative, liars who’ve avoided taking responsibility for the wrongs they’ve done most of their lives.

He does blame you. He doesn’t take responsibility. He won’t ever take responsibility unless he enters a specific kind of abuser program and even then the recidivism rate for abusers is *super* high. If you want to understand what’s happening better, [here is Why Does He Do That](https://ia800108.us.archive.org/30/items/LundyWhyDoesHeDoThat/Lundy_Why-does-he-do-that.pdf) written by Lundy Bancroft a domestic violence counselor with over 25 years experience. He offers the book free online. I listened to the audible version while I was extracting my ex and to say it strengthened my resolve would be an understatement. Once I truly appreciated why my ex was acting the way he was, I wanted him as far away from me as possible. There was no conversation to be had. I was **done.**"	Background_Park_2310	reply	na	na	na	0.9985435009002686	weak	no	no	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.
"Something I'm coming to terms with is that I will never get a meaningful, honest apology from my abuser for the pain and suffering he's caused. Nor will he ever truly own his behaviour. He admits to the abuse, but always down plays it - ""it's just a smack, it's not like I punched you with a closed fist"", or my personal favourite, ""what I said wasn't emotional abuse, I'm just the only person in your life who has the balls to tell you what you don't want to hear."" All of this is complete bullshit, of course. Abuse is abuse and it's wrong no matter what. 

Having them admit to it brings us a sense of vindication and maybe some closure, but please do not expect it to change anything else about the situation. It will not cause him to have an epiphany about how wrong his behaviour is, nor will it prevent him from doing it again in the future. You've done the hard part and you got away from him. Now do yourself the biggest favour of your life and stay gone. You may never get that admission of guilt and you may need to learn to live the rest of your life without it, and it will feel incredibly unfair at times, but not as unfair as wasting the precious time you have left on this earth being mistreated and abused.

"I agree with all the previous commenters—you’ll never get an apology and you’ll never get “closure.” Truly understanding that and accepting it has been perhaps the most difficult thing for me; it was the thing I struggled with most. I still feel anger over the fact, if I am honest. I accept it, I understand it, but I am still furious about it, and I imagine I always will be to some extent. The pain lessens over time, though.  It hasn’t gone away entirely, but it dissipates, and building a new, happy life has been helpful in putting these feelings (mostly) behind me.

Working with an excellent, trauma-informed therapist has been the key to my making peace with this reality, as well as beginning to heal from the trauma/address my CPTSD, learn how to build and maintain healthy relationships, and so much more. It has been hard, challenging work, but it has saved me and vastly improved my life. I cannot recommend finding a therapist for both you and for your son who has a trauma-informed approach, someone who specializes in or is at least well-versed in the dynamics of domestic violence. As someone who grew up in a home where there was violence and emotional abuse, I really cannot stress enough how important it is for your son to be in therapy, too.  I know that my mother did her best to shield us from what was happening, but interventions as a kid would have been life altering in such a big way.

I would contact your state/local/county DV organizations for referrals and recommendations. They may even offer therapy or other services
 themselves. I’d also call to see what other assistance they can provide, including legal representation. Again, getting an attorney who understands these dynamics is absolutely critical.  If your local orgs don’t offer legal help, I’d contact legal aid organizations near you, because they almost certainly will have a DV or family law project. If they don’t, they can make referrals. I’d also contact your state bar association to see if they can refer to family law attorneys, and I’d look at law schools in your state, since most have DV/Family Justice clinics and can offer representation or referrals.

Getting in touch ASAP with an attorney if you haven’t already will also be key for getting guidance on preserving and documenting key evidence, like texts and emails and pictures, as well as advice for handling contact with him in the future. Keeping it to an absolute minimum will be so important for your mental health, and it’s very likely he’ll menace you through the apps many courts use to facilitate communication between co-parents. Preparing for that/other harassment or anything else he does and getting help with how best to document will be really useful.

I’m so glad you and your son are away from your abuser. Be proud of how much strength that took. You deserve to be safe, happy, and loved, and I promise a much better life is waiting for you. I’m including a few resources below that may be helpful. Best of luck and take care.

"This might be a little difficult but this is the way that it was explained to me.
Imagine if you got up for work tomorrow and you grabbed your car keys and your coffee and your hands were full when you got into your van. You were setting them all down why started the car and put it in reverse. You weren’t exactly looking up and you didn’t check behind your van But you hear a thud. 

You get out of your van and you notice that you have hit a child. Even if it was an accident, even have maybe you were a little too distracted or weren’t as careful as you should be how hard would it be for you to forgive yourself? How hard would it be for you to allow that thought or memory even creep in to your brain and still be a functioning human being. 

Well, now you take a person who was likely traumatized as a child, most likely by a narcissist and this child grows up to do things that sometimes they know, sometimes they don’t understand why and sometimes they had no control over it.
Their brain does the same self defense mechanism. In order for a narcissist to exist and keep their self hatred locked inside of a box they can’t even afford a little bit of guilt. If they let the guilt start it won’t stop. 

I didn’t know how much I believed it at first until my oldest son started showing signs of bipolar and narcissistic personality disorder. I know for a fact that he was attacked by his father brutally one time and he was mentally and emotionally abused by him as well. I know because his father was never able to show him an ounce of love my son has that hatred for himself. All he cares about is different ways he can self harm and believe it or not, these people usually use us to do it.

We are normally the best thing that ever happened to them and to punish them selves they push us away, by any means necessary. They deprive themselves of the possibility of healing or joy. It’s a vicious circle.

First of all, you are not worthless. Abusers have a knack for making you feel like everything is your fault. This is absolutely not normal behavior. He is not a normal person so you won’t be able to have a normal conversation with him. It will always be “your fault” as hard as it is, it is time to say goodbye and stop trying to talk to him.

"he sounds like a narcissist, i don’t typically like to accuse people of this since the term is used so frequently and incorrectly now but it really sounds like he has narcissistic personality disorder. but, that doesn’t change anything other than you realizing that trying to get him to admit to anything is a pointless and honestly more traumatizing place to put yourself in. 

I went through similar situations with my ex. my therapist recommended that i record our “fights” which were way too many that i ended up just stopping after the first few BUT to record them so I could go back and verify for myself that “this happened” or “he said this/I said this.” I started to realize that he had conditioned me to believe him and that my “memory” was just hazy. I know this sounds absolutely crazy but that’s what happens when your constantly gaslit, it’s exhausting, draining and damaging. 

My ex made porn with a few women while I was at home with our son, he committed identity theft by uploading the videos to phub under my id, I even spoke with one of the girls and got actual proof that this is what happened. these poor women had been uploaded to phub w/o their consent and he was making $$. I begged him to admit it to me bc i already knew the truth, i told him i just wanted him to be honest, that i wouldn’t “tell”, yada yada yada… he were are 4 years later and he will still say “everyone i’ve ever filmed, they’ve 100% consented.”

long comment sorry, but point is… it’s useless trying to get someone to admit to something that they know they did. and, as far as accountability, you already know that it happened, the pain has already been inflicted so now seeking whatever you’re seeking from him saying “okay, yeah, i did that”… i know it would feel good but 99.9% of the time, you’re NEVER going to get that, especially given the abusive relationship with you two. please don’t go back, the cycle will never end.. and keeping communication with him just to fill your ego with his acknowledgment of what he did honestly won’t make you feel better. i know that sounds mean and awful, but it’s the truth. I say go to counseling, get away from this man forever (hopefully y’all don’t have a child together) and heal from the mental, emotional and physical abuse. 

I’m sorry that you’re going through this, I wish I could reach out and give you a hug because I know this game all too well and I share a child with my abuser who unfortunately, still remains a manipulative psychopath lol. If you are currently going to court for a divorce, get a good attorney PLEASE, even though most are snakes and just drain every single penny from you, and if you have a child/property that needs to be divided, buckle up for the ride… it’s a long, painful and exhausting ride, given your ex’s “issues.” 

be safe, be smart, keep your poker face, don’t show your cards, keep written record of everything, document document DOCUMENT everything… if you have to speak to him, ONLY do so through text so you have legit written records, if you speak to him on the phone then make sure you download an app that records calls (check your states law on that.. i live in a 1 person consent state meaning I am the 1 person that consents to the call being recorded & the other doesn’t need to know), find a DV advocate and just prepare yourself for the long but oh so much happier road to “recovery.” YOUVE GOT THIS!"

"I am trying to do just that... it's been easy so far to not look back.  But, I'm starting to remember and overthink the years of gaslighting...like maybe I am unlovable, this will be my second divorce.  The common factor in both failed relationships is me... he's right about that.

As far as communication goes, he's the father of my youngest son.  There has to be some form of communication, at least until the divorce is finalized and custody arrangements are settled.  But I keep myself as distant as possible, not allowing him any window into my life.

I'm not going back.  I don't have any emotions towards him except anger.

But I think this last incident was the writing on the wall.  Things were escalating to a dangerous point and he wasn't going to continue to hold back.  

I wish my heart didn't hurt so much.  I don't know why I feel so heartbroken.  Perhaps it's just the acceptance that I loved him with all of my heart and I wasn't able to make him happy.

"You know what? The very first thing I read this morning was your post, and the very first thing I did even before getting out of bed, was writing that response to you. I am so glad it made you feel better <3 Stay strong and stay single for a long while.   


Remember: the most important relationship you will ever have is the one you have with yourself. Love yourself more than you will love any man and love yourself more than any man will.   
When you have a deep and profound faith in yourself and a deep belief in your worth as a person only then  are you ready to find a man who will be a true and equal partner with whom you can build a good life.   
Because then you will be much less likely to believe gaslighting bullshit that is only meant to keep you trapped in a sick cycle of constantly trying to ""be better"" in order for him to love you and treat you right - of course you will never be ""good enough"" in the eyes of the abuser, but you will always keep trying in order ito ""make it work"". Promise yourself not to do that anymore for the rest of your life.   


You are enough and you should never believe someone who tries to convince you that you should be lucky that he wants such a broken/bad/horrible/ugly/evil bitch ""because no one else does.""

But the question should never be: who would want such a woman like me? (So I'd better take the shitty man I can get) but rather: what kind of man do \*I\* want? What kind of partner do \*I\* want to spend my precious life with?   


Personally I would rather stay single forever than subject myself to any kind of abuse, name calling, humilation, down putting etc. If my partner is not someone who will build me up and be in my corner, then I don't want him at all. Why waste this precious short life on subjecting myself to abuse every day?

have you ever filed a police report or did you just make the call. those incidents could all help you tremendously in being able to get away from him, FAR away from him.. I don’t know what state you’re in but the domestic violence hotline is always there, they always answer, they always talk to you and let you know that you in fact are NOT crazy and guide you to resources that are out there for you, local resources. go file a protection from abuse order, press charges on him for domestic violence, don’t worry about “hurting his feelings” or “getting him in trouble” because at the end of the day YOU have to protect YOU!! please make sure you have a safe and secure place to be if you choose that route because most abusers seek revenge through physical violence because they want to keep you quiet. An abusive ex that retaliates is honestly terrifying but as long as you are safe and don’t let ANYONE know where you are, you can at least sleep safe. I am a testimony to that. You are strong and have been mentally and emotionally manipulated to believe that you are anything other than that but I promise you, YOU are still in there!

"I have a family member that is verbally abusive towards his wife. He's not physically abusive as far as I know but he calls her moron, idiot, belittles her and does nothing to contribute to their family. He's gotten violent and punched a hole in the wall and also has a gambling problem. I want to help protect her and she does want to leave, but she's scared because she can't afford daycare  for their children and living expenses without him. I told her she can stay with us for a little. 

I have a few questions and would appreciate advice:

\- They have a lease in VA, they are renting from an owner, but the lease does not include anything about breaking the lease. I would assume since it's not listed, the owner has not protected themselves and can't punish them? Or at the very minimum, she won't return the security deposit? But it won't show up as an eviction, right? She's not REQUIRED to stay there, right???

\- I told her that he will be required to pay child support if she decides to divorce him, but she feels that he will just evade that requirement. Is it true that the court will take money from his paycheck if he's behind on child support?

\-Is this a domestic violence situation or simply a divorce situation? Does she have any backing in court, or will they not take her seriously since there's no physical violence? 

\-Is there anything I can do to help? Unfortunately, the abuser is MY family member, and I have cut ties with him and refuse to talk to him. I have tried to help in the past but he is just a POS and won't change."	flowertrain678	post	35.42109120423705	female	White	0.9992372989654541	na	na	na	2	domesticviolence	failed

"Lease: read Virginia’s tenancy laws and be prepared to work something out in writing with the landlord. Often the situation with lease breaks is you don’t have to stay but you do have to keep paying rent and probably a lease break fee until the landlord gets a new tenant. 

Child support: CS is ordered but it’s common for obligated payers to fall behind on purpose and not be punished like they should for it. The typical mechanisms is payer needs to pay to some website or agency then if they don’t their wages can be garnished, liens put out on their property, held in contempt, assigned a warrant for their arrest, etc. But like I said many people get away with not paying. 

Divorce or DV: it’s both. If she just divorces without a restraining order or police charges putting the DV on paper she can expect 50/50 custody and a less favorable financial outcome from the divorce. DV doesn’t have to be physical only to be taken seriously but you have to be more diligent about collecting evidence of mistreatment. Texts, recordings, etc. 

What you can do to help: ask her what she needs. Everyone needs emotional support but victims differ in what their priorities and hurdles are."	flowertrain678	reply	na	na	na	0.9992372989654541	no	no	no	na	domesticviolence	failed

"I took my daughter to a therapist. I was worrying about custody. My daughter’s father wasn’t abusive to me, this was before I married my abuser. Her father was a drug addict and made our home scary (stole rent money, scary people coming to our door, the effects of hard drugs on his thinking, rarely physical and always loving, he was an addict but he had a heart of gold)

The therapist told me I should 100% take custody (which I did and he told the judge it was probably best). 

Long story short, the therapist told me that one good parent is better than two mediocre parents. Children need to know they have a rock. You can’t be a rock for your children while cowering in fear. While you don’t see what he’s doing to you as abusive to them, I promise you it is. He’s damaging their lifeboat (you), that’s abuse."

on july 3rd we got into an altercation. i was in the kitchen washing the dishes, we were arguing but i kept a calm voice however he came from the living room to the kitchen and pushed his face into mine screaming. i’m (17F) 4’10 80 pounds and he’s abt 5’8 130 so i was intimidated. he does his often but he’s never touched my face which this time he did, i reacted and pushed the side of his neck so he’d get away from me. he then grabbed me and slammed me repeatedly on the ground while i fought back, he then carried me to the couch where he showed he was recording me and he rolled me over and slapped my back after he ended the video. 

the cops showed up to my friends house where i was staying for my own safety and basically told me it was my fault and i should’ve stopped talking. i was calling my dad out on the fact he has no job and my mom is struggling right now which apparently offended him so bad he felt the need to come across the house at me. we have a good sized house so he came over 12 feet to reach me. i was told that even tho his face touched mine first i still touched him first??   

is this my fault? i know deep down it’s not but why did the cop tell me this. i’ve had a hard time coping this time, this has happened since i was 8 but this was the second time the cops were called.  my mom doesnt defend me or stand up for me and i am an only child. i’m homeschooled and constantly around him. 

i really feel like giving up because i don’t see an escape. i have no college fund because my dad constantly needs money from my mom, everything is on him bc my mom can’t see through his manipulation. the only dream i’ve ever had was to go to college and prove i can be something.

If not I would try to keep things civil with him and not cause any fights because you know where it’s going to end up now especially since the violence door is already open.

"Hi, I'm going to write it here so if others search this question they can read this too. 

I'm sorry you're very tired, I felt very tired at the time I filed my PO too. Take care if yourself first and foremost. Eat something, drink water, catch a quick nap. 

Your local DV shelter can help you fill your forms out, just FYI. Sometimes knowing you're in a safe location and change of scenery helps you focus.

You will likely need two packets you will fill out every page in both. Your state should have a website so trying search ""[STATE] court forms"" and those packets are Temporary Protection Order Ex Parte and Permanent Protection Order. The temporary order ex parte means when you file both packets at the same time the ex parte will be reviewed by a judge within 24 hours, and your ex will not be notified unless the judge decides a temporary order is necessary. Law enforcement will serve the temporary order at that time. 

So, with the temporary order you need to attach any and all evidence you have to back up claims that you make in the packet. Make copies, because you will also attach it to the permanent packet. Evidence can be texts, transcripts of voice or video recordings, statements from witnesses that are notarized, pictures, police statements, and video and voice recordings can be submitted by flash drive. You do not have to have evidence for all the claims you make but it helps. 

When you describe why you are asking for a PO give at least three examples of illegal behavior. It shows it's a pattern unlikely to end without intervention. You also need to make sure you describe why you feel intimidated, threatened or endangered.

Fill out everything. Take it to your county's district court if you are unmarried and superior court if you are married. The clerk will let you know if anything is filled out wrong but they cannot give you legal advice.

The temporary order will be decided without you or your partner present so make sure you thoroughly describe what has happened.

If an order is granted you will get a court date in about two weeks. You have to appear and you have to present your case before a judge in order to get a permanent order. For mine I wrote a detailed script in chronological order from most recent to least recent event. I provided a fuller picture of my marriage and explained why I felt the order was necessary to protect me. Whenever I had evidence which was being spoken about I referred to it as an exhibit A, exibit B etc.  You can also call witnesses.

Your ex will get a turn to testify. You need to stare straight ahead and no matter how wild the lies are, how much they push your buttons DO NOT REACT. Take notes of the lies and think of responses to those lies. You will get a turn to respond to their testimony. They get one more chance to respond and then the judge will deliberate and hand down an order or deny your motion.

If you have additional questions you can PM me."	cinnabunni95	reply	na	na	na	0.9987583160400391	strong	strong	no	na	domesticviolence	failed

Ask the shelter if they are connected to a thrift store. Usually, donations that people give to thrift stores, those profits from selling them go to charities - oftentimes womens shelters. The shelter you’re in may have vouchers for you, or may give you a letter of confirmation of stay, to let you “shop” for some clothes at their affiliated thrift store.

"Dad deported, trying to come back tonight.

Hi,
(19F) I’m not sure how to start this off, but I’m honestly looking for advice/clarity as I can’t think logically at the moment and I’m sick to my stomach.

TLDR; My dad, alcoholic, narcissistic and abusive, was arrested after a physical altercation with my mom (who’s inevitably trauma bonded to him) a couple months back, which, after a series of events, led to him being deported out of our country (U.S). He’s planned to come back tonight and I don’t know if I should accept it, or have him caught and guarantee he’ll be out of my mom’s and younger brother’s life permanently. 

He’s been gone since this February, and my mom has been trying to find ways to bring him back legally since then, however it seems they lost the chance of that, as I’ve just recently found out yesterday that he’s being arranged to cross the border back illegally tonight. 
My mom and a family friend are both aiding in this, and these last few *hours they’ve started to bring back all of his belongings and car that he had in his home country, and seeing that alone is making my heart drop.

My younger brother (13M) and I have both dreaded thinking about this possibility, and now that the moment is here, I’m not sure what I should do. I’m already an adult who can leave and continue my life away from my parents, but it breaks my heart a thousand times thinking about leaving my little brother alone with them, after he’s begged both my mom an innumerable amount of times to get him out of their/our live. Inevitably, she’s been trauma bonded to this man for over twenty years, and thus she literally can’t fathom not having him in her life. But both her side of the family, as well as my dad’s, have pushed her to leave him for the last decade. 
There’s essentially no way she’s going to leave him ever, and I feel like, at this moment, I’m the only one who can do something to finally keep him out of her/our lives. 

There’s only a few hours until he’s “scheduled” to cross back illegally, and a part of me has accepted that it’s over and too late, but the greater part of me is thinking about pulling something idiotic so that he’ll get caught and can truly never come back. It sounds so fucked, but that exact scenario has been imagined by my mom’s closest family and my mom herself. 
Forgot to add: He had actually already tried to cross back illegally a few months back, in which he was caught and locked in a detention center. I don’t know if that’s a sign from the universe, but all odds have been against my dad since he was deported. 

I don’t know what to do, but all I know is that everything’s going to return to hell in every aspect of life for not only my mom, but my little brother too, and she can’t do anything about it because she’s psychologically bonded to him."	x4rces	post	18.569870704825654	female	White	0.9951618313789368	na	na	na	11	domesticviolence	ethnicity: no prediction, age: 19, gender: female, explanation: the author explicitly states their age and gender in the post (19f). however, there are no specific details in the text that provide clear indications of the author's ethnicity.
I can't tell you what to do because this is a heavy situation for a lot of reasons, but personally I was married to a violent narcissist for 18 years.

It's a very dangerous time because he is losing control. You and your family are at great risk of being physically harmed or murdered so he can maintain control.

"Hi, so I see this was written a number of hours ago, so I hope you are OK.

I hope you had the courage to report him before he got to you and that this has played out as you would hope for it to. Keeping your whole family safe.

If your Dad has made it to your home again.
Like others have said, we can never tell you what to do, it is such a difficult situation.
But, you've heard all the potential risks, and the increased risk of his emotional state in this situation.
Your brother is a child and need to be protected. Your mother can make her own, unwise decisions about her relationship, and we shouldn't really step in to mess with her choices.
That is, until she puts others at risk with those decisions, which she is doing with your brother. I believe you have a duty of care to your brother to report that your Dad is back, if he makes it back.
You chose the best way of doing that Social Services, immigration, the police...

But remember, you need to keep your brother safe, as a child he relies on the adults around him to keep him safe. Your mum is clearly making unwise decisions due the complex nature of the relationship she has with your Dad. So you need to step in and make sure your brother is safe.

You wouldn't want to regret not having done anything.

"I am so sorry to hear that! It is such a horrible thing for not only your Mum to go through but also for you and your brother to endure as well. I am sure she understands deep down that it is wrong but it is hard to see when you are in it sometimes, especially if she is used to the abuse. 

Every victim always says that their advice would be to trust your gut, if you don't feel good about something it is for a reason! One woman on average dies every week in Australia from domestic violence and I personally know someone who was murdered by their partner. It is definitely something that happens and happens quite often, I understand that you can't control everything and sometimes your Mum might not want to take your fears on board but it is worth preparing yourself and having a safety plan in place. 

You may be able to buy pepper spray from somewhere and be prepared to call the police and get out of the house fast if needed. 

If you have the option to report your Dad before he comes over I would reccomend it, especially if it means he won't be able to get to you guys again (to ensure you are all safe if you do provoke him).

Definitely— once I realized that my mom mentally won’t ever be able to leave him, because his abuse is so normal to her, I started considering that I’d have to be the one to make the decision of protecting ourselves. My brother and I both read this, and thank you beyond words— it felt comforting knowing that I’m not overreacting or thinking illogically in wanting to have him permanently banned from coming back.

"I had posted yesterday that an astrologer told me my husband may do extreme physical violence and if I leave him I may get cancer. I will explain this little more. When without him that is if I leave him I have to take some antidepressants like medicines not exactly antidepressants but similar medicines which have cancer as side effect possibility. There is no other medicine I can take. With him I can be okay with less medicine so cancer risk is less , still there but less.  Looking at my blood reports and levels of certain chemicals in my body my psychiatrist told me that my medicine can cause cancer in me with my dose. With him I feel less lonely and my dose is low. I am not able to do anything about this other than take medicine.

"First, please understand that cancer is a very common condition and you may end up with some form or another of it even if you stay with your spouse. 

Second, just because something is listed as a potential side effect for a medication doesn’t make it a common side effect for it. Those lists are disclaimers written by attorneys to help minimize a costly financial liability for the manufacturer. They’re not a guarantee that something will or won’t happen. They frequently list very rare complications or side effects simply so the attorneys for the company can point to it in the event of a lawsuit and say that the consumer was warned.

It is so very difficult to convey that men can also be victims of DV. Hang in there. Step 1 is to write everything down.  Don't trust your memory when it comes to this. Then go talk to a lawyer. Many states have standing orders in divorce cases, one of which not being able to move out of state. Apply for a protective order, file for divorce, ask for primary use of the residence as she abandoned it and request custody of the kids on the basis that school is starting back up soon and they need stability, not a new environment.

if you're not pressing charges please consider a restraining order, the likelihood that an abuser will claim to be the abused is very high and you may need something to protect yourself from further abuse or legal issues.  I filed for a one year order against mine, and was warned mine would either deny the abuse, say he was the victim, or try to justify why he did what he did - mine did all three, in court, lying up and down in front of a judge and saying he was afraid of ME.

My 2 cents, no happy marriage ends in divorce, any further pressing just deflect if you don’t want to talk about it. Maybe something along the lines of, it was toxic and became unrepairable.

"I could tell you what I said after my divorce. I could share all my embarrassment and shame, but I no longer have it. I could share the years of therapy to overcome the self blame. 

What I would recommend instead is to share what you are comfortable with. If you don't want to share, don't. 

I would also recommend a deep look into the question itself. Why would anyone think a person who has divorced from an abusive relationship and make their life safer ""low value""?

And if they do - what does it say about them and their ability to have empathy? I do not allow those people access to my life anymore. 

You are not ""low value"". You were abused. You didn't ""put up"" with it - you are now divorced. And alternatively people who stay are not ""low value"" or ""put up"" with it.

"I can really relate to your question.
I also fear that people think that I don't have good values/didn't take my vows seriously because I am divorced (I had someone say this).
That people assume that since it was a domestic abuse situation that all of the stereotypes are true: I am stupid/to blame/stayed too long
That I am not over it.
That I say the wrong things.
That it couldn't be true because he is so mild mannered and helpful. (You wouldn't believe that all of our friends believe his lies and hate me).

I agree with another comment about how abusers would weaponize the information if you told them.

One thing I noticed is that the ex didn't really have follow up questions. It became clear that he was fishing for dirt but he never showed a normal level of interest in me or my life experience. That's why I think the idea shared here to just tell a little bit at a time is good.

 They are all different, so I am not sure if there's a clear test, but a friend once said that anyone explaining their behavior is a red flag.

"I can also relate to this question. I ended a “starter” marriage a few years before I met the abuser I later married. In between the two, I was raped in a car by someone who came on to me very strongly in a bar. 

I shared that very private story in the early stages of getting to know my abuser. It was a long distance relationship, and admittedly I overshared a lot too early. I kept looking for a “deal breaker” because I didn’t want to waste my time with someone, and then find out much later that we weren’t right for each other. 

Before the first marriage, I was raped by a VP at a corporate retreat. I was only five years out of college, and had no idea how to handle what he called a “strong attraction”. 

After the emotional and verbal abuse started in marriage #2, my abuser degraded me with the label “damaged goods”. 20 years later, I could clearly see that he was manipulating me by the way he responded to my early disclosure of the first rape. 

He wasn’t empathetic, he just acted “ surprised”.  He did ask how many people knew this about me; the answer was very few. I reported it to the police who came to my parents house (where I was staying) at 2am, and I woke them up to explain (in the dark) that I was OK and they shouldn’t worry, but there was a policeman at the house and I had to go to the hospital. 

Just like someone else said, I don’t remember my abuser asking any other follow-up questions, and he didn’t seem to know what to say. I dismissed his behavior as not wanting to intrude on my privacy. That was in contrast to my first ex, who was 200% there for me and showed his sorrow and concern in every possible way, when I told him about it a few weeks later; and again, that was a few years before meeting the narcissist who I later married. 

There were red flags early on including his response to the first rape story, and then again when I told him about rape #2. He loved referring to me as Damaged Goods, claiming I was lucky he married me because no one else wanted me. 

FULL DISCLOSURE. I have a TBI thanks to the abuser, and have had ongoing cognitive issues with working memory. I’m 65, and this happened over s year ago. 

Re-reading this before posting, I’m sorry (and sad) to realize I have mixed up the facts as to which rape happened first. I don’t have the brain power to fix this easily, so I’m posting as is. 

I have a good lawyer and a great team of doctors and therapists who are very encouraging that I will get better. I can think and write well, it just takes 2-3x longer than “before”. Speech problems are more difficult to hide, but my closest friends can overlook the stuttering (or pretend they don’t notice). 

One day at a time, I’m continuing to put my new life together. I have no desire to marry again (or even date) but this same question is considered with every new person I meet."	chirp20	reply	na	na	na	0.9989957213401794	no	strong	no	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.

Most people are respectful enough to back off at that point, and if they're not, you'll have to decide whether you want someone who will push for that kind of info in the early stages of a relationship.

"I grew up watching my dad constantly abuse both physically and verbally my mom. My younger siblings either weren't born yet or were infants so they didn't have to see much of the abuse, during my pre-teen to adulthood he pretty much stopped overall minus the occasional spat here or there. This past year my dad is slowly going back to that piece of shit side, (even though I knew it had never truly left). 

He is constantly hovering over my mom. She will be sitting in the dining room watching a tv show or youtube video and my dad will always be asking ""what are you doing on there?"" or ""who are you messaging?"". I can go on with phrases he asks but then this post would never end. 

Basically my dad is the problem here but whenever my parents argue they just go back to normal like nothing happened the next day. We just have a giant elephant in the room constantly. Their constant arguing and passive aggressiveness makes me frustrated and uncomfortable to live with them anymore. 

I want to move out within the next year as my younger siblings are moving out for school around the same time. The problem with moving out is what happens to my mom?

"I (35f) left my husband (31m) 2 months ago. He was emotionally and verbally abusive. He makes threats and tries to intimidate me by throwing and breaking things and getting in my face. I took our 11 month old baby girl with me, packed up our stuff while he was working and moved to my mom's. He was of course livid when he came home to find us gone. He tried calling the cops on me, threatened to take legal action, called me names, yelled at me, and said he hopes I get in a car accident. 

Don't get me wrong, it's definitely easier with him not trying to reel me back in, but I'm a little confused. Everything I've read about abuse tells me that there's this period of love bombing that happens to suck the victim back in when they try to leave. If anything, he's just pushing me away further. He comes here to see our daughter and we don't speak to each other unless it's about her. It's definitely awkward. On the phone when we have to speak about something he's still being controlling and trying to tell me what to do and when to do it. He hasn't taken any legal/court action like he said he would. I'm just so confused as to why he's still acting like the same abusive person he was before and not at least trying to manipulate me to get me back. Even in front of my family he was being disrespectful to me and when they  came to intervene he said, ""Ill talk to my wife however I want."" 

Sometimes he will say thank you or be nice about something and I start to wonder if he's changing, but then the next minute he's trying to control me and I get thrown off. I don't know what to expect from him. 

Has anyone experienced this before? It makes me wonder if maybe it really was my fault for the way he treated me. I must have been so bad that even an abuser doesn't want me.

">It makes me wonder if maybe it really was my fault for the way he  treated me. I must have been so bad that even an abuser doesn't want me.

No no no no - don't fall for that, it's what he wants. Love-bombing is common but it's not absolute. The doubt you're feeling is exactly what he's trying to create. Abusers love to isolate their victims and make them emotionally dependent. By acting like he doesn't care, he's trying to control the breakup and make you feel vulnerable. It's a very subtle form of gaslighting.

Abusers only want a relationship with you on THEIR terms - he's trying to manipulate you into coming back to those terms. Don't let him.

EDIT: also, file for custody immediately - he can call the police all he wants, you're the child's parent so you haven't done anything wrong by leaving, but get the abuse documented ASAP and file for **sole** custody."

i resonate with your post. i have been through this with my ex. when i left he was the same way…i also felt that i was so bad that even an abuser didn’t want me. then a couple weeks or a month went by then suddenly he was love bombing me. within the past few months it turned into a cycle of hating me then trying to be “respectful” for our child then love bombing me again. i hate to say it, but you’re just at the start of all of it and i wish you strength!! none of this is your fault.

"Right now when you've first left you're deep in FOG (Fear Obligation Guilt). You know ECACTLY why you've left and what tipped you over the edge but you haven't yet articulated his predictable pattern of behaviour. But you will. You need to go through a process of unravelling the attachment. You could be a securely attached person like I was or you could be anxious attached and wondering why he's abandoned you. Either way you need to start what's referred to as intensive psychoeducation to make sense of what happens because you're trying to make sense of nonsense he has created to traumatise your brain. Focus on your safety. He will use your child to try to get to you in this post separation stage so you simply need an adaptable safety plan. Don't be a sitting duck. Have a grab bag for you and babe and get to a car if you have access to one.

Next is to try to create peace in your life. He's built a web of BS and you need to learn to unhook each anchor of his web to remove his control of you.

He is absolutely blaming you for his behaviour. All men do. It's what they do to avoid facing the shame of what they've done. If we start carrying their shame then the love bombing starts but they still know EXACTLY what they've done. The create ambiguity via DARVO.

Deny = calling the cops to make official allegations
Attack = saying he hopes you're in an accident
Reverse Victim Offender Roles = legal action and systems abuse via cops and courts.

 Look at the Duluth abuse wheels and there's one for DV and also post separation violence. You need to stop looking to him go solve your response. He's going to continue to be a violent jerk with or without you because that's who he is; it's got NOTHING to do with you and anything you've done and it's NOT your fault. Hopefully he settles down once he knows you're not going to seek him out, you're serious about not trying to seek answers/resolution from him and you are moving on with your life separate to him.  

He's already had you in his cycle of violence but you're out, you're free. He knows he's crossed every possible boundary you have and that you mean business because you've gone. Give him time to cool off and don't reach out. I did because it's normal to try to maintain the parenting relationship but most men who carry on like this don't want it until a new girlfriend arrives.

With time you'll be able to break down his behaviour into more predictable patterns but right now remember you're deep in FOG.

"I can empathise with your situation, I was in a very abusive relationship for 5 years. One night I was sobbing, he started trying to say that I was doing this to manipulate him into staying with me and without thinking I snapped saying ""no, I want you to leave. There's nothing I want more. Every night I think to myself that if I don't get out soon I'll have to kill myself if you don't first"". I expected him to blow up more but it kind of stopped him. I realised that I might have an opportunity to leave without too much bother and I did. We had separated before but he would love bomb me and I'd come back, this time it stuck because he didn't even try. I did everything in my power to make the breakup go quietly and for the most part it did. Ill never really know why that worked, and I've thought about it a lot, but he had been cheating for most of our relationship and I think he had basically been in a relationship with another girl behind my back for a year, so when he got a sense I was actually going to leave he just thought he would be better off investing his energy in the newer, younger girl. 

To go from that, constantly fretting and consumed with thoughts on how you want to leave and feel incapable, to suddenly being out of the situation without having to try much, it's really hard. Of course you go through what most people do when they are out, despite the relief you struggle to adjust, you're still dealing with trauma, you don't know how to live without the fear and anxiety. But you are also second guessing constantly. After all he put me through why did he just let me walk? Does he know what he did was wrong? Did I do something wrong? Is this all a trick? Have I blown this all out of proportion? It messes with your brain. 

Here's the advice I will give you: talk to someone about what happened if you aren't already. Counselling, confide in a friend, group support. You don't need to tell them everything, but when you tell other people things that happened and they tell you that you were right to be scared it will help you start to let go of those self blaming thoughts and allows you to deal with it. 

Yes, there are patterns and behaviours that always occur with abuse. But no 2 instances are the same. No 2 abusers are exactly the same in their methods. Don't see this as growth from him, and honestly you don't know what his motivations are. Maybe a family member has threatened to cut him off unless he does what's right by his kids. Maybe he sees that in terms of getting to see his child at all this is the most tactical move. Maybe he has decided that you've left and there's not much he can do, so he will move on to someone else. Maybe he is hoping this will mess with your head or win you back.

"Abusers use a lot of tactics. Him not using love bombing right now is not a sign that he is not really an abuser. They also do the discard. They start showing how kind and helpful they are and how much you really need them, especially because somehow you got confused and think they were abusive. They lose their temper and blame you. Etc. 

There's a lot to learn about what they do, and I highly recommend going to a DV agency and getting help. They can help you prioritize tasks. Especially since you are dealing with custody.

Best education on the topic is Why Does He Do That by Lundy Bancroft. Free audiobook on hoopla (Library app if your local library offers hoopla). 

I also found YouTube videos on narcissists to be really helpful. Dr Ramani is good. 

I waited for the ex to ask for a divorce because I had a gut instinct that he was going to do that and if I made the first move, it would enrage him. Although he was never violent, I trusted my instincts. Statistics say that your gut instinct is the best predictor of what he is capable of. Not past actions, experts, or statistics. You. You know him better than anyone. 

Yes, my instincts were right. Although he was appeased to be the one ending the marriage, he also started stalking me right away and for over 3.5 years.

What you mentioned about his motivations for seeing his daughter are things I have wondered about. Before I left, his family didn't think he would fight for custody.  I almost wonder if he's mainly around still because of what his family would think if he wasn't in her life. Or maybe it's a way for him to hang on to me.

I have heard this before, maybe even in that book. It's something I've really had to remember and trust my instinct on. The day I left, I didn't say a word.

"when i first started trying to understand what i was going through i was confused about the same thing, i had taken psych classes and skimmed pamplets in the past and they always talked about the ""cycle of abuse"" and there was no such thing in my situation.  Other than the first time he hit me the abuse was never discussed again, there was no apology (not for the first time either), there was no love bombing, the ""honeymoon"" phase was simply a short time period in which I was less likely to get hit.  Nothing I did to try to make things better mattered and my perspective of ""better"" was completely unhinged.  This is one of the things that kept me from leaving early in the year like I'd planned -  I would cling to any glimmer of hope that he'd changed, it was what was I was waiting for, and if you look for something sometimes you will find it.  It was promising, in my mind, that he didn't hit me between Dec. and March and it was only a few shoulder punches.  In April he slapped the kid and I confronted him about it and while he doubled down on how what he did was ok, he actually seemed near-pleasant (in my mind) following that, he even apologized for being an ass about something once which was rare form. And then beat the crap out of me in June and physically endangered our son and I finally ended it.  

He had *everything* to lose here, he complained to the court that I had forced him into homelessness (and that i abused him, and was a danger to our child, and all sorts of other crap) and that I left him with a gas guzzling vehicle (that I own)..  

In the moments between him finding me not at home and him getting served with the protective order I got a series of texts in which he was *still* not apologetic, the closest he came was to say he was ""sorry he was mean to me"", in between rationalizations about the state of the world and video games making him violent... 

you are not the problem here, somewhere he knows that this reaction was going to throw you off so he's running with it, if he thought tears would work he'd try tears, if he thought screaming would work he'd try that, if he thought filing divorce would actually punish you then he probably would.

You bring up a really good point. I think he knows that his tears wouldn't work on me, so he doesn't want to give me that satisfaction.

"I understand where you're coming from. It took me many years to even tell someone. It's so hard, but talking to someone you trust can help you feel a little less lonely and gain some clarity, even if it's not someone you know personally like a counselor. 

I remember those moments so clearly. Being isolated to the bedroom all morning, all night, barely coming out to eat, and he never cared. I felt like I was withering away, and no one cared. It was such a dark time. My birthday, holidays, and special moments would pass by like just another day. I would just cry alone in the bed while he played his video games online with friends. Family would call and I would pretend everything was fine. Not talking to somebody and keeping it to yourself and feeling isolated is a dangerous thing. 

Your daughter deserves to have a happy and healthy mama. You have to take care of yourself emotionally, physically, etc in order to take care of your little girl.

"The early years were a tough slog. You're between a rock and a hard place but you have this time to learn the evidence base. You need to reprogram everything you think you know about this, about society and our laws. Police and courts won't help you. I don't mean to stop reporting. I've been raging against the machine all week again. It means they won't listen to protective parents and choose to punish us to protect systemic brutality and force us to navigate this alone.

 Don't underestimate what I'm saying. I was separated and had kicked him out, packed up his stuff and changed the locks. I couldn't get him to legally separate so he could legitimately break into my home and sleep in my bed. Separation in my jurisdiction in Australia means parenting agreement and property settlement and men hold women, children and property hostage. Violent men refuse to negotiate because what's mine is mine and what's yours is mine too is their thinking. There is no legal way to navigate the early years but there is a right way.

It's common for violent men to refuse fair and equitable property settlement and it's common for them to go to extraordinary lengths to avoid safe parenting.

Look up the Duluth wheel of post separation violence. I'm still struggling with young children. There are family law implications for divorce in Australia and until he repartnered and had a good lawyer there was nothing me and my supports could do to get him to shift toward legal separation and divorce. He had a clearly articulated plan for total destruction and still does.

Once he repartnered it meant there was a team of women collaborating to push him across the line and he refused and fought every single step. He was trying to prove himself worthy of another woman but also asserting his insane control.

The day he agreed to settlement there were 5 women driving to make it happen plus what I had termed my army of aunts behind me. He was trying to prove himself worthy of another woman but he's not worthy of any woman; he's simply a very good actor with ill intent.

My children can't be protected but poverty makes it infinitely more difficult. He destroyed jointly owned assets and stole things I'd considered valuable.

I was advised early on to stay put of courts. I've been through 3 courts in multiple jurisdictions. I understand the laws around my rights and how social structures deny my access to them. Get yourself knowledgeable about what you're involved in. Get your education on how to stay safe, defend yourself and your child from risks and threats and somehow try to focus on your peace. A happy mum is a well raised child. Try the circle of security course if you haven't done it; it's the foundation of EVERYTHING. Learn about parallel parenting. You're doing everything well but will be undermined at every turn because of your genitals and the word mother. Do not underestimate the power of truth.

"Leaving. I need support.

I am leaving my 3-4 year relationship this Sunday. I need as much support and grounding as I can get. 
We fell in love very hard, specially me, I got obsessed and basically we trauma bonded deeply. I pushed the relationship a lot for us to live together while I worked in the US (he’s from there) , cause I originally live in Mexico. He was reluctant because of his past relationship issues but we started living together. 
So my issues is that Im obsessive, at least was, clingy, moody, I hallucinate and during our initial period I was undiagnosed and untreated. My “sins” include miscommunication of my feelings, splitting on him, emotional triangulation, and having my head on the clouds a lot. I frustrated him a lot. He had patience at first but kinda quickly started with intense yelling, which led me to fear and trying to over explain myself, which led to more yelling and more insults and a terrible cycle. Then we were good, after I had to take all the blame. After we were good, I tried to bring up the root issue once more thinking we could speak it calmly, but no… this led to more yelling, worse name calling, me splitting and crying or isolating, which made him madder. I realized I wasn’t at all what he expected but I had already insisted on us being together which was a hassle and a risk economically speaking, that I felt guilt, and I stayed. Im stubborn and tried bringing up my issues with him million times, the cycle just got worse… his reactions were unproportionate… I excused it with him having Autism, and blaming it all on me once again. My property like my lap, cellphone, clothes were destroyed by him. He grabbed me on my face or shoulders and shook me, he screamed at the top of his lungs, and called me nasty names. He once pushed me to the floor by the neck, he once said if I was a guy he would’ve already fought me. And he always felt justified, like I deserve it, that if I wouldn’t bother him, he would’ve not done that. And I stayed cause I wondered what if that’s true. But now I leave because he reacted like he usually does over something that I didn’t cause or was part of, then it hit me like bricks… he has had this reactions from before he met me, his mom has mentioned it. His mental illnesses are also untreated up to this day… we were never ready to be on a relationship with each other. The whole thing turned abusive because of our trauma and our toxic expectations. We were doing “fine” and I booked tickets to the US to “come visit his family”… im here now… but only I have a return ticket. I planned it all out, im staying with a friend and on Sunday I will let him know to read a letter I left him. I cannot tell him in person cause of his reactions. I feel guilt and shame. He will have to start his life from 0 on a state in the US where the cost of living is so high, he has no job, I paid for everything."

Do you have BPD? Is your abuser also your FP? You didn’t specifically say that but the terms you’re using like “splitting” make me wonder that. I have BPD and it’s so easy to bond to an abuser because of it. Remind yourself constantly that feelings aren’t facts. Someone who loves and respects you wouldn’t treat you this way. He’s not going to push you to the floor. He’s not going to call you nasty names. It’s easy to blame yourself if you have mental health issues yourself and haven’t been perfect in the relationship. But here’s the reality - if you were that bad (and to be clear - I’m not saying you are), a healthy man would walk away from you, not emotionally and physically abuse you. He isn’t the one.

I am recently married. An astrologer told me there is high chance that husband could be physically violent. He said there is good chance of extreme violence. His other unique predictions have come true for me. He has got 3 big awards. Other things he told me about husband that he would be dominating has come true. But if I leave my husband chances are I might get cancer for some particular reason as I have to take some antidepressants like pills which have cancer as side effects which cannot be changed which is hard to explain. With him too I may get cancer but there maybe less chance. With him less medicine I can take. Husband had mentioned once he has rage about certain external issue. Astrologer also done some deeper level prediction that brain won't be injured or the injury would be healable. But some say such deep level predictions cannot be done. 2 other astrolgers too said he could be violent.  I feel if I stay with him then from extreme violence I could get serious injury or even die.

"I've posted before about my ex. We were together for a year. During this time he was not physically abusive but was possibly sexually and he was very manipulative. He often put me down but in ways that were subtle ""e.g. my friends think you're really unnattractive but dw I like you"". He'd talk a lot about how I was hitting 30 soon and men didn't like women over 30 or how he would always take care of me (I'm diabetic) but no other guy would because it was too much to handle. He also seemed to be surrounded by people who loathed me for absolutely no reason to an extreme level and I never understood what I'd done to upset them and was never allowed to talk to them about it. It made me feel really insecure and like everyone hated me. He'd escalate fights often and would break up with me brutally, saying how I'd never see him again and he'd move house / change jobs so I wouldn't be able to ever talk to him ever again, even after a really nice day, and so I'd end up begging for him back because my abandonment issues would be so badly triggered. 

Towards the end I finally tried to leave for good and he threatened to kill himself,  taking steroids and experimental substances and if I ever upset him or even left him alone for more than an hour he'd tell me how he would take them if I left him alone. He'd talk about how theyd give him heart palpitations etc. Everything was somehow about me and keeping me and trying to get me to take him back. He was almost obsessive. I was in constant fight or flight,  terrified he was gonna kill himself. This went on for two months straight.

 He'd tell me in detail how he would kill himself, how I wouldn't find his body how he'd make sure I still thought he was alive or how I would always wonder if he was dead because hed delete himself from all social media etc.  He'd drink straight vodka and if I didnt stay up all night or miss work to drink with him he'd down the whole bottle and take pills with it. Somehow he did this whilst not missing work whilst I almost lost my job because I missed so much work to try and keep him alive. I was the only one other than his best friend who knew he was ""suicidal "" and he said if we tod anyone he'd kill himself straight away. He set dates on when he would die, then act normally while I would be having panic attacks next to him. If I wasn't panicking he'd talk about his body decomposing, till I was. I even went abroad with him because he saud he'd kill himself there. 

Eventually one day we argued and he walked out saying he was now going to kill himself because of me, he punished me by pretending to kill himself while on the phone with me, I had to call the police and ambulance and he got sectioned for 12 hours and released. He told me over and over how this was all my fault for not loving him enough and how I didnt deserve love and I would drive any man to suicide by being with them. He shouted a lot of very hurtful things at me a lot.

After that I blocked him so he got his sister to message me. I'd get messages saying he was going to die today, what did you do / come right now etc. This did work once and I came to the house in a panic to find him completely fine, we argued and he got so angry. It was just me and him there and I was scared. He was stood near the door and I felt I couldn't leave (I don't think he realised) and kept changing from being really angry and agressive to demanding a hug etc and I was backed into a wall seeing this new person in front of me. I was scared to say no to the hug and to be honest about my feelings. When I said he was scaring me he said i was just playing the victim.

 He also revealed that a lot of his time with me had been lies / an act. (E.g
 He was heavily in debt, his funny stories that made me like him when we met were not real, he'd taken pills off the Internet to increase his sex drive (and twice hed penetrated me thinking I was awake after Id fallen asleep) and had apparently been undee the influence of these pills at the time.

I didnt see him again, this was just over a year ago. For months after this I thought he had gone through with his threat and killed himself and about 6 months ago I saw he was back on social media and doing well, so clearly alive. 

The other day he messaged me this:

Him ""Hey how are you, l've been thinking about you lately maybe we should catch up soon?x""

Me ""Hey, sorry l don't have this number saved.Who is this?""

Him ""It's NAME, I've got a new number l miss
you""

I blocked him but since then I've been shaking and having panic attacks, crying all the time and really jumpy. I feel terrified. I keep thinking he's gonna come in the house (even though I've moved house) and attack me or my partner. I worry he's gonna threaten himself or me. He's never threatened me before so idk why Im so scared but I just feel unsafe. 

My current partner has been really supportive but he says he doesnt get why Im so upset and after a year  why I haven't moved on yet. He and my friend thinks it's a big overreaction on my part, I'm not in any danger and it was just a text. Like I'm just overreacting. 

I dont know how to stop feeling this way or if its normal to feel this way after a text like this and experience like mine? And if it is normal,  how do I explain that to my current partner?

TL:DR

Ex messaged me a year on and I'm having panic attacks and am terrified,  is this normal?"	betteringmylife123	post	16.903511644789447	female	White	0.9628863334655762	na	na	na	1	domesticviolence	no prediction.
yes it's normal for someone who was traumatised by this man. is there someone with training and experience you can see? not that it's not normal just so you can work through it. somehow i think your people should be made to hear you on that he's a danger to your health and wellbeing because you really don't need more trauma or to let them be taken in by him or his sister somehow. like you can work on yourself and work on trying to stay safe from him because it's very real.	betteringmylife123	reply	na	na	na	0.9628863334655762	weak	no	strong	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.
"Hi everyone, just looking for a little insight if possible. This will be a bit long so I would really appreciate if some of you could read all the way through

I’m (27F) a survivor of DV. Most of it was emotional, mental, and sexual abuse. I left my abuser about 5-6 years ago and I am married to the man of my dreams(25M). 

I have a problem with saying how I feel when I feel it and I end up keeping everything in until the most inconvenient moment, since I wasn’t really allowed to voice my opinion in my last relationship. My husband has a problem with that and he doesn’t understand and last night he said I was retreating to my “old ways” I tried to tell him I’m still healing and it’s so fucking hard for me. The issue I brought up was that he doesn’t hug me anymore like he used too & I felt if I brought it up he would think I was weird because of it. We don’t fight, but we do disagree but we never let it get to a blow up because I can’t handle that. 

FF to today and he sent me a tiktok about how kids are struggling to pay for things and aren’t paid a livable wage and I told him I hope it gets better for when our future kids grow up they don’t have to deal with these struggles. I guess I was wrong to say that because he told me that was not was he was referring too and that he doesn’t care about other kids we don’t have right now.

Now im internally freaking out because his one thing he says is that I don’t listen to him but I do, I just have really bad memory issues and I forget a lot of things sometimes. 

How long until I can feel normal again? Why does healing take so fucking long, im over all of this shit at this point. I have to try my hardest just to not get offended because of something my husband says when he’s joking around.

Am I being over dramatic?

"I'm in the team that says your husband's response is a problem. 

This comment about you retreating to old ways is bs, to be frank. I thought your take on the tiktok was thoughtful and kind.
Your response and freaking out internally makes me think that it is not just the bad past relationship but also the current relationship.

 Because here's the thing: I never would have put you down for that comment. I never would be impatient with the effects of your past experiences. A kind, loving person would say, oh I didn't think of that, can you tell me more? Or would smile gently and say, wow, you are thinking about having kids and hoping for their happiness? That is really beautiful.

The fact that he got irritated that you didn't see things the way he thought just honestly reminds me of the ex. He once got mad at me early in our relationship because I didn't know what his random hand movements meant when we were walking and holding hands. As if we had developed a complex navigation system together for crowded sidewalks and I failed to remember the system. In his head I had blown it. There was no developed system, just him assuming that I could read his mind and do what he wanted. As if that was possible.

"After exposure to abuse especially as a young child it's very difficult to put into words what happened to you.  Let alone be able to discuss and explain to other people AND MOST IMPORTANTLY OUR SIGNIFICANT OTHERS.

Abuse literally changes the brain and rewiring our default patterns takes time. For some its a lifelong journey.   I would kindly explain to him sending you a tiktok to ""send"" messages about snapping out of it is useless and honestly can set people back by adding pressure making your healing much worse!

"I asked about my problems in another subreddit then panicked because of the attention it was getting. I have been married for a while. We had problems after the first few years. Couples counseling helped some. We know how to talk better now. I don’t like sex because it hurts, he does so I compromise. That was another thing I was told I should do in counseling. My job has me travel sometimes, that makes him nervous, and when I was away he tested me. He sent 2 friends to check on me, they might have drugged me and had sex. 

I understand from the comments on the last post that most of this is rape. My Dr told me I’m being abused. I was getting tests for pelvis problems but also want surgery for tubes tied or removed. Then, I found out that I’m pregnant. I don’t know what to do. Do I tell my Dr? It could end up in my file. If I lose the pregnancy they might think I did it on purpose. How do I know who the dad is? I can’t remember what happened with his friends enough to know if they used a condom. Do I tell him or not tell him?  If I keep it secret and do want to end the pregnancy, how do I get to where it’s legal without him knowing. What kind of person does that make me if I choose to do that.

"In the end, I think you ought to talk candidly with your therapist and doctor. You've got a lot on your plate right now. If you choose to continue the pregnancy, they can point you to community services to get the kind of help and support you need.

Whoever the father is, if you did not consent/ was coerced into ""consent"" (which is not actually concent), or was unable to consent due to drugs/ alcohol/ sleeping, THIS IS RAPE, BY DEFINITION OF THE LAW.   The perpetrator(s) can and should be charged accordingly. And yes, husbands/ partners can be charged. Additionally, if your husband arranged with his friends, he is an accessory, and probably other types of charges. 

Regardless of counselling you've had as a couple, this is serious and needs to be reported. It will be hard, and it'll be a long road, but it needs to be done. 

As for the option of ending the pregnancy, there are ways to gain access. There's a helpful sub here that I can't remember offhand but if I find it I'll edit.

Quick rundown: 
My husband and I have been trying to get over our communication issue and improve our marriage. Sadly it’s not working and he’s refusing to go to therapy. I’m going for myself to deal with the emotional stress and the way his anger effects me. However my son (3 years) has also witnessed my husbands outrage and now repeating curse words in the same manner as my husband yelled to me. He now has yelled a me and about me infront of his own mother. When we got home I told him I needed to take our son and leave to a hotel. Then he tried to intimidate me by loading the magazine clip for his gun (2 feet away from where my son is eating and can see him) saying he’s loading it for anyone that tries to come on our property. I told him no one is coming except for a cop to escort me out if he doesn’t let me go. He eventually did let us go after my MIL talked some sense to him. Now I’m planning to separate and move to an apartment as I no longer feel secure and have increased anxiety being  under the same roof alone. Is this considered DV? Can I still report it if so. This occurred just last month."	TemperatureOk6340	post	40.395685826634995	female	White	0.9992238283157349	na	na	na	21	domesticviolence	no prediction.
Brandishing a firearm is not a minor incident. This is serious. Get out before he does something that can't be undone. Firearms and DV aren't ok.

In the UK its called Domestic Abuse now instead of DV as some of the issues mentioned in other comments, such as there being no actual physical violence, only an implied threat of it.

My initial thoughts are yes this is most definitely considered DV. I’m not sure what else you’ve been through or if he was loading the weapon prior to the conversation but regardless this is intimidation and a huge red flag. Access to weapons is a major risk factor that has been identified among deaths due to domestic violence. The fact that you are also going through a separation means this is an even more dangerous time for you and your child. I would report this immediately, they may not grant you a protection order but it will be important to have on the record. If you’re not ready to report to police yet start documenting everything and talk to trusted persons so you have other people who are aware of what is happening.

"My abuser did things like this. This is mental/emotional terrorizing and control/abuse. He’s attempting to intimidate you with threats of death/gun violence, by “subtly” suggesting how “protective” he’s willing to be of “the family”.

This is more my personal opinion and take from firsthand experience, trauma, and time in study of a psych degree and in CB therapy:

Abusive men mask their threats under the very virtues men should truly represent at their best. This is a farce, a shame, and whether also intentional as a part of abuse (it is unclear and depends on a case by case basis) it regardless feels very cruel to the people who experience it.

Good Men are supposed to protect and support. To mask the threats of death against your partner under the guise of that protection is disgusting.

Get away from him. Get your son away from him and help him learn to be a better man. You can’t save or change his father. Try to keep an eye on yourself and check in with your therapist for advice when it comes to your feelings about your son parroting his dad. He’s three, literally just a baby, he’s just copying people close to him to figure out who he is like any very young person. He will not ever “turn out like his dad” unless actively taught to be! Nurture the best in your boy and don’t give in to fear, and you shouldn’t have to worry about him becoming anyone but himself (whoever it is you’re starting to see in his tiny attempts at independence). 

If he’s regularly copying his father to get a reaction out of you with “bad” behaviors it’s only because for his age and development, that’s what’s getting your attention. You can talk him through it, and out of it in a little time. 

I wish you luck. I hope you get a good attorney set up soon to fully represent you and your son’s rights against your abuser in court. I’m very sorry you’re going through this, but you caught on! Sometimes people don’t really open up to what they’re experiencing until far later and more damage is done. Get your son away from him, and in 15 years, he may not even remember this man."

Yeah, sadly many people believe that this is the case which is why so many abusers get away with the suffering they cause. Mainly because domestic abuse is only really bought up in news stories etc when someone has been seriously hurt or worse, anything less doesn't make for a great news article, however with more people becoming aware of exactly what domestic violence is hopefully these stories will also be few and far between in future.

I told him I'm checking into the veterans hospital psychiatric hospital so I can do a in patient PTSD program(all true) left out I'm not coming back. He hated the idea if course. Here's what I'm struggling with...why am I so heart broken and sad after everything I've been through? Anyone else feel like that? He was my very first bf in life and I feel so attached to him, like I won't survive alone. Is this part of the experience? I've never been manipulated or had so much trust broken 💔.

I was 20 and panicked at the thought of being on my own.  I idolized him because his family had money and mine did not.  but he lied, did drugs, drank, humiliated me, did other people dirty.  controlled all the money.  wouldn't let me visit my aging parents, and was a total idiot.  everytime I would say I wanted a divorce he'd talk me into making up.  and this went on week after week for 13 years.  I finally thought of a plan, worked up my nerve, and forced myself to do it.  then I fell apart.  and my family, friends, neighbors and local shelter supported me and got me through it.  a little faith helps	shittykitty2020	reply	na	na	na	0.9144938588142395	no	strong	no	na	domesticviolence	failed
It's called a trauma bond. I suggest reading up on it as well as the cycle of abuse. You can do this! Especially going into a program like you are. Be honest with them. While you will likely experience relief, there are a ton of surprising feelings as well. The sadness and grief feel shameful because why would we miss them? It's just how the brain works and is nothing to be ashamed about. It's hard, but you can do it	shittykitty2020	reply	na	na	na	0.9144938588142395	weak	no	no	na	domesticviolence	failed

"It's coming up to 4 years in a few months since I called the police on my ex. Even now I feel bad about doing it, even though I know it was the right thing, because of how it affected him. I loved him so much, I can still remember all of those feelings now.

Over these 4 years, I have missed him a lot.

BUT, I can also see that I'm in a much better place than if I hadn't done that.

I'm alive for one thing!!

It's not going to be easy leaving, calling the police wasn't easy. It's not going to be easy not going back, it wasn't for me. But it will be the best decision you ever make, it was for me!!

I've always heard that the sadness comes as a form of grief. The best advice someone said to me is to grieve well, grieve the Lost dreams of who you thought you were in a relationship with, grieve the loss of the future you thought you had. Most importantly take your time and grieve well. If you don't, chances are you'll jump into a different relationship with another abuser.	shittykitty2020	reply	na	na	na	0.9144938588142395	weak	strong	no	na	domesticviolence	failed

Yes, this is common in an abuse situation to feel bonded to him and not sure how you could survive without him. The good news is that you can survive without him and there are many of us here to tell you that it slowly but surely gets better. Much better. The thing is that you will have grief about the relationship ending, your love for him, and mostly grief about losing the relationship you thought you had with him. All of those are valid grief experiences. There will also be relief. And all those things that wore you down and just didn't fully make sense will start to make sense as you figure out the truth.  The truth will set you free. I am so glad I am free now.	shittykitty2020	reply	na	na	na	0.9144938588142395	weak	strong	no	na	domesticviolence	failed
"I escaped abusive parents who almost killed me and killed my baby. When I escaped it was the first time I ever had any freedom in my life, control of my own body, etc. I had a phone for the first time!  


Escaping is ALWAYS the best thing to do, no matter the situation. You need to get away from those who hurt you, regardless of your relationship. This is why cutting out toxic people is so important. When you're out and you can breathe on your own... It's amazing.   


Make sure you hide all your info. Make social media accounts private, block all his accounts, block his number, etc. Get a DeleteMe to scrub all your info off the internet. If you need ANY help removing your info online please read this paper I wrote: [https://thevegandragon.com/index.php/sources-library/resources-for-activists/protecting-yourself-as-an-activist/](https://thevegandragon.com/index.php/sources-library/resources-for-activists/protecting-yourself-as-an-activist/)  


Don't let him ever contact you again. Also, take your most important things with you. Abusers will not let you get those back. If you have pets give them to someone you trust. You can lie about taking them to see the vet one more time before you check yourself in. That's top priority because abusers will harm your babies, human or not, to hurt you. I know this better than most. Get your furbabies out, get your most important possession out, and then you know you have truly escaped."	shittykitty2020	reply	na	na	na	0.9144938588142395	no	strong	no	na	domesticviolence	failed
"It’s hard but doable—so many of us on this sub are testament to the ability to escape our abusers. We pushed through the pain and uncertainty and came out the other side. After I left my abusive and violent relationship, I had the same fears you describe. But soon I fell in love with the safety and freedom that being away from my abuser brought me, and it actually wasn’t very long at all—just a few weeks at most—that I felt that uncertainty until I realized how much better off I was on my own. I say that because while every person is different and it’s true that some survivors have difficulty with the initial separation, not everyone does. Don’t anticipate the no contact phase being torturous and difficult. It may very well be totally liberating, as it was for me. I’ve never looked back and never been happier, and I was with my abuser for years and years. I just needed a little space to get my head out of the fog. So, trust yourself and push, because I promise you will find yourself in a better place, too.

The only way out is to go through it, and we each have to do that ourselves. However, having support wherever you can find it is helpful. I had almost no one at the time I escaped, but I made it through, and it sounds as if you have family and health care workers to support you, which is fantastic. That will be a great help, and I encourage you to keep reaching out to anyone who can offer you strength and empathy.

One of the best ways to find support is to connect with a DV advocate and/or your state/local DV organization (or the national DV hotline). Having someone who knows the struggle of breaking away will be very, very useful. They also may be able to provide referrals and resources for trauma-informed therapists who understand and specialize in DV, legal assistance, housing, or other help you may need.

Finally, I’m including some reading that I hope you find helpful. The Lundy Bancroft book probably saved my life, and it helped me realize how many ways in which I was being abused (which helped me stand firm and not go back). I hope these resources are a good jumping off point before you connect with a DV org. Best of luck, and remember to put yourself and your well-being first—you deserve the peace, happiness, and safety that is within your reach.

He told me he's been waiting/thinking for me this whole time we were apart, 28 years, and he heard I was divorced and looked me up.

Dumb me thought, ""How sweet,"" but the reality is the sweet boy I knew then (I had forgotten I had to basically cut him out back then. He was beyond obsessed, memories are tricky)he's some man I've never met. He's been to prison once for non DV and is never going back.

During the last 16 years of my parents’ marriage, my dad has been paranoid and jealous of my mom even though she’s the breadwinner and he barely works. Yesterday was the last straw when my mom was working at the nail salon and my dad accused my mom of cheating, saying that “the nail salon closed a long time ago”. To which my mom called her coworkers and showed camera footages for proof, but he refused to look or listen. Last night, he terrorized my mom and gave us until Sunday to move out of the house that my mom paid for. What could I do in this situation?

It helped me so very much. I ended up having a place to stay, Housing referrals after that as well as a pro bono attorney for my divorce. 

It’s not the policeman’s discretion on whether or not to prosecute and it’s definitely not their business to project the outcome of the case. They can give you their opinion I guess but that doesn’t make it factual. 
they’re supposed to take a report and send it to the DA for prosecution.

I live in Phoenix. I left him a few weeks ago. Been staying in cheap hotels and vacation rentals and trying to stay on my own but it’s been so hard. It hurts. I’m broke. Together we had lots of money and now I don’t know anyone here and no one to help me. I called the DV hotline dozens of times but no one ever picks up. I don’t want to go back but I’m sad and lonely and a hug sounds so so good. But I’d also be in danger because he snaps over nothing and becomes violent. I don’t know what resources are available or how to find them. I have bad credit, can’t get an apartment. I’m so screwed out here on my own. I feel lost and it just feels like I’m avoiding my boyfriend temporarily. But I left for a reason. I’m in danger if I go back. But I’m starving if I don’t go back. My life is in shambles.

"First, hugs to you!

You are at the hardest part. 

What is your income? 

I don't know a lot about the resources there, and it sounds like you are moving around a lot. Do you have any family or old friend anywhere else? Different state? 

Have you attempted to reach out to the welfare office in the area? They can help sometimes. They might even be able to direct you to where you can get help with rental assistance. Or help with staying in a hotel.

If you don't have work and need food fast have you checked out the local food pantries?"	IronicBunny	reply	na	na	na	0.9979750514030457	strong	no	strong	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.

I know the DV stereotype is poverty is the only place this happens, but it's not true. So I am here to tell you that getting help is worth it and you can have help. You need DV specific help, not a random therapist that says sure they can do DV (mistake I made). I have been getting support and DV therapy for 5 years (he left 3.5 years ago) for free.

I missed the heathcare.gov deadline. I feel fine and heathy but I would benefit from taking to a councilor but I can’t even get through on the hotline.

It's insanely hard on your own income. I was lucky and my mom let me stay with my two kids tell I saved enough money. Our DV shelter was packed. 

Family and friends can be a huge a support. But idk your situation with them. If you have any?

I don’t know if you have to have an application already in the system to do this but it may be worth a shot to call and speak to someone in customer service.

"Brief backstory:

My friend and current housemate was the victim of a few different crimes within the last two years. The charges include domestic battery as well as multiple breaches of 3 protective orders. Most recently, the offender chose to exercise at the gym she has relocated to, even though the gym is in another town 35-40 minutes out of his way. There are 3 locations in his town closer to him that he usually uses, this was without doubt intentional. 

His background includes playing professional basketball and competitive fighting. He stands at 7' tall and weighs about 290 lbs. He is comparable to Terry Crews (6'2) or Dwayne Johnson (6'5) in size, but BIGGER. My friend is an average sized woman. She is terrified of him.

This person is objectively violent and had a record before attacking my friend, but all charges have fallen in the misdemeanor category. 

&#x200B;

Our most pressing issues:

The most recent ruling in the ongoing case is that the offender is to wear a gps tracking monitor for an arbitrary amount of time. However, it gets ass backwards from here. They did not program the address of our new residence into the gps monitor and then explain to him how it works. The people that make these decisions have **TOLD him our exact home address, and her exact work address.** 

You have to be fucking kidding me.

The gps tracker is to be worn indefinitely, and depends on his behavior. But they said to my friend that it is usually only for **a few months at best.** This is ludicrous. The guy has already breached all three of the current protective orders against him without any hesitation or regard. The most egregious was sending her a text message barely three hours after receiving a PR bond (which he was not even supposed to be granted on account of the DV charge).

Not only do we still have **8 months on our current lease,** but they **gave him her physical work address** so it does not matter how often she moves (assuming that is even feasible). He has already driven by her place of work. 

When she was with him, he was regularly violent with other people over simple disagreements. Think of the jerk in the bar that is desperately waiting for somebody to look at them the wrong way so they can start a fight. He's that guy already. She saw him follow people home so that he could ""get them back"" at another time. She saw him break into people's cars out of revenge. 

This guy is absolutely going to cause more harm at some point, and the first person on his list may very well be the one person who ever fought back. His life has been very disturbed in the last year because of the charges she pressed and she has taken him to court multiple times and he has been on probation. And the scariest part is that right now, he is going to be able to do it so fucking easily. He just needs to be on ""good behavior"" for a couple of months, and then who knows?

We are open to any suggestions of where to post this if this is the wrong subreddit, and any and all suggestions regarding protecting her and by extension, our household. She has already been informed that she could break the lease (three of us are on it) and relocate without a penalty, but in the grand scheme of things, that is  not a practical option. And it's really not that helpful anyway. They wouldn't give her any money, just allow her to not pay a lease-break fee, inadvertently leaving the other housemate and I up shit creek without a paddle. How fucking generous. 

We live in **Colorado**, and the charges are primarily in the **Aurora** area. She is also pressing charges in our new residence in **Westminster**, CO.

Again, we are open to ANY suggestions, and if more information is needed I can talk to her. It is sensitive of course, so getting back into the nitty gritty of the nastiness may take us some time. I also obviously try not to ask her to return to that time period and state of mind unless I absolutely must. It is very hard on her.

Thank you for reading.

PS, here is a brief simplified rundown of the history:

1. Domestic Violence Assault, plead Guilty, violated probation.  
2. In Denver, violated court ordered protection order.  
3. Violated protection order at gym in Westminster.  
4. Directly contacted phone number via text, hours after PR bond, another breach of the protective orders.  
5. Currently in Westminster there is a violation of the restraining order, she is pushing for probation for a year and mental/health evaluations."	ChuckSnoris	post	25.984421463846566	male	White	0.9989975094795227	na	na	na	2	domesticviolence	no prediction.

Legal: Colorado like many other places is nonsensical with punishing DV offenders. As you have seen. Still need to keep up with reporting violations as they happen. One think I’d suggest is have her push for jail time only. Pushing for mental health (non accountability) is what the system is already doing, will not actually work to change the abuser, and for ignorant people in the system looks like she’s not that scared of him. 

Avoidance: You’ve said it’s not feasible to move. Is it possible for her to change her non-work routines? Like joining a different gym, different grocery stores, etc. 

Home security: external camera(s). Locking up doors and windows when not in use. 

Defensive violence when avoidance fails: I forever roll my eyes when people want to suggest pepper spray or tasers for life or death scenarios. Your friend’s abuser is physically terrifying like mine. A beating, strangling, any close contact scuffle is life threatening. I’d recommend getting a gun, taking classes with said gun, then having it on person in case his stalking escalates into a re-assault. Not just her but you guys too. She might not want to take that route but he might attack when you all are at your apartment. Women’s BJJ and a taser will not work for a Terry Cruise much less a dedicated one."

"I appreciate the response. 

We have cameras, and we have already moved a town over. She uses different locations for everything as it is, and the only reason our new address is now in the police report and by extension his information, is because he breached the protective orders after we moved. He was undoubtedly looking for her at other gym locations. She was doing quite well for several months until he was finally able to track her down at the gym in a different town 35 minutes away. 
After he was arrested for that, he contacted her directly hours after being released and breached the protective order yet again, which leads us to today. 
We are going to a court hearing today, and I am her victim’s advocate. I may have more information soon."	ChuckSnoris	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9989975094795227	weak	strong	no	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.
"I’m a 36yo male living with a 36yo female partner of 4 years.

There’s always been issues with the relationship, but in the last 2 years they seem to have ramped up. This is mostly verbal, never physical though she has thrown items “towards” me on a few occasions. What really has an affect on me is her unpredictable and extreme anger. My psychologist has said I have developed C-PTSD from constantly being stressed at home. 

I’m anxious about doing anything as I just don’t know if she will fly off the handle. Overtime I feel like I have given up a lot (friends, hobbies) just so I can keep the peace. When I come home from work I feel like I just have to do housework just so that she can’t have an excuse to go off at me. Then it’s just a countdown to when I can go to bed. I feel like a ghost of my former self.

In an argument I can’t say anything otherwise she will claim that I’m yelling at her (I never do) or that I’m getting too emotional and ‘crazy’.

Things really took a turn for the worse when she started putting pressure on me to have have a baby with her. I’m not totally against the idea of having kids, but we have a lot of things to work out first and I have a mental health issues (the aforementioned c-ptsd) I really want to get on top of. She accused me of being selfish and started laying into me again. To make a long story short, I caved in and we have started having unprotected sex. Sometimes I can’t “get it up” due to nervousness and simply not wanting to do it, which causes more issues and arguments.

I know I should leave, but I’ve got no where to go and our finances are intertwined. I am considering sleeping in the car, but then what? 

I’m really at my wits end and am kind of considering suicide. I’ve called a few DV lines at the suggestion of the suicide crisis line people but all they really say is to make an appointment with a mental health professional, which I’ve already done.

I’m sorry, this just turned into a kind of rant. I’m just not sure what to do."	Quiet-Loquat1	post	35.105680509312265	female	White	0.9986419081687927	na	na	na	11	domesticviolence	failed

"What other options do you have? Go out... Its both your job to keep the peace. 

You're allowed to go out. Go to the library. Take a healthy relationships class. 

Then have the boundary set. If you do X, I'm going to remove myself from the situation to protect my peace. Have that conversation, and then have a list of places you can go and would want to go. A friends house, a 24 hour gym... Whatever. 

The point is to get out of there. And stick to it. Do you think you can commit to trying something like that? It'll cause problems at first, because you're setting boundaries.

I did this in my situation, packed up the kids and went to Denny's... To the car wash... To drive around and watch the lightning storms, to my brother's house in California for a few weeks (multiple times). It did not end up changing his behavior much...

"I think it doesn’t help to worry  about what exactly is labeled, at the least  this is definitely toxic and you don’t deserve it. 

It’s hard to explain sometimes but when you’re talking about leaving, there’s never a perfect time or even a good time to do it you just actually do it and let the chips fall where they may, most of the time they fall in good spots anyway. 


I don’t know if you have called a domestic violence shelter directly or not but that might be a good idea. Also national domestic violence.org is a good place to find out how to plan to leave. It’s full of information like stashing money from paychecks, changing your direct deposit to a different account, taking your name off of certain bills and how to start looking for alternative housing. Housing options and any services available to you. Definitely look for a roommate because starting over is not easy and it’s probable that you are stuck in some thing we called trauma bond. Makes it hard for us to leave them emotionally and mentally. The domestic violence shelter probably has a great resource for a trauma therapist, specifically they are great because they help us really understand why we stayed and  how we get no contact after we leave. 

Make a list of every time she is threatening or angry, take pictures of anything she breaks, and keep any verbal texts that are threatening. If it ever does get physical, then don’t have any second thoughts about calling the police.  you want to protect yourself. 


I don’t know if you have just try to flat out tell her that you want to break up. Even though it’s a blow to the ego sometimes it’s best to allow them to think it’s their idea or you are the problem so that you can break up with the least amount of drama. In some situations the two people help each other out with starting out in New Lives separately.

You 100 percent do not want to have a child with her. That will tie  you to her for the rest of your life and that is a common way for an abusive woman to solidify her connection to you.

I know it’s not honest but I know how insistent a toxic person can be and how much harder it is for a man to put off sex sometimes. my friend said he had some really bad back pain went to the doctor, ended up at his prostate was inflamed. The doctor suggested laying off of sex for a while. it’s bought him some time.

One thing I’m going tell you is whatever you do do not get angry. Do not give her any ammunition to use against you to claim abuse. I am ashamed of my gender but when they can be very vengeful and use domestic violence as a weapon against their partners when they didn’t do anything.
If she’s picking fights and she’s pushing you to the edge and for a walk. Do not engage with anger. Start talking to your family and friends so that people are aware of her irrational behavior. 
It helps to play nice during these times because then things don’t get out of hand.

I know it seems like there are a lot of services for women but really the main services go to  women who have children.

I (21F) was in a relationship for about a year and a half. During the relationship I was not aware what I was dealing with was abuse unfortunately until things began to escalate. It was when I finally decided to leave I acknowledged it. But I never thought to stop and also realize that I was in a DV relationship. I don’t know, I felt simply saying abuse was enough. I came across a website talking about DV and while I was I felt like I accepted I was a victim of domestic violence. I experienced being pushed down, held down, water throw/dumped on me, held tightly, even a physical altercation trying to stop me from leaving. There was two arguments that ended with me being bruised and ultimately being my breaking point. I’ve always accepted what I went through but I felt like I was only seeing half of it. I never ever once actually thought that it was DV until today. Now I’m not sure how feel or handle this know having a label to it.

It’s tough to realize we were abused by someone who did such a good job convincing us they loved us . And maybe they really did love us . But people who are capable of doing such things to their significant other are extremely troubled individuals . But just know that isn’t normal love and while it’s hard to grasp the reality of being in an abusive relationship because abusers are often master manipulators… that’s what you were in  and I’m proud you got out .

I have been financially dependent on my bf for 10 yrs now. I have one child with him. Is there anyway to transfer money from like prepaid cards to chime account For free?"	Sleeptokenprincess	post	56.93333833503643	female	White	0.9968634843826294	na	na	na	3	domesticviolence	failed
You can deposit cash into a chime account. If you go to the app, there will be a section, I believe called atm map. Click on that and it will show you all atms in your area that you can deposit cash into, for free.	Sleeptokenprincess	reply	na	na	na	0.9968634843826294	no	no	no	na	domesticviolence	failed

My ex would always make me doubt myself like this. He would constantly say I triggered him, crossed his boundaries, provoked him etc. He said we were 50/50 at fault during the best of times. He moved out a year ago now and I can clearly see nothing I did justified his abuse. Did I act in ways I'm not proud of? Sure. I was no saint. I screamed back at him. Maybe in some ways, I did trigger him. I lost my mind a few times and acted crazy. But now he's gone I can recognise he's a grown ass adult with his own agency. They make their own choices. They choose to cause harm in whatever way it is. And absolutely nothing you could do would justify that judging by your other comments, you're not engaging in the inherently abusive behaviours, it's all from his side. You are absolutely not at fault. And you know what it's funny, the meltdowns, arguments, screaming matches do not happen now that he's gone. No one else drives that behaviour out of me. When someone pushes us and abuses us, it's normal to react in a way you might not usually, and then have that weaponised against you or cloud your judgement.

"Often, as the victim, it can feel like you are trying to maintain control over your abuser because you are. Of course you are. As the victim of domestic abuse your basic safety depends on whether or not your abuser feels like hurting you in any given moment. Trying to exert control over his behavior in that context is potentially a life and death proposition.

That need for control, as the victim, also often expresses itself as deliberately proving violence, knowing that it will result in trauma. It is a desperate attempt to regain some sense of control in an environment where you have neither control nor safety. That is not you being an abuser. That is also not you wanting to be abused.

Are you getting help from a domestic violence agency? Do. Believe me, you are not the only person who has had depression. And it is common in a DV situation. Also see if you can get any evidence safely. One person I know was able to get audio recording of the abuser yelling and kicking her. That is all she could bring. He was a charming person with friends there to claim he was not abusive. The recording helped her prove the truth. Judge immediately knew he was abusive.

Your partner isn’t a credible source of information if he’s saying this and that is definitely said to intimidate and coerce you. Using your love for you children against you. Before you believe anything anyone says you should verify it’s veracity and truthfulness. That is not true and you need to learn to think for yourself instead of simply accepting whatever he tells you. That’s not reflective of how child welfare statues operate or how domestic violence counseling works.

Eventually it builds up until you can't help but say something or you might even say something accidentally. It's normal to want to talk about something that bothers you in a relationship.

"That’s understandable, however hopefully you can begin to see how dangerous it is to simply accept what one person tells you. That’s irregardless of how long you’ve known them or their proximity to you. A simple goggle search can help answer these questions. It can also reaffirm that your not the abuser, you need to convince yourself no one can do that for you. We can help but you need to understand the dynamics of coercive control as it relates to YOUR relationship which will take time. Domestically violent relationships make us deeply codependent on the intimidating partner. What they say goes, create space for yourself and cultivate a healthy skepticism of what he says.

"For about a year and a half my ex-boyfriend and I have been in a toxic relationship. I would break up with him often because I just wasn’t happy and genuinely didn’t see myself long term with him because of his temper among other things. He’s been shady with his phone the entire time we’ve been together and anytime I’ve said anything he’s says he’s not doing anything and I’m being ridiculous.  But that gut instinct just would not go away that something is going on . But he would always convince me to get back together with him. I’m not trying to paint my self as an angel here. I have been very emotionally abusive and manipulative with this man because he would NEVER leave me alone when I’d break up with him. I mean I’ve said some horrible, manipulative things. But he’s called me from other numbers, texted me, emailed me, shown up to my apartment, come to where I was walking in the park if he saw me there. He’s never left me alone when I've asked him too and I have a horrible time putting up boundaries with people. 

Well one night at a restaurant he called me a bunch of names and stood up to leave and threw his hat in my face. He proceeded to sit back down and continue to his verbal abuse. As I get up to leave he says he will make a scene if I do so I stayed in the seat because I did not want that to happen. I know other people saw it….they were side eying us. We leave the restaurant and continue arguing in the car until he finally gets out of mine and leaves. Well I went to my job because I didn’t feel safe to go home . He shows up at my job and apologizes and just won’t leave me alone . We say our sorries and get back together . Well months go by and nothing like that happens again until it does. when we would get into fights in his car he would begin to drive fast and a little reckless and it would scare me. A couple of times he’s hit the breaks so (I’m assuming) I would hit the dashboard ...which I have. Once with my nose/ upper lip and the other with my knee and arm because he saw I had taken my seatbelt off to grab something from the backseat. Fast forward a little bit and one night I went to his apartment to confront him about the way he was treating me after we had been on the phone arguing. He hung up on me and turned his phone off. I probably should have left it alone but I was tired if being treated that way. He answers the door and an argument ensues where he is cussing me out and threatening me. I got tired of being disrespected and threw my drink in his face . I know that was wrong. Trust me I know it was. But I was just so tired of being treated like shit and having him yell and cuss at me. well I turned to walk away and got several feet ahead and he ran up behind me and shoved me to the ground causing me to hurt my knee and my hand. He said I deserved to have my ass beat. Not an instant apology or instant regret but that I deserve to have my ass beat. I have told him I do not wish to speak to him or see him again but he is acting as if nothing has happened. He's asked me to lunch and even asked me to go to a concert with him. I don't understand how can be acting so nonchalant about everything that has happened. 

I guess what I am asking is what should I do? He's apologized and what not but I cannot continue to be with someone like him. It's like something is missing in his brain that he can always just act like nothing has happened. I do not understand."

Yes, please please PLEASE leave him alone. He’s established that this is a pattern and it’s not healthy (or even safe) for you to keep reconnecting. You also need to start planning on how to protect yourself for once he realizes it’s truly over. See if your state has an address confidentiality program if you need to consider moving, let someone(s) trusted at work know about your situation and that you’re trying to avoid him, have a family member or friend stay with you for a bit if you’re living alone, etc. I’m not trying to be dramatic - this is how many DV stories begin before the woman eventually ends up in a body bag. The temporary pain of the ultimate breakup will be worth it in the long-term. It’s OK to remember the good times, but do not let them fool you into letting him back in.

"And you will never understand. I know it’s frustrating but give up on that now. Your looking for something logical to explain his behaviour but there is nothing. Something IS missing in his brain that he does not realize what he does is wrong and thinks it can be swept under the rug. That will not change and you cannot fix him. 

Something I remember after getting out (of a relationship very similar sounding to this one) was mild shock at how I no longer had to defend my actions or feel extreme guilt for my reactions. I’m still an asshole sometimes, sure. But I’m never abusing, hitting, threatening or manipulating someone and that was my first real sign that it wasn’t me, it was the terrible toxicity I was dealing with. It also made me toxic. 

Get out as soon as you can. You may not feel like you need to, but hide. He will try to find you (as he’s shown before) and it will either lead to a) him blowing up violently or b) you’ll cave and go back. Make sure to reach out to people you truly trust to support you and help you with each step of leaving. And definitely look up resources that can give you much more helpful tips that I am currently. 

You deserve happiness. Sending all the luck I possibly can to you."	PuzzleheadedPickle98	reply	na	na	na	0.9928836822509766	weak	no	no	na	domesticviolence	failed

"I’m not even a religious person but he has made me believe in Hell. I HATE that I still love and care about this asshole. Even after all the times he’s called me a fat worthless bitch who nobody will ever love, all the times he’s hit me when I was running away from him or pinned me down and covered my mouth and nose with his hand so I couldn’t breathe almost fucking killing me and then when the neighbors called the cops blamed me for “almost getting him arrested,” after he brought a fuck ton of blues (fentanyl) into my apartment and then abandoned me to go sell them every night, which is how I got addicted to fentanyl, after he brought a member of the Mexican fucking Mafia into our apartment which ultimately led to both of us having to flee the state to avoid being fucking killed execution style by the FUCKING CARTEL, after, on that same trip, he flew back home without me and left me in a hotel with our three cats on the other side of the country DOPESICK as all hell, and, the most hurtful thing he’s done, even after he refuses to acknowledge even a fraction of the damage he’s wrought in my life or take an ounce of responsibility for ANYTHING HES DONE, even after all of that, I *still* fucking care about this fucking piece of shit. What the fuck is wrong with me???

I need to get the fuck out. I’m so tired of being told what a shitty person I am by the person who did everything I just said and more. This isn’t even the first fucking time, I’ve been in one abusive relationship or another since I was 18 years old. Nine fucking years of my goddamn life. 

What does this shit keep fucking happening?? Why can’t I just fucking hate him and GO?! Why do things have to be so fucking complex and nuanced?? I just want it to be black and white: he’s been awful to me, so I hate him, so it’s easy for me to leave and move on. I feel like that’s what a lot of people think DV is like but it’s not, at all. It’s so fucking painful and confusing to be hurt over and over again by someone you really love and care about. Nothing about this is simple or easy. It’s so easy to tell a woman “leave him!” After what I’ve been though, I’d never say that to a woman in a DV situation. As if she hasn’t fucking already thought of that a million times. It’s so fucking complicated and painful. 

In the back of my mind I even know that what I wrote is an empty threat, I can’t picture myself actually leaving. He knows that too. My life sucks an enormous bag of dicks right now and I guess I just wanted someone to just tell me something kind because all I ever hear is what I’m doing wrong and all the ways in which I’m not enough."	calliopecusamano	post	26.049429540006365	female	White	0.9979867935180664	na	na	na	5	domesticviolence	no prediction.
i think it's great you're sharing. do you know people in recovery meetings who can help you with this? people often do eventually leave especially if the addiction related things are treated. it takes a few goes and you're not in denial which is an excellent sign. remember he will get dangerous around when he has less control like when you've decided to leave so don't tell him, and find someone like a counsellor who knows about safety plans. and he'll try to pull you back into drugs. gl take care.	calliopecusamano	reply	na	na	na	0.9979867935180664	weak	no	strong	na	domesticviolence	failed

"I can’t even believe that I’m writing this. 

Today, I got home from work and the gym and sat next to my husband on the bed. Our 2 dogs get a bit rambunctious when someone leaves or comes home so they were still excited. They both jumped up on the bed, we both got annoyed and I yelled at the puppy (8 months) who I felt started it. He then turned his attention to me and yelled that I shouldn’t just yell at her. He’s right, I maybe shouldn’t single her out, but I let them work me up. 

I told him not to yell at me and that if he had something going on at work, not to take it out on me (has happened before). He left the room, in my mind to cool off but then he hit one of our walls in our living room several times. He walked back over to me and I thought he had gotten it out of his system, but I was wrong. 

He hit me at least twice on the right side of my face. I say at least twice because I was really stunned and he could’ve hit me more. I got him off of me and told him to call either a lawyer or the cops now. He didn’t and then I told him to get his shit and leave and he sat down on the bed again like nothing happened. 

I started throwing his clothes out of our closet and telling him to pack up and leave. He just sat there. I then took my stuff up to the guest room and now that’s where I am now. 

I’m so shocked that this happened. In September, we will have been together for 12 years and married for 6 years.

"Hi,

I have a friend, 21 years old and a resident of Arizona, who lives on the Navajo nation in Arizona. For a couple of years, they had been dating a Native American man, 31 years old. They moved out to the Navajo nation from Chandler, Arizona, to be with their boyfriend. They sold most of their belongings, including their car and smartphone to be with him. They had a flip phone that was only able to text with no internet access. They have no car, no job, and no nearby friends or family who can help them out. They live in a rural area and do not know how to determine their exact location for others to check on them.

My friend was planning to leave their boyfriend due to relationship issues. I agreed to pick them up from a nearby town to help them relocate. Their boyfriend took away their phone and forced them to cut off close friends. I am certain that he is texting on their behalf as well, as the person texting could not answer a basic identifying question I asked about my friend. I believe that my friend may be in potential danger as I am not able to contact them and their boyfriend has been verbally and emotionally abusive to them.

Due to this situation, I was looking for advice and opinions on how best to help my friend. I live in Texas currently and I am willing to drive out to them to be able to assist them."	DianaEntente	post	44.16825079884773	female	White	0.9937337040901184	na	na	na	4	domesticviolence	failed

"Hi 👋 I’m F22, I’ve been with my fiancé for 4 years (M27), and we have a 1 year old son. 
Time has went by so fast and for the most part things have been good, but he’s yelled at me a few times and it’s just really hurt my feelings I’m not sure if this is just normal though and I have no one to ask really. 
The first time I can remember he ended up punching and breaking his car radio because I got a vibrator. The second time (that I can remember) he was yelling at me to get up and clean when I was pregnant before I went to work (we were trying to keep our house organized but I was just tired). Then right after I had our son he yelled at me and called me ungrateful and selfish. 
Our sons birthday was a few days ago. He was grilling food, and I was about to go pick up the cake. Then I realized that the car was really low on gas so I was scared I might not make it. I stay at home with our son so I called my fiancé to ask if we had any money for gas and he got extremely mad at me (we’ve been struggling a bit lately with money) so I just hung up and started looking to see if I could get any gas money really quick from like a cash advance app. He stormed outside saying he took everything off the grill and we’re going to get gas. So I started driving but the entrance to the gas station was blocked off so I had to drive through some neighborhoods to go back around and use a different entrance. He then just started yelling at me saying that I’m scared of everything and I can’t do anything alone and demanding that I just drive myself home so he can go by himself. 
Then yesterday was our sons doctors appointment and the parking lot to the hospital was completely full, so I just drove around for a minute then exited when I couldnt find a parking space. I kind of took a long way back around that was less crowded so my fiancé started getting mad at me again and trying to tell me to pull over so he can drive, but I didn’t listen. Then I went to make a right turn and hit the curb a little bit and he started screaming at me to “pull the f*^%ing car over now” over and over again. I couldn’t listen to him even when I tried because he was screaming and cussing me out, so I just decided the safest option for me was to just not pull over and make it back to the hospital. He started saying again that I couldn’t do anything right alone and when we got back to the hospital he started screaming at me about where to park which I ignored again because I didn’t feel safe do what he was telling me to do and I found a parking space. After that whole thing happened (while our son was there) I told him I’m over it, and I’m done with him. 
That was yesterday, and he’s been crying and being really polite since then, but I just don’t know if things can work after that. Is that just stress or is it likely it’ll just continue to get worse if I try to make it work?"

"I'm so sorry.
You don't deserve to be treated like that in any situation. And I think that anyone who would treat you like that is (bear with me here) honestly not trying to help you, rather they are intentionally trying to overwhelm you. 
That is a lot that I just said, so hear me out.
If you saw a puppy who made a mistake, would you scream at it? Would you think that your tirade would help that puppy to behave any better? Would you feel justified in raging at the puppy? Would you think that your rage and later apology are a form of love?

Even the ex who was verbally abusive to me understood this metaphor when his DV therapist explained it to him. (Or he was performing yet again and pretending that he cared, God only knows).
DV is incredibly confusing because that is what they do. They overwhelm, exhaust, and confuse you constantly. And then they throw you a bone and make you think you have some influence on them that inspired them to change! And then they love you, give you everything you need, and gosh it's the best relationship you have ever known. And then he is a bit grumpy and quiet again....
Fortunately I picked up the only DV book at the library one day, Why Does He Do That by Lundy Bancroft.
This book explains so much.
If I was your friend with you, nobody could pay me to act like he did. Definitely not with your baby there. I would be patient and helpful. If I somehow got frustrated, I wouldn't take it out on you.

If I say no he acts like fine but every 2 hours he’s asking until I give in. You did the right thing for you and your baby. Nothing confusing about that. If he’s gonna cry and change tell him to  go to a group that helps people like him who talk to you that way (a DV group) and if he can or will do it for a long time maybe reconsider but rarely happens.

"I'm sorry that this is not going to be hopeful. The ex's former therapist actually helped advise me on what to do about the stalking. He was shocked about what I told him about the ex and couldn't believe how the ex had tricked him (he is a former abuser who helps abusers change). Abusers often manipulate therapists. They adore the attention. 
To be honest, I hoped the ex could change a LOT. He certainly said he wanted to. I believed in the performance. I asked my DV group leader if it was possible and she gave me the most honest answer: if he is motivated to change, he might be able to but only for a future relationship. Once they feel contempt for someone, they can't seem to change it. And you likely won't see the depth of the contempt because they really hide it.
And in my experience, you know the abuser is lying because their mouth is moving. :(
It's really hard to realize that Dr. Jekyll and Mr Hyde is the same guy, and Dr Jekyll is just a performance of a good guy. :(
However, it is also liberating. And as hard as it was, I am so much better now. So much.

Any advice? I need him out of the house, but I can't even tell what's ""bad enough"" anymore. I have recordings of him making death threats, but he was very very drunk. You can also hear him hit me at one point, but it's not that hard. 

He was arrested in November after I called 911. I paid to get him out of jail and worked really hard to get the DA to drop the charges because I didn't want him to lose his job. He lived in the marital home (which is in my name; I bought it 3.5 years before we got married) for the entirety of the DA's stay-away order. I'm afraid to put that on the paperwork because I'm not sure if he could get arrested now for having disobeyed that order months and months ago, but...it's definitely relevant.

I just need to know how difficult this will be, because if they deny me, I have no other options. And it's hard enough already."	Dense_Sentence_370	post	29.919281816253637	female	White	0.9961357116699219	na	na	na	3	domesticviolence	no prediction.
"Put every detail on that order. I live in NC so your laws are probably different. But here, as long as there was DV (financial emotional or physical abuse) and you state continued fear then that’s enough for an order. Is there a DV nonprofit in your town? I went to one here and they helped find me pro bono attorney, go through court process, monthly support groups. 

See if you can find one quickly over there. You can file this paperwork! But don’t wait forever. Courts want to see urgency in action (unfortunately) or he may claim “you waited too long to file so she must not be too afraid of me.”

Hi, I have been in a abusive relationship for 8 years now. My family has been pleading with me to leave but I’m not sure how I can. I met him when I was 21 and he was 38. I am not 28 and he is 45. I feel like I’ve wasted all my youth just being mentally, emotionally, slightly physically (pushing, shoving, choked, held down, pillow held on my face, gun held to my head) and financially abused. He sold my car when I was pregnant as he owned a car dealership so of course I believed him when he said he would get me a better car. Today he really showed me his true colors as he isn’t used to having no money and we are waiting for an insurance check to come thru of 5k but we only had $20 and no food in the house. In the beginning of the month I get my food stamps but he spends it all first thing every month and makes 3 meals every day cause he smokes weed so he eats all the food within a week or two.  But I told him to just make sure he gets our 5 yr old something and don’t worry about me cause I know how he is. So he got our son a burger and himself 3 sandwhiches and 2 fries. My son was napping so he ended up eating his burger as well. I was so mad. I haven’t eaten in 3 days so I ate a few fries and he screamed at me and told me to stop eating his fries fatass. I’m 113 pounds I lost 45 pounds in 2 months because I never eat. I don’t car about myself just my son. And for him to not care if our son eats or not made me realize I need to get our son out of here. Plus it’s not fair for my son to see how his dad treats us, Everytime his dad leaves he asks are we safe now mommy? It breaks my heart but where do I even start? I have no car (which doesn’t matter as I’ve been basically captive in this house for 7 hrs now as I’m not allowed to go anywhere unless he takes me) I have no money (he keeps it from me) I’ll have no cell phone. I’ll have nothing at all when I leave. I’m scared. And I have to figure out how to feed my son today as well because his dad thinks it’s fine to just eat all the food and not care about his son. 😢 my son doesn’t deserve this.

You mentioned your family has been begging you to leave, are they able to take you in until you get a job/get back on your feet? If not, I'd recommend reaching out to the National Domestic violence hotline (either by phone or online) and see if they can help you/direct you to resources. You're right, you cannot stay there. I know it's hard but starving your child so he can it crosses so many lines that you urgently need to get your son out of there.

"First you need to get out. Pack your important paperwork like passport, IDs, bank accounts, birth certificates etc. Don't worry about clothes and items. Snap pictures of everything and anything if you have a cellphone or tablet.

Then call 911 and tell them you need them to send someone to get you and your child safely out. When they come let them know he's starving you both and he took all your resources, and you need help.
They will bring you to a safe location, maybe the station where someone will help you where to go if they don't already know where to bring you. They have social workers available. Do not hesitate. 
In a shelter there will be more social workers helping you. There will be people that care. You will not be alone. 

If you have any cell phone, tablets etc I advice you to sign out and/or delete your accounts because you could get tracked if he has spyware on them or if he knows the passwords to any. When you sign in on let's say Facebook it will detect a new location and send a warning and you have to be aware of this. Many apps do this."

"This. And if they don't have room, get them to take you to a women's shelter. They will help you start over, with anything you'll need. 

Also-- report to the police what has been going on. If need be, call 911 from whatever phone you can use, and tell them immediately you are in danger, there have been death threats, and whether he has a weapon. If you get disconnected they'll still be able to send an officer. Some cell phones have an SOS setting-- and even if they aren't on a network, with no sim card, you can still call 911. 

Another option: there's an app called What 3 Words. Each set of 3 words corresponds to a specific location. Tell someone (even online) what yours are and ask them to initiate a ""wellness"" check. 

And.... isn't him using your food stamps fraud? Can your welfare office (whatever it is where you live) help you out with this situation?

I hope you can get out."	Beautiful_Bonus8350	reply	na	na	na	0.999019980430603	weak	no	no	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.
"I do NOT consent to this being posted on any other platform or sub

I am using fake ages and names for privacy of me and my cousin, just know we are in our early 20’s. Let’s call my cousin “Emily” and her husband “Devon.” 

Some background:
Emily and I are best friends, she is the love of my life and possibly the most important person in my life. Emily and Devon dated for a year before getting engaged. I was happy for them when they began dating. There were no immediate red flags but I think that’s because I never got the chance to really get to know him. They got an apartment together pretty quickly into their relationship. Devon is in the military and often has to take long deployments for months at a time with little to no contact with the outside world. During this year of dating Emily he was gone for 6 months of it. Before he left I got to meet him over the phone and once in person. He snapped at me because he couldn’t get his Minecraft to work on his Xbox and blamed me for it because “he knows what he’s doing and I’m the one whose an idiot.” Context he was trying to play on a Java server on a Bedrock version of minecraft, Java is only available on PC/computer and I tried to explain that to him nicely and that’s when he snapped. This is when I felt suspicions of him being possibly abusive. 

On to the current problem:
I had noticed Devon snapping at people for small things or for no reason at all and I have explained to my cousin that his behavior is extremely unacceptable. She agreed but she continues to make excuses for him (this was before they got engaged.) Me and her sister have addressed our concerns about his aggression and how we believe he will eventually do it to her or even harm her one day. She continued to make excuses and claimed “he’s just stressed out, he’s not usually like this, I’ll talk to him.” Every single time I have spent around him he had a hostile attitude and only put it away when my boyfriend was around us or me. Recently my cousin’s health took a pretty big turn. She’s been having heart palpitations and severe anxiety attacks to the point where she can no longer drive or consume foods she enjoys. She cannot go out for extended periods of time because of how awful she feels. She’s gone to the ER multiple times and got extensive tests done and they all came back inconclusive. The doctors believe it’s stress/anxiety. My cousin has never been this way in all the years I’ve known her. She went from an independent go-getter with good work ethic and attitude to becoming a co-dependent shell and I think she realizes it too. She called me the other night and cried to me that she doesn’t know who she is anymore, that Devon has been snapping at her. She is right she isn’t herself and my boyfriend agrees with me. (Context my boyfriend use to be coworkers with Emily for a few years and she set us up together.) I recently came to the conclusion that he’s also gaslighting her because of information my boyfriend told me about the last time we visited them. Emily asked me is I think her marriage will fail. I lied and told her it wouldn’t but that she needs to go to therapy and couples counseling. I want my cousin to be happy I love her so much, but Devon is aggressive and he’s been getting worse. I hope the marriage fails she at least deserves someone who is kind, gentle, passionate, and ambitious. Not a insecure, only child with massive amounts of poor anger management skills. 

What should I say to her? I want to make sure she knows that I won’t ever think she’s crazy without being accusatory or scare her. But I want to be truthful and not give false hope. 

TLDR; My cousins husband is abusive and I always suspected how do I approach her about my feelings towards him without scaring her?"	thrwawayren	post	22.59613571922568	female	White	0.9988821148872375	na	na	na	2	domesticviolence	failed
"Just let her know you'll always be there for her without judgement.......tell her she's the only one that knows if she's happy and safe in her relationship but due to the changes in her and your first hand observation of hearing her husband be all snappy with people (mostly just the female gender), you want her to know that if she ever feels unsafe or if she needs to getaway in a hurry, you are an absolute safe haven......let her know that you're not accusing but you're just concerned for the decline of her health.......


There's not much you can do really until she decides that she's in a bad relationship....  And statistics say it takes a woman an average of 7 times to finally leave her abuser.......

Just make sure she knows you love her and care about what happens to her ......ask her to please please remember your number by heart just in case she ever has to flee with nothing......she can always borrow a phone if she doesn't have hers .....

"I’m torn and don’t have the knowledge to say whether you should address it directly. I guess what I would do, is not allow him to isolate her. So I would “play nice” with him in that if you attack him and she tells him, that would give an excuse for him to tell her not to talk to you. 

Reaffirm your love for her. Tell her that (if possible) she can stay with you guys anytime. 

Tell her your concerned about her (she seems to be having trouble) and maybe she should talk to someone.

also, talk to her about not feeling ashamed to tell you things and that you’d love her and support her no matter what and that if she ever thought she’d made a mistake you’d never hold that against her ."	thrwawayren	reply	na	na	na	0.9988821148872375	no	no	no	na	domesticviolence	failed

"#1 book: Why Does He Do That by Lundy Bancroft
(I recommend it constantly and see it recommended here regularly)
I think as your job, I highly recommend another Bancroft book: Should I Stay or Should I Go.
This is critical because the author teaches your role is to support a survivor, not tell them what to do (which is replaying what an abuser does, please don't do that).
Try to be extra careful about explaining terms. The first time someone in a support group mentioned the ""cycle of abuse,"" and I didn't know what she was talking about. I felt embarrassed. 
I've learned a lot from a couple people on YouTube and reddit talking about narcissistic abuse. It has helped me figure out what was going on. Dr Ramani is 1.

If you are coming from a CO background, I would caution you to carefully consider and rethink your ideas about police, courts, and the legal system in general. They are systemically and majorly unhelpful to victims of DV for a wide variety of reasons and issues. Many people and even other professionals assume that if a victim “does the right thing” and reports to police, that their problems will be solved and they’ll be safe. This almost never actually works out this way. Victims face all kinds of scrutiny and judgement and blame by those so called enforcers who are supposed to help them, and perps often walk away with little to no accountability or punishment. Respect someone’s mistrust in these systems, as it’s for good reason. Find other non-carceral ways to help victims find stabilization and stay safe. Empower them to make their own choices in how they choose to seek justice and know that it’s not one size fits all or right/wrong.

"I 28(m) am finally out. I didn't realize how bad it was getting. It happened so slow. I never occurred to me that what I was experiencing was abuse. It took a broken elbow and my hand broke in 3 places, a restraining order and cops walking her out in cuffs for me to realize but it was they clarity I needed. Today was the real first day i felt free. It was as simple as putting dishes in the dishwasher. I was staring at a pile of dishes dreading doing them for the next hour and then realized ""I'm aloud to use the dishwasher I don't have to wash these by hand"". See normally using the dishwasher was one of many triggers. If I even attempted to use it It would result in a massive screaming fit and a few broken dishes after it was done. I learned this the first few times I tried to use it and never used it again. My ex is bipolar and I walked on eggshells around her for simple stuff like this. If things didn't go her way she would scream and throw things and call names. I was told I wasn't good enough and that if I loved her I would do better. I was told to go find one of my whores to fuck. (I never cheated on her or gave her a reason to think this. These where friends I had on Facebook that just happened to be the opposite sex many of them married with kids. 

I felt like a fool but after this I spent the last few hours doing as many things I can think of that I couldn't do before. 
Turning the fan on high. 
Re-downloading facebook and unblocked over 50 people. 
Putting a lock screen on my phone. 
I moved my car from the right spot in the driveway to the left.
 I got my  Playstation out of the garage after a year and plugged it in(haven't had a chance to play yet) 
closed the bathroom door when I used it.
 I turned the ac on. 
I played my piano.(im rusty).
 I let the dog on the couch( she might have been right on that one there's hair everywhere now) 

but I didn't get screamed at once. Nothing got broken. I didn't get called stupid. Noone told me that I didn't love them. Noone told me I was pathetic. Noone told me to kill myself. I used to tell myself I missed her and that I miss the real her when she wasn't screaming when she was normal. And it took me too long to figure out none of it was normal.

So after leaving my ex and trying to learn to be a normal person again is kinda hard. My question for other who endured physical and mental abuse, do you ever when thinking in your relationship think you may have been the abuser as well… I have this conflict of emotions and it drives me crazy. Like I don’t know if being in the relationship for 13 years made it to where i licked up some of his mannerisms. I met him when i was 18, i dont know remember if i had any of these traits prior… was I a shitty person and did shitty things yes. i think most of that stems from not knowing what love was and how to properly love myself. I find myself asking more and more if i was the abuser or the abused? does anyone else ever feel this way?

These things are never black and white. You can be both, he could be both as well. My only advice would be to not ruminate on thoughts like these, acknowledge them and try and move on with compassion for yourself and for the situation. Silver lining is you will become more mindful and self aware and thus you'll never have doubt about any future circumstances. But again, compassion for yourself and the person you were and the person you are. Your future self will thank you.

" I understand questioning if whether or not you are the abusive one. For me, understanding my attachment style was very illuminating. I am fearful avoidant, which has abusive type behaviors if my attachment system is triggered and I feel my needs are unmet. I have ADHD which comes with bring easily frustrated and temperamental. So yeah, I was definitely abusive at times. My marriage was toxic in that we played into each other's disorders. He was a covert narc and liked feeling like the victim, and I was easily goaded into being reactive towards him to feed his narrative.
Learn about yourself and look at the good and the bad. Figure out your attachment style and what it means. Get therapy. Journal as triggers arise or memories resurface. See if you have any mental health issues going on. And then work on healing your old wounds so you don't act out towards others moving forward.

"Two years ago I put in my divorce decree order 
 if there was any incident of domestic violence, I could relocate back to my hometown but the ex would maintain parenting time. Since this order went into effect, I have been granted two restraining orders against the ex, he sat behind me in church during the time of the second restraining order, he took money out of my bank account without permission (a violation of the divorce decree), cancelled my car insurance without telling me (a violent of the divorce decree) and I got into a car accident during this time making it difficult to repair my car although not my fault. Car is not fixed to this day. Lately the ex obstructed me leaving an event because he didn’t agree I should be able to leave with the kids when he had 10-15 min left of his parenting time. I warned him never to come near me again in writing. He did it again a week later (walked toward me) at another event with the kids. I had to practically just leave and I warned him again to stop advancing toward me. He told me, if I’m that scared don’t come to the kids events.  Lastly, two weeks ago, I received an email from his current girlfriend accusing him of raging out on her, and she had to call the police. She detailed she thought he had a truncate and often smoked weed. She mentioned he hadn’t been the same since a tragic incident impacting our community (mass sh*oting). I called the police to verify and they didn’t suspect he was on drugs but did confirm a police call.  I’m isolated here-3hours from my family and why I put in the divorce decree I can just leave without the courts permission. And all these incidents to me are equivalent to DV. Both judges that granted the restraining orders warned him to stay away from me. It’s like he doesn’t listen and as time goes by from his guilty plea of assault on me, and the restraining orders disappear, he gets more embolden. I’ve made extensive plans to leave next week and came up with alternative parenting plan that limits our interaction. I KNOW HE WILL FIGHT THIS. No doubt. I don’t mind it. Lawyer says I’m in my legal right to move. Moreover, all these things that he has done violate our safety plan on file with CPS. We were placed on the central registry because of the crazy laws here but I ended up being taken off. Being on center registry negatively impacted my employment and I can’t be on there ever again. They put me on here because I didn’t leave after the first incident of violence and the children were in the house when it happened although I was a victim. It was a horrible ordeal and I just got off the registry the fall of 2022. I am leaving with the kids. But I’m afraid because he knows where my parents live. And he could be crazy enough to try and not go through the legal courts to fight this-which I welcomed. I am going to break the news via email after we have left. I am going to copy my lawyer and tell him I am happy to corporate through the proper legal channels. I am going to send him the alternative parenting time plan and agree to only meet him at a particular police station to pick up and drop off in the new home state. My parents house is equipped with cameras and I was going to tell him if he comes there, police will be called immediately. What are your thoughts on protecting my family from his possible crazy attempts. I’ve thought about getting a police decoy car but I can’t afford this. Hiring an off duty officer. Again unaffordable. Staying in a hotel- can’t stay forever tho. I’m afraid but I think this is the right thing to do. I can’t be three hours away here without support and near this person.

I'd hate to do nothing if there is actual abuse going on, but I'd also hate to make such an accusation only to turn out I was wrong.   


For reference, I have known this person as a coworker and ""work friend"" for about 3 years before leaving for another job about a year ago. I met his wife and son a handful times during that time at various company functions and informal coworker get-togethers. Over the course of those years I've noticed the following signs:

* Every time I would see his son, he would have some scab or bruise either on his arms or face. Usually there would be some explanation/excuse to go along with it from the dad (""He tripped and fell on the sidewalk"").
* In at least one instance I witnessed him verbally abusing his son, who was then maybe 3 years old. This was in a crowded restaurant; the son was throwing some sort of tantrum and the dad yelled ""Shut the f\*\*\* up!"" into his face. 
* The son's speech was stunted to the extent that when he was \~2.5-3 years old he was regularly seeing a speech therapist (the dad had openly talked about this among coworkers that he was close with). 
* On at least two occasions he made ""jokes"" about beating his wife (he made these jokes in a work environment).
* He would commonly talk about his wife to coworkers in a disparaging and very disrespectful way (calling her dumb, stupid, etc.)

For the record, I have never noticed any signs of physical abuse towards the wife (no visible bruises, scars, etc.). I'd say my coworker and I would have been considered friends at one point, but now we are more like former coworkers who used to be friendly. I don't really know the wife except for saying hi and exchanging some brief small talk on a few occasions (I don't think she would even recognize me if I said hi to her on the street at this point). 

What do I do here? Please help, any advice is appreciated!"	Agile-Employment-660	post	40.68919093043769	male	White	0.9942948222160339	na	na	na	8	domesticviolence	failed
"It's rough, there's not a lot you can do to help, and there is a lot you can do that potentially makes things worse for this mother & child.

I think documenting is a good help. Make notes and rough dates, email them to yourself or a new account so they're time stamped. Hope for a chance to run into the wife.

She'll be able to see you know and that will validate her, imagine a person gaslit to kingdom come, I know personally I was so shocked when in a 30 second interaction with the police, the officer could SEE what was happening and asked if my ex intimidates [them] often.

Paper matters in these cases, being able to read what happens and have it documented goes far, especially if as a bystander you are seeing enough to note, imagine everything you don't see.

CPS getting involved can be terrifying for abused women who aren't ready to leave. Maybe she has a plan to get out already. Family court can be a real nightmare in these cases too.

I would try to run into her and just say hey Ms, I just want you to know I see and hear things from x that gives me concern for you and your child. See what happens/how she reacts.

I’d say put in a report to cps. They’ll at least investigate, and hopefully if there is something there they’ll intervene. Unfortunately, without obvious proof they won’t be able to do much, but you’ll start at least a trail of paperwork. It’s not much, but I just wanna say thank you for caring enough to want to do something.	Agile-Employment-660	reply	na	na	na	0.9942948222160339	weak	no	no	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.
I would contact social services. I know where I live there's a phone number you can use and talk to them about your concerns and they'll advise you. At the very least you could do this even for your own pace of mind. Shouting in his child's face shut the f up is definately abuse and shouldn't be happening. The speech and language concerns could be developmental but with the rest of the information it paints a different picture. Abuse victims are very good at hiding evidence (speaking from experience) rather it be a wrong concern reported than a right one and this family are being abused and no one is helping. Good for you for even noticing and taking it further. Sometimes people need a jolt like this to get them out of the situation. You can also do this anonymously.

"I work with DV survivors and sending someone to her house without notice to her could make her more unsafe (especially if he is unstable).

Screaming at the kid is child abuse, but something should have been said in the moment. 

The best advice is to document. There was a case many years ago where a coworker noticed that her work friend was coming into work with bruises and she started tracking them. It saved that women’s life because she was able to give it to her for her criminal case against the husband. It is not quite the same, but close.

We have to be careful to send authorities to the house for DV unless you need to call the police. Batterers are very volatile and I have seen what happens when someone with good intentions calls CPS or other people of authority to help, and the woman pays the price."

If you suspect abuse this is a bad idea. You could be putting the woman and child in more danger as that will add fuel to his fire and think she is speaking out when she is not.

I totally know how hard it is to be in that position as a woman with a man that was able to mostly hide any inappropriate behavior. I was in more danger when it was reported. He definitely was angry with me. The children and I got placed somewhere safe, I was entered into a program. I hated cps and the involvement, plus k felt like my life was over because of the report. I am so much safer and so are my kids now. My husband was spiraling behind closed doors, had that report not been made we could’ve gone down with him. Trust me, I don’t say this lightly.

Yes- it is tough because people want to help but are not sure how to. What I tell everyone is to be a support. I cannot tell you the number of survivors I see without any family or friends because everyone gets frustrated with the situation.

"So, Friday I filed for a protection order. The next day it was granted. Judge saying that they find me in immediate danger, and that the protection order is in place now up to one year, even before a hearing. He has yet to be served, but he still is blowing up my phone. 
He is currently on probation for a different DV case for strangulation too. Last night he said he was going to stop by my place so I notified police. He didn't show. 
But since the order is in effect now, do I still need to wait for him to be served to let them know he's continuing the harassment? 
And they are considering him an ""ex parte"" so does that overrule him being served? I just don't know what to do. I've blocked his number but then he just texts/calls from a different number.

"*EVERYONE KEEP A COPY OF THEIR ORDERS ON THEM AT ALL TIMES* I even have screenshots on my phone and OP:

There is a legal advice sub on here but for my personal case: “ex parte” means they do not need to be served for the order to be in place, though keep trying to serve so they know. So yes calling the police was the right move as long as you have your ex parte order on you for proof. Very glad you blocked him. And keep those safety plans in place no matter what

Am order of protection is not valid unless and until the person named in the order is served. You cannot serve him yourself. Only someone who is not a party to the case can serve the papers.

"Not a lawyer, but had an ex parte and currently have a protective order. 

An ex parte is a temporary order of protection pending a hearing in which the petitioner (you) and the respondent (your ex) have the chance to testify regarding the events that led to the ex parte being issued. Do NOT miss this hearing, and for the love of god do not go alone. Bring someone safe with you. 

A full order of protection is issued after an ex parte hearing if the judge rules in your favor. It usually lasts 1-2 years, and can usually be renewed if needed before expiration. 

The respondent (your ex) can not legally violate the ex parte or full order until he is served. If you know his physical location, you can call the police non-emergency line and they will send an officer out to serve him for you.

Ex parte means that the judge granted the order without calling for a hearing first (meaning you provided enough info in your petition to show that you need the PPO granted right away to protect your safety), however it is not valid until it has been properly served. If you contact the police and it hasn’t been served, they won’t arrest him (unless he commits a crime, obviously), because it won’t show up in their system.	mementomori-93	reply	na	na	na	0.9974402189254761	no	no	no	na	domesticviolence	failed
"This is a bit misleading. They are valid as soon as they are signed, however, I highly doubt she got a year without a formal hearing first. Ex Parte is generally a protective order given in an emergency, and because in the States everyone has the right to face their accuser, ex-parte is so special because the defendent isn't present during the introduction of the cause of action nor has any chance to defend themselves during said hearing. That is why it is only for 30 days or less, because the goal is to protect the victim while also ensuring a fair hearing within the 30 days. At that hearing, if the claims are deemed factual by the bench, the defendent is then served a new order of protection which lasts up to a year and can only be extended or amended by the judge who signed it.  


Both the ex parte and order of protection are valid the second the judge puts their signature on it. If her ex had come over last night he would be in violation and could be arrested on the spot but thats up to law enforcement to determine. Had he shown up without threat of violence in a peaceful manner they would have told him about the ex parte and thus he would be now aware. If he shows up after that he can get aggravated stalking or whatever that state's equivolent is."	mementomori-93	reply	na	na	na	0.9974402189254761	no	no	no	na	domesticviolence	failed

"I(24F) grew up with my mom and brother(26M) and have been verbally abused regularly and occasionally physically hurt.
A couple days ago, my brother barged into my room when i was naked so I ran to my bathroom and locked the door. He wanted me to give him back something and I said ""okay but I'm naked so first get out and I'll give it to you after I grab a shirt."" He said no, said ""this isnt how this is going to work"" and insisted i come out immediately... i kept explaining I was naked but he didn't care. At that point he kicked  and broke apart my bathroom door and forcefully came in... the door slammed my finger and bleed a lot(i took pictures) i got scared and screamed and cried, told him to get out and he wouldnt... I tried punching his tummy because I didnt know what else to do (he is over 6ft and 250lbs, i am 5'4"" and 130lbs. It didnt do anything but he said ""this is self-defense"" and punched my right face/jaw as hard as he could and i hit my head on the wall and knocked out for a few secs.

I reported to the police station and they recommended I get a restraining order. But when my brother found out I did this, he also immediately called the police to our house and said his side, which he believes he did it out of self defense.

In this case, is he protected under the ""self defense rule"" even though he forced himself into my room bathroom and hurt my hand first? Also me trying to punch his tummy had no force or effect because my right hand was already numb from the door and had no strength..

These men and their ""self defense"" tactic. My ex was twisting my wrists so much I had to turn my body too so my wrist wouldn't break. Well in the process I pinched his side so hard I made him bleed. And of course gaslighted me to believe he was defending himself against me. He took photos of his ""wound"" and then deleted my photos of any proof he was beating me. 

But what he did was not self defense. That man was not threatened by you or scared for his life. He was coming at YOU.

"I don't know if your brother is narcissist, but his behavior suggest something like that. He is trying to make you guilty, and is naively believing that it going to work. Moreover, he has been hurting you for a long time.

So, it is good that you have the proof. But how does your mother react? Is she afraid of him or what? By the way, did you take photos of the broken doir, too?

The police and lawyers face this kind of situations every now and then. I don't think they are going to accept your brother's explanation just like that. He will be asked quite nasty questions. Not knowing where you live, but if you were here where I live, your mother would be interrogated, too. 

Could you leave your home right now? Do you any have friends you could go to, or how about a shelter home? You need help, and that help cannot come from your mother or any other close relative.

The strongest chains seem not be of steel, but of fear and force. People have succeeded in leaving violent families. It surely is not easy, but they all have been weak, stressed, ashamed, worried and so on. You don't have to change all your life immediately. You even cannot.

"tl;dr - No he cannot invoke self defense.  


It depends on what state you are in, or country for that matter, but I am 100% certain he would be the primary aggressor and thus canno't invoke self defense. He is looking at one count of battery for the finger, may get reduced to assault if it isnt permanently disfigured or immobilized.  If your state has aggravating factors such as domestic violence enhancements it will make the charge a bit worse, instead of looking at 1 year he could be looking at 3 for instance, or it will take it from a misdemeaner to an aggravated misdemeaner or even felony, it really just depends.  


But AFAIK in the USA or UK or Western Europe, to claim self defense you almost always cannot be the primary aggressor, which is usually interpreted as one who intentionally or had intention to inflict harm, and kicking the door down and busting up your finger makes him the primary aggressor, therefore you hitting him was justifieid and his retaliation was not, in fact he would be charged with 2 counts of battery because 2 seperate visible injuries several seconds or maybe longer apart from one another."

"***** UPDATE******* 

I DID IT ! I’m on a plane on my way to safety with my daughter. I was able to get out, with the help of friends & family. I was able to buy a ticket the same day and sneak out of the house with my daughter. I have such a mixture of feelings sad, relieved, stressed, guilty, and happiness all wrapped in one. Last night was the worse night but I was able to get him to let me sleep in the guest house with our daughter. This gave me the chance to pack our things get our paperwork together and sneak out. It was heart racing and probably the scariest thing I’ve done in my life. But we are out ! Thank you for all the encouraging words. I know we have a long road of recovery ahead of us, i don’t know if I’ll ever be the same. But I know that I’m on a path and that’s the most I can do. 






***********

I write this just seeking encouragement, there’s enough shame and blame in me to last a lifetime and all I want is to be heard. I (30f) was involved in an emotionally, mentally & physically abusive relationship for 3 1/2 years. He was a narcissist and constantly gaslit me to a point where I didn’t trust my own thoughts anymore. I had low self esteem and we share daughter (2f) so I stood. 

In January of this year I found the courage to leave and stay with a friend. During this time my ex would claim he was in therapy & AA. He said he was getting better and wanted me to come back to his home island with our child so that he can be close to her. He’s always been terrible with me but he has treated our daughter well. He even came to visit us on 2 occasions one being his birthday and one being hers. And he treated us wonderfully. 

I really thought he was improving. So come early July when my friend said I couldn’t live in her home anymore, my ex decided to step in. He said he was better and that he had a home for us to move to. We spoke about our boundaries, are expectations and agreed that we both wanted to best for our daughter. He said he wanted to attempt to right his wrongs and i foolishly decide to believe him. 

As soon as I stepped off the plane I knew the mistake I had made. His attitude was completely different, and I was looking at the old him again. He began calling other girls and making plans to see them in front of me. When I commented on it he called me names and began punching the walls and intimidating me. He said awful things and I found myself feeling so small again. 

Over these 7 months I thought I had healed, and in the matter of 7 seconds he destroyed it all. I began doubting my own memories and if our conversations even happened or if I had made them up. I realized he got in my head again. But I’m not as weak as I used to be. It’s only been 4 days and I’m already making an exit plan. This time I’m gone for good. I’m just so embarrassed, ashamed, hurt, and disappointed. I can’t believe I let him fool me again."

"i know it’s much easier said than done, but try to give yourself some grace. you are not a fool for going back - it just goes to show how much of a master manipulator these abusers are. your kind heart, your ability to empathize and to see someone’s potential, your desire to hope for the best and trust someone’s word - those are among the reasons you stayed. those are all beautiful qualities that i hope you never lose or hold back on in the future because of this awful experience. unfortunately those same qualities sometimes keep us sticking around longer, going that extra mile (or 1000) to make sure the other person feels taken care of, their needs met and put first. 

i can relate to these feelings of shame and guilt so much and i know so many others can too. if it was easy to just walk away, there wouldn’t be so many others who could relate to this same horrific situation. but this should tell you that you are not alone. draw strength from that. don’t be disappointed in yourself. look forward and be so proud of yourself for having the courage to put yourself first, because you deserve that full, beautiful, happy life - you just have to trust yourself enough to let this be possible.

you walking away is you loving yourself, even if it hurts more than it feels like the right thing right now. the permanence feels scary and daunting and sometimes insurmountable but hopefully one day those fear-based feelings that we’ve become so accustomed to will one day transform into feelings of hope and excitement for all of the possibilities ahead. you are setting such an incredible example for your daughter by this decision - you are teaching her that self-worth and self-love are of the utmost importance. i wish both of you all the very best on your healing journey 💜💜"	Hinamar	reply	na	na	na	0.0024202701169997454	weak	no	no	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.

I’m no where near in a place to date anyone new and I don’t want to. I’m still hung up on my former bf that I still love and I don’t really my consider myself to be single even though he does. I want more children but I’ve dealt with too much abuse and heartbreak the last 3 years to even be emotionally available to anyone but my son. I feel like the connection between him and I is still there but we can’t legally talk or be around each other right now because of an RO. I’m just a depressed mess all the time because of it. Idk why I fell in love with a man nearly 10 years my junior but I did and it’s ruined me mentally and emotionally. Sometimes I’m not really sure who I am anymore because I just feel so lost over him. Being numb would feel better than feeling all this pain but I can’t numb myself. I just need to heal and I have no clue how long that’s gonna take. I don’t even want to have sex with anyone unless it’s him. That’s how messed up my head is.		reply	na	na	na	0.997901201248169	no	strong	no	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.

"It changed me into a completely different person and I hate him more everyday that my husband has to fix a heart he didn’t break. 

I started listening to alot of healing music one of my favorite artists is Lauren Spencer-Smith. Specifically the song “aftermath” 

“How did I become the toxic one?
I keep on tryin' to unlearn
The person I've become
Why did I ignore all of the signs?
You went from someone I admired
Someone I despise”

“Instead of running, I waited
For you to care enough to fix yourself
Ain't it ironic, now it's me that needs the help?
So even when I'm fine
I can't tell
If I'm happy or I'm sad
'Cause no one ever talks about the aftermath”

You pack a bag of essentials, clothes, small toiletries and food that are easy to carry don’t go bad, a small knife for protection and leave.

Anyone that will absolutely not call your mom but is safe? I agree. Forget CPS and don’t tell her you are leaving at all!!!! Just be normal and get the stuff mentioned above. I’d add phone charger and money. Write down numbers of people you can call in case of emergency. You lose your phone, you won’t access numbers. I also would add email yourself the safety plan you have had and what part you are enacting and why to yourself. But make sure you use an email she doesn’t have access to. I would worry about this part later. But This way you got a record. It can be part of the journal. How old are you or what age range? It might help us with advising you. But overall leave. The sooner the better and don’t come back. If she’s trying to kill you -refuse to return and don’t fall for apology.  Absolutely though, you need to leave. Get some where safe.

I just read your age.

I’m going to be honest if you are scared for your life and decide to leave you need to know for a person your age it is going to be very dangerous.

"Someone your age leaving will be dangerous- I agree. Here is what the National Hotline Runaway Hotline states below. If you call and you think she is monitoring you in some way, are you able to use someone else’s phone. 

I can’t advise you not to follow the directions below. However, I think you should find somewhere safe to go to folks that will be able to allow you to stay with them regardless if your mother is notified. I know that CPS in some states will elect minors to stay somewhere safe —like a relative— if/when they investigate. 

If you are uncomfortable with this, you might want to leave and go to a safe place where calling police, CPS, and mom will be based on your comfort level. But that person needs to be a safe person. Not a boyfriend or some one that can take advantage of your age and vulnerability. 

But start with this hotline and plan to leave to get to somewhere safe as soon as possible. No one should be threating or trying to kill you. Absolutely leave and go some where safe. 

 

“Running away can be dangerous. If you are under 18, the police will most likely require you to go back home unless there is clear evidence that there is a risk of immediate harm or serious injury to a child. If you are being abused, it is important to notify the police/Child Protective Services (CPS) of the abuse so that an investigation can take place. Another great resource that provides confidential advice and referrals to local support is the National Runaway Safeline: call 1-800-786-2929 or text 66008.”"	LavenderCakes14	reply	na	na	na	0.9978737831115723	weak	no	strong	na	domesticviolence	failed

Hi everyone, so today me and my boyfriend were in the car and I was talking to him and he was just on his phone basically not even paying attention or giving me any type of feedback, so I grabbed his phone and put it behind me and he started saying give me it, give me it, and so then I said no look at me while I am talking to you and then I will give it to you and then when I looked up he slapped me in the face and said give it to me and I was so shocked I gave it to him and then I just said never do that ever again and then after I slapped him, because I was honestly mad, because why would you do that? That’s so rude and I know it wasn’t right of me to hit back and I should’ve been the bigger person but I just did it out of instinct, then he punched me in my ear with a full fist and said don’t hit me and I won’t hit you. He is not born here. He was born in Armenia and moved here 2 years ago and I know touching in general is not right and there’s no excuse to it, but is there some type of cultural thing that he thinks it’s OK to do that? I am Persian, so we are pretty similar and I know in general it’s not right to hit a woman. Again I know this shouldn’t be an excuse but I’m just curious because I just can’t believe it. I am 20 years old and he is 25 but also please don’t say anything about the age difference because I believe I am pretty mature, I graduated with my bachelors of science in nursing when I was 19 years old and all my friends are around 26 to 30 so being around the age group of my friends and the university life really matured me.

"Firstly it is not right to hit anyone, not just women.

It sounds as though you lack communication within your relationship. Would it not have been  a better, less aggressive action to ask ""Do you mind just leaving your phone for a minute as I need to talk to you about something""

Snatching someone's phone from their possession is also a form of abuse and theft, this kind of behaviour is not ok. He asked you multiple times to hand back his phone, but you never. Not all abuse is physical, manipulation and isolation are also kinds of abuse that you in fact used. Now this absolutely doesn't give him the right to hit you or for you to hit him but it is important to see where the abuse started, which was with you. We need to recognise abusive behaviours both in ourselves and others.

Moving on from this, I think you both need to sit down and discuss what is acceptable and unacceptable within the relationship, how to acknowledge when the other needs their attention and the best course of action to take when that person does not feel like they are getting the attention they need from the other, like a statement where you both know the other needs to talk "" Hey, I know you're busy, but could you please help with this, discuss this"" etc.

It would also be a good idea to get advice from a professional to help each of you see that you undertake behaviours that aren't acceptable and how to transform these into behaviours much more acceptable in a relationship."	silence1802	reply	na	na	na	0.9989655017852783	weak	no	no	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.

"Ghost him, or break up via text if you must, but do not break up in person. When you break it off, make sure he never finds you again. He is dangerous and will ruin your life if you stick around. You need to make sure he cannot get to you. Victims of domestic violence are more likely to be murdered when trying to leave the relationship. They are also more likely to be ""hoovered"" back into the relationship by various manipulations. They use apologies, tears, threatening suicide, etc. They love bomb you to pull you back in, where escalated abuse awaits (because you tried to leave). It becomes a vicious cycle and is more difficult to escape as time passes. If you hold your ground and they can contact you, they'll harass you, stalk you, lie about you, try to get you in trouble with the police. You name it.  It is better if you go no contact for life.

"Last week, my boyfriend of several years assaulted me. I called the cops and he was arrested. Since then, I’ve chosen to go forward with a protective order and pressing charges. I’m still in the house for a few more days to pack up and get all of my things. 

The day after it happened, I called the only domestic violence resource in my large city. They told me they were busy and would get back to me. At this point, they’ve still not reached out again. The last two times I reached out to this organization (during past incidents in the same relationship), they didn’t return my calls. 

My friends aren’t checking in and helping me and neither is my family, despite them all knowing what happened and promising help. This is the exact scenario that has stopped me from leaving so many times.

I'm not sure where you are from but my area has a community outreach program via 211.....if not, maybe reach out to the police via the non emergency line..the police dept in my town has a domestic violence outreach worker that works as a liaison between victims and other agencies .it's a long shot I know. Otherwise, keep calling friends and family. I don't know about your specific circumstances but i think sometimes people are hesitant to help because they think you will just go back to your abuser again. No matter if they help or not keep in contact with them and let them know what is going on. Dont let your abuser isolate you from them.

"I'm so sorry to hear your going through that on your own. Feel free to drop me a line if you want to chat.

It is a lonely path, even if you have family and friends to support you. Even more lonely, if you don't. 

You will likely find yourself fighting ""the system"", a lot! Police is useless, the law is patchy, the whole sector is massively underfunded, etc...  It will be frustrating, it will be infuriating. My advise is - hold on to that rage. Let youself to be really angry - sometime it's the best fuel you can have. 

I had a couple of day when I regretted. Not leaving him, more like doing it so much under the impulse (it was a scary night...). Could I have waited 2 more months and play it more wisely? Perhaps. Could something really bad happen to me over that time? Perhaps...

I think that if you found yourself in a situation in which you had to call the police and go with a protective order that means you must have had a freaking good reason to do so... If you've done it - you probably just had to to it. Trust your guts. It's heard after years of ignoring your instinct (I guess everyone in abusive relationship learnt perfectly how to numb feeling inside them telling them to just run away). But even if it feels lonely now, you're free. The battle is not over yet but the most difficult step is already behind you. 

Check out Bloom by Chayan. They have great resources on healing but they seem to be very international and might be able to signpost you to some other organisations in your area. There's a very friendly chat there, too, so I sometimes use it when I feel crap and lonely.

" My (28F) best friend has been with her (30m) boyfriend for 12 years, and I have serious concerns that the relationships is toxic, unhealthy and heading into DV territory. 

For context: 

They met when they were 17 and 19 respectively, and the relationship started off fine… He has always had mental health issues (potentially bipolar), however I never suspected that the relationship was toxic due to this until around 5 years ago, when he became a lot more mentally unstable, cut off all of his friends and became completely reliant on her for all of his needs. There was a long period of time where he couldn’t hold down a job, as there was always something wrong with the boss. It was never him, the world was simply out to get him. Thankfully, he found a job he really enjoyed (a dive bar that allowed him to be himself, something that is crucial for his wellbeing) and found a crowd of friends through that job which meant that my bff could have some reprieve from having to be his only person. Unfortunately though, he was still showing toxic traits: ie - calling her every half an hour when she went out somewhere (even though they live together), speaking to her disrespectfully in public, having emotional outbursts at her, forcing her to leave parties early with him, and generally controlling/questionable behaviour. 

In the past, he’s also made passing comments about their sex life to me and other friends of my best friend, saying that “she doesn’t want his dick, and he could have a line of girls waiting to have his dick if they were to break up”, which is unhinged behaviour considering he was saying this to HER friends. 

He is unpleasant to be around, and many people find his personality overbearing, and people (especially my bff), has to walk on eggshells around him because he is susceptible to having emotional outbursts and socially inappropriate. To be completely honest, he is a loser and she is a literal goddess who could have anyone she wants. It breaks my heart because if you look at their relationship over the 12-year period, you can see how much she has changed, from being this incredibly confident, fiery girl who would always call out behaviour, to now having low self esteem, a loss of identity, and so much more introverted than how she used to be. Her light has gone out... I want to also mention an added complex layer to this: She lost her mum to brain cancer 3 years ago, and it so happened that her BF also lost his dad to cancer....a week apart. and in the same hospital, which created this trauma bond between them, and he always talks about how it must be fate that they are together, and have to remain together because of it. 

I am writing this because last night when I was hanging out with both of them, they had an argument which was triggered by his lack of social awareness when talking about someone he didn’t like like (a constant thing), which led to him storming off, telling my bff to fuck off and storming out of the bar to who knows where. Just really aggressive behaviour that makes me realise that the way he acts in public, is probably tenfold worse behind close doors. 

Note: My friend and I tried to imply that we didn’t think her relationship was healthy a few years ago during a one-on-one dinner with her, but she shut it down quickly/didn’t want to get into it. 

**TL;DR**: My best friend has been in a 12-year relationship with an unstable, mentally unhealthy partner. He shows toxic behaviour, calls her incessantly, and makes inappropriate comments. Recently, he had an aggressive outburst in public, raising concerns about what happens behind closed doors. I want to help her, but previous attempts to discuss it were shut down.

This is going to sound harsh, but the reality is even if this is happening to your friend, there is nothing you can do to help her until she wants to help herself. My advice for you and her other friends is to be there for her as a shoulder to cry on, to vent to and even though at times it may feel like you are a broken record just still try to be there for her. It will become even harder for her to leave if this is happening if she has no friends to help. He wins if she becomes completely isolated.	ivegot_brainrot	reply	na	na	na	0.9986446499824524	weak	no	no	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.
Yeah - it really feels like this is something she will need to come to realise herself, I just feel worried about how much harder it will be for her to leave after this long. But you’re right - I guess all I can do is tell her that I’m here for her, for when (hopefully) she finally leaves him.	ivegot_brainrot	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9986446499824524	weak	strong	no	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.

I completely understand and empathize with this, if it takes a toll on you mentally then you definitely need to take time for yourself. As a friend I would never want my problems to take their toll on you. I think you tell her just like you said, you love her and will always be there for her but for your own sanity you need a break. Let her know if there’s an emergency you are always just a call or text away. It’s very hard to be the friend of someone who’s in an abusive relationship. When i was in my relationship, I stopped telling my friends what was happening because I knew I wasn’t going to change my situation at that time and didn’t want to put them in a bad place.	ivegot_brainrot	reply	na	na	na	0.9986446499824524	weak	no	no	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.
I posted a few days ago about me being considered high risk of death by a refuge caseworker. Now I have an IDVA and they have referred me into marac. However, I have recently found out that my abuser and father have been communicating, and that they have arranged for him to take our daughter out for the day today. The IDVA, police and social worker say he's not allowed around either of us. But my dad doesn't understand and is putting my daughter at risk. Who knows what he can do to her? Plus, once children's social services find out, it can lead to child protection procedures. I don't understand why my dad is doing this. I can't risk my daughter being hurt in anyway. I also don't want her to go into foster care. I really need to move out the house.	ghanaianbrit	post	59.007201654433416	female	White	0.998350977897644	na	na	na	11	domesticviolence	no prediction.

I attempted to restrain her at first because she was gassed up and intended to do severe physical harm and could have easily left me paralyzed or worse with that initial blow since she was using a heavy blunt item and it was completely out of nowhere and caught me very much off guard. After she was subdued on the bed, all still while struggling to punch kick knee and scratch eventually she wore herself out cooled of for a minute called a girlfriend them was right back for round 2.

My boyfriend did EVERYTHING for me. He has helped me financially, he has done an incredible amount of physical labor helping me with my house, he takes me on dates, enjoys doing new things. We have fun. 90% of the time, it is the perfect relationship. Admittedly I have made some mistakes but I have always felt that his reactions have been disproportionate. He resorts to the cruelest of verbal attacks, screaming and minimizing me as a person. He talks to me as if I am a horrible person using and manipulating him so that I can squeeze just a little bit more out of him. When I get tired of hearing how horrible I am and try to call off the relationship, his anger increases tenfold. I am afraid that he will eventually escalate to physical violence. It’s been a year and I keep thinking “if he was going to, he would have by now” but I don’t know how true that really is. I’ve been fishtailing on whether I should run or try to work it out. To be clear, I called the relationship off. He wants to reconcile and I am unsure.

"I think if he is making you feel unsafe with how extreme his reactions are, that is in general not a good sign.

Do you really feel like you deserve to be screamed at every time you make a mistake? 
Do you want that for yourself, or kids if you have them?

What kind of father is a guy who’s perfect 90% of the time, except for the 10% when he crushes a child’s self esteem, becomes their first bully, and makes them feel like a horrible person for wronging him in some way?

Emotional violence isn’t really ever appropriate unless it’s in defense of yourself and even then it should only be used to remove yourself from the violence you’re defending against. 

Sometimes, for those of us who have lacked real security/consistency in life, we cling to people who give us even the slightest amount of effort in hopes of filling that need and solving that imbalance. 

No amount of consistency is worth sticking around for if you just get screamed at 10% of the time. No good partner is perfect, but when people are saying that, they mean flaws like forgetting important things sometimes or being a little selfish in certain ways.

It’s totally unacceptable, and I broke up with him. I am not having a good time finding somewhere to go. For now I’ve booked an Airbnb for a month but it’s not feasible as a long term plan. He promises to change, and it does seem more genuine now than in previous similar fights, but I just don’t know. He went through my phone recently despite me saying that it would be a dealbreaker, relationship ending choice early on in our relationship. I just don’t know.	manicpixiedeadpool1	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9689740538597107	no	strong	no	na	domesticviolence	failed

"It sounds like he’s just had more time to know your tells and where to manipulate your weak points. He only seems more genuine because his own desperation is up. He knows he went too far too soon to keep it going.

That is how the cycle of abuse works. Its a wheel. They love bomb you, things are great, stress occurs, they lose it, they take it out on you little by little until they really explode. You suffer shock and trauma, your system goes into survival mode and you start thinking about escape, then they coax you right back with the best apology. “I’m so awful, I can’t believe I did that, I’ll never do it again. I’m such a piece of shit I can’t believe you love me.” Then it starts all over.

If that sounds familiar, run. Get your place back. Use the money from renting out your house to rent a different place, put things in storage whatever you’ve got to do. 

He’s trying to make you into a thing he can play with and throw away. He doesn’t actually have the emotional maturity to see you as a person or an equal. Going through your phone,  ignoring your privacy and autonomy, trying to force you to get fucked in the ass so he can live out some porn fantasy? This is all controlling behavior.

"Thank you. 

I need so much reassurance that I know how to decipher the writing on the wall. 

There have been some smaller red flags, but I started to really pay attention when he started throwing “respect” around. 

I also paid attention when he yelled at me to the point of tears and avoiding eye contact. He said that I needed to stop being so sensitive and demanded that I deal with his poor communication skills. 

I paid attention when I seriously contemplated throwing myself out of the car during an argument. 

I paid attention when I felt so verbally cornered that I felt myself wanting to resort to physical violence. I took it out on myself instead, hitting myself in the head and legs. My legs hurt for over a week. It was deeply concerning to me to feel this level of distress. 

I paid attention when he used my flaws against me, to degrade me. When he joked that I looked pregnant because I’m overweight.

"For a lot of people “respect” just means “fear what I will do to you if you don’t give me what I want.”

You don’t tell people to respect you. Respect is only ever given, either you give it to yourself, or people give it to you for being respectable. People who demand respect deserve none.

I know this is probably a common thing you hear tossed around, but when you’re ready to look into it, therapy with a psychologist with a doctorate is going to help. If you’re lucky with a decent job and insurance, look into someone who has experience helping people with trauma through whatever health care website your work HR packet have you.

I’m not a professional, but I’ve seen enough at this point to say you probably can’t accept it because there’s something you feel is unfinished or that you need from his love.

One of the hardest things in life is accepting situations when we can’t get closure and must live in ambiguity, never knowing the answer. 

I can tell you from experience sometimes the answer isn’t what you thought, and you don’t get what you think you needed at all. A lot of times the answer is it’s no one’s fault. If you’re having trouble accepting this because you feel like it needs to be worse for you to walk away, ask yourself why you feel you need to hurt so much to deserve to be happy?

The good news is that if you stick with this boundary and get away from him and leave this whole thing behind, you’ll know from now on where you stand. Where a good boundary is, you’ll read and remember signs he had and see them in other people and you won’t make the same mistake again. 

You will make all new mistakes 😅 but that’s just life, we fuck up, we learn. Being perfect is a stupid fantasy and the people who try to pretend for it are lying and often hiding something they would fall apart if everyone knew about or saw.

As far as your body image, only you can be the judge of that. It’s your body. Fuck what anyone else has to say about it (except you know, a doctor). If you don’t like where you’re at with a little extra weight, work on it, but please also try to accept and love yourself where you’re at. I’ve been a little overweight most of my life because I would self-soothe with food. I’m just getting to where I want now. It’s been hard but worth it. I tell you, earning it for yourself makes it something you’ll never take for granted. People whose genes are good from either being born rich or living in nice places or both can take that for granted, but they’ll never have the character of what it is to take your body back from an unhealthy place.

You may not even be at an unhealthy weight. I’ve seen so many awful men fat shame their girlfriends for having a little cush on their toosh. Everyone likes a juicy butt."	manicpixiedeadpool1	reply	na	na	na	0.9689740538597107	no	no	no	na	domesticviolence	failed

The feeling that you “deserved it” from experience doesn’t tend to go away any time soon.  It is a coping mechanism.  It’s a way for you to justify everything -‘The reason you stayed for as long as you did, because you deserved it’ etc etc.  However what I will say is that mind over matter will eventually kick in.  You will eventually put your trust in someone new who will allow the darker thoughts to become easier to dismiss.  I often think whether I would change that part of my life given have the chance and I always come back to no.  Simply because it shaped me into who I am today.  The memories will stay.  The bad thoughts become easier to cope with.  Keep going, it will get easier,  I promise 💙		reply	na	na	na	0.0022517552133649588	weak	no	no	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.

He refused to legally marry me bc he didn't want my name on anything but he tricked me into having a fake wedding to make others think we were married.

"Depending on what country you're in, you could be considered ""equivalent to married"" which would give you the same consideration in splitting assets. You should be able to do a google search for this as it pertains to your location. You could be entitled to a 50% split. If there is a paper/ digital trail of where your own money went this would likely be taken into consideration. A divorce lawyer could answer questions about assets and debt in more precise terms. 

Either way, start over now. Take things one step at a time. Make sure he has no access to anything of yours-- email, financial accounts, tax stuff, nothing.

Literally one day at a time.  Time heals…but it gets worse before it gets better - at least it did for me.  I stayed too long and felt trapped…then he brutally attacked/ beat me in public and in the presence of our kids.  Finally there were several external witnesses and I had the support I needed to get out.  5 years later and the criminal trial just concluded last Oct but I’m still being pulled into probate at least twice a year over visitation timeline - he doesn’t agree with the court ordered therapy and supervised visitation.  He doesn’t even want the kids (never did - in hindsight he got me pregnant both times after i had tried to leave him) but he wants to win and wants to keep up his perfectly curated image (narcissist to the core).  It’s hard.  But I am free and don’t have to worry about every thing I do upsetting him anymore.  My house is peaceful, no yelling or the constant calling me a bitch or cunt for nothing.

"its hard, its good you at least know that you need to, but don't be too hard on yourself for not doing it faster, you need to try to find the right time and hope he doesnt choose the time for you.   Mine's last tantrum involved flying glass hitting our 8 year old son and him screaming profanities and irrelevant racial and ablest slurs at both of us while chasing me around the house hitting me and trying to knock me down when i tried to get a broom to clean it up.  It sure did make leaving easier? Even the court advocate said I would have had a harder time using past abuses to get a restraining order months later, but i would have rather left before started turning on both of us instead of just me.  i was starting to feel like shit about not sticking with my plan from months before, regardless, and feeling like i was just making excuses.  I am starting to feel bad for him again but i got a 1 year no contact order for a reason (which he broke today to text about seeing the kid cuz its his birthday, and i'm sad but f him) and i will stick to it.  i spent too long like that.

the best advice i got, other than all of the meaningful and supportive comments from the wonderful people here, was from my brother.  He told me that if i wasnt sure i was committed to leaving that the best thing i could do was to make a plan for what i would do if i DID leave.  And i did that, i had a few scenarios lined up, all of which I failed to pull off on the timeline i wanted (after winter, in case he ended up homeless) and in a way in which he would not have my car (i couldn't drive our truck confidently).

"July 22nd 2023

I don’t usually write on Reddit. I tried but deleted it. I’m scared for my life, I feel like I’ve exhausted my resources and even when I used them and stupidly tried to be compassionate I put myself in the position I am now. In august of 2022 I met a guy via fb and we had alot of mutual friends. I ignored him the first time he hit me up but stupidly entertained him the second time and decided to meet. From then we were together everyday. He was in a halfway house situation and ended up getting kicked out due to being intoxicated. I ended up letting him come live with me and that was the worst decision I ever made. When he first moved in he stole my car and wrecked it in a high speed chase. I let him stay bc he said he would replace it. When I found out he was cheating on me, I tried to kick him out and he choked me. My mom came just in time to prevent him from beating me. Ever since then every-time he gets angry and it gets violent it’s worse than before. It went from choking, to pulling my hair, to slapping, to biting my ear, to hitting me closed fist (the last two in the same incident, I was not prepared for that mentally). He says I’m not a battered woman because he barely leaves marks but the pain is still there when it’s all over. I’m skipping over a lot bc I want this to be a journal. Im gonna revisit everything in the future (prob when I wake up) but for now I just wanna get out what I’m currently sleepless over so I can hopefully get some type of sleep.

The other day he asked me to keep liqour away from him. I was to only give him two WINE COOLERS a day. Today I got home from work and he asked me to give him one after drinking atleast 5 already throughout the day. I repeated what he told me the other day and went to go sit down in my room. I work a long hard job so I be tired after work. When I sat down he came in my room 30 secs later asking did I want him to act out. He had that look in his eye and I asked him what did I do. He said exist. Then he said “what did I just ask you to do”. I was going to do it seeing how angry he got but it was like it was too late. He blocked the door so I wouldn’t walk away from him. At this point I know not to walk away because it makes him want to hit me. To him it’s disrespectful. So I don’t. I spent 15 minutes listening to him speak horribly to me, threaten me, basically tell me things about myself that I’m confident is not true. It was like being a kid again, and being disciplined for something you know you shouldn’t be disciplined for. Like getting a whooping for no reason by a parent who just wants to whoop you. He found his lost gun today and after hearing him say that I no longer feel safe. I’m scared for my life. If I die, he killed me. Im leaving these behind for when it happens. 

It’s 4:01 am. I can’t sleep. I’m scared for my life..I’m sorry if this isn’t the right place for this. I just needed some type of outlet. I feel alone because I constantly let him come back when I was already done. This time he came back using the excuse of getting a shower and spazzed when I asked when he’s leaving so I haven’t even told no one that he’s here. I’m so disappointed in myself and the person this is making me into."	Jazzlike_Ship_6032	post	13.129322779925303	female	White	0.9988368153572083	na	na	na	28	domesticviolence	no prediction.

File a restraining order ASAP.

i’m so sorry you’re going through this. i read some of your comments about how your aunt is coming to get you and I think this is the time to get away. please be honest with your family and let them know you’re scared for your life. i would suggest letting your aunt and maybe another man or other family members try to get him out of the house- DO NOT GO WITH THEM. i know all the logistical things like the fact that it’s your apartment and such feel important but no inconvenience is worth risking your safety. you need to try and get a protective order in place that will have him removed from your home and then you need to move. explain to your landlord the situation and they should let you break your lease. there are laws/statutes that allow for breaking leases for free due to domestic violence. you are in grave danger and at this point you need to do anything it takes to get away- even if that means staying with family or friends. if your family can go to your place tomorrow and try to get him out, maybe they can also grab your cats. reach out to a DV organization in your area and talk to an advocate who can help you create a safety plan and walk through how to get a protective order. stay safe ❤️	Jazzlike_Ship_6032	reply	na	na	na	0.9988368153572083	strong	no	no	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.

I am a dv advocate and you are being mentally and physically abused. Only you can make yourself leave the situation, no one can do it for you. He is using you and gas lighting you and you need to go. It won't ever get better so you know what you have to do. Go to a shelter and give yourself a new lease on life. It's up to you how you want to live.

"My story was THE SAME situation, halfway house he got kicked our of, moved in with me because he had nowhere to go, wrecking my car. Literally all of it. Shit. I feel like you're my trauma twin. 

That being said, the one thing that finally made things click for me was my best friend telling me ""his story is the way it is because he's made it that way"". His previous broken relationships, jail, halfway house, etc. It was because of his choices he made to get himself that. History repeated itself when he started to hit me just like he had done in his violent past that he was ""rehabilitated"" from. These types of people, especially THESE types, do NOT change. If he was in a halfway house im assuming he has addiction issues and he's continuing to act on those impulses by drinking. Something I learned from AA (went on my own accord, not court ordered) was ""you ain't done until you're done"". He ain't done. 

Please take it from me as someone who has walked literally right in your shoes, seemingly every step, it doesn't get better and you have to walk away. My story ends months after I broke up with him because he finally pushed me enough to have him arrested, and after months in jail, within 2 weeks of him getting released he was kicking down my front door. Had him arrested again, and on felony charges. Please do not let it get to that point. 

I didn't try to make this a ME thing. Your words resonate with me so strongly I just had to share. Your outcome, if you go down the path I did and stay beyond reason, which you already gave, is likely to end up the same way mine did, or worse. Please get out. If you need help finding resources I can help you. 

I know you've probably only tried to help him better his life. And I know it sucks when you put THAT much thought into someone else's well being just for them to treat you this way. You didn't have to let him move in, but you did. It really is the worst when you think you're helping someone and doing good for them just to quite literally get a slap in the face.

Stop beating yourself up - it will only make you lose self-confidence.  The chemical addiction of a toxic, abusive relationship is stronger than drugs.  Obviously you need to get him out of your life and go No Contact - you know this and I hope you do it.  No Contact is the only way to find peace and heal.  For the short term call an 800 DV help number or a DV shelter in your area.  Make a plan to get out.

TW PHYSICAL VIOLENCE

Smh can’t even go to work without drama. I told my auntie about what’s been going on and she said he reminds her of her of abusive ex. I also talked to my cousin and she says I just need to evict us both and run. 

He’s really trying to strong arm me into getting a rental so he can find a job. If I don’t get the rental it’s my fault he’s not working and not able to leave the house. And it’s making him crazier. 

This morning before work he asked me for my vape and I told him no because I’m going to work and want it throughout the day. For some reason he feels entitled to my things and I do share a lot (mostly because he’ll gangsta it from me and I won’t have a choice) but this set him off. Again. He pushed me on the bed and ripped my earphones out of my ear and tried to take my phone. The only thing that kept it from escalating is the fact that my mom was outside waiting to take me to work. 

The fact that this little thing set him off to the point of intimidating me is scary. I got a big sun of money coming and I plan on using that to move out of state. He has a gun in my crib and I really feel like he would try to rob me. 

I think I’m going to tell my apartments I’m going to move out and try to get me some type paper to get him to leave. Idk an fake eviction notice or something."	Jazzlike_Ship_6032	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9988368153572083	no	strong	no	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.

I’ve called the police before as well as my neighbors (that’s why I speak on resources) he was trespassed and the last time I called he got sent to jail but they wouldn’t take his stuff. The officer also yelled at me for letting him back (the reason i did that time was bc he wasn’t safe at the only other place he has to go. It literally has bullet holes in the front doors). They left the responsibility of him getting his things back on me (I was to give him his stuff when he got out). I met him at the beach and he gave me all these apologies then asked for a shower bc he hasn’t had one in days. When I asked when he was leaving he spazzed on me and got violent like he didn’t just put his hands on me days before and landed in jail. He’s been back for about two weeks..I can’t call the police or I’ll get evicted since he’s trespassed so I feel stuck.

It’s my apartment so I feel like I can’t just leave and I have my two cats here. I can’t abandon them at all. We don’t have a car and he doesn’t work so he just sits here and play the game all day. He’ll peep if I try to do any type of packing and I feel like that would really get me killed. I’ve never been in a dv relationship so the snap I see in his eyes and personality is crazy and instant. He gets triggered when he feels like he has no options and he literally has none besides the place with bulletholes in the door and he desperately don’t want to go there.

"Yeah that is completely fair, I wouldn't want you to put yourself at risk at all! Personally I also had to plan for a year (pretty much just waited for an opportunity where he moved further away) to be in a good position to leave safely. 

You could possibly talk to police discreetly and see if they would come to help you get your items out of the apartment. You could then possibly stay with family or at a shelter until you get back on your feet. 

Where I live we have legislation that protects renters who have had to leave before the lease is up because of DV. Possibly you have some protections there that may be useful. 

I would also try speaking to a DV organisation because they may have ideas/advice relevant to what is available in your area. 

The situation you are in is very tricky because he seems very volatile and dangerous. It will probably best to plan and make sure everything is in order to get out safetly.

No I have a family reunion today. I literally have not been able to sleep since he said he wanted to beat me just for existing so now my aunt is on her way to come get me early. I just cracked and told her what I told y’all and will speak deeper into it when I get with her. Hopefully she can help me get him out today (which I think she will based on her past experiences and the energy she’s giving me).

Another thing I did after getting the RO - he was ordered to leave the house (we were married with 2 kids) but I wasn’t going to stay there with the kids because I didn’t feel safe.  I was blessed to be able to move in with family until I got back on my feet.  I hired a local police officer in town to come to the house while I went with a moving truck and packed my stuff up.  I could only afford an hour (@200 an hour) and that was money lent to me since he made sure I never had access to my money.  I felt much safer with the officer there though.

"I can’t even remember the first time he put his hands on me to be honest. I only remember certain moments from some of the incidents. I just wanted to put some of these things out there because it feels so embarrassing but I need it out of my head and somewhere else. He threw the cat litter on me, so much of it and it was used. Stuck all in my hair and face. The smell, it took me so long to be okay around the cat litter because the smell took me back. He yelled and said some awful taunting things. 

He pushed me through a door and then blamed me for breaking it one time. 

He choked me several times. Grabbed my arms and shook me so bad leaving huge bruises on both arms that had his fingerprints. 

He throws me and pushes me around, I’ve been shoved up against walls. I’ve had pillows and blankets on me, trying to suffocate me i guess. He’s covered my mouth so many times as well. Can’t forget getting spit on. 

I think he has sa’d and r worded me on several occasions but I hate calling that stuff that.

Almost 9 years I have lived a nightmare. A nightmare that progressively gets worse. It took me a very long time to realize he was abusing me. I blamed myself for everything and I still have moments in which I blame myself. I’m tired of living in flight or fight 24/7. I’m so burnt out. This man has treated me like garbage for so long and I’m so damn tired of it. He has cheated on me the entire time (women and men). He doesn’t pay his bills and spends his money on god knows what while I’m stuck covering what I can. I’m the primary one providing for our kids. He got all of these pets and won’t take care of them or help with them financially. He has drained me of everything so I can’t afford to leave. This housing market completely screwed me because there are no affordable apartments in my area. I’m hoping between what I save and what my tax return is I’ll be able to move next spring, and it kills me knowing that I’m stuck until then. I just want to be happy. Not worry about if the house is getting foreclosed on or if I’m going to get an std from one of the many people he has cheated on me with. I’m tired of being stressed out about how I’ll pay for the kids expenses or how I’ll be able to afford groceries this week. I’m tired of him bringing up my sexual abuse while we are having sex for him to get off on it or bringing up women he has cheated on me with while we doing it to try to get me to agree to a threesome.  Like wtf how is this my life? And why is it so hard to leave and start new? I just want to start new. Sorry just needed to get this off my chest.

Sounds like you are getting yourself into an empowered headspace to get free. It’s really difficult to rise above the gaslighting and manipulation. I hope something comes up for you to be able to get away soon. Harder with kids for sure. Would you consider looking into a shelter? They have resources.

"When I was in a domestic violence relationship sometimes I would get away from him and just go home to my parents. At the time (I was in the relationship) I didn't notice some things that stand out to me now. 

For example, when I'd get home I would sleep for days (2-3 days at a time) but then I would either get stalked and just give in by going back to him. One day my mother called me a masseur (to the house) because I was in writhering in pain. My poor mother having to see her daughter go through that must have been horrible. I can't imagine seeing my daughter like that. 
  
Another example was how I would walk around looking paranoid. This one was brought to my attention because of the way I would look around as if I was being followed, but that's how I felt because he was stalking me. 

Sometimes.m, right before I would see him, my stomach and/or head would begin to ache, my palms would get sweaty, and I would begin to get anxiety. 

The most overwhelming symptom I would get is the feeling of defeat. I felt defeated by him because no matter what I did he was going to do whatever it took for me to go with him. And what would he do? On more than one occasion he would stand across the street from my parents home and just call my name - my niece called the police in him and stood out there until the police showed up. He would follow me and then catch me off guard to scare me. 

This nightmare was overwhelming and felt like it would never end. And I am not going to lie, sometimes it would be me who went to him. However, it has been almost ten years and what I have described feels as though I just lived it yesterday. Those feelings are that strong so for those who are in the first stages of leaving an abusive relationship - hang in there because you will get though this and one day you will be able to explain to someone in your shoes and hopefully help them."

"I think all you have described is quite normal given the abusive situation. Your body is in constant fight or flight mode, it throws off your cortisol levels, among many other things. It also exhausts you. So knowing you’re in a safe place (at your mother’s house) your body knew it could get much needed rest. The pain could be from living in constant tension. It takes such a toll on you. The “paranoid” state isn’t uncommon either. You’re just trying to be safe and you’re so used to the uncertainty and the danger.

"To keep things short and clear, my mom has been married to my dad for 23 (without counting time dating). He has been abusive since I can make memories. I grew up parenting the both of them as my dad would find ways to insert me into the arguments. Although thankfully, my little brother (12) and I (22), were never se*ually harmed, my mom was also abused in that way for 20 years because their culture taught them his pleasure was her duty. He was always verbally, mentally, emotionally, and financially abusive to all of us though. He would hide recording devices in our cars, cameras outside and inside of the house, once even trying to sneak one into a corner of my moms room, she thankfully spotted it quickly and smashed it with a hammer.  I have been in therapy due to everything i've had to deal with from a young age with my parents. All three of the therapists i've had believe he is a narcissist but obviously can't formally diagnose him as he isn't a patient. 

My mom finally moved out in May then filed for divorce. My dad has not been doing well with the divorce at all. The first week he harassed her for hours at her new apartment until she threatened to call the cops on him for a 3rd time. After that, he's been trying to do everything to harm and bother her. He called CPS on her, they found nothing. He has been living at home for the last 3 months without paying mortgage and tried to illegally take it out of her bank account by using an old check of hers that he found at the house. Thankfully her savings were in a secret account he did not know about, but her other account had her apartment rent money and then he overdraft we her 60THOUSAND DOLLARS. As a banker however, she was able to contact the right people immediately and get help from fraud department. 


Due to the divorce he has planned to go to Mexico and move there. I would also like to mention that I am only still on good terms with him because he has refused to give me my pet birds despite neglecting them. However, i'm finally supposed to get them back today since he ""plans on leaving"" in a week or two.

Now to the title; sorry for the long intro but with everything we've gone through, that's still the spark notes version. I could write a book on everything we've gone through with him. 

He called me yesterday, this is how the call went:


 
dad: hey you're gonna get an email for a reference, when you have a chance to fill it out please do

me: um okay, for work? why me? i don't work like that yet. why didn't you ask one of your old bosses:

dad: hahahaha no not for work 

me: for what?

dad: for a firearm background investigation 

me: umm-

dad: can you please fill that out when you get the chance they probably just want to know that i'm real i don't even know what they are going to say

me: ok

I hung up in shock after that. 

Now, my dad has never owned a g*n, in fact, he has always been extremely against them and hates them. And with all of the crazy shit he's been pulling to make this a nasty divorce. i'm actually fucking afraid. not for my life, for my mom's life.  It's also mega fucked up that he didn't even ask me if i was comfortable with it? he just put me down as a reference and asked me to do it. 


I have not submitted it yet, I had an emergency therapy session yesterday after he called. My therapist told me NJ has strict g*n laws and it would take 30 days to receive the permit but i saw on other places it said 3 days or 7 or 30. does anyone know which one it would be?

He is also currently starting to get upset at me because it's 11:30 am and I haven't filled the form yet since he called me about it yesterday at 3:00pm. 

1. I am afraid that he will be able to see everything I wrote. Since he told me that he will be notified once i complete it.
2. I am petrified that because he hasn't been previously convicted, isn't a regular drunkard, has no physical disabilities, and no formally diagnosed mental issues.... that he will still get the permit. 

I have filled out my reference form. on my notes app but i am too afraid to send it in.

I also called my town's firearms department and they said i'd get a call back today but i've been waiting since 7:30 and nothing. My mom and I are going to go in person today to tell them our concerns.

My brother and I have to seen him later so i can get my birds but i want to puke just thinking about seeing him with whatever he is planning. We do not feel safe in anyway whatsoever with my dad and I really fucking hope that the police take these concerns seriously and this reddit post doesn't end up on a true crime youtube compilation. because if it does, blame the MOPD for ignoring my moms pleas multiple times. 


But since I basically know nothing about g*ns due to the view my father instilled on us growing up. can someone please tell me if:

He can see what I write on the reference form?

He still has a good chance to get a permit?

And how long it takes to process in NJ?


Thank you sorry for the long post

"Per New Jersey law he shouldn’t be asking you to be a reference because you’re a family member. 

Otherwise since he has no criminal record or mental health record he does stand a good chance of getting his permit approved. He can just get friends or coworkers to fill in as references regardless of you refusing. 

You can and should thwart his application for a permit but spend time informing friends of his not to let him borrow or steal their guns. My abuser stole a gun from one of his friends after I had him arrested. The theft would have been unreported had I not PM’ed said loser friends about abuser’s actions. 

He can steal a gun outright or have someone straw purchase a gun for him. All this to say your mother needs to be unfindable by him. Shelter, relocating, something. Otherwise it’s a countdown to true crime right now. 

Police can only be reactive even if they care. You/her/both/brother anyone you trust should look into acquiring firearms yourselves for self defense. Take lessons then be diligent about practice/competence. Security measures buy time but absent moving where she can’t be found she has to be ready to fight back."

update: police officer was of no use. he would barely let us talk and said all divorces were messy, he barely wanted to give us a written report. When he came back i tried to ask about my birds. he brought up the last time we went to the house to try to get my birds. I went around 10 because he always goes to the gym at 8:30-9. so he would be back. i rang the doorbell and went in, got some of my brothers stuff for his boy scout camp, when i saw the conditions he had my birds in i started to cry. He hadn't changed the papers since the last time i had been there, they barely had food and the cage smelled foul. i told him i wanted to take him if he wouldn't take care of them and he threatened to call the cops on me to tell them i harassed him. i had to leave without them. When i tried asking the cop about it, he cut me off and said that i had tried going around 11. how he knew i don't know. I don't know if it's because we needed an escort once to get our stuff. despite the lawyer saying she didn't need any type of permission since she is still paying the house that is also in her name. However, the cop said he had to call my dad first but he never answered. However, that was a month or two ago and it was at 9 pm because we were scared to see him and tried to go while he was at the gym. Anyway, I hope most of this is paranoia but the part that is not paranoia and was the fact that from our point of view, his dismissiveness, attitude, demeanor, and even look of annoyance was not helpful at all. We asked him what we could do to be safe and he asked us many times what we wanted him to do. we told him each time we didn't know and that's why we were asking for help. He finally gave us a written report after like 4 or 5 repetitions of this. And he asked if we wanted to talk to someone else but then sent us to morristown. i got a bad feeling about all of it so we decided to submit the reports at a later date to at least get my birds for now. It was truly a hair pulling experience and a first hand clear view as to why so many women die in cases of domestic abuse despite reporting it. i left crying out of fear for my mom knowing the possibility that he is still tracking her car and knows we were at the police department and i have to see him in an hour and a half and he is still adamant on my brother sleeping over tonight. he really doesn't want to stay with him either. he has been nothing but happy the last 3 months to finally be out of the house as once i would go back to forming for school my brother was put in the same spot i grew up in	Fabulous-Chair8098	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9963462948799133	no	strong	no	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.

"Trust your gut! A victims fear is usually a good indicator of the seriousness of the situation. Honestly I think it may be best for you and tour family to go into hiding. He sounds very dangerous and it is a common step for these types of men to physically harm or kill the people who leave them. 

I believe there are some risk assessments that you could do on your own just to get an idea but in my opinion I would be as careful as possible.

update: we saw him last night. he was mad we didn't want to stay at first but thankfully he didn't force us to although we have to get breakfast with him in a few mins. i got my birds i feel a giant weight taken off. only the babies were chirping at the house but now all of them are. I just find it weird and uncomfortable how he doesn't have a ticket yet. what we're afraid of, is him faking going to mexico, and coming back after a while to get revenge or something he's crazy idk. thank you to everyone who has been so validating in the comments ❤️ i really hope he does leave at least temporarily so we can figure out some stuff. we're looking into how to get her a new car as soon as we financially can so we can get one he can't track once he's gone	Fabulous-Chair8098	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9963462948799133	no	strong	no	na	domesticviolence	failed

we're at the police department rn waiting to file a report per her lawyers instructions. i feel like my heart is going to beat out of my chest. i hope there is someway i can get my birds back i know it sounds trivial but i raised them and fed them from early weeks of life and when they had kids i took care of them from the moment they hatched. even smuggled them into my dorm so i could feed them at their appropriate times. with the way he is, i've been so afraid that he will release them and play it off as an accident. - someone came we are now going to file written reports but it was hard to get the cop to understand	Fabulous-Chair8098	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9963462948799133	no	strong	no	na	domesticviolence	failed

"I met my fiancée 1.5 years ago. I was on my way of healing from depression and a failed suicide attempt. She seemed to be the most loving and caring girl I've ever met and we quickly got into a relationship.

I was always trying to be a perfect partner for her. Confident but gentle, paying attention to every whim of hers, getting her gifts and presents regurarly, travelling with her to places she's never been but always dreamt of. I spent the vast majority of my time, energy and money on her.

Soon, after about 6 month of being together she started to complain more and more. Minor things. For example, when we were on holidays in Italy she rushed out from the restaurant we've been eating at because she couldn't stand that each time I drank from my coffee, I pushed out my toung a little bit. Or when she started shouting at me in front of everyone at the amusement park once, because she felt ashamed to be with a partner who ""puts his hands up when riding the roller coaster"". Things like that.

No matter how much she complained, whenever she had a problem, I was always trying to calmly listen to her and trying to figure out how can I solve this problem. I always tried to change myself in one way or another. I'm sure I have many shortcomings but I was always willing to accept them and did my best to change myself for better.But unfortunately no matter how much I please her, no matter that I'm always there for her 0-24, she complains about everything all day. Everyting is my fault according to her. She even went so far to state, I'm the ""worst, least attentive partner she's ever had"" and that all her exes were miles better choices than I am. She always compares me to other men, highlighting how much better they are.

She hit me. Many times. Sometimes even with sharp objects. She threw out the engagement ring I gave her, because it isn't her taste and she finds it humiliating that I am her fiancé. She told me that me spending on her about 8000$/month is not enough for her and she'd rather be a prostitute than sticking with me.

I am way too depressed, emotionally broken to million pieces to leave her. I don't have any energy. Not even to break up. I've had multiple suicide attempts because of her. I cannot live like this, but I'm not strong enough to leave her.

Excuse me for whining. I know a lots of it is my fault. But I'm curious what can I do in this situation?

TLDR: I'm in a relationship in which I am being hurt both emotionally and physically, yet I cannot leave"	Strict_Exogeneity	post	24.619956654304165	male	White	0.9990972280502319	na	na	na	1	domesticviolence	failed
"Hi guys, first time poster here, thankyou for taking the time to read.

I’m a surviver of DV myself, had a lot of different experience and had a lot of exposure to different types (last 10 years my experience identifying red flags has kept me safe)

But this is about my sister and I just wanted to vent somewhere so I can get it all out and focus on supporting her without my emotions getting in the way.

Sis had a brief fling with a guy 20 years back, it was maybe 6 months.

It was a distance thing and there was no social media so contact was actually pretty limited other than a few stays.

At one point he was committed to a facility, unsure why but I feel like that’s noteworthy.

I don’t know what happened between them but by her recollection she wasn’t all that interested so broke it off, but he tried chasing her up.

He turned up on her doorstep a year later and her response was to simply shut the door on him.

Then she moved out of town and mum told us he did try to come back again but she told him she was way up north now (true).

So, for many years my sister lived quite blissfully without contact from him.

She is super restrictive with social media and is untraceable online.

She moved home when COVID started and things were great, until she got a message from him on Facebook.

She was shocked because aside from being untraceable online, he doesn’t live in town so the timing was very weird that soon after she moved home it’s like he knew.

Her response was not to reply and immediately block him.

So then he messaged our mum, a big long message I can’t remember what it said but it was creepy. There’s only one type of person I know who tries to get in through parents if they can’t get in directly…

We looked into him a little and found that he still lived hours away so hoped he would get the point and drop it, also he has become a solicitor (that will be important in a moment)

She got a new job this year that has lead to some minor online presence, just a few photos in local news, not her name, but he has somehow worked out where she works now.

Yesterday her manager called her and asked if she was in some sort of legal trouble because our local member of parliament had reached out to them saying a solicitor is trying to contact her!

For a moment she wondered what on earth she could have done, then asked some questions and worked out it was him!!!

She explained to her manager and he was supportive.

He used his position to dupe the member of parliament into acting for him to try to reach her. An MP doesn’t help you track down a long list buddy, he had to tell them he’s a solicitor and would only do so to make his request look official.

So we spoke last night, I told her my concerns about his behaviour because this goes beyond just reaching out to an old friend you had a fleeting though about.

It’s up to her how she wants to proceed though.

Today he called her work directly and managed to connect to the chief so next minute, he’s now acting for her ex and sending messages for her to contact him because he hadn’t been brought up to speed yet.

So, that’s the story so far, I just wanted to get it off my chest because I’m furious and concerned, but we are wrapping ours arms around her to she knows she has support and if she wants to take my leash off then I already have a plan to put him in place (tell the partners at his firm what he’s doing and that their reputation is potentially at risk as not only is he using his position to support his attempts but now they know about it so if anything more happens the question will be raised on how they managed him, then let them do the work to pull him in line)

But for now, all I can do is what she asks of me and that’s just to be available and supportive.

Thank you for reading, this should help me get the gremlins out so I can focus on being a better support person rather than the anger I feel about him."	exhaustedspice	post	27.898738591493274	female	White	0.009017840959131718	na	na	na	3	domesticviolence	failed
"https://www.stalkingriskprofile.com/what-is-stalking/types-of-stalking

I believe there are different types of stalkers. The link above goes more in depth about each type which might help you get more info on what he may do next. 

I am so sorry to hear about your sisters situation! I myself have experienced stalking by an ex which has continued over many years but the circumstances are very different. I was with my ex for 4 years and in my opinion the stalking is more to torment me because my ex enjoys making others suffer and has nothing good going on. He has also been to jail for stalking multiple times but continues doing contacting me. He also has contacted me and my family very consistently.

To me it seems like your sisters stalker is more obsessed with her and the ides of possibly having a relationship with her? It reminds me of a case where a young actress was stalked by a man who went on to physically harm her (I am so sorry I don't want to scare you but I feel it is relevant). 

I would reccomend reporting it all to the police and getting a restraining order. He seems very persistent so it is probably worth being able to get him on something. Also would reccomend increasing all safety measures, getting pepper spray, being very secretive with any personal info (addresses, pictures showing local shops etc and any work info). 

I am also sorry to hear that you have personally experienced DV. I imagine this is probably triggering for you also. Best of luck to you both, may this guy f*ck off ASAP!!"	exhaustedspice	reply	na	na	na	0.009017840959131718	no	no	strong	na	domesticviolence	failed
"Like below I see others have mentioned stalking and harassment.  Get the restraining order.  Yes, some will tell you it's only paper.  

It doesn't matter get the restrain order:  it begins the documentation and tracking process. Also check her vehicle for traps like a tracker someone could put on her car.  These lurkers are an obsessive bunch who do this type of thing.  Especially the rejected ones. 

I have experienced stalking and learn the hard way; my own family were involved in assisting\*\* him finding out more about me (where I live what's going on) and using them to inject himself CLOSER TRYING TO GET BACK into my inner circle.  

Yes,  its sick but ""some people"" can be just total manipulators which is a different story different plot twist. .  Its teaching us these stalkers or psychological weirdos come in all shapes sizes and genders! 

Some people are just not too bright.  Every situation is different.  The rejected one's creep you out!  Family members supporting these whack jobs need to get help! Thats for another day!  Please tell her she can google her address see if it lists and shows photo of her home and front door.  

She can request from google maps to have the photo and front door blacked out etc SO THESE WHACK JOBS WONT LURK or try a way to get closer to her!  Cover all her bases.  

Also get her phone numbers changed.  Its all a pain but worth it.  They know how to operate so she needs to tell everyone to not be giving her private info work home etc out to anyone!  We also are creatures of habit and they know this.  Change up her driving routine.   Never take the same route.  If he goes silent and she doesnt hear much still dont let her guard down.

"Thanks for the link, that is helpful.

I’ve had my share of stalker experience, with my own and others. It’s pretty tricky so any information that helps build knowledge on this behaviours is helpful.

She’s not interested in going to the police at this stage, and I won’t try to compel her either.

My job right now is to provide a safe space and if I try to push her in a direction she doesn’t want to go in then that makes her withdraw (she gets overwhelmed easily and retreats) so I need to make sure she can remain open with me about it so I can stay well informed on the situation.

I’ve already explained to her that I strongly believe these recent actions lend credit to this person being potentially dangerous rather than a mere nuisance, but she needs to choose how to proceed from here.

I have told her I will step in at any time she asks me.

Will need to wait and see, it’s really quite a sudden and unexpected development and I don’t think she’s ever been confronted with dangerous people before so it’s a lot for her to process."	exhaustedspice	follow-up	na	na	na	0.009017840959131718	weak	strong	no	na	domesticviolence	failed
"Already sounds bad 17 year age gap. They met at my old work, she was a bartender and he's a factory supervisor. It breaks my heart to type this because I found my biological moms seats cheating on him, but what he has uncovered here is maybe worse. She was always a combative drunk, he also likes his liquor, and boy do they indulge together. Until ""it happens"" whatever it is that day, she freaks out they start ww3 with screaming, slam and break shit, then she often strikes him, she has beat him over the head while he was asleep before. They are almost always always shitfaced and fine by the next day. She acts very similar to anyone else minus the striking them. He just sits there and takes it, one time he pusher her away and she messaged me all night about how he was an abusive a**hole, while crying and playing victim, I was in the room as she got of 2 to 3 good face punches on my poor old man. Lately my dad has been so stressed from his job do to shortages in mechanical parts, and he comes home to this abusive crap. He provides her with everything and they have no money, he makes over $120,000 a year and she's working a management role at a factory too and they have no money somehow. 8,000 a month plus whatever she makes (I know its around at least 20-25 an hour 40 hours a week). They have 1 car payment, 2 cellphones, and a $2900 mortgage, where is it going. He has grown suspicious of her somedays, like a month or so ago when she went to her boss's that gave her the promotion 3 months into working at the place and turned her phone off all day. Strolled back around 5 or 6pm the next night, played victim screamed for awhile slept together repeat. I get a job at the same place and said boss moves to another plant 1 week into me being there. I pay the electric/ internet as well, also buy any and all house necessities, and pet supplies, for her 2 cats and their GSD. Basically my cats since they'd be long dead to neglect like her 3rd one succumbed to if not for me feeding and taking care of them. Since I've moved back home (1.5 years) and am saving up for a place she has gotten physical with him at least 5 times to my knowledge, but a screaming match instigated by her is almost a nightly affair. He has gotten to points where he's told her to leave but she weasels back into his life by morning. I told him I need to have a 1 on 1 talk this weekend, so any advice on how to approach that would be great. I'm very suspicious of her cheating on him from how she treats him, to how she dissapears for some time to go to bars or the night nobody knew where the hell she was (at her boss's). I don't have any idea how they have no spending money and constantly ask me to help, unless she's spending it somewhere or on someone. She is insanely aggressive and cannot be wrong, everything is always about her. Every weekend she has friends over to party and get shitfaced, and recently my dad basically had a mini stroke from these shenanigans she loves to set up. What has she done every weekend since, invite company over to drink of course! She is quite literally killing him in almost every way besides directly poisoning him. He comes home from getting screamed at for not being able to produce product with no parts, just fer her to be 4 shots deep ready to rumble over how he doesn't fold his laundry right. Its disgusting, im literally going to lose my dad and at this point I'm not unsure that isn't what she wants. Between disappearing for hours, to ""losing her house key"", to beating a man 17 years older than you with health problems. Its making me so sick. That's not even all though, my step brother 18 who she has custody off but isn't her kid since her sister is worse then her I guess, is really getting messed up by this, I thought he escaped it going into the forces, but he has now been medically discharged, and his fragile pschy from her and her messed up family is gonna come home to this again soon. She is currently calling me a fake work ethic haver because I wont go into work this weekend to do a job they won't certify me for so I can make more despite me doing it for a month working 5 days a week anywhere from 8 to 14 hours (they only worked 4 days a week when she started 6 months ago), couple this with the 6 point termination system that by my math she has gotten to since I've started by missing work for ""illnesses"" (hangovers) and his doctors appointments that she didn't actually go to. Sorry I'm the a**hole because I want my money, and I want to talk to my dad on my days off. She's currently having fun messaging between the management of our work about me. Funny ive got more qualifications then her already knowing 4 positions there to her 1 (2 if you count her new cushy open up excel spreadsheet in the ac office role) and have plenty of work ethic when im feeding her animals, fixing her guest bed, fixing their washer, fixing their upstairs shower, giving them $2500 to fix there downstairs one (who knows where that money went still broke 5 months later), or just giving them money to help out. She stopped talking to me around 10 hours ago. Which was when I broke and messaged my dad. I'm honestly a very calm and down to earth person i defended her against my dads initial cheating accusations, thinking he's been hurt and she's doing stupid stuff, but no way cheating right, not to him again, but now I just don't know. I always listen to both sides. When I messaged my dad asking to talk we could have done it today had she not taken him out to a bar all night the moment she smelled my disdain. We aren't her family we are emotional punching bags that she will just assault or shutdown or both in front off. And all I know is a lot of cameras don't work at my place of work and she spends a lot of time in the office with her ""bros"". Nothing adds up i feel so horrible, so sad, so angry, so used, so manipulated. I can only imagine my fathers side. Despite all this im worried that he will have my guts after I unleash how I truthfully feel about her. I've had a hard life when it comes to family, my father bearing anger towards me is something I dont want to think of. I'm a massive people pleaser and can't stand not knowing someone's feelings towards me. I guess I'm just writing this in case of worst case scenario honestly, everything has taken a toll and if she's poisoned him to much against me I will basically have nothing. No family near me, no home, and the most uncomfortable working environment ever created (that may be completly unavoidable). Despite all my loathing and uncertainty, the thought of her sleeping her way to a cushy position, all while ignoring any family, and spending all of there money fills me with a white hot rage. I just wanna curl into a ball and dissapear or decimate whatever bridge her and I have. Despite all this i do still care for her, she needs serious mental and substance help, but she sooner cuss you off ""her property"". We have no proof she has cheated and so a divorce would likely mean she makes out like a bandit, and takes my stepbrother away to screw him up so much more. I'm just so sad and so angry, I pray no one else lives like this.                  

TLDR: My stepmother is physically and mentally abusing my father, while destroying anyone else's mental she comes into contact with. Potentially cheating, and most likely blowing all their money. What can I say and do to open my dads eyes.

Worry not! You can set the standard by not engaging with her, and walking away and never interacting with her again. Others will see it happen , and realize it is possible!

So I’ve been dating and I am beginning to ask questions to guys if they have ever gotten physical with a woman to help with my discernment in dating. he said, not since college (were in our 40s). But then he also talked about some incident 5 years ago. I asked him to elaborate. Sounded like a girl accused him but dropped the chargers. Said girl lived in his house, couldn’t get her out. He forced her out. She made theses claims. Either way that was when he was 37-38 years old. You a grown ass man. I don’t see how normal people be getting into these situations. It’s a no for me.

"I personally would never date anyone who has a history of domestic violence. The issues being 
1. It’s extremely unlikely that an abuser stops being abusive. Even if they’re not physically abusive, they evolve to emotionally abuse which I believe is sometimes worse 
2. Abusers don’t show their true colors at first. It typically takes 9 months to a year before they start being abusive.  You might waste a bunch of time just to find out they never actually changed. 
3. It doesn’t matter if they were in college and it was “so long ago” since they abused. You should know better by college to never lay your hands on a woman (or man) 

So I’d say skip this dude and find someone who has been taught to respect and value others from a young age, instead of it being a lesson learned in their early 20s

Any dv sign is a hell no from me. The verbally abusive sociopath ex was tricky. I asked him how his father treated his mother and he told me about how his dad came down hard if he or his brother was disrespectful to their mom. I asked about previous dating experience and he strongly believed that you never talk about that. I found out that he had a pregnancy scare at 18 with a previous gf only because it came up in infertility therapy, this was 7 years into the relationship. How he spoke about it was full of red flags: she was probably lying about being pregnant, he refused to speak to her, she threatened to talk to his parents and this enraged him, he (devout catholic) gave her cash for an abortion as last contact with her. He was enraged at the priest he confessed to. What I didn't know at the time: he spoke as if this was all currently happening, not something he experienced 10 years before and had gained some perspective on. I also didn't know about love bombing and other distraction techniques that he used on me to make it hard to realize what was going on.

Well. Seems like it worked. This actually the opposite of DV therapy and handbooks when you are a victim and go back to dating. It’s recommended to ask before you share your experience. Then later if/when things get serious set ground rules for “fair fighting”. Then make it abundantly clear, no physical violence, yelling, etc. will be tolerated. Don’t tell them you’re going to leave—that makes you vulnerable. But no that you absolutely will. Any hint of it-you need to leave. For example, I was seeing a guy who did know about my DV experience. Six months into a relationship he got mad-first time. He started pacing when he got angry, cursed, and threatened to leave me. I left instead, never said a word or looked back. That was it for me. I also asked this guy like above - he didn’t see it coming in terms of asking. He has no idea about my experience. I’ve not even met him. But he acted like this was okay. MOST DV abusers brush off physical altercations like it’s common. They tell on themselves all the time. I think it’s important to ask very early when you’re not vulnerable and then watch them when they get angry. They usually tell on themselves.

"Thanks for this. As far as asking about DV vs handling conflicts, we have been discussing this in this thread. You’re not going to get a straight answer either way. No one is going to say, I chocked someone. Everyone is going to give the PC answer when it comes to conflicts. Asking straight forward, have you gotten physical with someone, likely will yield an answer that can help you discern early. Given the abusers history-like you pointed out, they often minimize, lack remorse and accountability, etc thus they will probably yield some sort of admission —like said person on the text. 

Ask early before you even get to the first date. But I would add, make the ask seem nonchalant so it’s hard to read how you really feel about the situation and do so in a series of other things. Ask over the phone or on text so you’re not triggered in front of them. Make it a point to circle back to this topic later on if you decide to move forward so you can share your deal breakers and ground rules of having safe conflict. By no way do you have to share your own experience just because you ask the question. You can make it a point to say,  if we get to know each other better, I certainly will share. And that’s it. 

However, if they answer like this person, letting on they have had incidents of violence in any of their relationships -ghost them. Not worth deciphering. 

If they lied to you, you likely will find out eventually, and that makes it easier to leave if they blatantly lie."	SuperMindFreak	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9988960027694702	weak	no	no	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.
With the deal breaker thing. I’ve done/do that, but it’s not the same. We all agree with deal breakers when we first start dating for the most part. It would be hard for someone to disagree. But to ask if you’ve ever been physical with a partner or person they are dating, I think should be asked. Most of DV perps I find still lives in delusion that those incidents were okay and not their fault - or brush it over like this guy- I grew out of it. I find that doing deal breakers just kind of doesn’t have the same meaning as actually finding out if they have been in these DV situations before and seeing how they responded to it.

"I’m sorry to here that. I’m hearing some common themes
that are early warning signs abusers do if asked if they have ever been abusive (or involved in a domestic dispute): 1) they admit violence on their part but minimize it; 2) they blame other things for their violent behavior as if it was out of their control (being young, being at a bad place in life, the other persons fault); 3) show no signs of remorse; 4) no signs of therapy or seeking help; 5) omit labeling this as “domestic violence”. 

It’s like our abusers reincarnated. This could very well easily be my ex trying to explain his role in almost killing me to a potential new partner. I think anything resembling what they would say is a red flag and you should BLOCK/GHOST and pretend like you don’t know them.

I know some folks sort of wrote off asking folks directly and early, but I’m a fan of this. I think we should ask, have you ever been involved in a domestic violence. If so what happened. I think you should absolutely ask over the phone and/.or FaceTime. I wouldn’t ask in person because you can be triggered. Moreover; you want the ability to walk away from a potential partner safely.

"I think you share what you need to share. Nothing wrong with not sharing. I shared with the guy I dated for six months cause it was early after my divorce from the DV ex and I didn’t know any better. Hadn’t finished therapy yet. But I think you don’t ever have to. I like to ask them because it’s the least I can do to protect myself. If they lie they lie. I believe I will find out. Good advice was provided in one of the responses - do a background check. But again, I think it’s all how you ask.  I swear as much as my ex got in trouble (arrested and convicted) he still believes it’s somehow my fault. What I’ve learned is most men (I’m not sure about women) that are DV abusers are also narcissistic. They never take accountability- sometimes I find they flat out enjoy talking about how they were wrongfully accused and/or minimize the violence, or swear it was just a misunderstanding to the ones that actually were abusers but never thought of themselves as an abuser. Like this guy said he hasn’t been physical aggressive with a woman—“not since college”. 😂. What in the entire fuck? He thought it was okay. Had he known about my experience—I’m
Sure he never would have admitted it. 

He did ask me if I had ever gotten physical and I have—but it was in defense. Few understand this and to be honest the police report don’t even reflect what happened. I’m not sure if the court records reflect because I never showed up. But my divorce decree does reflect my ex as the abuser (I made sure it did) and so do the restraining orders. I happen to also never have had any other relationship with that kind of history. None. But I’m not sharing all of this. I won’t even share I had to defend myself. 

One might believe I’m not being honest - but I know I’m asking cause I’m a survivor. Fuck all that honesty. I’m not about to explain the cycle of abuse to anyone. 

I imagine I’m going to get other type of responses and also lies. If they say no-never been “physical” with anyone, I’m going to believe them until I do a background check. Even if I do do a check; I’m going to ask to speak to their ex - if they have kids. Relatives like their mother or sister or brother. Now if EVERYONE IS LYING, and I find out, I’m gone. 

But I also realize-I’ll never find out for sure. But any sign, I’m gone. If you ask, just be prepared if they act like they have been in a DV situation, to take it lightly in front of them, then bail the fuck out if they do. Don’t look back. When this guy told me what he said in the text, part of me wanted to act like it was a while ago, but no.

Thanks. Therapy and my spiritual growth is why I can just walk away. Other guys have showed red flags (not in DV) and I’ve manage to weed them out way before things start with exception of one guy. I just kept ignoring his flags cause he was so cute and going through a divorce. Then I woke up cause he was all over the place. After therapy and being more attuned to why I stayed in a relationship that was terrible for me, I’m not afraid to be alone, just end things when it’s not healthy, and have strategies for staying away. Although I’ve only been in one DV relationship, the others were trash too. I just accepted less because of the social pressure of being married/couple, didn’t want to be alone, and in terms of the ex, didn’t want my children to grow up in a divorced home.

Absolutely will not be perusing anyone who has been physical with a woman. I have a father and a brother that never have. My brother is a survivor too.

"I don't know where else to ask or post this without him knowing it was me. I am in fear for my life.
I divorced my abusive ex 3 years ago. the night I left, he beat my car with a crowbar while myself and my son were inside it, all because I told him he needed a shower and as far as I knew it had been weeks since he'd had one. 
I called the cops, and his dad, his dad came and got our son out of the situation (we lived 2 hours away from my family and any support I would have). the police came and since he had barricaded himself inside the house, they made me leave. I was told since it was his house (my name on the deed tho) I needed to go or I would be arrested, I wasn't allowed to even get clothes.
I was homeless and living in a camper for about two weeks, had to buy everything new. judge granted an epo until the hearing so I got temporary custody while getting messages from ex that I would be ""allowed"" to meet my son at the local public park but without anyone there to support me, and that his family would be there a long with police. 
aster gaining custody ex stalked me, came to my apartment, called my bosses saying I abused and abandoned my pets (I worked at a vet clinic and was forced my police to leave my house), took over my Facebook and changed the verification numbers to his number, took over my email and did the same, took over my iphone MacBook and apple watch doing the same, called my parents to talk shit, called my friends to talk shit, had his friends call me to ""explain"" what was going on and that he just wanted to talk. he tried to run me off the road while picking up my son from school, he called CPS making false allegations of child abuse (I was cleared). 
he would call me roughly 150-200 times a day (all rejected), he refused to let me get my belongings (even with multiple court orders) he accused me of theft (but I wasn't allowed to take belongings). 
he sold property that was mine (a car that I still have the title to). 
he was heavily on drugs and tested positive in family court (judge still granted 50/50 custody and no supervision), never held in contempt for anything mentioned above. 
since the court hearings (last was June 2020) I have given up primary custody because my life has continued to be hell, constant harassment and abusive texts. he still has my child call local hospitals when I don't answer the phone because of work to look for me. 
my kid would come to my house then go back there, and roughly a week later I would hear that I had locked him in closets, that I was talking bad to him about his dad, that I was abusive and didn't feed him, that my apartment was an unsafe environment (CPS again cleared me). 
he has actively been trying to ruin my life.
since I have gotten remarried he has continued to send me messages every time after exchange that I will be going to jail, that I am abusive and that my child is traumatized after visits, that I am trying to coerce my kid to live with me full time. these messages come out of nowhere and are aggressive and scary. some of them have video of my child being recorded saying that I said things that never happened or never did. 
I fear for my life, my stepchildren's lives, my husband's. 
he is unhinged and the court system has failed me.
I am considering giving up my rights to give him what he wants, 100% custody and parental rights. 
if my child is interrogated and recorded, and coached just for spending time with me, maybe being with me at all isn't good for him. this man will continue to attack me as long as I am involved in my child's life, and at this point, my child has lied to me about events at my own home so much that I am essentially mentally estranged from him. 
he won't sit next to me, he won't play games with me (but will with his step brothers) he won't hardly talk to me, and constantly asks when he's going back to his dad's. 
I don't know what to do, but I am happier about the potential to be free than I am about not seeing him. 
what do I do? I am going to end up divorced, homeless, or in jail because of all this. 
I've spent 3 years checking my backseat for him, avoiding public without someone with me just in case, I am tired of living in fear.

I'm so sorry you're having to deal with this......but, are you 💯 positive that he will leave you alone IF he gets full custody? Those types are hardly ever happy.....even when they get what they say they want......I don't see somebody like your ex giving up that control over you that easily!!!!

It seems unlikely to me. My assumption is the abuser won’t let it close. For more info, my 21-year-old daughter just left an abusive relationship after he strangled her. She wants one last conversation for closure. I think it’s a scary idea, but I’m not expert.

"Last conversations can be and have been opportunities for a repeat assault/murder attempt. Closure comes healing during from time away from abuse not from hearing a fake apology if any apology is given.

Closure is an illusion in all situations. Especially in DV. It’s just the [cycle of abuse](https://www.domesticshelters.org/articles/identifying-abuse/what-is-the-cycle-of-abuse)starting again	Iampussydog	reply	na	na	na	0.996344268321991	no	no	no	na	domesticviolence	failed
"Do not seek ""closure"" with an abuser. It only opens yourself up to more abuse. That ""last conversation"" is all an abuser needs to suck you back in. The abuser will ""love bomb"" and try and get victim back OR he will use physical/mental/emotional punishment to abuse the victim. 

Examples:
The victim goes back to the abuser because he wanted to apologize. Abuser apologizes and cries with contrition and is ""sorry for everything"". The victim goes back and the cycle begins as the ""honeymoon period"" ensues.

The victim goes to talk with the abuser who apologizes. The victim doesn't accept an apology so he begins with name-calling (emotional/verbal abuse begins). Cycle of Violence ensues 

Abuser doesn't apologize, starts blaming the victim and asking the victim for an apology. Cycle of Violence 

Abuser shows up with a gun threatening suicide or bodily harm in victim.

"I’ve slowly begun to realize that my husband has been very clearly emotionally abusive, especially over the last few months. I’m concerned on whether it’s escalating to physical abuse now. Over the last couple of months, he’s:

- Grabbed me by the shoulders and got in my face during an argument
- followed me when I tried to leave a room and wouldn’t leave me alone when I tried to get away to get a break from arguing 
- has put his hand on my neck and squeezed a couple of times “playfully” and saying he thinks I would like it during sex even though I told him I didn’t like it
- “jokingly” put a pillow over my face and told me he sometimes feels like just smothering me
- slapped my arm hard enough to sting when I didn’t do something he wanted me to do (we weren’t arguing per se, I was just being stubborn and not getting up out of bed to do something he easily could have done himself)

Just don’t know what to think anymore. He kicked me out of the house a few weeks ago because he didn’t want me on the pill and I wouldn’t back down and I wish I didn’t come back. Things have been somewhat calm since I’ve been back, but he’s just recently resumed some verbal abuse/gaslighting and did some of the things listed above within the last week."

"I’ve been out of my situation for over a year now. I have been struggling horribly lately, and I’m scared I won’t bounce back from this. I physically and mentally feel just as bad as I did on the first day of separation. I don’t really know where to go for support. I don’t know where to find a therapist that will have the skill level to help me. I lay in bed for hours and dissociate and am stuck in task paralysis. 

My trauma bond is so strong that I desperately miss my ex who mentally, physically and emotionally abused me. I feel like such a fraud because I miss him. I honestly have to fight the urge to call him and beg for him to take me back and tell him I’m sorry for calling the police (the first time he was arrested, it was the neighbors, second time, I did). I have been crying almost everyday lately. I have a restraining and protective order against him, and it’s so hard for me not to reach out. He’d likely call the police on me if I did, who already think I’m a joke. 

The psychological damage of this is killing me. I grew up in a home where I was not loved and supported (emotionally abusive) so when my ex did the same I didn’t flinch. I have no low esteem, and I feel almost brainwashed. After two years of constant non stop psychological games, I thought being free would feel better. But it actually feels worse, because I have been discarded. And now I’m left alone, unable to trust men, emotionally unavailable, and numb. I’ve gone on countless dates and each time I sabotage it because they’re not like my ex. Any advice or insight would be appreciated. Or suggestions of resources to seek out."

"It took 3 years for me to find mental stability again. The first year after was *brutal.* The second year, medicated, confused often but slightly more manageable. The third year much more stable and normal, unmedicated (for cost reasons) and I do not miss that mfer at all. 

Every time you want to reach out to him you should have other things you can do instead in mind already. Like text a friend, listen to that podcast you wanted to listen to and tidy up the house while you do, play a video game, finish reading or revisit “why does he do that” if you haven’t read it, find ways to get involved with other dv victims/causes so you feel less isolated, look up therapists who deal with dv survivors, eat an entire cake if you have to. Therapists all have specializations so you’ll find one if you look. Maybe not the first time you try but that’s why you try again. Better to put the energy you have into doing something that will help you eventually than putting energy into something that you know has never truly helped you.

The time passes either way so when you can, try to spend it reinvesting in yourself, however small. Sometimes passing the time looks like just sitting there and learning to tolerate the discomfort and really feel your feelings, likely for the first time. If you come from a neglectful background, your feelings have never been treated with care or importance so processing them can be a real challenge because it’s may be the first time you’ve ever had the space to do so. But now someone cares about how you feel and it’s you. You’re the person who can help yourself, not your ex. After all you’ve been through, you should know you can and will survive this.

"The peak for me was 1.5 years after it happened. I decided to end myself. I had a plan and a date. And then that date came and I didn’t do it. And I just kept not doing it. And eventually I quit feeling so numb. I quit trying to find a replacement for him, and I quit thinking about him so much. 

I’m 2.5 years out now. I still struggle sometimes, but I’m able to find joy in my life now. So much more than I’ve ever been able to before- I grew up in an emotionally abusive household as well, and have made a series of bad decisions trying to get away from it. 

Some people get a lot out of therapy and medication. I tried that for awhile, but it wasn’t for me. Googling “Domestic Violence therapist” should show you who’s got experience in that area, although it make take seeing a few before you find a good fit. 
What helped me the most, I think, was finding a friend with benefits. I’d given up on dating, but finding someone I could be physical with while knowing that I could walk away at any minute was really freeing. It felt like having the power in my hands. At first it felt wrong being with someone else, but now the thought of him makes my skin crawl. But finding a consistent FWB kept me from making stupid decisions by giving me the companionship I need along with strong boundaries. 
And friendship is helpful. Find people you can connect with who will listen to you as you spiral and reassure you repeatedly that it wasn’t your fault, that you didn’t deserve any of it. 

Make sure you’re getting some sun every day too. If you can’t exercise, just go sit (or lie) in the sun for a half hour a couple times a week.

You’re not responsible for his behavior, he is. Abusers exist because they’re enabled. They’re never really held responsible. He’s literally already got a charge and he’s still abusing. He’s proven he’s unable to be responsible for his own behavior. He’s gonna seriously hurt someone some day, in a way he can’t take back and the more time he experiences consequences for his behavior, the less opportunity he has to hurt someone else. Don’t repeat the cycle by letting him skirt accountability. You’re no less important than he is. You press charges because your life matters and you didn’t deserve that. Don’t do him any favors.

"I just did this for mine. Not strangulation, but smothering and smashing the hell out of my eye. 

Here's the super sneaky easy way to get the restraining order, just like I did:


You take as many deep breaths as you need, and tell the truth. You look at the judge, and at any family or advocates you bring with you for support, and you never waste a single breath or glance on him. 

You tell the truth about what a violent waste of oxygen he is, and then you leave and never look back. And you just stop caring about his existence, and if he contacts you in any way or harasses you at all, you call the police without guilt. Because you are worth it. 

He will try to lie, try to manipulate, try to sleaze his way out of trouble, because that's what they do. The judge will see through it. They're over confident and think that because they were able to beat you down and gaslight you that they're somehow smarter than the average bear. But they arent. Judges see a hundred of his ilk daily. They all almost read from the same script. Mine came in so confident he was gonna walk out of there the winner, but he got cut off by the judge every time he started trying to slander me and just generally talk shit. 

I asked the judge questions, kept it straightforward and simple. I told the facts of what happened without any embellishment. I was honest when I said I didn't remember something clearly, and honest about my own part in things. 

But you have to remember the most important thing. You're not in trouble or on trial here. There's no excuse for what they do to us. I won't lie to you. It was very difficult and pretty scary just to even be in the same room as him. It was like...so bizarre seeing him in this new light. I was afraid I'd feel guilt or remorse or pain or sadness, or still feel like I loved him, or whatever. But he just looked...pathetic. evil. Mean. Desperate. Thanks to this hearing I was able to see what he really was. A shallow, abusive, user who gets a kick out of hurting women. 

You don't have to do this. Only do it if you want to. And have a safety plan in place. But it might give you some closure. It did for me. Gave me some validation, got me my best friend back, my mom back, a place to live back in CO with said best friend (used to date, reconnected awhile ago, not for dating, just support) and most importantly, gave me an ending bookmark so I can more easily put that chapter to rest. 

Since getting the order of protection, my nightmares have already lessened a bit, and I'm able to sleep when it's dark out finally. Got into a really nice rehab, have housing set up for when I finish, got scholarships and grants for school (started this before he finally crossed the line and never told him) so if I choose to go back in the fall or winter I am all set. I'm becoming myself again. It's not because the piece of paper really protects you. The truth is, there is something permanently broken in these people, and they will never, ever be whole.

"I felt this boundary hangover too. I sat with the discomfort and went through the process because I kept reminding myself of my own peace. I wanted to move on, my abuser did not. And I felt guilty for maybe four months, you can feel guilty for a year or your whole life - it’s all natural and valid. 

Victims tend to statistically have big hearts, it’s why we stay longer with the abuser. We couldn’t possibly believe that anyone wouldn’t want to change their ways for the better of the world, but they won’t. PLUS it’s overwhelming to think about having control over someone’s life like that. For me, he can’t come within 100yards of me.

My brother is 18 and he recently threatened to hit me. My mom and my brother got in an argument and he gets very violent when he doesn’t get his way. He steals our money, property etc. He recently stole some of my mom’s things from the attic and started throwing them on the floor because my mom told him to stop. I told him to stop because he almost hit our dog and he told me if I didn’t go in my room in the next five second that he would swing on me. I threatened to call the police and my mom told me that I couldn’t call them because I got arrested last year and that they would arrest me too. I told her to kick him out and she threatened to kick me out as well. I’m not sure if I should call the police because if I do my whole family will hate me.

Your mom should kick his ass out of the house and the next time he threatens you you call the cops on his ass. There's absolutely no reason why you should have to put up with that and look, your mom is lying to you when she says that they'll take you to jail too, they have no reason to take you and she's just trying to scare you because she's trying to protect your brother.	nonis8	reply	na	na	na	0.9989687204360962	strong	no	no	na	domesticviolence	failed
"first post on this thread. you can see my previous couple of posts on other threads. 

Am in what several therapists have described as a DV relationship. married for 9 years with a 5 yr old son. Husband has only been physical once, about a year ago. the most common and ongoing issue is the emotional/ verbal/ manipulation side of things. and gaslighting.  I know i need to leave. Its gottent o the point where i find myself physically shaking sometimes fom stress when we argue. am also about to start antidepressants as im having such a hard time functioning.  what i want to know is HOW ON EARTH have people left when there is a young child to consider? it breaks my heart more than i can articulate to think of tearing up his family, and having to spend his life going between 2 houses, and the fact that i will likely lose 50% of my time with our son.  How do you reconcile this?  Husband still thinks we can ""amke things better if we BOTH make some changes""

Issues have included:

\-1 physical assualt which left me with bruises

\-1 threat to throw me off our balcony (said infront of son when he was 3 yrs old)

\-1 instance of being so full of rage when driving with me and son in the car that he was driving so dangerously, creaming, bashing steering wheel so it beeped. son and i were both beside ourselves

\-on and off drug addiction and everything assosciated with that (lies, blowing money etc)

\-found out he been messaging $eX workers online and other random people. confronted him and he was just very defensive. only mildly apologetic.

\-verbal insults include: terrible wife, bad mom, horrific human, souless, vacuous human, piece of s\*&\^, bucket of s\*$&, tip rat, scumbag, idiot, most incompetent person theyve ever met, i contribute noting to our life.

"Hey. Step back for just a minute. Take a few deep breaths. 

Let me ask you, do you think the same level of stress affecting you, the one that has you trembling, having difficulties functioning, taking antidepressants to address, do you think it’s not having a similar effect on your child? 

Just because a child doesn’t have the vocabulary or maturity level to express what they’re feeling doesn’t mean they don’t feel the same way you do. There’s no good choice, somebody is going to be affected no matter what you choose, so you just have to do the best you can, make the best choices you can in your situation, knowing there will be some fallout no matter what you do. My choices were and always will be what’s best for my child, and most of the time I made good ones, but we are humans and not perfect, so I also made mistakes. Don’t beat yourself up, you’re doing the best you can."	regularMondayCoffee	reply	na	na	na	0.9988277554512024	weak	strong	strong	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.
"Nervous-Ad292's comment is 100% accurate. That stress you are under right now is affecting your child. It's clinical-level knowledge at this point that DV in the home traumatizes children involved even if the DV ""stays between the parents.""

> it breaks my heart more than i can articulate to think of tearing up his family, and having to spend his life going between 2 houses, and the fact that i will likely lose 50% of my time with our son. How do you reconcile this?

Husband has already broken up the family and child is as much a victim of husband's abuse as you are. Funny how abusers will claim ""BOTH make changes"" when they really mean you continue to jump when they say jump and they do whatever they want. 

If your family court system is good you can use your experience to limit his parenting time so that damage to your child is lessened with parallel parenting. Child may or may not need their own therapist to deal with still having contact with husband. A really good family court will make visitation with the abusive parent professionally/third party supervised but it really depends on where you live. 

If you live in a bad area (legally), your abuse history will be discounted and child will be with you both roughly equally. You will have to do the best you can with the time you have, probably have a therapist for the child and be on the lookout for """"""""more direct"""""""" child abuse or worsening of substance abuse to file a modification that limits husband's parenting time. 

If you live in a super bad area (legally), husband will claim your abuse history is fake and alienating him from child and judge will give him most of the custody. It's really hard for protective parents in this scenario because child will be super traumatized and needing lots of support and/or abusive parent turns child into a pawn-mini-me that hates you. 

You have to break out on your own terms for your own health and your child's. Even though you as a DV survivor are resilient and strong, a child's wellbeing relies on parent(s) being in as great a shape mentally as possible. Get the abuse on paper with a police report and/or restraining order and/or report to CPS. Use said paper trail(s) and file for custody with a good lawyer. They don't have to be DV-specialized but they should be aware of how the local judges react and be willing to advance your requests efficiently. They'll tell you the cheating doesn't matter but the other issues you've mentioned are relevant to custody factors. 

I'm mostly through the other side and parenting a young child is infinitely easier without the would-be murder at home with us."	regularMondayCoffee	reply	na	na	na	0.9988277554512024	weak	no	no	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.

"OP, somehow we have this myth that ALL children are better off with two parents, irregardless of how toxic the parental relationship is or how abusive one of the parents might be. This is heartbreakingly wrong. While we are teaching our children that it’s not Ok to hurt other people, to be kind, to share, to play nicely with others, the behavior we are modeling for them is exactly the opposite! They are actually learning, by watching their parents interactions, lessons on how to disregard others feelings, how to verbally and physically abuse in order to get your way. How it’s ok to lie about how you feel, or about what has happened as they hear mom say ‘oh, I’m ok honey!’ after they just saw her get hit, or listen to Dad gaslight Mom yet again about something they know happened. Our children learn how to walk on eggshells when they are around angry people, how to become silent and invisible. They learn that dysfunctional, abusive relationships are OK, since this is what they are being forced to endure. They grow up without any sense of boundaries, or sense of self, and as adults don’t recognize the red flags that would warn them that the person they are dating is an abuser, because they show the same traits as their abusive parent. As adults they enter into unhealthy relationships and become victims, falling into the same survival behaviors they grew up watching. 

Children need stability, unconditional love, kindness, compassion and care. These things can come from both parents if both are emotionally healthy, or one. What a child will never need is to be abused, or to witness abuse, because that will scar them for life. 🙏🏼"	regularMondayCoffee	reply	na	na	na	0.9988277554512024	no	no	no	na	domesticviolence	failed

"I left when my daughter was 9. She spent 9-20 in therapy for what he did. Mostly to me, but did hurt her and threaten to end me if she told what he did. She did end up in the hospital because of him, and I ended up there a couple times. My daughter had a ton of trouble trusting boys to date, and dated a few bad ones. She has cptsd from living in that situation. 

The bright side, we are happy and healthy and whole now. It’s been 12 years since I left him. I moved on, met my now husband and we have a little dude together.

"You have mentioned a few times your husband says things can get better if you both really try. First of all, he’s the one who is abusive, so he is the one who needs to change. Making this seem like a shared problem or issue is just another form of minimizing responsibility and illustrates that he has no intention of acknowledging the harm he’s causing or changing. 

I understand wanting to cling to promises of making things better, but there’s a reason it is so rare for abusers to change. They don’t want to, and they use promises of a better future to keep us in their grasp.

I’m including a few resources that may be helpful about change in an abuser (and how rare it is) plus the effects of abusive homes on children. You aren’t “giving up” on your son if you leave, you’re giving him a much better future if you do. The stress and long-term harms of growing up in such a home are well-documented—not to mention the clear trauma responses you’re having.

It sounds as if your husband is trying to pit your young son against you. A common strategy and a dangerous one. It’s understandable your son loves his father but he’s very young and you are the parent; it’s your job to make these decisions, and comments from your son about loving his father shouldn’t deter you from doing what’s best, even though I know this is such a hard situation to be in. Your child is not privy to and doesn’t have the capacity to understand the complexities of what you’re enduring (and what he is, too) at the hands of your husband. A good father doesn’t abuse the mother of his child.

I hope you will reach out to a DV organization ASAP to get the help and support you need and to start crafting a plan. I wish you all the best, you deserve so much better.

"Yesss, this 🙏

Just to add a bit more.
OP, if you are planning on leaving - do it secretly, plan carefully and only tell those, you absolutely trust that you are going to leave (you don't want the fall back of them telling your husband).
If he figures out your going to leave, his behaviour may escalate in terrifying, unpredictable ways.

It's an absolute must to get a good lawyer.
Evidence too.
Have you talked to your local DV organisation?
Having that little bit of extra support really helps.

I wasn't married, didn't live with him and we weren't even in a relationship at that point, when I left.
My child was two at the time.
I lied to my ex and told him we were staying at my mother's for a few days. When in reality, we were actually in a refuge.
His father started to freak out and asked to see our child (ngl I felt so guilty). Then he started to threaten with legal, stating how he has father's right. I said that I am not stopping him, he will see his son again (didn't state when).
By that point, I had a family lawyer and actually didn't need to talk to my ex directly - as a letter was on its way in the post.
So I blocked him on everything and that felt good, instead of the constant messages with demands.

He denied any abuse, eventhough it was highlighted exactly what kinds.

I agree with all the comments with the trauma that comes from witnessing domestic abuse as a child.
My ex's parents was a DV situation but his mother only managed to do so much.
This is my concern and I hope that my child doesn't become abusive for becomes a survivor of the same thing.

"Hi there. I’m really really proud of you for knowing what you need to do. To address each of these points…

That thing about if “we” really try, and we BOTH have things to work on, etc… this right here is complete gaslighting in and of itself. There is no amount of anything you could be doing that would make what he has been doing okay. Or make it a reasonable reaction, or make it not abuse. You together have nothing to work on. Realistically all he should have to work on is himself.. but for himself. Sadly for men who abuse, they seldom rehabilitate, almost never change. Any time he convinces you that things are better, he is changing etc, it is just part of the cycle of abuse. It will always go back to bad, and the bad only will get worse over time. The ground will keep falling out from underneath you over and over, and it will break your spirit (and your sense of reality, if you are me)  more and more each time. 

2. You don’t think your kiddo knows much if anything. You are wrong. And even if that was true, it will be in no time that he will witness more than you could’ve imagined and it will break your heart. Also, as others have said, he will pick up more and more on so many small things and the age he is at is really impressionable and a lot of ways of being you don’t want for him may stick.

I just dont know if i belive that things could change enough for me to be happy. ie should we go to therapy together and ""give it another go"" for sons sake

and

2) the fact that for the most part (but not 100% of the time), son doesnt see anything overtly wrong, as most happens after he's in bed, etc. but hes certainly seen and heard some things. and whilst i unbderstand that all this means my husband isnt technically a ""good dad"", in my sons experience, he would feel that he is. e.g. they are super close, husband is incredibly loving, gentle, etc towards son. If anything, its become a bit of a ""them and me"" scenario, where im now a bit on the outside."	regularMondayCoffee	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9988277554512024	weak	strong	no	na	domesticviolence	failed

"I think being aware that a change is needed, and actively beginning to make plans to leave, even if only in your head, is a good place to start. 

You’ll get all sorts of advice on this Reddit, telling you to start saving money, secure a job and a vehicle, find a place to live, even if temporarily, before leaving. All of that’s great advice if your situation allows it, but a lot of people, like myself, didn’t/don’t have that luxury of time, they realize they need to leave immediately, for whatever reason, and after grabbing whatever they think they’ll need and as much money as they can and out the door they go. It doesn’t matter which exit you take, leaving is the priority. I’m not going to tell you this is easy, no matter which exit you chose it’s going to be hard. 

I was married 22 years. When I left I hadn’t had a full-time job in years, I was a SAHM, worked part-time, was fully responsible for the kids, the house, the yard, the pets, cleaning, shopping, rides, cooking, laundry, plus doctors appointments, vet appointments, teacher conferences, vehicle maintenance, school functions. I had one minor child 17F still living at home when I filed for divorce. She was nearly an adult, not a 3 year old and it was still an incredibly difficult time for her. I had no access to money, I had no job. I had to borrow money for a lawyer. 

I was really lucky not to have to deal with determining custody, it’s never pleasant but when dealing with a narcissist it becomes a war zone, it’s hard to come to terms with the idea your child has to spend 50% of their time with someone who has been physically/verbally abusive to others. Unfortunately the court is going to give him partial custody of some sort, no matter how much you oppose it, so your time will be better spent preparing your son for it, than fighting it. The best advice I received was pick your battles. The narcissist will fight over every single decision if you allow it, so decide which battles are worth fighting ahead of time, and let the rest go. This is a form of gray-rocking, engaging only when needed, and otherwise basically ignoring them. Negative engagement is their idea of a good time, you can deprive them of that by refusing to play along.

It took 3 years for me to get divorced, and it’s still not finished, we have another court date over division of finances coming up. So not only is it hard, but it feels like it will never end. For me, the first year was the hardest, you’re mourning the loss of what you had committed your life to, you’re struggling to get your feet underneath you, to manage court, a full-time job, daycare, bills, your child, and you’re doing all this while dealing with a bitter manipulative narcissist doing their best to see you fail. 

For some reason at this point, instead of making some changes and getting some help, trying to save the relationship, the narcissist instead will go scorched earth on you, because they’re trying to force you to come back, they think if they make it hard enough, you’ll give up. This is where they’ll be willing to hurt themselves to hurt you, so don’t make the mistake of thinking “he wouldn’t do that, if he did, then X, Y, Z would happen, and he doesn’t want that…” They absolutely will take the hit if the outcome means things get difficult for you, no hesitation. You might never consider using the child as a weapon, but they will. Make it through the first year, it gets easier from there.

That’s all I have. Sister, you can do this, if I can do it, you can do it, there’s nothing special about me, I have no secret weapon. If you want to talk further, message me, I’m a good listener."	regularMondayCoffee	reply	na	na	na	0.9988277554512024	weak	no	no	na	domesticviolence	failed

i have a few years worth of notes, with dates, about things that hav happened. phtoso of text message, photos of brusing etc. therapist recommended doing so a couple of years ago and im glad i have. 

Similarly, the idea of leaving in secret feels like an overreaction and unfair to him. but when i have tried to talk to him about separating, it never really gets anywehere as he always ends up making me feel so guilty for ""ruining our sons life"" if i make that choice  :("	regularMondayCoffee	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9988277554512024	strong	strong	no	na	domesticviolence	failed

"So, the big thing about custody and visitation (which I’m sure will be familiar since you’ve read WDHDT) is that an abuser can NOT be a good parent. You’ll want as minimal time as humanly possible, maybe even supervised visits only, especially starting out. 
Things are different where I’m from in the US I’m sure, but I gave my ex husband 50/50 when we divorced because I wanted to be fair, and because he “only” abused me, not the kids. I understand now that I made a huge mistake. It took a LOT of escalating behavior, trauma for myself and my kids, years and thousands of dollars in lawyer fees with numerous court dates to get it fixed, because the court didn’t take me seriously. “If he was so abusive, why did you give him 50/50?” So they tried to paint me as either a dumbass or a liar. 

I highly recommend trying to talk to an advocate or a lawyer - both, preferably - and work together to find a plan that will keep you and the kiddo safer."	regularMondayCoffee	reply	na	na	na	0.9988277554512024	weak	no	no	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.
"Thank you. We escaped in 2021 and moved to a different county, so he doesn't know where we live. 
Sadly, I have no evidence so I can't get any protection:(.

This is how I felt at the start. Tbh it was my therapist that recommended to go there for support groups.
So I went to the first appointment, told her what he was like and she requested that I ask for my keys back - that was the start of it escalating.
Veiled threats and such, just enough to make me feel unsafe in my home - to the point that I would have intrusive thoughts about it.
Ended up calling a different department of that organisation because I was terrified. That's when it blew up - told them what he was saying and bam, child protection came in, talked to the police on the phone.
But I couldn't understand why everyone was acting the way they did, it didn't feel like a dangerous situation at the time.
I was slowly planning and trying to gather evidence.
Can see now, why they reacted quickly.

I'm so glad your therapist told you to start gathering evidence back then. This is good!
Plus with his addiction and spending issues, I think this may go in your favour for contact?

Look at it this way (bit of reverse psychology)- your partner's behaviour is totally unfair. You wouldn't treat him or anyone this way, so why is it okay for him to do it to you?
He doesn't have the same level of empathy that you do. No reason for his behaviour is justifiable to be abusive towards anyone.

As for 'ruining our son's life' - your partner is already doing that by making your son witness his erratic and abusive behaviour. Home needs to be a safe, secure, stable and loving environment for children to flourish.
Also,  like my sister said when my parents divorced.....she will get two lots of Christmas and birthday presents haha that was her reasoning.
Once you are out, you will need to sit down with your son and explain in a age appropriate way that you couldn't stay with his father. It's common for kids to blame themselves under certain circumstances.

Also, you can't do your best as a parent while constantly being mentally and physically beaten down.

"This is a wild ride lol I’ll try to keep it short! 
He wasn’t really good nor bad on paper.. he was pretty much nondescript. No criminal history except for a small marijuana charge that got dropped (at the time, anyway!) Couldn’t hold a job for long. Very lazy, slobby, not a cool guy by any means. But he wasn’t really bad on paper. 
But what really drove me to do 50/50 was my childhood. My mom was the abuser in the household, and she tried to use me against my dad in their divorce. My dad was my favorite person in the world. I kept thinking about how heartbroken my dad and I were without each other, and I didn’t want my girls to experience that.
But his behavior escalated tremendously after we split, as abusers often do. My kids witnessed more violence AFTER I left than they did before. 
I left June 2017. I got full custody of my kids after years of him harassing me over text, assaulting my male friend in my driveway, harassing people on the internet (trolling, death threats etc) which put my kids in danger because he was offering to give out his address, sending my kids back to me filthy and covered in horrific diaper rashes and sending them back to me in diapers long after they were potty trained, and the kicker was when my kids came home and told me “daddy took his clothes off and got in the tub with us.” After speaking to them very carefully and going over it with their doctor, it sounds like there was no penetration or anything but I truly believe he was grooming them sexually. This was in May of 2021. 
He eventually developed a severe alcohol problem and his behavior escalated AGAIN to where he wasn’t allowed to see them at all. He died from the alcohol last October. 
If I could do one thing differently, it would be avoiding 50/50 from the very beginning."	regularMondayCoffee	reply	na	na	na	0.9988277554512024	weak	strong	no	na	domesticviolence	failed
Ohhh AND he aimed a gun at my face (when I left, June 2017) and then strangled me to the point of leaving bruises on my throat (Nov 2017, with a previous strangulation incident in July 2013) for which he was arrested. I dropped the charges because I felt bad for him. So on paper I was the one who looked bad. I looked flaky and passive and that’s pretty much why they didn’t take me seriously.	regularMondayCoffee	reply	na	na	na	0.9988277554512024	no	strong	no	na	domesticviolence	failed
"I previously made a post here about my LDR boyfriend's bruises. It's been a tough almost-2 months, because I simply have not been able to make any direct contact with him because of his girlfriend that he lives with. Even before she found out about us, she visually checks in on him (opens his door and looks at him) every half an hour, and glances/checks his phone + social media inboxes every day. 

Background: he abandoned his old life (broken family, parents abandoned him and left him with aunt), moved cities to live with her after dating for a month-- 2.5 years ago. since then their relationship has been stale, they sleep in different rooms, she wakes him up to do chores every 2-3 hours in the day (he works the night shift so sleep is daytime), she verbally belittles him saying he's useless, yet supports him financially to make him stay.
When he moved over, he brought his rescued cat to her house (it means a lot to him).
They have initiated breakups a few times even before me, but this girl would threaten him with suicide and also forbid him from leaving with his cat. So because of his cat, he gave up fighting for himself.

31st May she found about me and argued with him for a whole day it seemed, she initiated breakup but was threatening to abuse his cat if they break up. Funny thing is, she has yet to actually know the full extent of our relationship. Up till now, she hasn't accessed the app we used. She has only seen a few hearts on instagram and a missed call from me which he forgot to delete. that's it. 
This day was the start of his phone not in his full possession anymore. 

1 June was when he went to the ER for vomiting + dizziness + heart palpitations. The timing was weird

4 June he made contact with me and i was so relieved. he explained what happened over the past few days but not much. he also told me that he wouldn't be able to contact me much the next few days because she has been checking Battery Usage everyday. then he sent me pics of the bruises (in old post). i only had suspicions after i ended call with him. 

no messages until 8 June where he finally went to school for the first day since this happened. I sent him a message and he replied instantly, but he had an exam to attend. we talked a little, and he told me she would be waiting for him at the gates of the school as soon as his class ended. we said our goodbyes and he deleted our chat. however in the afternoon i received insults and was blocked. i think it was because there were extra minutes of said app's On Screen Time in battery usage, which was unexplained, so she knew he contacted me.

from then on, i could only reach out to his distant friend whom he usually calls during work just to chat. from this friend, i found out that the girl has been following him to work everyday and just sit there in the dining/ rest area watching his every move.
when the friend calls his phone? it's either unanswered or she picks up the phone. and she would pass one airpod to my bf, while she picks up the other to listen to the conversation. as such, the friend and him can only talk about us when she goes to the toilet.. 
communication is really choppy and bad. to make things worse his friend has no empathy and no sincerity in helping either. men be men, they really just talk about meaningless things and call it friendship. 
though, i've gotten a few replies to my pressing questions. he has said that he plan is ongoing, he needs to save money (though i can't see that, they even got a new hamster) -- he says that he wanted a hamster because it reminded him of me (i used to send him hamster pics) and that hamster utitilies were all paid for by her, but now he has to cover other expenses which was previously paid for by her. there seems to be no end, what other questions should i ask? would a deadline be reasonable?

over the past month his abusive gf has limited all his social media profiles. i've created a fake facebook profile with hints within (he gave me a code between both of us, i set it as birthday). he accepted it during work possibly knowing it was me, but after 4 days i was blocked and his facebook has friend requests disabled :-) 
i'm running out of ideas as to how i can contact him. 

I know many aspects about his life, he and i have turned on location sharing since months ago. i know where he works, where he lives, but i have slowed it down because i'm afraid this would cross a boundary? initially i've tried calling the store but it's linked to fax only. I crossed a boundary yesterday maybe, because i called his school (it's a very small private diploma school in the corner of a road) in hopes of the staff would help me a message to him, to contact me. yet for some reason, the school called the social bureau and police? the police went to his home, and everything was told to the girlfriend. i specifically told his school personnel that he has a sensitive situation at home, and his girlfriend is controlling his phone!!! i don't know what tf happened, and why they would tell his abuser everything. within 4 hours since i called the school, the girlfriend removed our location sharing.

To answer your question- you don’t. 

Last time my abusive ex had a hidden girlfriend he told her I was the abusive one and he was just using me for a place to stay so she would stick around. Furthermore if this girl is with a man who has been cheating on her with you (& I’m not justifying her actions) then it makes sense why she’s hyper vigilant towards his communication/whereabouts. Sure she sounds batshit crazy but so do you.

so i would believe that he does want to be with me.
i've thought about your last line as well, people always say if they really want you they would be with you, right. but who am i to expect that he should take a up a loan just to get out of her house and incur debt?"	abckittyxcv	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9954060316085815	weak	strong	no	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.
"“Who am I to expect he should take up a loan just to get out of her house and incur debt?” You are the other woman. If he hasn’t done that for himself, he’s not going to do it for you. 

I think most people would be willing to make necessary changes and sacrifices to escape serious abusive situations- especially when there’s no children involved. You said “she supports him financially to make him stay.” Seems he’s complacent with his situation. 

Furthermore, if he still continues to talk to you he’s also an abusive partner. Whether this abuse is reactive or not is besides the point. He is supposedly using this woman for his own financial stability and continues to lie and cheat behind her back with you. If he’ll cheat on her, he’ll probably cheat on you. Abusive relationship or not, I don’t respect anyone who condones or enables betrayal. Calling his work, school, creating fake profiles to contact him- you are borderline stalking someone who isn’t actively trying to contact you back.

"i am so sorry you're experiencing this, and i can unfortunately empathize 100%- earlier today i even looked up ""waiting for court limbo"" and some results popped up regarding ""waiting anxiety"" but it was mostly for stuff relating to executive function over appointments, not paralyzing, and grounded, fear and anxiety over being judicially involved with holding an abuser accountable over the literal crimes committed against you 

i don't have any advice, but just wanted to let you know you aren't alone and i feel you with the extreme frustration- what will hopefully be the last court date with my ex is in a year and i am constantly waiting to get a call from my court advocate or legal assistant to the prosecutor that he made bail and will be released at any point ON TOP OF the dread of having to testify about all of the abuse (including SA) in front of a jury.... it's a nightmare and i stg nobody knows how it feels unless they've actually been through it, the amount of apathy i've encountered from people, as well as insane ignorance with statements like ""oh, well at least it's going to court and you get to tell your story"" BRO. the silver lining isn't yours to make, what the hell, also going to court is not a silver lining! maybe in retrospect but that won't be for YEARS if i ever feel like that at all, i've already testified and it's brutal, you are basically being professionally gaslit in a courtroom and are being tested for your resilience against it while your abuser is there bearing witness, it's insane it's not just retraumatizing it's its own new trauma 

i've wanted so badly to move on and do the things i know i need to do to heal but knowing i can't work towards forgetting everything and moving on because doing so can potentially compromise my ability to discuss the events in question due to forgetfulness from time passing keeps me stuck, that on top of worrying about when and/or if he gets out and begins the stupid stalking process i'm told will inevitably happen just makes me feel so stuck and it sucks"	georgixx	reply	na	na	na	0.9984503984451294	strong	strong	no	na	domesticviolence	failed

You’re right it’s a completely traumatising experience all on its own! My original date was 22nd May and I travelled all the way across to country to attend court, they got me all settled, talked me through what would be happening and then my solicitor came in and said it had been adjourned but no one had told me (or the courts). Since then I’ve just gone massively downhill. Can’t start any trauma therapy until the whole process is over, 1 because it could be used against me by defence with regards to my ability to give credible evidence and 2, again like you said, because this process it just additional trauma on its own.

Totally get the being gaslit in a courtroom with your abuser there, that’s the biggest fear. The gaslighting in the relationship is the worst part, I can imagine it’s so so triggering in a court room, having your reality questioned again.

It’s definitely not something that anyone can understand unless they’ve been there, I also feel like the longer it goes on, the less people are empathic towards you, as in there eyes we should be over it by now I guess!?

"Domestic abuse does not have to be physical. Emotional, financial, verbal abuse and control still cause the same psychological damage to the victim. The abuser will also step up the campaign of abuse if they feel at risk of losing their victim, which often results in extreme violence.
He will also get worse in future relationships, my ex has had 2 gfs since i left that have had his charged and convicted of abuse towards them, he esculated mych quicker in those relationships than he did with me. 


I had the police commander contact me as they couldn't charge my ex before the marac review, but he was so concerned that i was in the top 5% most likely to be killed by domestic abuse. 


My ex attacked me after i left him and went into the refuge,  in the middle of the street and caught on cctv, he did not care about getting caught,  he only cared about attempting to take back the control i was begining to gain by leaving him. 
 He attempted to bully womens aid and the social worker to the point they themselves contacted police. I had to stay in the refuge until i could be housed away from the area.

Family annihilators are an example of this. In cases people will claim the deaths were unexpected because there were only arguments/emotional abuse in the relationship before the murders. 

There is a man in jail for strangling his girlfriend. He was described as being insecure and needy but never hit his girlfriend.

So I didn't really know the signs. But thanks informing me. Also, the relationship moved fast. I met him, he said he loved me the second day and I found out I was pregnant 4 weeks later. So this all took place in two months of meeting him.	ghanaianbrit	follow-up	na	na	na	0.992828905582428	no	strong	no	na	domesticviolence	failed
Yes you're right. His words are truly painful and make me so stress that they affect my mental health. He's said some really disgusting things that I don't want to even think about.	ghanaianbrit	follow-up	na	na	na	0.992828905582428	weak	strong	no	na	domesticviolence	failed
Yes, I've reported him for rape and they're investigating him right now. However me and my daughter live with my father and police have installed a panic alarm in our house. But he keeps on coming unannounced-banging on the door in Broad daylight. The police have removed him from my home many times. Everyone thinks I'm not safe at my dad's, so they're trying to move my daughter and I either into a refuge or temporary accommodation.	ghanaianbrit	follow-up	na	na	na	0.992828905582428	no	strong	no	na	domesticviolence	failed

A week ago today I finalized my plans to leave my(27f) boyfriend (25m) of 2 years. The past… I would say about six months have been nothing short of the worst six months I’ve probably ever had, and that’s saying a lot. He let the mask slip, he was so kind, loving and gentle in the beginning. He became super controlling and violent. I felt so trapped and so afraid. I’m so happy I went with my gut and left before it was too late and things got a lot worse. I didn’t even think about it too much. I just turned off the feelings I had for him and I just left. It wasn’t easy and my heart truly goes out to those who have it a lot worse. I truly wish you guys all the peace and safety in the world💜	viviana1994	post	22.60273639523645	female	White	0.9878702759742737	na	na	na	28	domesticviolence	failed

"My daughter is 21, and a few days ago her boyfriend of 2 years choked her “because he let his tiredness get the best of him.” He was arrested. She knows the risks of choking, and left him to stay with us, but still is somewhat protective of him, minimizing (in my perception) his coercive controlling behaviors. She has agreed to therapy, and seems to want it. Currently she has him blocked on everything, but he found a way to reach her anyway and is being apologetic right now. Because she’s minimizing certain aspects of his abuse, I’m terrified she’ll go back to him. She is fixated on wanting closure, and just “one last conversation” which I feel is opening the door to more manipulation by him. I’m looking for insight because I’m out of my element. Her history is below:

In late June she told me he was verbally abusive, calling her stupid and saying he hated her. She’d been hiding a lot from us. I’d already gotten the impression she was protecting him about something, and was secretive about him, but I didn’t push it bc I wanted to keep communication open for when they broke up. Here are some things I’ve picked up on in the past: 
- he worked hours away, and she would ride with him and sit in the car all day waiting for him to be finished with work
- she left the studio we provided for her to live with him, but his living situation was a house of cards, and she quickly became homeless. Recently living in a trap house with him
- she has lost every job she’s had since meeting him, at least once for arguing with him in the parking lot of her work
- has lost all but one friend (used to be known for how outgoing and extroverted she was)
- she doesn’t make eye contact with any of his male friends out of “respect,” (she was a feminist before meeting him)
- he makes her change out of her shorts (doesn’t want to give males the wrong impressions) when company stops by
- he broke into the bathroom when she was on the toilet bc a past girlfriend cheated on him in the bathroom, therefore he didn’t trust how long she was taking in there
- he has packed his bags at least 20 times in arguments (she was abandoned by her bio dad) and I think he knows abandonment is her greatest fear
- he has forced her down to sitting when angry, with his hands close to her neck but not choking her that time. 
- she looks like a shell of her former self now: malnourished, has lost at least 20 lbs since they got together. Everyone who sees her asks me what’s going on 
- he called her fat, then called her bloated (she’s always worrying about looking bloated) 
- told her she could do exercises to build up her thighs and butt 
- says she acted so strong when they met that when she cries or acts weak now, he can’t comfort her because he has to treat her  the way she claimed to be 
- always telling her she needs to grow up 
- talks to other women online and when she caught him he claimed he “finesses” these women for money (he’s also unemployed) 
- during the relationship had her blocked on some social media but blamed her for it 
- we’ve barely seen her throughout their relationship, and only been around him twice 

As he was being arrested for choking her, he asked the police to ask my daughter to wait around at the trap house to “Watch his stuff.” No remorse expressed, nothing. 

I’m sorry this is so long. I have trouble with being concise, especially when emotional. My main concern is that in spite of all of these things I listed, my daughter sees all of it through the lens of this prick’s vulnerability. I feel I am walking a razors edge trying not to bash him and turn her off while also trying to help her realize she’s been being abused. Any insight would help so much.

If this was my daughter and I had the funds, I'd be taking her on holiday, treat her to fancy dinners and really focus on making her feel good. One of the best parts to me about being out of an abusive relationship is that I can go where I like and do what I like. I think the treating her really well will highlight to her what she's been missing and will give her less time to think of him and be in contact with him. The more space and time she has from him, the less of a hold he will have on her. If she's a reader, get her to read Lundy Bancroft's book, it's an eye opener.

my mom let the dv shelter guide her.  she was on the phone with me once a week for 10 years and we always hada good convo.  after that time I went home to her to get back on my feet and start over.  and I felt like being close to someone abusive would make me that way.

Read everything you can get your hands on about dv and pass along to her what she will tolerate. Be careful not to push her away by being too adamant  because alienating her from family is part of the dv dynamic and she needs you desperately. She is at high risk of returning to her abuser. That’s when it gets tough as a parent. Keep the bond with her. Be supportive of her and reiterate that you love her and are here to help. Listen to her. I would say it’s best to let her know you understand he is abusive but it still may be hard to leave him at first. Tell her about trauma bonding, love bombing, gaslighting, all the ways abusers confuse and lie to manipulate their victims. Give her words to understand what’s happening to her and that dv relationships follow very distinct and common patterns. To be ready to leave him, she must conclude that he won’t get better except temporarily as a ploy to get her to stay. Sending you a big hug. I’ve been in your shoes. Took a few years.

"There are two other primary people in the house, and one of them is constantly doing coke and there are people who wander in and out of the home also doing coke. The other primary person is definitely a drunk, but I don’t know what other drugs he does. The house is constantly getting water and electricity shut off, and in general is just a flophouse for people to stay at or party at. It’s really awful and filthy inside, as you can imagine. 

She claims she and her ex don’t do drugs, but it’s hard to know what she’s hiding right now. I think it’s more likely that he is her drug of choice. She’s been very dependent on him for feelings of love and acceptance, and said it was worth it to be homeless and live in those conditions in order to be with him."

"I had to go to work again today with evidence of your anger and addictions on my face.  

Barb Simpson said it best, it doesnt matter how you feel on the inside, its whats on the surface that counts. 

I am most disappointed because my office used to be a safe place where i was well liked. Unfortunately, the majority of my peers are judgemental and the rest became too uncomfortable to look at me. 

Each time i arrivred with an obvious injury the distrust of my character grew. I dont think this was intentional--after all, even on the most primal level, weakness simply isnt tolerated in the game where survival is a prize only awarded to the fittest. 

There were several days that I stayed at work long past 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. I was terrified to return back home.

Had i been asked outright back then, i likely would have just broke down, but I was neither approachable or vurnerable. 

When i arrived with a broken hand, i pretended it wasnt swollen. When i showed up with a laceration across my face i stood up in front of 75 people and gave a sound presentation that i am almost certain did not reach a single person--not really anyway. 

So, eleven months after the first incident, i arrived today  with a broken heart, one good eye, and one black eye. Nobody said a word, but i know they know. 

This agony reminded me of why words like secrets exist. It feels like i detailed every gruesome scream in a single email and forwarded it like a superstitious chain letter. 

Im naturally very private, thats easier still when my shame breeds more silence and reinforces the idea that i am the local unsolved mystery. While secrets dont make friends, they do keep the local people and their quesrions at bay. 

Whats heavy on my chest now is waking up to the the pain of existing every day that i could be dead in the god damn ground. 

You gave all the bad things better names which let me stay hidden for far too long from all the demons in disguise. Ive been coexisting with evil so long that i think ive caused my internal warning system to malfunction. Arrogantly, i thought i had escaped the daily mental, physical and sexual abuse of my early years.

The familiar gossip that surrounds me now only revealed that im simply on a repeating loop fueled by the speculation of those peering down from their ivory towers. 

What i need to get off my chest is that I hate that i am broken, i hate that i am stupid, I hate that i fell like a mistake. 

I only have myself to blame and i know its cliche but i dont wanna be me anymore.

"I was in a physically abusive relationship for years. I have documented all of the assaults and recorded my partner during the violent rages. The last time, 5 months ago, in a drunken rage he beat me up badly, choked me and said he would kill me. I was afraid for my life, as I had been before. 

I called the police when he refused to leave, gave them his name and told them what happened. They came hours later in the early hours and I had fallen asleep.

I documented my bloody face, bruising and an audio of the attack until he smashed my phone. 

He begged me the next morning not to press charges because it will impact his custody battle. He asked me to go to therapy with him instead. Therapy did not go well and he refused to participate and instead threw me under the bus. He did admit his physical violence and other abuses to the therapist. He chose to discontinue therapy and I left him. 

I think he should be held accountable for his actions. I have been getting domestic violence support, I’m in CoDA, I’m in therapy.

"Hi

Sorry throwaway acc because I have some relatives in my main.

One year ago I broke up a 8 year relationship (I am 28 years old), it was really hard and it was thanks to therapy but I never told my therapist in detail what happened.

I thought my ex was the love of my life now I see how wrong I was, he treated me so so so bad, everything I did was wrong, even simple things like how I walk, EVERYTHING was a reason for him to call me bad things like stupid and things like that, but that was nothing compared to the things he made me after, I'm sorry for telling this, but he beated me so many times, he tried to kill me with a huge knife and even he strangled me till I fainted. Oh my god I already crying writing this. Yesterday I got mad and I threw everything my ex gifted me.

Last session I couldn't resist anymore and I told my therapist everything, I started crying and when the session finished I went home crying, since then I CAN'T STOP, I'm not overreacting, I cry all the damn time, I'm on a two weeks break on work so I don't have that distraction, I only want to be in bed crying, I literally wake up crying and I have nightmares where people who I love leaves me.

I tried taking 0.25 of clonazepam and it helps me in the moment but when the effect dissappears I am this whole mess again. I went to buy groceries and I cried in the middle of the cereal aisle, I mean I AM A DISASTER. I don't know what to do, really, I don't know. I am getting desperate because I don't find a solution.

Yesterday I went to have a run to clear my mind and I came back, guess what, crying...

I don't know if I should contact a psychiatrist and ask for help or contact my therapist and tell him what is happening to me. I just want to take clonazepam and sleep all day but I know that doesn't help so I don't do it. I wake up desperate and the rest of the day I try to distract myself with another things but then the night comes and everything sucks again and my dreams are not helping me, I have nightmares all the damn time.

I am meeting a new person who treats me so well, but we started dating two months ago and I can't tell him this and I am so sad because I don't want to screw things, I mean he treats me like I've never been treated and I am a happy person when I am with him and I feel like I am goint to mess up everything because now I am a mess.

Please, I don't know, just tell me this is normal and is going to be ok, it is?

"You should definitely continue to talk to your therapist. If they have a doctorate, good, if not you might ask them to recommend you to a psychiatrist for different meds. I say this thinking that you may still continue to have difficulty being unable to stop crying.

I would be very careful with clonazepam and really any prescription drug. I know you’re only taking 0.25 mg, which should be pretty safe. But meds can be a slippery slope for anyone at any time.

Most importantly, its good and normal and kind to yourself to be honest about some things:

You have been traumatized. You may have some form of PTSD or Complex PTSD from what you’ve experienced. Your body wasn’t ready to release the emotional and mental stress and pain you underwent until you finally felt safe enough to tell someone. As much as you can’t stop crying and you “want to get back to normal” the person you were before this was really hurting and strained with so much pressure. You kept all of this in for how long? You deserve this release. You deserve to feel your feelings. 

Take your time, your body is telling you that you need the time. You deserve rest and peace. You in no way deserved what he did to you, and you survived that awful treatment. You made it out and that’s amazing. You recognized that your peace and safety meant more to you than keeping his “love” for you in your life. The crying and releasing you’re experiencing is part of years pent up in your body. Let it all out. You will feel better eventually, don’t be afraid. It’s okay to be delicate. It’s okay to be vulnerable. 

Especially when you’re safe with yourself. 

As for your new person, take time. Drop some small amounts of information, look closely at how they respond. Time will tell how well they will treat you and watch their actions, not what they say.

I wish you all the best and I hope you take your time to heal from this."	NorthVisit5477	reply	na	na	na	0.9983147382736206	no	no	no	na	domesticviolence	failed

The case is: he hit me in the leg and I called 911, went to urgent care. So I’m assuming the evidence is enough. Now that I reported it, in state of Ohio it’s out of my hands and up to prosecution to drop the charges. I need to do something about it, and don’t worry we won’t be living together, and we’re also getting a divorce. Just please help on what I could do to ask the prosecutor. Spouse knows I reported and he took it well, he said he will deal with it, whatever penalties he would face. I cannot let that happen to him and we won’t be together anyways.

"The first time I called, I couldn’t get anyone to answer and he was right there and I was afraid things were going to get worse if I didn’t hang up. 

The second time, he called (because I called my mother, who I knew would answer.) We were both arrested. I was in shock. They asked if I needed medical treatment and all I could think was “I can’t afford a medical bill without his income.” So I refused a trip to the hospital. I regret this deeply. They put me in a room alone while they were processing us. I slipped in and out of consciousness a few times. While I was awake I was able to hear him joking with one of the arresting officers in the hall the entire time. I almost passed out again when they showed up to escort me to finger printing. No empathy was shown. Inappropriate charges pressed for both of us (lesser charge for him, and a charge at all for me.) 

The third time, I called- it wasn’t for an ongoing situation, but I found lots of evidence of serious crimes in the house against me. They took the evidence, and followed up months later that they couldn’t do anything about it because it wasn’t a crime. (False- it is clearly in my state’s statutes as a crime.) 

I have not felt supported by any step of the legal process whatsoever.

"I recall one incident where my partner at the time had trapped me in a hotel room, planning to kill me - I’d woken up to him holding a boiling kettle over my face, I managed to escape and call the police but I was unable to explain what had happened. All I could do was say yes or no and they basically came to the conclusion that we were both intoxicated and it was a two/sided argument. It was not. I felt so judged and invalidated. There were several instances where police failed to recognise that it was abuse, simply because I didn’t know at the time either. I had been manipulated into thinking I was partly to blame.

In my better experiences, the officers took more time to ask questions, they filled out the DASH risk assessment with me, which I think enabled them to truly see the abuse. They saw the patterns and told me how dangerous the abuse was. They also spoke from experience with other offenders, and of similar cases (no gdpr breach), but their knowledge and experience was validating and made me feel heard, it was their training and experience that meant they were able to see the abuse and see past the abusers facade. 

Interestingly, it was usually the average police constables who were invalidating. One even said that most of the DV call-outs they got were 2 sided, so they were probably biased/immune to it. It was the major crime team & specialist DV police who were able to recognise abuse and validate me (other than on one occasion where regular PCs begun the process, but that was in a police force in which DV is a priority crime).

I actually did a small scale study on stigmatisation and the impact it has on help-seeking behaviour in IPV. It was only a college project but interestingly I found that of the people who had disclosed abuse to the police, the had received some form of stigmatising response (blame, downplaying abuse, etc) and that then prevented them from seeking help in future instances until it escalated to the point that lives were at risk. Formal support networks (such as police) are usually where most DV support referrals come from. So one of the most crucial points of contacts for DV victims being so uneducated on DV is incredibly dangerous. Whilst the project wasn’t published evidence, I think it says ALOT about the dangers of less than adequate communication with the police.

"They had a pamphlet that pointed to the services needed to get out. They validated my experiences and corroborated my feelings that I was in danger.  

My ex-wife was not in the house at the time when I called the cops. When I got back from work, I found the house trashed. Photos ripped off wall. She had stolen a lot of random items from the house but left all her personal items. She stole the bidet, bathroom mirror and all the silverware but left her wallet, jewelry and clothes (also all the deeds and titles for the houses and cars).

While I discussed what has been happening, the cops kept their hands on their guns and looking out the window. They studied her photographs.

There was a lot of other strange behavior also. It all started with Covid lockdowns. For about 9 months I tired to hold things together but the cops assured me I did right thing by calling them. They were concerned for my safety and gave me all the info needed to get safe before they contacted her.  They wanted me out of the house and file a dvpo before they contacted her. 

I think they saved my life. I didn’t want to call the cops. I was left with no option. I was terrified to go to bed, what if she showed up randomly in the middle of the night?

I wouldn’t offer help. You can get crossed in the cross fire. Idk this is a tough one. I wish someone would have helped me leave. But I would have needed to want to leave first. See DV victims don’t realize they are victims all the time. We rationalize it.  Think it’s going to stop.  Hope it does. But a last straw will come. Either way when they leave it’s the most dangerous time—so if you “helped” you be putting yourself at risk. I also would be conscious of helping while things are escalated. Again if this guy has no problem beating up her he will have no problem going after you. I would just offer your phone number as a good neighbor.

It has been absolutely awful. We broke up a month or so ago he never took it well but I tried to do parent. He broke in my house earlier in the week out of anger and yesterday he busted in my house took my son and my phone. Took a video of me grabbing for my son and claimed I scratched his (my ex) arms up. I got a domestic charge but he also filled it under a false name so and it’s completely made up so I’m not worried about it sticking. When I got out of jail the cops told me I probably need to report the arresting officer and they got my son back for me. His dad has no rights so it would have been kidnapping if he didn’t turn him over. Then I get home and find out despite the no contact order he stayed at my home that he doesn’t share with me anymore and rearranged my furniture and had another woman stay in my house with my son there while I was in jail.

Mine attempted to break in to my house 3 seperate times in a week despite me having a restraining order. What saved me was my ring cameras. If you don't have any, I highly recommend you get some kind of security cams. The footage is what helped the police get the charges to stick and now he is likely going to serve time in prison.

"This has been the roughest 6 months of my life. By far. Like goddamn it terrible. It’s because the person I was before the relationship, was dead, so I was left completely broken trying to scavenge for pieces to put myself back together with. But. As hard as it was. I did. The old me is dead, but I’m becoming who I need to be. I am finally starting my future and I’m so excited. 

God knows I’m not 100% healed, but I’m accepting now that I’m never gonna be. Mentally I literally died, that person is broken beyond repair or any function, sadly that will always leave scars, but those scars can be reminders of what I’ve been through rather than something I’m still going through. I have good days and bad days, tbh today was a rough one, but I am so much infinitely better now. I no longer doubt I was abused, and I am no longer afraid to say it. It’s my history, and it’s ugly, but goddamn it I wear the battle scars with pride. 

I almost pressed charges… and I’m happy to say I’m 99% sure a Jury would have found him guilty if I did after collecting evidence. There is something so satisfying to that. 

He ruined my life on every level, every aspect, but I’m rebuilding to be someone who I am very proud to become. I would be lying if I didn’t say a lot of what I’m proud of are things that I learned and became because of him. He doesn’t get that credit though, because how I grew was through the blood sweat and tears of moving on and healing. I respect myself deeply, and so do others around me (friends, parents, teachers, coworkers, bosses, even strangers who just met me) and I am so proud of the man I’ve become. 

Please. Keep fighting. I’ve been in the trenched, I still am sometimes and it feels suffocating like there’s no way out. You may not believe me, I didn’t, but there is a life on the other side."

I’m wondering how many of you have also been in a similar situation? What was the response when you did contact? Why did or didn’t you contact? If you could improve on the response of police what would it be?

I will never judge those who did or didn’t reach out but would love to know everyone’s experiences both good and bad.

"I was raised in domestic violence. My father was an abuser.  The entire family is dysfunctional and believes in ""the dysfunction."" 

(Its delusional thinking).    some form of:   Shared psychosis.  

  I then alter my life escaping DV-by slowing extracting myself from family. Lowering contact.  

No longer exposing myself, along with trying to listen to the next generation another abuser in the family found out and threatened me with violence for trying to talk and help another victim in our family. She was only talking, and I was listening to her for her. 

He found out.  Only for that victim to then turn on me.  Nice huh?  Yup, be very careful because these situations are dangerous, and you still question if you are insane or them?  Trust me its them.  You wont win IN SOME CASES SO I UNDERSTAND AND DONT JUDGE EITHER. My mother was a victim I know what she went through.  I won't do it. 

 Its sick and its twisted but its on them not me.  The perp eventually destroyed his own life and took his own life.  (He had many things going on.  (Drugs for example). 

 In trying to help I was threatened, and all of the family continues to see me as the bad guy.  Its ok once I accepted it is what it is. A lot of envy in dysfunctional families. I did not report to police but wanted to. Thought long and hard but did not do it.   It was not out of fear I did not report, I just knew threatening me was not something:

 a. would be taken too seriously because there was not anything they could actually do.  

b. they would have to wait until a crime was committed.  

I just had to make a decision to stay no contact and NOT CARE WHAT THEY THINK.  

This still does not change the abuse and how much threatening can still mess someone up emotionally psychologically which affected me A LOT!  I HAVE LEARNED NOONE CAN CHANGE MY DIRECT EXPERIENCE OF WHAT HAPPENED AND I KNOW MY TRUTH.  YOU REMEMBER THAT! NOTHING CAN OR WILL CHANGE YOUR DIRECT EXPERIENCE OF WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU. As much as they want to rewrite what happens you know! 

Once you accept everything as is :  you keep going around it.  Its still not easy but everyone has to do what is best for them.   The dangerous MOST DANGEROUS TIME IS IN LEAVING so there will be a lot of hate, envy and dysfunction when families are especially violent.  That being said it is the BEST THING I EVER DID.  ESCAPING.   When they see me:  I remind them of what the TRUTH IS  without saying a word!  It reflects back on them!   Its hard but I did not report.  Everyone has to make the right decision for them!"	shift_theculture	reply	na	na	na	0.00148363399785012	no	strong	no	na	domesticviolence	failed
"If you are the female in the equation you will likely not be believed. 
If you are believed, they won’t do anything anyway. 
If they finally do decide to take action it will be the equivalent of a “bad boy” finger shake. 
You will likely be hurt or even killed before it’s taken seriously. 
If you get a order of protection, you’ll be hard-pressed to get it defended if it’s violated. 
If you file for divorce, even if being assaulted was the cause, unless the judge allows it, the assault won’t be mentioned or used to drive the decisions being made. Even when it’s the sole reason for the divorce. 
They’ll be a lot of discussion about being the disadvantaged spouse, and providing comparable lifestyles, but in the end you’ll still be the disadvantaged spouse, and you won’t have a comparable lifestyle.

"I was raised in a DV household. 
And I was just in a very unexpected IPV situation a couple days ago— mind blown tbh. I thought about calling my best friend before the police— they agreed lol. For me at least there’s a lot of shame, embarrassment, feeling like I wouldn’t be believed, feeling like I’d absolutely lose my shit at some football coach cop, feeling unnecessary guilt, like I was “over reacting” (yet I was in danger)— but what I realize now is I was focusing solely on getting myself to a safe place / safe distance away from that person. They had already hurt my body, tried to take my phone, they already made it clear they were going to use their body to keep me out of my home — the thought crossed my mind several times and it was verbalized as a threat at least 5x however, I just wanted to get inside and get behind a locked door. I noticed a neighbor yell from his balcony and follow through the parking lot and continue towards us until I got inside— yet he also didn’t call the cops during/after the assault and left as this person rang my unit over and over in the middle of the night. 
I work in the mental health field and I think I feel the most shame for unknowingly bringing such an unexpected violent presence into my life and around the people I love. Ya don’t know someone till ya know someone. And of course, all of this comes with deep self compassion and self forgiveness. They are responsible and accountable for bringing hurt and violence into our lives. 
Survival instincts kick in— for some reason, personally, the idea of calling the cops creates more internal conflict than my gut instinct and fight/flight. Of course, if absolutely necessary I think my mind and body would act on calling the police. Because looking back, there were actions I did before/during/after in survival mode without even realizing that got me to a safe place. You’re not alone when I comes to the feelings around calling for help. And know it’s ok to trust your gut because it’s there for a reason — and that includes when the little voice is screaming “call 911”"	shift_theculture	reply	na	na	na	0.00148363399785012	no	strong	no	na	domesticviolence	failed
"The restraining order I had against my ex was for a year. I ended up getting it renewed for five years, although I asked for ten. It expired last month. I just couldn’t bring myself to deal with him again, and I thought that after so much time has passed he would have moved on and forgot about me. I thought letting it expire would be the best route for my mental health. 

Well, less than a month later he texts me. None of it mean or nasty, all of it trying to get me to come back to him. Even in his attempts to be nice, it just seems creepy and awful. I hate how he talks to me. I didn’t reply because I felt like he was trying to get a response from me. I hope that by not responding maybe he’ll assume I have already gotten a new number or something. 

I’m just downtrodden. I thought he might have found someone else’s life to ruin, most preferably his own. Why did he have to text me. It’s been six years. You’d think he’d have gotten the message that I’m not desperate for him, that I don’t want him. I’m just really, really sad. I had finally created distance. Now I don’t feel safe.

"I got out lawyered. She faced no consequences for her actions.

Well, I am not a lawyer and ended up representing myself during the DVPO hearing.  

Despite the evidence I put up, the texts, the photos, it wasn’t enough.  She walks free and faced no consequences.

I only had enough evidence to prove stalking once, not twice. In our state, it needed to be shown twice. How was I supposed to know this? I’ve never been in a DV situation before in my 40+ years of living.

The bruising photos were commented away by her team because, “look at him, he’s 6ft 2 and over 200lbs”.  How can my sweet 5 ft client cause all that harm to such a large man? He didn’t go to hospital, so not that bad. Right? 

The repeated SA was “consensual” again, he’s so large! There was no evidence or video…

The threats were represented as “jokes”.  Her brother-in-laws guns are “not a consequence of this case and inappropriate to bring up”. 

She filed divorce the day after the cops contacted her and brought her in. Her case was filed a few days before my temp. DVPO case was granted.  So, obviously, my DVPO case was just retaliation for divorce…  

The kicker was, they wanted to reject my case against her and place a case on me.  Again, HE is large and scary.

In the end, I wrote 4 pages of dates, times and facts. This is what happen. These were her actions against me. Her response was over 184pages long of speculation and paranoia. Trying to avoid consequences.

The judge saw through most of her BS.  He ruled my case was filed in good faith, ruled against her claims against me and kept the temporary order in place for an additional two weeks.  Enough time for me to move across country without her knowledge. Sadly, the judge didn’t grant the full PO and the charges were dropped by the DA for not crossing the “preponderance of evidence” level in the DVPO hearing.

She faced no real consequences.

She continues to cyberstalk me.  It’s been 3 years now.  It’s always an “accident”.  Not enough to file an anti harassment order. I also live 2500miles away."	burner_1993	post	30.320830045667904	female	White	0.9983726143836975	na	na	na	6	domesticviolence	failed

"Thanks. It was a rough time in my life for sure.  So happy we never had kids. I wasn’t about to retaliate during her outbursts, if I did I would be in jail right now. 

It sprung out out of nowhere. I put up with things for about 9months before calling cops after one really bad night. It just kept escalating.  The cops were very concerned how quickly and rapidly things escalated.  Not to mention a family friend of hers committed a m/s about a year before her outbursts started. 

Even though this is in the past and I’ve moved on. I worry she hasn’t.  

I met someone about a year ago, we just got engaged and expecting our first kid.   I worry if/when my ex- finds out, this might be a trigger for her.

bias plays into it for sure (moreso due to having a female perpetrator than being a male victim), but even in “traditional” (male perp female victim) dv cases, the legal system is awful at giving any sort of justice. don’t know if that’s a comfort to hear or just more depressing, but we (ppl with female perpetrators) certainly aren’t alone.	burner_1993	reply	na	na	na	0.9983726143836975	no	strong	no	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.

hi. so my mom has dealt with domestic abuse with my dad for my whole lifetime (i am 20), and this is her second marriage where she has had to deal with abuse. i really wanna help her get out of this situation even if it means working my ass off so i can help her get her own place. in our experience, trying to get help from higher-ups has never accomplished anything. the police have been called thousands of times only for them to say the same thing every time and not actually make any difference. i believe my mom has tried to file protection orders before and had court hearings but again, it did not change the situation. she has made it clear that she doesnt wanna stay with any of her family and that she wants to be on her own. right now i am just trying my best to complete my degree and hopefully get a job that can support her. we live in pg county maryland. any advice would be appreciated please and thank you for reading. 	chileanywayssss	post	29.150703764450164	female	White	0.9866315722465515	na	na	na	1	domesticviolence	no prediction.

"My neighbor (~60m) lives with his aunt (~90f). He screams at her daily and calls her the worst things. Sometimes it sounds like he is throwing things. We as neighbors collectively told his adult children whats going, one of them even heard it once when they forgot something and came back to collect it unannounced but they wont do anything. We talked to the victim but she says everything is fine but she went within less than 6 months from a cheerful woman to barely speaking. I think all this stress makes her cognitive function decline rapidly. :(

I’m a 26 year old female who has been dating a 28 year old male. 3 months ago my partner strangled me while camping at the beach. I was sure I was going to die but somehow I was able to get away and call the police. This was the first time he was ever violent with me but on the days leading up to event he broke my phone and coffee table over a fit of jealousy. I was ready to leave him for these things alone but he was able to convince me he was sorry and it would never happen again. The beach trip was supposed to be healing for us after what he did and stupidly I was having the best time that day and really believed we could move forward. That night on the beach we got into an argument that ended with me saying I didn’t want to be with him anymore. I should have known better but I have never been in a situation where any past partner physically hurts me so I did not realize a breakup could lead to him getting violent with me. He strangled me and banged my head on the floor as well as threatened to kill me because in his words he will not allow me to get over him and he needs to teach me a lesson. I was in shock I could not believe this was happening to me. I could taste death and could feel myself slipping away. He is much bigger than me and wrestled me/ tried to choke me out when I tried to run away. Somehow I was able to escape anyway and was able to drive away and get help. He was arrested that night and I filed for a restraining order. He was in jail for about a month before posting bail. During that month I tried everything I could to move on and make myself strong but as soon as he got out I found myself listening to his apologies and humoring the idea of getting back together. I love him but I knew it was wrong hence why I hid my communication with him from all my friends and family who supported me after the attack. I’ve been seeing him and letting him live with me for the past two months. I live hours away from my family and friends so you could say I’m quite isolated. It’s made it easy to live in denial that what I’m doing isn’t a mistake but living in this lie has caused me incredible stress. I’ve let him lovebomb me and convince me we can get past this, but abuse keeps happening and I’ve lost control of the situation. In the last two months at least 8 unforgivable acts of violence have occurred including him grabbing the steering wheel away from me while I drive. Every time I’m afraid I might die but I no longer know how I can escape. I feel sure that if I can get away from him I will never let him back into my life again but I’m afraid he will kill me before I get the chance to leave him for good.

i’m so sorry you’re going through this. from experience I know it’s the absolute scariest thing in the world. unfortunately when we find ourselves in these situations our brain gets caught in a “abuser/victim” cycle which makes it much harder to leave than simply knowing we should. i just want to reiterate to you that anyone who actually LOVES you would NEVER EVER hurt you. they would never verbally abuse you, they would never physically hurt you, and they would never put your life at risk. i know that because you’re inside of the situation it has started to become your new normal and it’s hard to process what it is happening but you are in such grave danger. please contact your family & friends and tell them you’re scared he’s going to kill you… the best option is escaping and going to stay with one of them who lives hours away. i promise you any inconvenience they might experience is worth saving your life. or just get in your car or book a flight and run and never look back. contact the domestic violence organizations wherever you end up and see if they can get you in a shelter. even being homeless for a little while is worth saving your life. please please call a DV organization so they can help you safety plan. the most dangerous time for a survivor is when they are leaving but if you are having these thoughts it is a good idea to act on them before he can talk you out of it. if you want to message me, you can. please leave. you are so cared about and loved and everyone would be devastated if anything bad happened to you.

Update after writing this post I went to my apt with two of my male coworkers to escort me while I get some overnight things and my dogs. It was as dramatic as you can imagine with him begging me in front of them to just talk to him, but having their support I was able to get away safely. I told him not be there when I came back or I would be forced to call the police since it is my apt. I was able to convince him to book a bus trip back to our hometown with the promise that I will think about reconciling yet again but I know as soon as he gets there tonight, I should go no contact. I’m relieved already knowing he’s on his way to be hours away from me but he’s still currently lovebombing me and trying to convince me he’s only leaving so that I know he truly loves me and that he’ll be back when I’m ready to forgive him. To top it off I was contacted by a therapist just now informing me that he’s signed us up for couples counseling. What can I do to stay firm in my decision?

"I’m going to start this off by saying I am 15f and my friend I’m discussing is 16f. 

I was friends with a girl (Z) for 6 years up until about a year ago, we were very very close. About a year and a half ago she got a new boyfriend (H). I had known this guy for a while and he seemed ok. He had some anger problems but I had never seen him lash out towards females. 

When they got together I was very very supportive of them together because he seemed to make her happy. 

After a couple of months, maybe 4 or 5, she started changing. She had always been a severe tomboy. Her hair was short, she dressed in “boys clothes” only. She went by they-them pronouns and never liked makeup or girly anything. 

Around their 4th month together she started telling me about how he didn’t wanna kiss her in public because then he would look gay because she “looked like a guy”. I saw this as a red flag and told her to not listen to it. (We were still friends at this point). She kept telling me about him doing this. Then suddenly she came to school with makeup and dresses and skirts and she started talking super girly. She did a complete 180 out of the blue. I didn’t say anything because maybe she wanted to change. 

About 6 months into their relationship she randomly texted me telling me she was no longer my friend and I was “manipulative and controlling”. She had never mentioned stuff like this and we were very open. BUT those were both things HE had called me in the past. Over the next few days she unfriended literally every single one of her friends until the only person she had was him. 

I have 5 classes with her so I see her a lot. Every time I see her she looks more and more depressed and loathing. Before school ended I started seeing bruises up and down her arms and sometimes busted lips. When I asked her about it she was say they were just from her falling off her 4-wheeler. 

I also sometimes hear him saying stuff to her like “your nothing without me” and “I thought I told you no.” And a lot of other condescending and straight vile things. 

I also noticed that every time he comes around she gets quieter and more closed off. She has also started flinching a lot. 

I don’t know what to do and I don’t even know if I’m allowed to post this but no one around me (including my parents) think it’s a big deal.

We were best friends who spent entire summers, weekends, and family vacations together. I KNOW her. This isn’t her. 

What do I do?

"Everything you've described sounds like domestic violence to me, especially the flinching part.  That's a uncontrollable reaction that a victim does when the abuser is around.  I know, because I used to be the one flinching and ""upsetting him and making him feel like a monster"".  

Since you're both still young and at school, I would try to get teacher or parents involved.  Like let them know what you've noticed and that you're genuinely worried about her, especially with her bruises.

She might be upset about your meddling, because it is also embarrassing for her to have to admit being abused/controlled."	laura4ever	reply	na	na	na	0.9983037710189819	no	strong	no	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.
"Teenage is time of changes. It is usual that childhood friendships end, and I really remember how painful it was.

For adults it is so easy to explain that a teenager is sad, angry, desperate or even explosive because of that teenage.  However, puberty and teenage are not pain automats. During those years the brain developes and it can cause this and that, but not all can be explained by the developement.

What you have heard your friend's boyfriend saying does not sound like fair to me. Your friend can be abused, and based oo what you told, she can really have problems. But how deep are they? It would be so easy to say that you are minor and your parents should take care of her, and you all. That's just not the case. Your friend is sixteen. Her parents cannot order her to stay away of that guy. If she is deeply in love and cannot see the situation realistically, she is dependent of that boy, and will do even stupid things to meet him. Or, in the worst case, she is afraid of him and does what he orders.

I am afraid there is not too much you can do. You can tell her parents, who, in the worst case, can see it all but actually cannot do anything. They cannot cuff her to a radiator. On the other hand, if he is narcissistic, he really can look like a dream boy friend, until the hell is really unveiled.

I’ve already told her if she ever needs anything she can always come to me, even if it’s just to talk or sit in silence. She agreed that she would. We’re not on bad terms but we are no where near friends anymore. I tried getting in contact with her parents but they didn’t respond.

"Thank you for your answer!

Not having children of my own, but having worked with younsters in very, very deep troubles, seeing people learning things in the most painful way is heartbraking. I have seen a girl of your age admiring her wonderful boyfriend until he jolted and pushed her so that she got her bones fractured. The end to that love was put in the court.

Then a bit philosophy. Demanding proof is an easy way to swipe the problems under the rug. It means that the principal cannot or don't want to do anything. Not wanting means, maybe, that (s)he is tired of or not interested in that problem. I guess principals tend to see lots of teenager's arguments.

I am sorry for not being able to help you and her. You are clearly very empathetic and worried about your long time friend. Empathy is a great gift, but definitely not an easy one!

Sometimes just really asking how is she and letting her talk about her feelings and thoughts can be the best help therapy and help. It, of course, is of any use only if she is willing to think and talk.

"Trigger warning:
I feel so terrible. If you’ve seen any of my recent post, then you know; My boyfriend is abusive towards me, but he hasn’t been in the last 5/6 months and has really improved on that, he has a severe porn addiction where he often spends thousands a day on it, I recently took a long vacation to see my family and I found out he cheated on me multiple times with strippers and paid them about $500 every time (he has no idea I know this), We we’re about to move across country once again in about a week, and since finding out about the cheating, I’ve decided that I was going to leave him, and I was gonna leave when he wasn’t home and not say a word to him.

Well the other night he came home late and confessed he went to the strip club and he has been going a lot and having an even harder time than ever with porn (which he doesn’t know that I’ve had access to his bank statements and I’ve been seeing everything he’s beeb doing) (He did not confess to cheating). A few hours later he told me that he is ready to quit Him confessing to me he has a bad addiction is a big deal to me because he’s only said that once or twice, and when I’ve tried to bring it up again he gets mad and says he doesn’t have an addiction, so I know this is a serious moment where he’s trying to seriously fight his addiction. He also tells me how he’s been feeling very depressed and suicidal lately and has been for awhile now. He feels like any day he could end his life. He talks about how he wishes he could get a gun but he doesn’t think he’ll be able to. He leaves and comes home with a knife. He doesn’t do anything with it tho.

For the rest of the day we discuss him getting treatment and help. At one point he asks me if I want to still move with him, and since we were being very honest with each other about the porn addiction (even tho he still is lying about the sex), I decided to tell him I don’t want to move with him and break up (even tho I originally wanted to keep it a secret because I was scared he would be mad and try to hurt me or break my things).

For hours he cries and begs he can try to do better for me and he is going to get therapy. I keep telling him no I am all done. He eventually calms down and leaves.

Hours later I get texts from him just saying “help”. I find him extremely drunk on the roof of a local apartment building laying on the ground, on the phone with the suicide hotline for 1 hour and 40 minutes. The lady on the phone tells me she talked him away from the edge, and he is really drunk and very tired from crying. She told me he says he wants to sign up for help so he can fix his addiction and our relationship because he loves me. I hang up with her and try to talk to him but he is so incoherent he doesn’t know what is going on. He starts shaking and throwing up so I call 911 to have someone come help us. Before they arrive he tries to stand up and ends up hanging over the edge of the building and I hold on to him. He eventually lays back on the ground and the ambulance, police, and firefighters come to the roof. We end up going to the hospital and we were there for 8+ hours. They waited for him to sober up and then gave him a psych evaluation. They come to conclusion he is fine to leave so we just left a little while ago. 

He keeps begging me to stay. I truly do believe that if he goes to therapy we can have a better relationship. But I’ve already decided I want to move on. I’m so heart broken leaving him & especially after he came forward to me about his addiction and needing help. I’m scared he will commit suicide. He is still lying to me about the cheating."

"His decision to kill himself or not is 100% in his own hands. You could be the most perfect partner in the world and the other person still can choose to kill themselves. It is not in your power or your control and it is not your responsibility.  

He may or may not be sincere in his desire to change, but the fact is, he not healthy. He is a severe addict who has abused you. What he does or does not want does not change that fact. He cannot create or sustain a healthy relationship now and probably ever, without intensive intervention over a very long period of time. 

Leave. If he’s actively a danger, alert the authorities but leave anyway. If he has people in his life, after you’re safe somewhere, tell them that he may try to harm himself and to alert the authorities - not you - if they feel he’s in danger. And then absolutely do not look back. 

It’s painful. It’s sad. It’s normal to want to help. But this is not your role, your job, your area of expertise and frankly, you do not owe him anything other than a phone call to the authorities if necessary. I’m not being cold, it’s just, people use the threat of suicide to garner sympathy and to manipulate you into doing what they want… there’s no end to that, and no healthy person would do it.

I know it’s hard to say but they usually NEVER wind up doing it.

Keep reminding yourself. Not your fault at all. It’s a form of manipulation that works most of the time! And not only that but most people like him(narcissists) only get worse from therapy because they are taught new lingo and use it to their advantage.

My ex would promise me he would get help; he never did that either.

My ex promised he'd stop drinking; definitely did not happen. 

Abusers become so confident in being able to lie and manipulate their way back into your heart, they will say and do ANYTHING.

If you can get his family to intervene and “get him help,” I’d explore that route. That’s what I did when my ex started threatening suicide and it worked. It’s an opportunity for you to exit, not an obligation for you to fix. Leave while he’s “getting help,” whatever that may be. Do not move across the country with him nor wait for him to be “stable” before going. He never will be as long as you’re threatening to leave him. Don’t talk to him about it anymore.

I'm genuinely surprised that they didn't commit him. It's usually a mandatory 72hr psych hold when someone is suicidal. He needs to be committed and needs long term care... This might be biologically driven given the porn addiction and his depression. Is he open to getting on medication? Anti-depressants suppress sexual function so if he is overly sexual to the point he can't control himself, having medication might help him balance that out as well.

Couples therapy is for people who need help reaching common goals. It will absolutely not work for an inequitable/abusive relationship like this. In fact, it can cause things to escalate.

Trauma bonds are the real monster. You become addicted to the highs and lows of the pattern you’re caught in, and while relying on him for your own validation, you also hope that your relationship/situation is different and he’ll change - he won’t. He will wear down your self worth and independence until you believe you don’t deserve better. Contact a local agency and get linked with a DV advocate. Find a therapist who specializes in this.

Your heart wants you to stay, it’s understandable. But for the love of god start putting money away… the day will come when you WILL be ready to leave, but the shelters will be full, you have zero dollars because you spent everything on gifts and things to make him happy, and you’ll be stuck. 

Hide a bag with your personal valuables  in case you decide to leave in hurry. ID’s, jewelry, whatever matters to you. 

The simplest thing in the world is to make an abused woman feel she’s responsible for the situation. Like we fall for guilt trips and shit a child would not believe… it’s ok.

Make contact with someone who used to be a friend who you trust.  You will be surprised, I lost contact with all my friends and family years back with an ex.  After being abused and locked up all Christmas day with no dinner etc while he enjoyed his day at his mum's. So boxing day, with no money, I escaped. He left and went to his mum's and I got out the house, got on a train, explained to the train ticket inspector, who took my mum's address, but I never got a fine.  I got to my mum's hadn't spoken for 2 years.  She welcomed me in, let me stay on sofa till I got placed in a hostel.    I then found out I was pregnant.  Take whatever precautions you can.  Don't raise a child to think this is normal.  Hardest is to ignore calls, don't get dragged back in.

This is all textbook abusive behavior. The problem with abusers is - they’re never the problem. They don’t have insight or the ability to take accountability for their problematic behavior.

" 

I recently have had the misfortune of hanging out with a life-long friend of my current partner alone (repeat, he genuinely IS a friend of my current partner and they have known each other since infancy) and he is slowly revealing himself to be a serious misogynist with a worrying penchant for objectifying or invalidating women of ALL ages (now including myself) which has seriously triggered my PTSD from the abuse of my ex. 

STORY OF THE LAST FEW DAYS (contains brief allusions to CA) : The friend of my partner is 26 and VERY sheltered so I am pretty sure he hasn't encountered a female outside of the social circle he has had since childhood. Regardless, the things he comes out with and the way he outwardly behaves  (outside of simply saying ""no"" or ""you're wrong"" when I deliver him actual facts that dispute his misogynistic attitudes) are just...honestly sickening. Mid-way through conversation, he will say ""holy shit"" and gawk like a fricken cartoon wolf at women who he refuses to talk to incase they have a boyfriend. He says that he doesn't care about getting to know women that aren't interested in sex. He isn't interested in women at all unless he can have a sexual relationship with them. He will withdraw all emotion and care if he finds out a woman has a boyfriend or isn't interested. The worst has been the following which just made me want to vomit. That children wearing bikinis of a ""sexual"" style are demonstrating consent, saying that 14 years olds are capable of having children so men are instinctively looking at them sexually and those bikinis are inviting that...I told him immediately that I didn't care how ""instinctive"" that was when cavemen walked the earth, it is now considered widely as ""disgusting"" to even cite neolithic approaches to biologically sexed females as a reason to sexualise A CHILD! Never mind attempt to normalize them.

Misogynists don’t respond to patience and understanding. Your partner needs to knock his friend down several pegs then unfriend him if there’s no change in attitude.	Any-Notice6457	reply	na	na	na	0.9990229606628418	no	no	no	na	domesticviolence	failed
This is not your problem. This is your partner's friend, and your partner needs to, man to man and preferably with other of their male friends around, lay the fuck into him. Not be polite. Tell him he's acting like an animal, not a man or an adult, and however much he wants to make his unhappiness with life or himself about other people, it's him. He is sick, and has contempt for other people who have nothing to do with him. And HE deserves contempt. That conversation is tough love and his last chance to go get therapeutic help for whatever the fuck is going on. Because his behavior is sickening.

"Question about what counts as choking. 

My ex was physically abusive in other ways, but never choked me during an argument or out of anger. He did a lot during intimacy which I know isn’t quite the same thing and I don’t consider that to be intended as abuse. 
There was one time during an altercation he lunged towards my throat with his hands out but he didn’t make contact (I dodged him and he hesitated and redirected himself) so I don’t know for sure whether that was a near miss to being choked or if I was reading into the situation too much in my heightened state of fear and knowing him touching my neck was something to look out for, and possibly he wasn’t actually aiming to grab my neck. So I give that one a pass. 

However recently he sort of play wrestled me to restrain me from doing something annoying, but went a bit overboard and grabbed me around the neck twice. Not hard enough to leave bruises or pass out, but hard enough to impose my breathing. He didn’t do this out of anger, it was more like play fighting. He thought it was funny. 

Does that constitute a “yes” to your standard “has he ever choked you” risk assessment? Or similar to choking during intimacy would you put this in a different category to physical abuse?"	lana_12345	post	16.852671488511408	female	White	0.016477005556225777	na	na	na	6	domesticviolence	failed

"Hello, I (18M) am confused about the situation I am in and would appreciate some insights. I apologize if this not an appropriate type of post for the subreddit.

My dad (49) used to hit me with a belt (or sometimes with his fists) when I was child to discipline me. He stopped doing that about the time I was 13 but would continue to use it to threaten me. A few years later he started boxing me randomly at times, accordingly to him as a way ""to play"" with me. Ever since I started going to the gym and building muscles he stopped doing that. Aside from the physical stuff he has also always been emotionally abusive and I don't feel safe in his presence at all, quite the opposite. I'm always afraid to say the wrong thing and cause him into a rage which might make him hit me again.

As for my mother (51) she's hit me as a child lightly with things like a blanket, that stopped around the same time of turning 13. Now recently she started being more physical again, like pulling my hair sometimes, or hitting me in the back. She's also been equally emotionally abusive and often threatened that she'll get my dad to hit me again, although he doesn't have rage outbursts.

Does this quality as domestic violence? Where can I find more resources to learn about this topic? What should I do about this situation?"	thegameoflovexu	post	28.33545174248972	male	White	0.9980806112289429	na	na	na	14	domesticviolence	failed

Not a problem, bro. For additional anecdotal evidence, my family is from Soviet Russia, where domestic abuse was very common in those days (much less common now). My dad was (and still is) a very capable martial artist/street fighter, with a specialization in judo. The one time he put his hands on my mom, he didn’t hit her—he just pushed her off of a chair. She immediately walked off and started packing her suitcase, without saying a single word. He followed her, got on his knees, cried, and bought the house that she wanted. Tough guys don’t pick on women and kids. Your dad is a complete pussy. Like I said, take a class, and next time he boxes you, knock him the fuck out. He needs to understand that he’s wrong.

"I was abused as a child.  I knew it was abuse b/c I was being beaten.  But I couldn’t tell if what she said was my fault.
I don’t want to list everything b/c I’ll cry, and never finish this.  I thought I dealt with it, but am now in a relationship with and the same things are being said to me, with the addition of “even ur mom knows how fucked up u are. Nobody in ur family can even stand u.  Ur husband left u, and the only reason ur kids always take ur side is b/c u manipulated them to hate their dad.

The thing is, when my husband left me w/out 2toddlers, my family wasn’t there. My  dad died when I was 2, my mom has always hated me, and I only ever had my grandparents, who I lost at the same time my husband left us. 

My kids are 19& 17. They are amazing.  They don’t do drugs, they’re kind, hardworking, my son already in college n my daughter has been padding her college app since 3rd grade. They’re dad won’t talk to them, b/c my atty violated privilege by telling his atty that she asked that she be allowed to speak to the judge b/c her dad was sexually harassing her, BUT, refused to ask the judge, b/c it “will just make u look petty”. 

I ended up Ordered to drag my daughter out of bed (b/c I couldn’t claim my children respected me if I can’t get them to obey me). 

There is so much going on that I can’t fit it into this (homelessness, cancer, sexual assault, just so much,

So when ppl tell me I’m acting wrong b/c of my “f’d up history”, I don’t know if they’re right. I can’t ask my kids b/c even though they’re nearly adults, i know they’d feel bad for me, and it’s MY job to make sure they’re ok, not vice versa. 

 But I also don’t want to be blind to my mistakes b/c I want to be a good person n not have my past affect my kids.  Everything I’ve done has been to ensure they’d never have to feel like I do, but I’m barely holding it together. 

I’m on Zoloft, buspar, minipress, Wellbutrin, & Seroquel (in addition to my cancer meds) b/c I’m diagnosed w/severe PTSD. 

I feel so alone b/c if I don’t act the way any given person wants me to, they’ll tell a cousin, sibling, aunt, my mom, whoever.  I know that a lot of families have that kind of dynamic, and ppl like to complain, ppl argue….

But idk how to cope with it.  I raised my kids to understand that sometimes we get mad, but have no right to endlessly scream in someone’s face. Even if we’re upset, we don’t ignore ppl that love us, we ask for space— and all kinds of other shit that nobody else seems to care about, which makes me think I’m doing something wrong. 

Idc what happens to me.  But I don’t want my kids to end up in my situation and I’m scared."	Tell_me_more2022	post	29.620221609537793	female	White	0.0322592630982399	na	na	na	2	domesticviolence	failed
"You sound like an amazing mother. Even with all your trials and tribulations you still manage to raise, what sounds like outstanding kids. That was all your hard work. 

I too, had a parent who would always talk negatively towards me, knit pick at my ""imperfections"" ""faults"". This set me up for a long ride of,  low self-esteem, no self worth, and relationships that mirrored my father. I thought that was normal, that being treated like shit, was ""normal"", I was a shit person so I deserved the abuse partners inflicted on me. 

It's hard to rewire the brain, and thought patterns when your exposed to negative comments and a abuse as a child. What helps me, is knowing my intentions are always coming from a place of good, in the best possible way I know how to at the time. Being a good person isn't something your born with, it's something you actively choose to be everyday, it takes effort, and because we are human with a full  spectrum of different emotions, we do act like dicks sometimes.

"We’ve been married for a little over a year and I knew when we got into our relationship that she has BPD. She’s in therapy and we are both in couples therapy. 

She’s never intentionally harmed me physically. The only times she has have been accidental, but yesterday I was trying to talk to her about how her lack of engagement in our conversation made me feel like my feelings didn’t matter. I’m sure I approached it wrong and said the wrong things to make her angry, but while we were in the car she began speeding rapidly and driving erratically. She kept telling me to “get the fuck out of her car” and that if I couldn’t appreciate how much she’s changed that I could just walk home. She almost hit other cars and drove off the road and I was really scared. When we got home she called me a pussy and a little bitch for going outside to smoke a cigarette (I know it’s a terrible addiction). She knows I can’t go anywhere because I cut my parents off and don’t have anywhere to go. 

She threw her engagement ring at me and told me that she didn’t want to be with me anymore which is something she promised she wouldn’t do. She left the apartment twice for hours on end and told me “not to worry if she wasn’t home”. 

I contacted a mutual friend who also has BPD in hopes that she might be able to help me understand what to do and when my wife found out she told me that I needed to stop ruining her relationships with her friends and that I needed to find my own friends to “ruin her image to”. And then she threatened to kill me if I tried to leave and then threatened to kill herself. 

She did eventually calm down and apologized, but I don’t believe her anymore. I want to because she’s a great person and I love her but all I see when I look at her is what she was last night. I don’t know what to do.

"Reckless or aggressive speeding turns into violence insantly when an accident occurs. It is like keeping a knife on someone's throat and waiting for any sudden movement. So, if it is not called violence, it is not only threatening.

I can somehow understand her feelings. I have acted a bit like that. She was definitely out of any sufficient control. Now, understanding her is not accepting her acts. They really are two different things. Understanding is being realist, knowing what made her do what she did. Accepting, in my opinion, is letting it happen again.

Not knowing where you live and what the laws are, I ask if she drives recklessly often. If that happens, can her driving licence be withdrawn? Threatening to kill you or herself is alarming, too. I would ask in my mind that how long it is from the words to any kind of an act.

Therapy is not patent medicine. One of the factors is her ability to understand and speak about her feelings and thoughts. And even if she is capable to understand herself, we can only hope that her behavior changes. If she goes on as she did, you are the only one capable of making changes. Easy to say, hard to do.

So, I think you should make plans. I cannot know how detailed they should be, but at least I'd ask you to decide beforehand when to ask for help, when to call the emergency and when and where to go if you have to leave your home."

"Driving recklessly when she’s mad is common. We’ve talked about it before and how it makes me genuinely fear for my life and how it feels threatening because she only does it when she is angry at me. We live in Michigan if that helps at all.

The thing about letting happen again hits home because every time I give her an “ultimatum” (I.e. if you throw your ring at me again I’m going to leave) I never follow through with it. Most of that is because I have nowhere to turn. If I go to my friends and she finds out, I fear for my safety because she doesn’t want anyone to stop being her friend. I also don’t have a car so I cannot just leave. I’m stuck at our apartment when anything happens.

While I am not in immediate danger (she has been sort of wallowing around our apartment because she feels awful for treating me that way) I do fear that if she gets angry again things might escalate.

"Hey guys, I just wanna ask for help and what my options are. 

Background, I’m 23 male and I recently graduated college. So my parents are poor and are poor due to pretty poor life choices. My dad is a narcissist. It’s well known he isn’t a great person. 

My backstory is, I don’t have a vehicle. And I don’t have a job as I’ve just graduated college. I don’t have any outside sources or friends because I pretty much had to work all throughout college if I wanted to eat food. Luckily I did have room during college as my mom (not so much my dad) allowed me to live at home still. I will be leaving the country for medical school in December. 

I’m relying on transportation to get me back and forth to work at Walmart so I can save some money. However it’s not enough to get out. My father is very abusive towards me. Just tonight he punched me and gave me a black eye, and ripped my degree apart in front of me and told me “you (Me) would never amount to anything so why even try. “ I want out but how do I deal with this for 5 more months. I’m scared for my life he doesn’t even see me as his son because he literally has called me everything in dictionary. 

I’m afraid to leave my mom also. She obviously can’t come with me to med school and I’m scared she’s gonna kill herself or she’ll be killed by him. What do I do Reddit. It’s not I can call the cops I’m 23 years old with no car or friends to call to stay at their place. I have nothing but a useless degree. Sure I’m leaving in a few months but what do I do? Just put makeup on my eyes until I’m out.

"Using my energy to send you hugs. Does your mom have means to get a place outside your town to live? I am asking: what about a shelter for her to live as a transition until you have school? Then she can have her own place. I acknowledge I am giving advice only knowing some of your story. 

Your dad. Wow. No excuse but he has some deep wounds that are being unfairly projected onto other. I hope you take time to give your inner self compassion. Nothing is your fault. 

Your fears and anxiety once you go off to school are so completely valid. 

I have some resources if you want to chat. Also, have you read The Body Keeps the Score? It may help ease your worries about coming from a broken home. I did.

How would you have liked to have been contacted by the ex before you?  If he is an accomplished narcissist he would have quickly convinced you that his ex was crazy and out to get him.  There is no good way to tell someone something they don't want to hear and won't initially believe.  If you feel an obligation to warn his current gf, call her, deliver the message and let her deal with him however she wants.

About 2 years ago my ex boyfriend strangled me to the point of unconsciousness. Ever since then I’ve had cluster headaches periodically and the feeling as if I’m about to faint. On top of that I’ve had progressively worse random gi symptoms. Is it possible that my vagus nerve was damaged during the strangulation and causing all the these symptoms ?	valbot5	post	31.14388945776297	female	White	0.9971946477890015	na	na	na	7	domesticviolence	no prediction.

"My dad has always been a tyrant, and has made sure to keep me and my siblings all dependent on him as adults.  I moved back home about 3 years ago to protect my under age sisters.

Tonight, we finally kicked him out.  It was after a temper tantrum from him because I agreed when my sister said he had abused her growing up during a fight.  I could feel that it was going to escalate, as he has gotten exponentially worse since his heart attack last year.  He is paranoid, and barks and screams at all of us for extremely minor things, he is getting triggered way more easily as he gets older.

There is no reasoning with him and I’ve finally begun piecing together all the ways he’s been abusive and it’s become scary.  I learned that my mother’s rehab therapists said that they think he’s purposely enabling her drinking.  I immediately realized that he did the same exact thing to me with cocaine  (luckily I put my foot down when I got back on meds). I learned that the entire time my mother was working outside of the house to support us he wasn’t doing any of his work AT ALL.  He keeps guns in a safe in the house, and my sister and mother told me that at what point he had taken one out of the safe and was sleeping with it under his pillow.  (This was because some kids across the street have been shooting our cars with BB guns, but he refused to actually get a 24/hr wired camera system).  I don’t believe this to be the only reason he did that.  I managed to sneakily hide the keys to the safe and watched him while he packed up and left.

Part of me feels I overreacted, but I’ve always been scared shitless of him and this is the first time we’ve ever asked him to leave for the night.  I asked for his keys but he just told me to fuck off and left.  I want to believe he wouldn’t come back tonight and do anything but the fact that he has a key still and we have 3 separate entrances to our house has me scared. Especially because he’s started drinking again and smoking weed, I wouldn’t be surprised if he’s even doing coke again. He’s never gotten physical with me, but has shoved my sister on occasion.

I don’t know what to do.  Is this something I *need* to call the cops for? I don’t want to be the reason he gets arrested. But I know that kicking him out is a big deal, and that abusers tend to get to their most extreme when the victim puts their foot down or leave.  But im likely officially not the Golden Child anymore because I’m the one who asked him to leave and went through with it, so I’m scared what the consequences will be when he comes back."	canriderollercoaster	post	25.25314155794074	female	White	0.9970307350158691	na	na	na	4	domesticviolence	no prediction.
"This is definitely a start, but I am worried for you. My father was much like this. Gun safe and all. I don’t know how many siblings you have or when or if your mom is getting back, but there will likely be issues across all of it. 

I’m so glad you’re there for your sisters. They undoubtedly need your stability and support. 

You could only really call the cops and get them to do something if he breaks in (which he has keys so no) or if he comes back and starts getting physical with any of you.

A good thing you’ve mentioned (sort of, sorry to be a little cold here) is that he’s had a heart attack already. If it comes to you having to physically overpower him, he’s got a disadvantage. I hope it doesn’t come to that at all. 

I take it, as you said he’s leaving for the night, he has a place to go? Will he stay with a friend? You mentioned he might go get drugs, do you have any clue as to who he knows that would get that for him and how far away/how long it would take to get? 

I worry because he may come back. I hope he doesn’t have any other weapons other than what’s in the safe.

I don’t know what your living situation is, but if there’s a way to fully throw him out, legally, try to do it. Get your mom’s help if you can. You clearly are very worried for your sisters. 

I hope you can all work together to get safe and begin to heal, but you’re not out of the woods yet. If there is a local shelter you could visit they might have people you could talk to as far as getting more informed and giving more options to protect yourself.

Good luck and stay safe."	canriderollercoaster	reply	na	na	na	0.9970307350158691	weak	strong	no	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.
Also you didn’t overreact. Listen to your gut on this. He’s getting older, his body isn’t as strong, abusers lash out more (like you said) when they begin to lose their feelings of power/control.

"Thank you so much for your response, it’s incredibly validating.

My mother has been home this whole time, unfortunately she is in no position to help either.  She is an extreme alcoholic, she drinks until she can’t speak almost every day.  She’s been trying to get sober, but she relapsed today because he triggered her.

My dad has a business, and since she’s working for him again she’s been getting all caught up.  She has said that our financial situation will change very drastically in the next few months, and that she has been doing her best to hold out.  We all have.

If he gets arrested or dies, all of my mom’s hard work will have been for nothing, all his will be for nothing. We will be left with nothing but a severely alcoholic mother who can’t take care of herself.  We have many pets, I don’t know where I can go with all of them.  I could probably find a way out for myself once my youngest sister turns 18 next month and goes to college, but that would mean leaving my mother, and I have an incredibly tough time trying ti justify abandoning her, no matter how abusive she was to me herself."	canriderollercoaster	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9970307350158691	strong	strong	no	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.

Like with all things mental health related, we can’t fix other people, we can’t convince other people to change. Everyone must choose the life they want for themselves. I know you dont want to abandon your sisters, and I get waiting to make sure the youngest is grown and out.

We own a home together and after a year of going back and forth over it and him talking bout signing his name off it then changing his mind I am done with the bullshit.

Good on you for letting go, but just make sure you're protecting yourself and staying vigilant.

"My abusive narcissistic boyfriend of a year and a half now has a mastermind and every time I left he was able to manipulate me back saying he will change. He has physically and mentally abused me for months plus the cheating and his smear campaign that I’m verbally abusing him when I finally react to his abuse and stand up for myself. He loves to lie about me and my personality to his friends and family because he is “great guy and everyone loves him”. He is bipolar and is extremely hyper sexual. I caught nudes on his phone back in January and he punished me for it by taking my phone for hours and destroying my belongings. He held me hostage and didn’t let me leave so I ended up moving out of his place when he was at work to live on my own. He didn’t stop calling me at that time like hundred times a day, he apologised, cried and said he would never do it again. I believed him and took him back because I am in love with him…maybe his good side. 

We chose to get back together but not live with him anymore. I thought it would be best so he won’t be able to do anything to me anymore when I live with roommates. Two months later of the same struggles in the relationship, I see a gay dating app on his phone while sitting next to him. We are in a heterosexual relationship and I had no idea he might be bisexual because he would always say the “f” word, make fun of pronouns and thought he was homophobic. He denied it, flipped the table, gave me the silent treatment for days and said he dowloaded the app by mistake…I went insane and reacted to it and he said he didn’t want me anymore because I’m verbally abusing him and all I said was he is a cheater. I stopped contacting him for few days and was ready to move on but he reached out again and unfortunately took him back!!!! However, he set new rules for our relationship and that was to never touch his phone again if we want to stay together and be happy. He said he will be honest and to proof that to me he told me the few days we broke up, he downloaded tinder and matched with my friend. I was so confused but chose to keep the peace and I agreed to not touch his phone even though it felt weird because I knew he was hiding stuff. 

The last week has been so nice and lots of love bombing. Yesterday while hanging out with him I found that a girl messaged him so I went through his phone and found some really disturbing text messages—he was texting a girl and asking her for nudes/other nasty things. I found out in the text she is saying she is only 14 years old and she was asking him if he is fine with her age he responds saying yes…….he asked her to send him a video of her playing with herself and to call him a “pedophile” in the video because it’s so hot to him. I’m so shocked and disturbed and don’t know how to act. I know if I tell him he will punish me and might break my phone. I am scared to report him to authorities and I literally feel physically ill I haven’t gotten out of bed today. I ended up reaching out to the girl and asking her questions and giving her advice to stop sending pictures of herself to men on the internet for money and she said he was always asking her to do weird things and paying her for nudes….I encouraged her to report him but she said she is scared….she lives in a different state. I have no idea what else to do. I know I want to leave him forever now but I don’t know what to tell him. Should I just go no contact even if he knows where I live and uses “*67” to call me when I block him and disappear? 

Please don’t judge me for staying through all the abuse. I stayed because I am attached to his good side and I truly love him…not sure how to break the trauma bonding with narcissistic abuse. I’m so hurt and lost."	Royal-Willingness329	post	23.719559693210584	female	White	0.012135115452110767	na	na	na	18	domesticviolence	no prediction.

That's pretty terrible. Definitely  report it to authorities. Most states have mandate reporter's so you could get introuble  for not telling  also. I don't know what they'll do with the girl being in a different  state but you should get a no contact order, so you can feel safer and if he shows up the cops can help you. If you messaged the girl you can use that for evidence. You could also try to get screen shots of his phone for proof.

Brings back bad memories. Been there with a very manipulative ex bf who was a pathological liar & abuser. 2.5 years off/on and the closer I got to ending the toxic relationship, the worse the abuse got. Hiding my car keys, breaking my phone, destroying my belongings, stalking, two rapes, strangling, shoving, cheating ... LE warned me to get OUT as it will get worse. I listened to them, got a restraining order & called PD to come to the apartment while he packed his things and was escorted to another location. I used sage to smudge the apartment & negativity----it helped a lot. I prayed for him to be removed from my state to somewhere far away ... it happened 2 months later and he's very far away to this day. The authorities finally caught & convicted him for 2 felonies related to sexual abuse of a minor under age 14. He's now a Level 2 registered sex offender in a state that requires him to be registered for life.

You don't have to announce or even mention that to him because he probably would either throw that FAKE love bomb at you to try to keep you from seeing there are normal people in the world.

"Update: I did!! I reported him to victim witness services here and to the PD. I gave them all the information but they were never interested in seeing the chat between me and the girl or the screenshots on my phone. They never asked for his address, just his name, where he works and phone number! They said they will reach out to him. They gave me a report and asked me to follow up but when I did follow up few hours later the officer said he still needs to write a report because he was patrolling all day and then investigate if needed be. Why were they so chill about it? Even victim witness services were not helpful at all. They were like “if you want to report it you can” and they told me someone will call me today from victim witness services to talk about how to get a restraining order but they never did. Even the cops just asked few questions and said if they need any other information they will reach out. What does this mean? Should I wait and see what happens or go again to the police station?

My ex kept texting me all day and seems fine! I did not respond and when I wasn’t responding he was like “oh so you wanna abandon me now” because he knows that I know he is guilty and was talking to a 14 yrs old.

I never said living without him would be hard I just said I’m in love with him…..I don’t want anything to do with this man anymore after what I saw I am done with him forever because it’s fucked up. There is no discussion about that. What I am trying to say is that it’s hard to report because I’m so scared that him or his family might come after me. They know where I live and everything about me. They also know where my parents live. Also, the girl is still willingly texting him so she can still have an income because “her dad starves her” according to what she told me when I asked her to stop texting and reporting him so I’m confused but she is a CHILD and he fucked up. I am already contacting professionals to be able to get advice on how to protect myself after reporting. This is really damaging to me because I fell in love with a narcissistic cheater and now a pedophile. Yes, I might be in denial about the way he treated me throughout the year and a half of dating him because he made me normalise his abuse and gaslit me.

"Thank you so much for sharing your story. You’re strong. I totally understand what you are saying and I definitely don’t want to be involved in his disturbing behaviour.

It’s been so difficult because part of me doesn’t want him to end up in prison knowing he has a life and I still love him. I called the cops on him once before and since then he has been saying that I’m selfish and I put his life in jeopardy as an African American in this country to only proof that I’m not as weak as he thinks “I could’ve got killed”. I have to be smart this time because he is mentally unstable. He doesn’t know I found out about it but he knows I know he was cheating so now he is trying to love bomb me and show me he is loyal and told me last night that the girl texted him saying “Everything OK” and showed me a screenshot.

"Report to this CPS, and the police. Can i ask for some background details. You say he physically abused you, to the point you feel your life is on the line. What has he done to make you feel that way? And yes, narcissistic abuse is hard to leave but there's just certain things that even narcissistic abuse shouldn't hold you in. I was 30 and my ex was 48. He had beat me, degraded me, insulted me and cheated on me. The straw that broke it all was I caught him talking to a 19 year old on Tinder. Fuck that. Idgaf if she was ""legal"". She might as well not have been for him being 48 and talking to a literal teenager. I would've immediately reported him had I caught him talking to a minor, even though this man had once held a gun to my head during an argument.  Even then, yes I would've reported him.

And the girl he's been talking to, she has absolutely no fault in this whatsoever. She is a victim. She has no responsibility to stop talking to him, but I would think that you would feel like you have a responsibility to help her.  Can I ask what country you are in, because this doesn't really seem like an American mindset. And i mean that with zero offense, I know many countries are dangerous. I'm just really confused why you think his whole family would come after you and your life is on the line, unless they are like in the mob or something...?  Fuck, give ME his damn information and ILL report him. You absolutely can't just let this slide, there is a young child at risk here. 

And im just gonna go ahead and say it, you aren't in love with this guy. You are trauma bonded. This isn't love and there's nothing LOVING about this situation. Even his ""good side"" is just a manipulation tactic to get you to stay and hold on. There ISNT a good side to a lying, cheating, abusive PEDOPHILE.  There just isn't."

Talking from experience, take this very seriously. This is not love. He loves no one. He belongs in prison and I'm putting that lightly. Everything has been shown to you that you need to see, so there is no grey area. If you continue in this toxic cycle of off/on with him, it will get worse. Even prison cannot reform a pedophile.

My (22F) parents (both 45 M&F) have been married for 20+ years. It was always toxic from the start. My dad is verbally and emotionally abusive to my mom and sometimes to us kids (25, 22, 12, 13) too, but mainly towards my mom. I’m not 100% sure if he is physically abusive to her. There are times my mom wants to leave, but doesn’t have the courage to, due to financial issues and he threatens her. She was a SAHM, went to school to get her bachelors and masters. She never found a job that she liked to go with the degree and it’s one of the main issues my dad has with her. It’s become really toxic in the house hold since we were kids. We’re always walking on egg shells, tense, anxious, not knowing that next time he’s gonna be mad about something. I want to help my mom move out and be comfortable on her own, but how do I do that when I make $17/hr? She does have job that pays $25/hr and has an interview that will pay $30+. Not only that, my dad just took out a car loan for $24k, so I’d have a newer car to drive. I’m scared he’ll try to use that as leverage over me. Any tips on how to help or what to do? I’m lost and need out.	gobblemeswallowme0	post	27.86230564196303	female	White	0.9989475607872009	na	na	na	2	domesticviolence	no prediction.
Unfortunately, we still have men/boys that treat women like toys. At home, in the workplace, etc. It's not easy being a female.

"I’m really sorry you’re going through it. I’ve been in a similar upbringing.

I think some very important things to keep in mind are that your parents, in as much as they help you out, have no right to hold it over your head or leverage it against you. If your dad tries, he took out the loan, he could default on it, but that would still only effect his credit, and they might eventually repossess the car. So that would be the only part that could suck there, no wheels.

Beyond that, I know you have a lot of siblings, and they’re going through this too. I hope they’re alright, but part of why your mom is staying is probably to make sure they’re provided for. 

You can’t help people that don’t want to be helped. It’s probably the worst thing you have to accept coming from an abusive home/family cycle. Abusers will just keep abusing, and the people they abuse will stay until they’ve had enough. It often comes down to a snapping/breaking point.

I’m really glad you want to help your mom. I’m so happy you can be there for her and your siblings. Sadly, unless there’s probable physical violence, your mom may not ever try to leave or divorce him, until after the youngest kids are out of the house.

Your best bet is working your way to getting out on your own, and then supporting where you can. Until she decides to leave, there’s not much you can do.

I don’t know if you’re in school or learning a trade. Tradework programs and community colleges can often be better and cheaper than most universities and get you placed well in better jobs after certification. Save money, get your own place, work on feeling safe and getting your own sense of security and healing going. Once you’ve found a rock to stand on, you can start offering help to any of your siblings."	gobblemeswallowme0	reply	na	na	na	0.9989475607872009	strong	strong	no	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.
"Hi everyone, this has been on my mind a lot the last few days I could really use some support.

First my ex/father of my child came to my house while I was in the shower, got in through the back door, came up to my room and knocked on it because it was locked. I opened the door and immediately when I saw him I slammed it in his face. I watched him leave out my window with his cousin in the car and they left. I don’t know what he wanted. Probably something bad I mean he has robbed me before. I work at a gentleman’s club and I keep a lot of cash in my home.

(This all happened in the same day)

Second, I got invited to a pool party by someone we have mutual friends with. I did not know he would be there. It started out okay we were all drinking and yes we should not have been at that party together considering I do have a no contact order against him. I regret going to that party more than anything. But yeah it was normal and fun and I’m not sure where things went wrong. We were both very drunk and doing our own thing, not paying much attention to each other. Next thing I know is he’s throwing up in the bushes and I’m in the pool with my girl friend. When we went inside our friends apartment ( a big group of us) he was accusing me of hiding his car keys. I knew that it was escalating but I didn’t want to leave because my girl friend had went to the gas station like 2 min away so I was waiting for her to drive me home. He was starting to call me names and yell literally in front of everyone so I tried to get in the bathroom but there was another guy in there and my ex got mad and threw me on the ground and attacked while all the girls at the party were literally laughing and nobody even tried to help. Once the bathroom was free I went in there and locked the door and waited for my friend to come get me and left. 

I called the police and they made a report, 5 days later they installed a security system in my house in case he decided to come do something. We do have a 3 year old in common and my main priority is protecting him. 

2 days ago I saw him on the local arrest report he has 2 felony no contact order violations, 1 misdemeanor dv, and 1 probation violation.

Okay so this is how I feel, I remember when this had first happened 2 weeks ago, I was so so angry. I wanted justice because I felt so violated and embarrassed and I just didnt want him to get away with hurting me like that. I wanted nothing to do with him. Now after he’s been arrested I feel tremendous guilt. I feel like I messed up his whole life. He will probably be going to prison now? It’s his third dv charge against me. I wish I never went to that stupid party. I wish I never called the police. I feel like I’m to blame and he’s in there just blaming me too. I know that’s not the right way to think or feel but it’s overwhelming me. I think I’m a bad person.

Maybe I just need validation that I did the right thing or just another point of view I’m not sure. The last times that this has happened I felt the same. So much that I actually emailed the prosecuting attorney last time begging them to not prosecute and saying it was my fault. Maybe I don’t understand how a person can be so amazing and then turn around and be so evil.

"Girl, he's the one making all the decisions to fuck up his life. You're doing him a favor by giving him consequences for dv, which are sadly much less than the consequences would be he if tried this psychotic behavior with someone else. Hopefully he'll learn to change. 

There's a whole list of people you're being a literal saint to by giving this guy consequences and the impetus to change: Your kid, the DV'er's future partners, his neighbors and family members (who don't want to put up with this sh*t either), and most importantly, yourself.  You have to take care of you. Nobody else will do it.

"Hey yall, I'm not sure who to turn to and I think my friend is down playing everything so that she doesn't have to feel how hurtful and scary everything is. 

My friend is a 20 something single mom. She is a fucking badass. She raised her, at the time a baby, child throughout college while working full time. She is an incredibly kind and strong person and I really admire her. I'm also scared for her. 

Tw: physical and emotional abuse and abuse of a child and potentially kidnapping a child

So my friend met this man and they dated over a year. During this relationship he was a serial cheater and when she found out I think that's when it blew up. I'm not sure the order but here are some of this pos guys actions. He gave her a concussion from hitting her multiple times in front of his coworker and locked her out of the car. Was reckless with her young child and almost killed them. Destroyed her home, kicking down the front door, punching holes in the walls, and tried to break into her gun safe to at best threaten her and at worst shoot her. He tried to kidnap her child at one point. 

She broke it off with him a long time ago. Maybe 2 years? And hes been stalking her. Sitting outside her home, calling her with *69 even tho he's blocked, and etc. 

He's stalked other past gfs too one of them calling the cops on him. He's been kicked out of multiple apartments and I think had his truck repossessed. All the past gfs talk to each other about the situations they went through. 

Recently he saw her at a home improvement store and slapped her ass so hard it hurt. Mind you he's dating someone and also cheating on her, too. She told me obviously physically scared and no one around her helped her in this situation and when he left she had a meltdown. She thought about filing a police report. 

I told her there were def cameras and she should take it to the police but she was hesitant. She's def not still in touch with him trust me. But like any abused person there's the hesitancy. I was abused by my ex and couldn't get out and when I did get out I swore never to get in that situation again. But the point is I get it. 

I dont know what to do for her. She has a home that she owns so she can't just move. I was lucky and moved 8 hours away from my ex. She has roots here and her work is only 20 mins away which is a really good drive. 

I'm extremely scared for her. Does anyone know what we can do? For references were in Texas so we are subject to those laws.

i think the best bet is trying to get a stalking protective order put into place. your friend needs to start recording everything that is going on. if he is showing up at her home and following her places, that should be enough evidence to get a protective order. if she can obtain a video from the store that will also help. at this point the best route is getting a protective order out against him, informing all her loved ones what is going on so they can keep an eye out for him, put up cameras around her home, tell her neighbors to be on the lookout. alert her job and tell them if he ever shows up there, call the police. not going out alone and being armed to a certain extent (even if it’s just mace or other protective equipment). in these situations you want to cover EVERY base and collect all the evidence possible because stalking can be hard to prove in a court of law. most states probably won’t consider calling from blocked numbers as stalking but the rest of his actions should fall underneath the law. help her reach out to a legal advocate or go up to the court house/family violence unit and see if she can get in front of a judge.

"She should file a police report even for the past incidences and get a restraining order. If there’s no pattern on paper somewhere the legal system is extra lax with intervention. 

Since a gun safe was mentioned I’m also suggesting she carries concealed when she’s out of the home (maybe even in the home) and brush up on dry fire so if he breaks in and there’s no escaping she won’t miss. If she’s not competent at shooting it’s worth paying for a babysitter to take a comprehensive lesson at a range so she can do the rest with dry fire. Look up laws pertaining to self defense too. Don’t want to hesitate and die or shoot/brandish wrongly and be jailed away from the child."	Donttalktomeormydog5	reply	na	na	na	0.9944682121276855	no	no	no	na	domesticviolence	failed

"Hello,

I left home for university in order to have done that I put up with a month of physical and emotional abuse. Now its the summer and I am back at home and its like nothing has changed- I anticipated that but i worry this will now broach into financial abuse. I am going to keep why to myself so I cannot be idenitied. Just know that they use their kids like an insurance policy for their future- since I owe them their life. I was seriously assulted last year but I couldnt get help or go to provide evidence. I took photos and sent them to a friend and deleted them off of my phone. Parent also manipulates and uses religion to justify their behaviour. They also believe that they can control me and own me. If i report it blows up everyone else life and i cannot give them a stable support system. we do not speak to most of our relatives since they cut off contact. the ones we do- she will happily lie and manipulate and i worry they are of the same mind set.

I do fear physical assault and its getting to it. How long in the UK do i have to file an assault report? is it up to me if they keep it on file or if they press charges anyways?

"I'm truly sorry this is happening to you. I'm not in the UK, and I don't know anything about how long you can wait before pressing certain charges.

I will say that you should take the pictures you sent to your friend, and take them to someone who can help you in terms of social programs that help with domestic violence. That could at least get the ball rolling and start you on a path toward not only building a case and evidence against this person, but also that case could be used to remove the other people who are being (as you suggest) somewhat held hostage in this living space.

I will say I understand and remember my own experience of feeling owned, like I owe my life, and so many other things due to religion and misogynistic abuse in my upbringing. It is not easy, you will feel echoes of these hurts for maybe the rest of your life. It's more about how much and how long you have time to see to yourself in a safe space that is your own to commit to healing and working past these things. That takes a lot of time and security and you need to be patient with yourself because none of this can be done all at once. 

If there is a way you can make sure to safeguard your finances, even taking money out of the bank entirely and stashing it, I would. I would also search for family that has been cut off that you might know, or at least suspect, was cut off because they wouldn't put up with your abuser. They could be a powerful ally in this situation, or at least someone who could back you up and support your word.

I know you can't describe much of the situation, but it sounds like you have siblings involved in this mess as well. I know you're just going off to university, and you haven't entered into a career yet. I hope you can finish university and get a good job so you can be a stable point in the lives of your siblings. That doesn't necessarily mean you need to parent them or take them on from your abuser if they are removed from your abuser's care. You need to see to your own life and your own health and safety first because you're becoming an adult. If you can't function, you can't help anyone else.

I wish you luck, and want you to know that everyone on this forum will try their best to support and encourage you. There's a lot of good people on here who will cheer you on. You can do this, you can make things better."	MainCommunication481	reply	na	na	na	0.9987988471984863	strong	no	no	na	domesticviolence	failed
I’m 15, my moms boyfriend has attacked me several times, so has she, but she mostly just belittles me. I don’t know what to do anymore, my dad, the only family member that doesn’t treat me horribly, has stage 4 throat cancer and 7 weeks left to live. I’ve gone to the police and CPSall my life, since I was 8 or 9, my dad would take me and my brother after I started telling my dad was was happening. My brother was too scared to say anything tho, and didn’t recognize that it was abuse. I started cutting myself when I was 10. When i was 11 my mom brainwashed me into believing my dad smoking weed was a horrible thing (he does it for his pain) and that he could hurt me. So i stopped talking to him. I regret this since he was my only support. I also realized I was transsexual around this time, and was scared my dad, with his religious views, wouldn’t accept me. My mom didn’t accept me either, I tried coming out and talking to her about it and she screamed at me and told me I was retarded, that I’m not a boy and never will be. I stopped talking about anything to do with being trans after that, but she would constantly remind me that I’m not a boy, tell me to wear makeup and dresses so all the boys would think I’m “hot”. I felt disgusted and just wanted to die, I became more suicidal then I already was, the first time I said I wanted to die was when I was 7 or 8. I remember laying on the floor crying while my mom screamed at my dad, I just kept saying to them that I wanted to die. My mom ignored me, but my dad heard and it was one of the final straws leading up to him leaving her. My dad regrets leaving me with her, he told me he wishes he would have taken me and my brother with him. I was talking to my dad about two days ago, and told hi about the incident last week where my moms boyfriend and I got into a physical fight and he tried to kill my pet rat. You can read about that in my post history in r/ rats. He recorded everything I said and told me he wishes he wouldn’t have had me and my brother with my mother and wishes he didn’t fall in love with someone incapable of love. There’s so much more that has happened and I can’t even fit it into one post. My whole life has been filled with abuse, I don’t think it’s ever going to stop. My mother is narcissistic and no one believes that she hurts me, that she has, or that her boyfriend ever has. She is an actual demon, I want her and her boyfriend to die. She made my dad out to be this horrible abuser that ruined hers and mine and my brothers lives.

"EDIT: No longer pursuing legal action. Odds are against me as an adopted girl from Russia but my own plan of rebellion is simply ignoring them if they reach out or call me. If it becomes incessant and bothers me to the point I don’t feel safe, law enforcement can help with that. 🦎

My name is Anna. 

EDIT: My Russian name is Maria Slastenova and soon enough I will be Anna Maria Slastenova. I am 25 years old and I was adopted from Russia when I was 7 months old.

TW // adoptive parental abuse, self-harm mention, eating disorder mention, etc. //

Every since my adoptive parents brought me here they were so kind to me up until I decided I didn’t like flowers all that much anymore, I didn’t want to wear pink anymore or match dresses with mom, etc. I would say around 6 years old is the first time my mom squeezed my thighs and told me I’m getting fat and to go outside and play with the other kids. 

I can’t recall but I was either 6, 7, or 8 when my mother, her mother and my aunt were dying their hair and waxing their eyebrows. They commented on how uneven or whatever mine were and said I should get them waxed. I said no. Their answer was pinning my arms behind my back, forcing my back down on the sink, some applying hot wax to one eyebrow and ripping it off. I screamed and they said to keep it down. Someone commented “We should give her a bikini wax” with a chuckle. Mom took it seriously and I broke out of her grasp and bolted to the other side of my grandmothers’ house and hid somewhere dark and small.

Mom wanted a mini her. She didn’t like me having a voice. She had my enlarged adenoids removed when I was young, she told me it’s because I snored loud and kept her and dad awake when they needed sleep. Told the doctor she was concerned about x and x. I still snore to this day. I got two other mouth surgeries when I was younger too. I got braces when I was younger, maybe 8 or so, and begged my orthodontist to not tell her my gums were bleeding because she would get mad and yell at me. He was kind and assured me that he wouldn’t. My teeth are spaced out still and my retainer doesn’t fit anymore. They made me get a bunion removed while I was going to school for some licensure and working at a job and said they would take away x and x and x if I did not. They told the doctor a different story, they were concerned it would hinder my ability to walk. I had to drive myself, with a boot on, after a day or so of her so kindly driving me and she reassured me that she would know if I wasn’t doing my physical therapy. This was 5 days before my birthday, 05/23, when I was 20. I still have a bunion and the toe next to it still sits on top of the big toe.

There’s other stuff. Medicinal abuse and the like. She would talk to my doctors and my psychiatrists after our sessions for 15-20 minutes to get me on these medications that weren’t appropriate for a 14-15 year old.

I have hurt myself many times to get the attention of outside people and I did but even then, they still put down “No evidence of child abuse or neglect.” The last time I hurt myself on purpose was burning my lower right calf 10-12 times with a hot glue gun from her crafting room when I was 16. I was institutionalized at 16 for anorexia and lost ~35-40 pounds in the timespan of 3~4 months but the medication I was on sped up my metabolism and the weight literally melted off. While I was in the program she would comment how sickly I looked but was so kind to everyone in group therapy. Up until my therapist told her she needs therapy when she interrupted me during my session. I was groomed by a pedophile, blamed for that. Blamed for my self-harm, blamed for losing friends and relationships ending or not working out, blamed for not getting straight As in high school because I could literally not focus, blamed for my sexual assault, blamed for my scoliosis, blamed for taking medications they forced me on, blamed for just being me and existing.

My question is. What are the chances of someone like me, the adopted kid they swore to protect to both adoption agencies, winning a case with a good attorney? I don’t want money. I just want them to pay and serve time.

Or if anyone has any outreach links to good domestic violence attorneys, I would appreciate it as well. Once I figure out health insurance, I am going to reach out to a behavioral therapist.

She is blocked and he is blocked. I have an amazing boyfriend now and he is the sweetest and most gentlest man I have ever been with. Blocking them has made me feel free but I do not want them getting away with hurting me and hurting other people in their pasts.

"Honestly I would just close a door to them. What they did to you was definitely awful. But revenge isn't always the answer. I'm not saying this because your wrong or they are right.... but fighting this will hurt you mentally and it's a real challange. Your life will be consumed with hate and if they don't get the punishment you think they deserve it will haunt you. 

But honestly...
That's messed up that they wanted to give a 8 year old a bikini wax when children that young Don't grow hair like that. And everything else sounds horrific.

"Yeah. My boyfriend told me the same thing. When it comes to a court case I’m at a disadvantage unfortunately. Doesn’t mean the abuse I went through isn’t true but I don’t want any of this to consume me because hating is not at the heart of who I am. 

Thank you for your honesty. I’ve noticed that when I think too much about why her and my father are the way they are, it causes stress and that stress contributes to my nerve pain.

A big “Screw you” to them is just never speaking to either of them again.

I worry my brothers hate me though. So I’m allowing them to just reach out to me if they want. I know there’s no longer going to be family dinners or family celebrations but I refuse to play the part of a happy white girl in a happy family when they’ve put me through so. So so so much.

"The last message I sent my father after he blatantly lied about the medications I was on, that they had me out on and allowed me to take was this.

“And I am tired of you outright lying to me. I was on these medications since I was SIXTEEN. It’s on my medical documents I got and requested from Scripps, all 98 pages of it.

I am not your client. I am your DAUGHTER the two of you adopted and swore an oath to protect. Do NOT lie to me. Clearly you cannot differentiate between a daughter and a client, though, I don’t have to be a doctor to know what I went and how I felt on those medications. 

If she won’t attend therapy with me, fine. Goodbye. I tried. I really tried but even now you’re lying to me. I really tried to give you a benefit of the doubt but even now you’re lying to me. A psychiatric doctor can’t just give a minor medication without telling their mother or father why. Mom KNEW what those medications would do and what they were for. 

Maybe one day you’ll learn to be honest but clearly, today is not that day. I really REALLY thought you were a good man but clearly not.

Leave me alone. Thanks.”

I essentially thanked him beforehand for abusing me and neglecting me and further proving to me that this is not a family I want to be a part of.

I have a friend who has been in an abusive marriage for close to 30 years. She kept it hidden for a long time. She finally left about 7 months ago. And she was just turning the corner, getting her footing, and he swoops back in. Says he’ll finally go to counseling. And she says she wants to try with him. I’m at a loss. What can a supportive friend do in this situation? I am terrified for her. I’m afraid I will lose her to this. Is there anything I can do? Is there anything I can say that might change her mind? There are no children involved. Just a diabolical manipulator who I believe will do anything to keep her, mostly for monetary reasons. Please let me know if you have any advice for her friends. This is so heartbreaking to watch.	Honest-Map-1847	post	36.47051938896865	male	White	0.9984422326087952	na	na	na	11	domesticviolence	failed

"I’m so sorry this is happening and thank you for being concerned and for being there for her. 

In terms of what I think works: Help her remember the part of her that is strong and independent. The part of her that loves herself fiercely, the part that feels brave, the part that takes no shit and knows she deserves better. That part of her is still alive somewhere within her; she’s just lost touch with her. This is often the most effective way to help people in these situations — help cultivate situations where she can feel powerful, and then she remembers she has power. That doesn’t necessarily even mean discussing him; it means helping her remember her worth & that life is short & that she is capable. 

That, and don’t judge her. I know it’s hard, but believe me she judges herself 1000x more. Having a non-judgmental safe space to be witnessed is probably the most valuable thing you can do for her.

At lot of that stuff can be driven by shame as well. The abuser makes you feel like nothing and you feel embarrassed to admit what’s happened to you. Also, the recovery process after abuse isn’t easy or short. Sometimes it feels (inaccurately) like staying is the path of least resistance. Why Does He Do that is available for free online and has some resources for how to support loved ones leaving an abusive relationship. I’d beg your friend to read it before counseling, before agreeing to anything with this man. It will be so insanely familiar to her, it’s hard to ignore. She’ll hopefully realize his behavior isn’t unique at all. There’s nothing complex about it. He’s a dime a dozen and he won’t get better.

Hey I’m posting this for my wife . Basically a few years back her child’s father abused her , strangled her etc . She called the cops and he got arrested. Forward a few years later and he flees the state of Florida to Trenton NJ with the kids . He has cut all communication with her and she can’t get in touch with her kids or anything. And he has a open warrant for that case for never showing up. What can my wife do? She wants him to be held accountable for what he did and she wants to get her kids. Any help or ideas please.

"I do not know your wife's custody agreement to state facts, so I'M just going to advise blindly.

 This could be considered interstate parental kidnapping, and the Feds will get her children for her since it involves two different states. 

Unfortunately, Florida still doesn't recognize Domestic Violence as a Felony and will not extradite him for a misdemeanor. 

I do not know facts again about either case, but this is something to look into. 

I can tell you if this is the case, she has full custody with legal documentation, then 
a phone call to her ex by the Feds usually works and the quickest resolution and less of a financial burden. 

He sounds like he needs to have a chat with them quickly.  This isn't a good situation at all as we are dealing with a violent person who has children with him that has already been used as a weapon to hurt others, especially their mother. 

The longer he has them, the more danger they are in and most likely are already being mentally abused and under the parental alienation syndrome.

Just as a heads up, your home state will lose jurisdiction of the children after 6 months of them not being there. If it’s within the 6 months she can file for custody with a motion to have them returned to their home state. Once the 6 months hits the new state will have jurisdiction and she would have to convince the courts it’s in the children’s best interest to return to your state.

"Hey OP,

I've been going through your post history. You need to get out of the situation with this POS. That's easier said than done, especially according to your previous posts, but you must keep trying like hell. You mentioned that you're financially independent now and can take of yourself and your daughter and the baby on the way. Once you get a couple more months in, it'll be harder for you to move around, especially with the little one on the way. You wouldn't want to be dependent on him again. He already hits you and gaslights you daily; who knows what he'll do to the kids in the future? Get other friends/family members involved if you have to. You mentioned that you're in Europe; if the police aren't helping and you have no one to contact, there are always support groups. Maybe they will have better resources for you to access to get yourself out of this situation.

My cornea was lacerated during a strangulation and I lost some vision in that eye. It is now completely healed, so it is permanent. 

They said it should only be 10% loss, but it feels like more. When I'm driving, it's difficult, and I need to close that eye to read. 

It's definitely not HUGE, but it's just a constant reminder that puts me into a horrible head space. All the headaches, the white line, the blurriness. 

I feel so mad that I'm living with this forever. I'm mad at myself that I lied to the police in the ER, but they were mean and he was right there. I'm mad that he walked away with no consequences.

Then here they are living like nothing ever happened to them

"I got my temporary protective order extended for a year, with no contact and was granted temporary custody of my son.  I was fortunate that the women's shelter was able to let me talk to a lawyer ahead of time and I was prepared for what was coming, even though I was kind of shocked at where he took things to.  I had audio and some pictures but the judge thankfully saw through his nonsense pretty easily.  My husband did zero research and went off script in so many ways.  Here are some take-aways from my consultation with the lawyer and court case (i will try to make this read-able and save specific commentary for the end, the bulleted list below was super helpful though)

* I was told my husband would do one of three things

1. deny the abuse happened at all
2. tell the court that he was the one being abused
3. try to justify his actions (and admit guilt...)

* I was told to stick to ONLY the incidents that I had written down on the paperwork I filed during the temporary order.  Thankfully I had written down a few other key major events so I was allowed to discuss those too
* I was told that as my own lawyer i was able to object if he went ""off script"" (in my case it was far more interesting to see where he would go)
* I was advised to talk through what I was going to say and record it and then listen to it again to make sure I hit all the marks.  
* I was advised to write a basic outline of the key points I wanted to make and avoid sounding like i was reading a script  
* I was advised to go through any evidence and make sure it was ready, and to go through the recording and make notes of the key times that were worth hearing because the trial time would fly by fast and the judge was not going to want to hear the whole recording, if he felt he needed it (he did not)
* I was advised to try not to get too emotional, to not let myself get baited by anything he said, and to just stick to the facts I had already written down while giving a basic outline of some past events to show that things had been escalating over time
* I was warned that if he did have a lawyer, they might try to say the evidence was not valid for whatever reason, that might have been tricky but it wasn't needed and he showed up alone

If you want more details, keep reading, its a real sh\*tshow.

Hubby basically checked off all three of the first boxes.  He claimed that he had photographic evidence of bruises, but as he talked we realized it was from our son hitting him, which was a roundabout way of trying to say it was justified somehow that he slapped him in the face.  The case was not actually about that, even CPS said that wasn't enough to trigger a case with them and their bar is lower.  They told him that, too, he said that i had called CPS (the mandated reporter at court did that due to our kid getting hit with glass and bearing witness to the meltdown, not me)  and they told him there was no reason to open a case for him slapping the kid and so i think ok sure, then why did they call him?  

He claimed he was afraid of me, that I elbowed him in the kitchen after he accidentally dropped a plate because of the perpetual mess in the kitchen (he was the stay at home dad... unless it was about the state of the house and then it was my laziness) and that i was pushing him and when he tried to regain his balance he ended up falling on me.  

He claimed that he did not threaten to stab me during our ""shouting match"".  I told the judge if there were any doubts I had a recording of the event in which he clearly did, and that i never raised my voice and the only thing you really hear me repeating is ""i'm sorry"", ""stop"", and ""i'll fix it""

He claimed that these ""shouting matches"" happened often.  He claimed that he was afraid of me.  He claimed that I had rendered him homeless, cut off my credit cards, and left him with a gas guzzling truck (which I own and insure), and that he was ""stupid to put it all in \[my\] name"" even though he's spent the last 20 years dodging every single debt he has and his credit report self-immolates if you  print it out.  He eventually admitted he was at his dads, and not homeless, but tried to say his dad was going to throw him out because i lied about my glasses being broken (I didn't even say that his son broke them, just that they were fixed now and his grandson was ok, and to get his son help - and knowing his dad he coached half this shit and wont be kicking him out).  He blamed video games, incidents of roughhousing that had occurred 20 years ago with my cousin, the time 13 years ago that my now ex sister in law slapped him (she's psycho too) and the time 2 years ago that my then 12 year old autistic nephew wrongly thought they were roughhousing and punched him in the ass. He said that we used to go to BDSM clubs (true, to gawk mostly) and that we were ""into that scene"" and he never hit me outside the bedroom (neither are true at all). He said that my family was full of obese diabetics who were prone to unresolved violence and his child was not safe with us.  

Most of his last points were made long after the judge had decided to grant the order, he had just asked me who to take OFF the original order (my cousin and nephew were in town during the temp order) so I knew things were leaning my way.  The judge just let him talk and talk, I didn't bother saying i objected because all he was doing was digging a hole for himself, the judge knew it, I knew it.  He asked if I wanted to respond to any of it and I did not even answer most of what he said because I knew it was crazy.  The judge finally said I was the more credible witness, kept the order as it was, i got temp custody of our son as well as my car, the dog, and the house, and blessedly NO CONTACT.  He asked to keep his mobile phone, I told the judge I didnt intend to cut it off, the judge said he felt he needed a phone and I told him he actually had TWO and he said ""i think he just needs the one, right?""  The advocate later pointed out that he said he could keep his phone, he did not say i had to maintain service on it (and even then, i'm still not going to cut it off, not before we start in on the next phases)

there's probably more, but that hits all the marks.  I was shaking in anger and anxiety when I realized he was seriously going to say that he was being abused, but I managed to keep my composure enough to stick to the points.  By the end I didn't know if I wanted to hyperventilate or scream but choked it all down."	paisleymanticore	post	37.49465166179851	female	White	0.9962902069091797	na	na	na	1	domesticviolence	no prediction.

"Love is terrible sometimes. I still miss and love my abusers, but I would never let them back in again. 

A good friend of mine told me about the old Edgar Alan Poe story The Cask of Amontillado. You may have read it in middle school or high school, but I never did so I missed the reference. 

A good takeaway from the story is this: 

When you cut off someone in your life which do you choose? If you were to trick them into a cellar, chain them up, and brick them away forever: would you brick them up entirely, or would you leave a brick out for their cries to echo out to you anytime you visit the cellar?

In the case of all my abusers, I don’t spend time with any of them anymore. I moved away and I have not spoken to any of them for years, some close to a decade now. 

Sometimes the best closure you can get, especially with lost love on the wrong person, is to get the fuck away from them and anyone who knew you together.

That isn’t always easy, or even possible. If you can’t leave, I would only advise that you shouldn’t have anything to do with anyone who believes him. Make new friends, hang out in new places, make a new community for yourself to thrive in. Even if it’s just 2-3 other people. You can find better people to be around. 

Let your ex and the people like him sit behind the wall you built around them and forget about them. Their memory will fade, the love you gave them will change and become gratitudes and joy in other simple things in your life. You will later share love with people who care for you truly. I believe in that. You will find respite somehow. Just keep working on yourself, keep making a point to choose your friends, don’t let them choose you. 

I wish you luck, and I hope you take your time to heal slowly but surely."	Historical_Morning61	reply	na	na	na	0.9962853193283081	no	strong	no	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.
Give it time. Don’t let yourself fall into the trap of the good memories. My ex was shot and killed a year after I left him and it was honestly the best thing that ever happened to me bc I’ve had moments of weakness where I would have definitely called him lol. In fact I learned he was dead after I unblocked him on fb bc I was considering reaching out. It’s so so so hard to untangle yourself from the trauma bond. Don’t ever put the pressure to be “fully healed” on yourself. It’s a lifelong journey. You will stumble on the way and find yourself in situations you swore you’d never be in again. Join a support group. Talk it out with a friend or a pet. Start journaling about the feelings you have and then start journaling about why you need to stay away.

You are not crazy to still have love. You truly loved him. So it does not just go away it’s natural. I will be so confident that I am healed and bam something smacks me in the face. I live in a small town and can’t move until my son is an adult. I hear about him all the time. I wish he would move away and I never have to hear his name. But that’s probably not going to happen. I hear about him and who he is dating, marrying, and divorcing 🤣. Yup with in a year of being divorced from me he was remarried and getting another one. I have heard so many lies and rumors he has spread. Some people believe him but the one who truly matter and love me know better and that’s all that matters to me. I am still close to a lot of his family and it’s hard but they believe me and we try not to even talk about him. I know that it still hurts to hear all the lies. A narcissist will never own up to what the did. He will always blame you and make you the bad guy. No matter how bad we want them to see their wrongs it won’t happen.  The only way it could possibly happen is through Jesus. He can wake he up and open his eyes but it usually takes breaking them down to rock bottom. I hope this helps in some way to know you are not alone and it’s normal. Just keep moving forward it gets better and better. Not going to tell you there are not bad days bc there are.

TW: description of abuse (not super graphic) 

So my MIL told me my wife had a psych eval (willingly, she’s trying to steal my kids and convince the courts jumping on me to strangle and bite me was just due to PPD). The therapist decided she has PPD. But the abuse started when we first got together before we even had kids?!? The sexual abuse in particular was very early in the relationship and she got rid of my friends almost instantly. She’s been controlling and berating and sexually assaulting me for YEARS. We went four years between our second kid and our third and she was abusive even with no new baby for PPD. And I looked it up and PPD may have things like impulsive violence or something but not almost eight years of sexual abuse and verbal abuse and isolation. It’s DELIBERATE.

Like when we’re in public and every time someone looks at us she’ll point out they gave me a weird look because everyone doesn’t like me, or a group of people laughing is laughing at me. She’s been psychologically breaking me down for years to the point I can’t even look at people because I feel so bad. That’s not PPD!

 she definitely has hit me way before the last few months of extremely violent attacks, I just didn’t recognize it as wrong because she’d just slap or bite my forearm  if I tried to block her which I figured wasn’t abusive because I was bigger and I had always done something to make her mad. So my bad. And people point out women are less violent so I figured I was being a baby by being nervous to make her mad. 

She hijacks my PTSD from child sexual abuse. She likes to wake me up to sex when I’ve asked her not to a million times. It activates a freeze response where I can’t stop her or say no. She says she likes the power and I need to be more kinky. Also if I turn her down sometimes she’ll get mad and badger me for hours and not let me sleep until I break. That’s not PPD!

So basically she lied and tricked the therapist and pretended the abuse just started after our baby was born. So they diagnosed her and now she’ll go get “help” for her diagnosis and they’re going to give her the kids I know it. I’m freaking out. This is never going to get better. I should go back and make sure I keep my kids safe and I’ll actually see them. 

This is 1000% my fault because I couldn’t man up and just report the sexual abuse because I was so embarrassed. And, honestly, I didn’t report the physical violence for so long because everyone told me that I needed to be a better husband. Help more. Work more but also do more at home. Give her more sex. Give her more free time. I’m the bad guy because I’m awkward and private and I she spun this whole narrative about us. I have no friends because she got rid of mine instantly and she won’t let me have more, and I can’t have anymore because of how gross and disgusting I am she’s pointed that out many times. This is my fault I couldn’t figure out what to do."	EmbarrassedGuilt	post	21.779462803793983	male	White	0.9986494183540344	na	na	na	6	domesticviolence	no prediction.
"Was this a court-admissible psych evaluation or she just went to a therapist somewhere to diagnosis shop? They are two different things. 

Diagnosis or not your testimony of her behavior over time should convince the judge that it’s not PPD related or if the PPD excuse sticks your lawyer should convince the judge attach hoops where she should only get supervised time until she finishes mental health treatment. 

You have a crappy lawyer who’s trying to do as little work as possible.

"Unfortunately, courts may handle situations with male victims of abuse differently from female victims of abuse. 

Additionally, I recommend to search if there is an NGO or helpline in your state that has experience with fathers affected by domestic violence.

For men, any kind of evidence you collect can be helpful. I had some very solid evidence. And later, when I looked through my old photos, I realized that I had visible bruises on some of them. I also noticed that some doctors had took notice of bruises and recorded them in their files. Perhaps you can find some evidence  for the time she was violent before being pregnant?

Since she pulls the PDD card, I guess it means that it has been proven that she was violent at least after giving birth?

Even after you left, she likely will not suddenly become a perfect human. If she has a personality disorder like narcissm or borderline, the effects of this disorder may still show up in other constellations outside of a relationship and there is a slight chance that she continues to do bad stuff, which may make the custody case more clear.

In  cases I had heard of in my area, fathers won custody after their former wives started to misbehave terribly (e.g. drug abuse or hurting the children), because this made the case very clear.

Not a court ordered anything. Just an evaluation from a therapist she’s trying to show CPS she’s getting help. She’s going to try to use it in court to show she got mental healthcare.

There is hospital and police records on this. Also she pushed me down the stairs about a month ago and tore my ACL but since I lied to the ER doctor I don’t think that will count.

"The temp order blows wtf. CPS sets the bar in hell. A good lawyer should be able to argue that the timing of her mental treatment is suspicious and not enough to protect the children for visits until they’re done. 

The irritating thing about family court is that it maximizes money for professionals involved and human suffering. Male victim of abuse and mom will strangle the baby with or without a PPD/P excuse? Suddenly they’ll revert to Tender Years doctrine and give mom too much custody. Female victim of abuse and dad throttled the baby? Mom doesn’t get to breastfeed and baby should live with dad more than half the time. Shit is fucked. 

I know locations have shitty case outcomes but I swear it’s like your lawyer doesn’t want to try. It’s not as if women don’t abuse men and children as you unfortunately know too well.

It’s hard to disable the negative self talk you have from all the abuse you’ve suffered but understand that no one should have to become a legal professional as a side hustle because abusers refuse to die alone. You shouldn’t have to know what to do. I know how much reading I was doing for my own situation I might as well take the bar at this point."

"Yeah CPS says the reasoning is she was the primary caretaker because I worked, she is breastfeeding, and she’s never harmed the children. The only violence in front of the kids were she attacked me while I was holding the baby but I put him down and left the room (as best I could while she bit and strangled me) so he was kept out of the worst violence. The other kids stayed in their room because I yelled for them to stay. 

I do agree the courts always favor the abuser for some fucking reason. I think it’s because we’re embarrassed and stressed and our memories aren’t good and we tend to disclose more and more instead of everything right away. Meanwhile they are cool and calm and able to advocate for themselves.

The lawyer is trying to build a case, I have text where she admits to sexual abuse and hurting me back for years. I have texts admitting she wouldn’t let me have friends etc etc. I have couples therapists who refused to treat us because of abuse Im going to see if they’ll say something in court. I’m so stressed and I really wish someone had told me it wasn’t okay for her to have sex with me when I didn’t want to and slap me a long time ago instead of telling me I needed to do better."

Your question about driving someone to hit you is a sign he’s gaslighting you pretty well. Physical violence has never actually resolved any kind of conflict so it’s not a solution. If someone has violence on their mind that is a personal problem for them and they’re always going to find an excuse to let it out. I don’t know what it’s like to attempt to leave an abuser as a single parent, I just know as a person. My mom did it and it was hard at first but her life got significantly better after that. I also know if it’s something you know that you don’t want you will leave eventually, it just takes time. Something will be your final straw.

Oh lovely, you are not stupid ❤️ He is manipulating you first into believing that he’s changed, and then into blaming yourself when you realise he hasn’t. That is 100% on him - you are not responsible for his actions. No one can provoke violence in another person; he is in control of his body & choices.

"They always claim to be. And you know? Every once in a blue moon, if they've put the effort, time, and determination to face themselves, they CAN change. Anyone CAN. An abuser rarely changes at their core. 

But! The majority of the time, the ""changes"" that they've made are changes in manipulation tactics in order to get you back, or conceal the abuse better in order to not be revealed to anyone outside of the situation. 


You are never going to be responsible for someone abusing you. Ever. You questioning yourself is exactly what they want. In order to control you. So that you comply with every single request that they make. 

I hope you're able to muster up the willpower to leave, and I hope that this time is the last time you leave and stay gone. If it isnt, and you go back, I really hope that you have the opportunity to leave again before he takes it from you permanently. I hope he doesn't rob you of the life you have left to live, and I hope he doesn't rob your child of their mother. I know it's hard. I know that hearing the usual ""well if she wanted to, she could leave"" isn't that simple. I see you, and everything you're feeling is valid. 

You're very strong, you're stronger than he wants you to be, and you're strong enough to leave."	Original-Sun-9875	reply	na	na	na	0.9994915723800659	no	strong	no	na	domesticviolence	failed
"All the other responses have covered most of what I wanted to say so I'll just add this one thing:

> Do you believe you can drive someone to hit you?

The answer is no, you can't. Abusers don't abuse you because you did something that drove them to it. They actively look for things to blame you for to excuse the abuse they already want to inflict on you. 

[I'd recommend reading this book; it's a really good resource. ](https://archive.org/details/LundyWhyDoesHeDoThat/page/n241/mode/2up)

I wanted to highlight a few passages that address your question more directly:

Part 1: (section: The mystery) - Page 80

> Part of how the abuser escapes confronting himself is by convincing you that you are the cause of his behavior, or that you at least share the blame. ***But abuse is not a product of bad relationship dynamics, and you cannot make things better by changing your own behavior or by attempting to manage your partner better.*** Abuse is a problem that lies entirely within the abuser.

Part 2: The mythology- page 87

>an abusive man works like a magician: [...] He draws you into focusing on the turbulent world of his feelings to keep your eyes turned away from the true cause of his abusiveness, which lies in how he thinks. [...] His desire, though he may not admit it even to himself, is that you wrack your brain in this way so that you won’t notice the patterns and logic of his behavior, the consciousness behind the craziness.

Part 2 (Section 5) Key Points to remember- Page 353

>You do not cause your partner’s slide into abusiveness, and you cannot stop it by figuring out what is bothering him or by increasing your ability to meet his needs. Emotional upset and unmet needs have little to do with abusiveness."	Original-Sun-9875	reply	na	na	na	0.9994915723800659	no	no	strong	na	domesticviolence	failed

"been with my bf since the start of this year and thought he came out of a fairy tale. 

he was attentive to my needs and treated me like royalty. was always there and loved being with me all the time. he was open and honest right from the start. 

things started getting harder when he said i wasn’t matching up to his communication and it was making him feel like he’s in this alone. i tried my hardest to change and do as he asked but it was always a problem. 

this got escalated into smaller things. but to keep a long story short, everything i did he has a problem with. to the point where if i didn’t agree with him on something i was doing and he thought differently, it was a problem. and that problem was me. 

finally hit rock bottom when he hit me/beat me the other week. it was bad. my body was bruised everywhere. i forgave him and went home. we never talked about it. it happened again in our house where i was ragdolled, strangled and hit. i forgave him again. but we broke up - not because of that. but because he said my communication was the root of all our problems and he didn’t believe id change. we eventually got back together and it eventually happened again. this time he was caught, police were involved, both families and work. 

i am now struggling to not go back to him. i truly believe he is a narcissist. there are so many things wrong with this relationship that i can’t even begin to explain in this post because my mind has been messed with since the beginning. he has a way of turning everything on me in way where i eventually believed it and automatically started blaming myself. 

my friends and family are all supporting me. and they have all told me the same advise i expect to get here - to get out. but i need help understanding. i have never been able to understand this man or relationship. i feel like i’ve never had any control since being with him. i lost myself very early on and became a version that suited him.

"It’s an abusive one. The man doesn’t like you and you’re taking it as a challenge to see if he will revert back to the fake self he used to trick you into a relationship. It’s not real. The real relationship was he enjoyed getting you to change yourself to his unfair, ever changing rules. Then knowing you were fully attached started beating and strangling you too because he liked it. You understand what this is but you haven’t successfully mourned the potential of what the relationship could have been if the fake self was real. It’s easier to say you don’t understand than it is to confront the grief from acknowledging someone that claimed to love you hurt you very badly.

"nothing he is doing is new, its a pattern, and it repeats with most of the people in these bad relationships.  If someone else hadn't I was also going to suggest the Lundy book, it really put into perspective that my situation was not special - it was textbook abuse.  So many of the things in the stories relayed in that book were pieces of everything i'd seen for the past several years, and they were little red flags waving in the distance the whole time.  It never starts out with a full beating, it just ends up there and your odds of being murdered by this man or permanently injured are high.   There is nothing you can do to fix him because he won't admit he's at fault, only he can come to grips with that, and even if it seems like he's sorted himself out this is a pattern that will repeat if you take him back.  I was never beaten as severely as you but i held out and tried to fix things for 4 years.  

if you stay, document everything, get audio/video recordings, and do what you can to protect yourself for when it falls apart.  Mine tried to claim that I was the abuser, i was fortunate that i had no doubts because i had audio of the entire thing and came prepared for that."

You are going to feel better and have better understanding over time! These guys really work over a persons psyche and make you feel super unsure and lost. It’s because they are not healthy, they do not operate with normal emotions and integrity. Usually their victims believe all their amazing BS during the getting to know you phase and so hopes and vulnerabilities are very high. Then when you are sufficiently hooked, the real jerk is allowed to surface, then rule the relationship. The crash is devastating. It seems so hard to believe the same person could flip so far into ugliness but it’s just what they do. It’s their true hidden self that has an insatiable appetite for power and worship combined with zero empathy for others. There is no winning with one of these. You must cut and run. You spent the relationship being lied to and projecting your own good nature onto a most unworthy canvas. But now you are on your way to freedom!! Good for you.

2. No control in an abusive relationship.
3. Feel like you’ve been reduced since meeting him, don’t feel like yourself.

5. He’s physically abused you multiple times.
6. Doesn’t accept responsibility for his actions, you are the problem.
7. The abuse has included choking/strangulation.

"Best lesson I've learned today was detaching myself from objects and people. I grew up in a home where our parents were absent and our basic needs were unmet. It came to the point where my siblings and I had to fend for and raise ourselves in a boarding home full of gang members and other strangers. I was finally able to make it to the other side by not letting our lack stop me from obtaining my degree, going to the military, then working in a career I absolutely love. But living in lack as a child affected me in that I became materialistic as an adult. 


However, the experience of getting my items stolen by the ex helped me realize that they were all just objects that has nothing to do with my identity and defining life's meaning or purpose. All that is valuable is within yourself because we are all divine and that is something we can take with us on the other side. 


When I came home this morning, I found that the ex has taken every last chance to destroy me by stealing all the appliances including the refrigerator and washer and dryer. He's also stolen both televisions and furniture that I've purchased with my hard-earned money. And to top it off, he stole all the major yard tools and the bed. But as I was sitting down on the living couch in the middle of a barren house, I started to see the positivity in this experience; one day you can have it all, and one day you can have it all taken away, and this is why it is best to know your own value and not attach yourself to outside physical objects. This realization brought a feeling of peace in my heart to move on and let go knowing that I still have love surrounding me and I still have my light to shine."	maosan311	post	27.7630202855867	female	White	0.0031882235780358315	na	na	na	4	domesticviolence	no prediction.

A small taste of what finally put me over the edge: I recently posted that he owes me $2800 in rent which he denied at first, then paid me half of it and still denies he owes more. Like he can gaslight me into changing my mind.

I've absolutely had it. Nevermind he tried to strangle me in the past, verbally abusive, secretly drinks, lies constantly, wants to claim disability for fibromyalgia that he doesn't have, somehow has money to gamble with, has a work wife and on and on.

"I just want to tell my story in case anyone needs some hope. This is therapeutic for me to type out and I want to celebrate with anyone reading this whether it reaches one or one hundred people. I also want to give a disclaimer that I was privileged in a lot of ways in my situation and I understand this may not be everyone’s story. Regardless, I’m here to tell a story about DV and hope. 

We were two people with trauma. I expressed it by attracting it, he expressed it by repeating it. I ignored red flags out of loneliness. Out of desperation of someone understanding me. The fights continued. Bruises, broken valuable items, promises of change that I always believed. The gaslighting felt so comfortable yet so daunting. I remember sitting on here disassociating as he was screaming at me just thinking “I hope my future self is going to get out of this someday” I knew it wasn’t going to last forever. I’d break it off, find my strength, go back. One broken promise after another finally got me out. It’s weird being in something you know isn’t going to last forever but not knowing your way out. It’s like trying to solve the hardest puzzle in the world. You know there’s a solution but what is it? The answer is there is none. Nobody in the world, not even your future self, can get you out of it until you’re ready. I didn’t know that morning when I woke up I was ready. I just knew the deepest pain and feelings of loneliness couldn’t be worse than the pain he was causing me. I was wrong for some time after leaving, the pain got worse. I suddenly was faced with not only the grief of losing who had become the closest person in my life but the trauma of the abuse. Constant debilitating flashbacks and crying. A lot to deal with on top of pre existing trauma based depression, anxiety, & ptsd. But here I am, a year later, the happiest I’ve ever been. I was very privileged  to have no ties to him in terms of marriage or kids. I was also lucky enough to be living at home at the time and just get a part time job( which turned into my career) I’m now working at my favorite job I’ve ever had and moved out of my parent’s house. There were times and days I thought there was no end in sight for pain and flashbacks. I might still agree with that statement only with strength behind it. With the strength and knowledge that I will never forget this but I am powerful enough to live with it. If you’re out of it, celebrate no matter how early or long ago it was.

I love that for you and I’m so happy to help! All I ever wanted to do is get something good out of my terrible experience like helping others. It is totally normal to emotionally feel like you’re in the wrong at first. Some of that can be leftover damage from the gaslighting as well. The more time you spend without them the more your brain will form new pathways in new beliefs. Just give yourself time to heal. My heart goes out to you knowing how painful that can be at first. Keep the hope but also understand and don’t beat yourself up if your journey to healing is different than mine. Some people heal quicker, some take longer.

Yesterday suddenly he wants me out and he wants to call the cops on me to quick me out , I don't trust my girlfriend alot with him I am scared and she is scared. My question is, should I let him call the cops and my girlfriend is gonna tell the truth and say he has been abused to her. The cops still going to quick me out even though she says that .

"This sounds like the beginning of my very abusive relationship. 
It starts off like this, and gets worse. 

Ever so slightly he will wear you down, take your confidence, gas light you, make you dependant on him (emotionally), and call all the shots, all while making you believe you're the problem, not his behaviour. 

I'm so sorry to say this, but get out while you can. Even if the good outweigh the bad now, before you even realise they'll only be the bad, but you'll be in love and emotionally invested and it'll be harder for you to see. 

I could have wrote this about my relationship. It ended up destroying my self-worth, my dignity, my mind and it was only a 2 year relationship.

Don't do it to yourself. Love you more than him. It won't end well, that's some major controlling, insecure and abusive behaviour. 

I have now met someone who is everything my ex was not. To be able to not have to explain or justify to someone what you're having to do (i.e., why you didn't answer your phone) is so refreshing, and made me actually see what love is.

"100% agree. OP well done for reaching out & for asking. I also believe it will escalate, but here are some concrete reasons why I think what he’s doing is already abusive:

- Slamming things around is abusive behavior in itself, in the context of you being triggered by it and him knowing that it’s a trigger. It’s unacceptable and he is an adult and could learn how to control his rage. (And no, “learning how to control your CPTSD” is not something you can do, so they are not the same.)

- Demanding to know where you are & acting like you’ve done something wrong by not regularly reporting your whereabouts is controlling behavior, as is demanding to go through your phone (people have a right to privacy). 

- Pressuring you to take drugs is coercive & controlling, ALL THE MORESO when he then uses your state of intoxication against you (him claiming you said things that you very well might not have even said). 

- Holding something against you that he is at least partly (if not wholly) responsible for (the “confession” and feeling the need to lie to him about seeing your friend) is coercive behavior.  

- Isolating you from friends and making you feel guilty about seeing them is controlling behaviour. 

- Refusing to forgive you for something & bringing it up repeatedly to gain power over you is controlling behavior. 

I know it will take time to unlearn these patterns of being attracted to these types of men, but it IS possible and it sounds like you’re already on your way.

"Tldr clueless family member harshly reminds me of trauma.


I haven't lived with my mom for a long time and I am 15+ years post dv. I'm nearly 40 myself. 


She's been reorganizing and clearing stuff out of her place and brought a box of stuff. Apparently papers etc that I packed up as I was leaving the apartment I had with him. Our lease agreement we had together was on top, some bills in his name, a couple CDs, I think I saw some baby stuff like my kid's wrist band from when she was born that I kinda wanna keep. 


I was so unprepared. I told her, ""this was a traumatic period in my life and you can't just drop this stuff on me without warning"" but honestly I can't even touch it or look at it. It's in the garage. She was apologetic but she just doesn't fucking get it. 


I'm just not gonna look at it and gonna put a tarp over it maybe. 


I texted her that she needs to come get it. That I'm not in a headspace to deal with something like this with zero notice. 


My grandma has been downsizing and she's been bringing stuff over like China, old Xmas decor etc so I thought it was a box of cute kitschy stuff but nope, I opened it to literally see the lease agreement for the apartment where i was brutally beaten.

A good amount of time had passed since those things happened but no matter how much he tried to fix the past and be the dream partner and person I loved so much I just couldn’t shake the feelings of distrust after everything done to me and eventually with someone else. He can’t understand why I have literal trauma after he went home with a random person and I was up till 5am crying and calling him cause we shared locations if he loved me and wanted a loving relationship with me. I followed my gut instinct and left the situation I had so much shame about for four years and lately find myself feeling sad about the fact that I miss him. I’m not willing to take the chance of getting my feelings hurt again. In low moments I’ve reached out to try to talk about us or the breakup he says he’s not the same person anymore so he doesn’t know what to say because he doesn’t know why he did any of it. I get scared I won’t meet someone again who could take care of me and love me like that so I try to tell myself that will always be inside of him and will probably happen to the next person.

Yes. The only reason people repeatedly abuse the person who loves them is they enjoy abusing that person.

>He can’t understand why I have literal trauma after ...  

So he's still neither apologising  nor accepting responsibility for the pain he caused you. Yes, he's still an abuser.

>I followed my gut instinct and left the situation 

Good on you for making the sensible decision and acting on it.

>I love and miss him.  

You love the image you had in your heart of who he would be, how he would treat you and what a life you would have together. You will never have that image come true with this man. Let go, and live free. You may still find love with someone else. 

&#x200B;

>It would hurt so bad if he moved on and bettered himself and it was the relationship that I wanted. 

Let him go. Let go of your hopes of a life with him. If you care about him at all, hope that you leaving him permanently will teach him a lesson so he will be able to be a decent partner in the future. If you go back to him, you will undo whatever you may have taught him, and instead he'll learn he can treat you like shit and you'll still come back.

"Hello, I’m (22F) not quite sure how to start this I’ve had a hell of a day. I was with my ex fiancée for 5 years. During this time he was physically abusive and emotionally abusive and I recently found out that he purposefully took one of my cats I had years ago and dropped it off miles away. It wasn’t until a month ago that I discovered he was cheating on me. I messaged this other person and told them everything about the abuse and they laughed in my face and called me a liar and other nasty names. After a few days I told my ex that we needed to break our apartment lease but I didn’t have the money since we had just moved in and was buying all of our furniture so we decided we would leave when we had the money under the condition he doesn’t talk to this other person. He refused to pay for everything and threaten to ruin my life if I didn’t comply. Well I ended up finding out he still is talking to this other person and after telling my mom all the abuse I endured she gave me my half to break the contract and my brother is allowing me to move in with him which I’m currently in the process of packing my things. 


He has been threatening to not pay his half of the rent, to report me to a job I’m currently in the process of getting with the city for abuse because I said I wish I could ruin his life like how he’s destroyed mine when we broke up out of anger (I regret saying that so badly), and he’s threatening to report my family to ICE  because my parents are illegal. I feel stuck and confused and terrified for my life because I feel like he holds my life in his hands. He’s been telling me that he wished I die and get raped and other terrible things. 


I was wondering if there’s anything I can do to protect my future and my family whether that be legal advice or precautions I should take from now on? I feel like a part of me has shut down from the trauma and I can’t think straight. He also admitted he wishes he could ruin the lives of people he went to highschool with and I don’t know if I should warn them even though they don’t know me. I’m so scared and confused I’ve been calling lawyers and the National Domestic Violence hotline all day and I feel like I’ve gotten no where"	Confident_Swan_3228	post	21.115688107366484	male	White	0.9969261288642883	na	na	na	3	domesticviolence	ethnicity: hispanic, age: 22, gender: female, explanation: the author identifies herself as a 22 year old female ('22f'). her parents' interaction with ice implies that they are immigrants, potentially of hispanic ethnicity.

Contact your local family court or police about a full stay away order of protection. He will then have to vacate the shared home. Do not tell him you are doing this. Choking you significantly increases the risk that he will eventually kill you. Don’t take this lightly or believe him when he eventually says some version of sorry. Contact your local DV agency to speak with an advocate about all of your options and for assistance safety planning. Also, consider going to the ER for the strangulation. One, it creates a medical record that could be used as evidence against him later. Two, strangulation and choking can cause injuries not immediately seen or felt that can lead to complications later.	akbrowngela	reply	na	na	na	0.9990334510803223	no	no	no	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.

Documentation is also very important. Even if you do nothing, legally, today.

"I’ve been with my bf for almost 4 years. We met online and talked for a long time before that. I finally came to visit him in 2020 after he expressed that he wanted to take things farther. I visited twice and made a dumb decision… I decided not to get on the plane home and did not tell him. I forced him into the relationship. Of course his doors were open to me and allowed me to live with him and be with him. 

The first time he hit me, I hit him first multiple times after he locked me out of the house for taking a walk without telling him where I was going. I was furious and struck him multiple times in the face, after which he struck me back twice. I take full accountability for that. I apologized and never struck him again. He accepted and we continued the relationship. 

The second time was a year later and he slapped me for going through his phone and finding him sending nude photos to women , as well as receiving them. 

Over the next few years he continues to strike me for going through his phone or confronting him about cheating. 
Once for contacting a girl he was cheating on me with, he pushed me onto the ground and punched me in the mouth. 
Another time he was choking me against the wall, foaming at the mouth and telling me to leave him alone. 
Again , another time I was punched in the face for going through his phone. 
And so on and so forth..

The most recent was about 4-5 days ago. I went through his phone and found out he was speaking to a specific girl that I told him I didn’t want him contacting anymore. (This girl and him talked negatively about me for a long time. He stated he hated me, he wished I was dead and he wishes he was with her). After he found out I went through his phone he punched me multiple times in the head and face. He then told me to leave (please remember , I’m almost 3000 miles from home) and that he was done with me. I gathered my things to leave and he took my phone and refused to return it to me. He told me to leave without it. I refused. My phone has all of my contacts , cards , etc on it. I needed it to go away. He eventually gave it back (after going through it to try and see if I cheated on him. I’ve never cheated on him) after which I tried to leave again. He told me to stay out and out of fear of being beaten again, I stayed. He accused me of enjoying upsetting him and ruining our relationship. He accused me of cheating and lying about men in my life. This tactic worked on me because I have low self esteem and I love him. I entertained his manipulation. An emotional argument ensued which then led to me laying down again and sleeping with him.
This was a true awakening for me. I look at him and I literally fear for my life. I’m afraid that one day he will kill me. But I don’t know where to go or what resources to get to. I know I’m not perfect, but I don’t want to die or lose my teeth because of this. I love him and I keep giving him chance after chance, but I can’t keep getting beaten anymore. Please."

This is absolutely a toxic situation that you need to get out of. Do you have any family that you could move back in with?

"I can’t stress enough that when our lives have been thrown into a total disarray, we make decisions that aren’t the best.

I’m really truly sorry that your father’s death has (at least from your description) thrown your close family into grief and struggle. It’s never easy to deal with that kind of loss.

You’re definitely making great choices in this moment. Seeking help, getting to a shelter, and getting away from him is going to pull you away from any future hurts.

I personally would go to the hospital get checked out and press charges against him. 

Abusive people are self-destructive. They will hurt you because they want to be able to hurt themselves. When they get as bad as you’re describing it they want it all to stop. It’s like they want to get off the roller coaster but they are not equipped to do that on their own so often times they escalate the abuse to something criminal. I know it seems a betrayal but he actually wants to be stopped.

It is not your job to fix him and there’s no possible way you can because of mental illnesses we are over our heads. After you get checked out ask the hospital or the police to help you find a bed in a domestic violence shelter. They will help you with restraining orders and no contact. They will help you in so many ways with so many resources

I moved to St. Louis Missouri where he lived. I became dependent on him and his resources because I abandoned all of mine to move there. He already had a household set up so he didn’t need double of everything. Period it took some time but he began to let his mask slip and showed how abusive he was. They only get worse the older they get. That’s a fact. He was choking me and controlling everything I did. Because I was married to him I thought I couldn’t escape

Finally he choked me and I didn’t think he was going to stop. He had started drugging me with leftover morphine from his hospice patients. He was an RN he was trying to take my life

I spent six weeks in a domestic violence shelter, there’s an easy, they have rules and it’s sort of feels like they’re controlling us instead of the abuser but they have a good reasons for it. After my weeks there I was set up with a furnished apartment and I had to pay 30% of my income plus $50 a month for utilities. The program allowed us to live there for up to two years. It took me another two years to save about $2000 to move back home but I did it. Then there was wayI was safe so he could find me while I waited.

My point is that even if you 3000 miles from home there’s still a lot of services and help for you. Don’t feel so trapped.. don’t stay with him for any reason. He will take your life from you. But some of them are also psychopaths and if you’re unlucky like me he no longer wanted to take my life he decided that I was going to live but he would take my child’s life and I would have to live that pain for the rest of my life there are crazy and there is no help no cure and no treatment. It doesn’t matter anymore who did what because you can’t convince him. He’s too scared to look at himself in the mirror. Jail time might help for a while.
Time for you to get away go no contact. The shelter will be able to refer you to trauma therapists. Find when you like and stick with the therapy. Need to be able to forgive yourself for being hurtful in the beginning. I came from an abusive home and that’s all I really knew so I hit my husband a few times in the chest and the arm when we first met and were young. It doesn’t equal to what he’s been doing to you.

Also, you are not “dumb.” You are surviving as best you can while being abused. Trust me when I tell you that there are so many things that I still find deeply humiliating about my abuse and how I coped with it and how I behaved.

"AITA for not wanting my son around his fathers family?

I 20 female got pregnant at 17 with me ex boyfriend 21 Male we’ll call him Frank for privacy reasons. Franks parents I felt never really liked me his mom let’s call her Carly questioned if Frank was the father or not. She went on a rant saying she had to do a DNA test with Frank because his Dad (Will) or his mother didn’t think Frank was his. This never happened she just wanted a DNA test perfectly fine with me but don’t lie about it. 

I was with his friend before I got with him but it wasn’t in the time frame for when I conceived, He was with my friend before we got together, he continued to run around with them behind my back. Fast forward a little bit and I’m 4 months pregnant and I get a std I haven’t been with anyone other then Frank. So far this pregnancy has been full of cheating and drama my hormones are going crazy I’m scared about what the situation is turning into. We get threw the whole thing I listen to his cries and how sorry he is for it. 

I landed a decent job but I don’t drive so 2 hours on the bus there and another 2 hours home and 6 months pregnant, while Frank sat at home doing nothing not even cleaning. We stayed at my mothers house so it was literally only one room I’m not asking for a lot to be done.  I saved enough to move to a 2 bedroom apartment I was still only 17 so  Frank was head of household. Believe it or not this is where it gets worse Frank is back on the same bull shit. I have no idea but his whole family and friends know about everything he doe’s behind my back but they never said anything. I have my son he’s a beautiful healthy baby boy I feel so detached from him no connection I feel broken a wave of sadness had hit me. 

Postpartum depression and Frank as soon as we got back home would leave constantly. Leaving me alone with this small human I have no connection with, my son would cry so much at times I could not get him to stop I broke down time and time again. 

I told Frank I can’t do this alone anymore I feel like a single parent so he does what any reasonable human would do he leaves for 48 hours no calls or text. I tell him I’m going back to my moms even tho I’m 18 I still am not head of household. His cries and begging made me stay. 

I find powder in my son’s closet I’ve seen a lot of illegal things from my childhood and teens from the people I was around. Meth it’s fucking meth in my 2 month old son’s closet. I scream and cry and he shoves me into the wall. He grabs my throat I leave, he tells his dad and his dad gets me to come back. This happens time and time again till I leave. 

It feels like a weight has been lifted off my chests! I’m on tinder meeting new people and making friends. The friend that was running around with Frank we’ll call him (Ronny) we become best friends again. I started talking to the guy (bob) I was with before Frank I tell him about the whole dna thing he want to be the dad but it wasn’t a high possibility it was his. 

Frank and I have a few mutual friends and it’s a couple they are the ones that came to my rescue after her but his hands on me the last time. The girl we will call Mary and they guy Guy. Mary and Guy started acting weird Frank is obviously on hard drugs and isn’t creditable for any information he gives, Frank filled their head with lies and they filled bobs head too. 

Ronny is my only friend at this point because of Frank they all called me a shit mom along with other things. While Frank was in the hospital after he had got hurt bad. It was constant messages and I said things out of anger because they know what I went threw they still took his word over mine. I talked to Franks dad with Ronny and he cheers me up he talks about how disappointed he is with his son. He says he loved me and his grandchild he always claimed him. 

Fast forward a little Frank had been to jail was out and sober. I’m 19 at this point and we give things another shot, Ronny is mad I’m not hanging out with him and starts telling Franks dad I have people in and out the house . Ronny says he knows he shouldn’t of said those things and he’s sorry. In this point in my life, it feels like everybody is switching up on me. 
Frank started talking to another woman he didn’t trust me after Ronny.

Frank leaves her to come back to me. Not even 24 hours he moves city’s with her! I’m upset and try and leave with planet. I get a few days in the hospital and get out Ronny picked me up and we went to get my son. Frank is back I know I’m stupid but I can’t help but run back. 

We stayed together for about 6 months then  found messages of him and his friend talking. So out of anger I call him gay. We break up franks family knew and said nothing.

Almost the whole relationship has been violent. After my birthday few months ago he logged into my Snapchat and got angry. He showed up her with a gun he pointed it at me my son and nephew were playing in there room. I begged him to leave I was crying and screaming I don’t want him to hurt the babies, he calls his dad to come get him his dad heard me screaming and crying. His dad and sister rushed over here but not before I jumped on his back and tried to get him to leave. I ended up getting hit with the gun he tried to shove his knife inside of me. When his dad got here he ran outside and said he was going to jail. His dad and sister came inside expecting the worst but I was making sure my son and nephew was okay. I had tears and couldn’t really see anything his dad called the cops. They took statements his dad took us to the park and to get ice cream they wanted to make sure he wasn’t coming back before they left. I love his dad and sister but it hurts what they kept from me.

I want them to still see my son but also I don’t want Frank to try to get a hold of me threw them."	PalpitationDull5658	post	23.426061391182564	female	White	0.997992992401123	na	na	na	1	domesticviolence	failed
"NTA. 

What you’re asking for is somewhat possible. You can get a lawyer (free or reduced cost through your local DV agency or full priced elsewhere) and ask for a custody plan that limits Frank to supervised visits after whatever probation he’ll get through criminal court, substance abuse treatment, and drug tests. You can continue allowing your child to see Frank’s father and sister that have helped you with or without the legal order but it might help have your lawyer name them as supervisors when Frank does visiting time."

"I’m still processing even though it’s been three or so years since I became a victim of domestic violence. My abuser hurt me so bad I had to get multiple surgeries including one major surgery and a separate minor surgery on my eye because he basically punched my eye back into my head and broke bone. My eye is still uneven and kind of weird to this day and my nose is slightly crooked from it. 

I’m just really sad because I look in the mirror and it’s a reminder of what happened. I end up feeling ugly and ashamed even though I have friends reassure me it looks fine. Sometimes I fantasize about getting plastic surgery to make it go away, but I don’t think that would fix the problem because even if I got surgery that made me look better, any change would still remind me of what happened. 

I’m not really sure what to do about it, the physical reminders that pop up every day while looking in a mirror, taking a photo, or feeling old surgical scars. I’ve been doing better, ie no more panic attacks every single day, but this is something that still upsets me and I’m wondering if anyone else has any coping mechanisms for this."

"My face is different now too. Solidarity.

My sharp, perfect jawline was my best feature, and it's messed up, and that's still broken and it hurrrts. There's a scar(?)/cloudy spot in the white of my left eye left over from a massive subconjunctival hemorrhage, and thank god I was never fond of my nose because it's a lost cause now. I'm missing some teeth I could have darn well used, too. At least they were molars and the space doesn't show much.

I don't look *that* different, ig. I do look like I've been bareknuckle boxing wayyy out of my weight class (because I basically have), but I'm recognizable. Getting some weight back on will probably help, but holy everything, the RAGE I feel at having my pretty face messed up is overpowering. I'm not even to the stage of grieving, really, I'm still mad.

I have other injuries, and my singing voice is still kinda shot. I've cried over that. Haven't gotten around to crying over my face yet. There's SO MUCH to cry about.

My only words of encouragement are just, hold your head high. Those scars mean you *survived* some serious shit, the kind of shit some of us don't make it out of alive. It's totally ok to be fucked up inside about it--I am--but the shame here does not belong on you.

"I think it sounds like you're doing really well with this and allowing all the self-awareness you are experiencing to be ""up"" where you feel it.

I think scars or not a lot of us have cried in front of the mirror and the person we see there.

But the mirror is just that... a mirror. It's a reflection that you are interpreting.

I would suggest if you can, to spend a few minutes a day looking in the mirror and imagining sending love to the person you see, every layer of you built each day of your life, imagine a colored mist of love around her or going into specific parts.

It's very wise of you to understand that about surgery, and who knows maybe one day you still want it, but being with these emotions, and helping the part of you that went through it can be first. 

In imagining caring for yourself, what is your perfect care that you would've wanted at each stage of the experiences you've had. Maybe it's an angel, a friend, a voice of wisdom, a place of solace where you rest or a higher version of you gives the most tender loving care to a younger version of you.

Hey, that’s totally okay! Rage and regret are normal feelings for the shit we’ve been through. I don’t think a lot of people talk about the recovery process of people who have been through extreme situations of abuse. I literally felt like a crazy person. I was repeating things that happened to myself and crying, having panic attacks, feeling like I was literally losing my mind or breaking which I learned is a symptom of a panic attack. However, after reading The Boy Who Was Raised As a Dog by Lundy Bancroft I felt a lot less crazy and alone. A lot of the post abuse reactions I was having are normal and things seen in children of severe abuse situations. I highly recommend the book but it can be triggering since it goes into each person’s story, but I felt like I needed it. I cried and would have to take a break after each part, but yeah very informative.	Worth_Ability_3808	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9932875037193298	weak	strong	no	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.
Hello redditors, I’m sorry about the confusing title but I need help with something. About a month ago Me and My girlfriend got into a serious fight which resulted her holding a knife to herself to hurt herself but I grabbed her arm that she had the knife with and she bit me on my arm. Later on the cops showed up and took her to jail and she got out later on. We have two kids together two beautiful daughters but I still love her. She went through a lot in her life and she has really bad depression and anxiety. She didn’t mean to hurt me but the state pressing charges against her. The state that we reside in is Kentucky. I need advice on how I can get the charges dropped against her. The state pressed charges on her and I don’t want a no contact order or restraining order in place on her because I still want to be there for my kids and her. But the thing is after she got out the state ordered a no contact order on her without my permission or knowledge. How do I get this change or how do I drop the charges against thanks!

"In March 2021 my husband strangled me and the state pressed charges and imposed a no contact order. I went through the program to have the order released but couldn’t do anything about the charges because it was in the states hands, after I called the police I was not contacted again.

2.5 years later, thousands spent on lawyers and counselors, and I absolutely regret how I handled the situation. I wish I had just paused, taken the time to be without contact to see how bad things were. Instead I immediately jumped on trying to get him sober, him in treatment and him help. Now I’m realizing I’m codependent and have so much unaddressed trauma because I shoved my needs down and took care of him.

I completely understand you love her, those feelings don’t switch on/off just because of what happened. But maybe take some time, look at what you need to heal from this, look at what your kids needs to heal. Take care of yourself, take care of your kids. If you’re open to it, I’d suggest looking into codependency. Your girlfriend is capable and responsible for dealing with her side. She needs to face the consequences or this will continue. What if your kids saw their mom with that knife? Your girls deserve to know they are safe and secure. Can you be sure they will feel safe if you take your girlfriend back?

"i completely understand where you are coming from. mine had a porn addiction, was a cheater, and often coerced me into doing things i had trauma from, but he was also abusive in other ways. i understand missing him. but you can get over him. your physical and mental wellbeing is SO important, and he didnt value that. it just takes time to heal. i cried like everyday because i missed him at first. i wanted him to “get better” so we could be together again. he didnt, and they usually dont. 

but youve got this. remember how important you are, and he didn’t act like you were important. you are not an object. it just takes time, let yourself cry about it. let yourself be angry for what he did to you. feel the full range of emotions about it. it wont always hurt this bad, and you’ll get there sooner than you realize. letting yourself feel all of these emotions is good for your healing journey. just dont go back. you deserve better. 

if possible, talk to a therapist. or a close friend or family member you trust. someone who will listen and be there for you through the hard parts. it wont be hard for forever, but this stage of it definitely sucks."

"I think like this, and I hope my thoughts help you. And I know that if they help, it is only something small:

Our bodies have own memories and wills. Our mind is not just one rational life planner and storage of memories. There are competing stimuli, and not all of them are clear and easy to comprehend.

Time, processing, wondering, discussing and remembering will construct some kind of an agreement within about how to live on with your memories and feelings. It takes time. And even if you did not want to think and speak about them constantly, suppressing would be harmful.

My boyfriend and father to my children, exposed himself to my sister (16) when he was driving her home with our daughter (7) in the back. Our daughter thankfully didn't see, my sister took my daughter inside my dad's house with her and called me and told me what had happened. I automatically called the cops once I was off the phone with her, I also sent some messages to him telling him we were done and he better not come home and that he needed to take himself to the police station. I just gave birth to our 6th kid a few months ago, 3 weeks after I had our child his Dr had switched his meds and up'd the dosage on some, a week after he started the new meds he started having black out moments and wouldn't recall what he was doing for a few hours at a time. And all of a sudden he would snap out of it. This is not me trying to justify what he did. Even though he says he doesn't recall this happening and that he doesn't even remember coming home from work. (He had come home like an hour and a half early) which was odd, he also wasn't aware that my sister was at our home until he got home. I believe my sister whole heartedly, and will support her through the end of this. But I also believe that he doesn't recall doing this because of these moments he has been having. He's never done this before, to any of my sisters and he's been alone with numerous of them many times and they've all said nothing has happened before.

My concern is, that two of our children aren't biologically or legally mine, and he is their ownly living bio parent and family. If he gets arrested what would happen to our two kids? Would they be able to stay with me and their siblings? I'd also like to point out he hasn't been home since this has happened because I told him not to come back. And I believe he did go to the police station, I haven't heard from him at all today and this happened the day before.

I think I just needed to get this off my chest. But I also need help with the second part."	Simple_Employer2968	post	43.14506346735692	female	White	0.9965938925743103	na	na	na	2	domesticviolence	failed

"My advice: put yourself in your sister's position and make your decisions based on that. What effects would defending him/staying with him have on her after what she experienced? Would you ever trust your sister/have a relationship with her if she stayed with someone who did that to you? What would you want your sister to do if you were the 16 y/o who had that done to her?

Talk to a family lawyer about your custody concerns. If you've been the children's caretaker and they have no other family, I don't see why you shouldn't be able to keep them with you."	Simple_Employer2968	reply	na	na	na	0.9965938925743103	no	no	strong	na	domesticviolence	failed
"I don't really know how to start this. My partner and I have been on/off for almost five years. For the past year we have been steady and even moved in together. I lost my job and became physically ill due to depression and stress. I had to go to a ton of doctors and hospital appointments. Since I didn't work I couldn't afford my rental and we moved in together at his apartment at the beginning of the year. 

We've always had some pretty explosive fights (though not physical), however each time we've gotten back together we've had better communication, less fights and an overall better relationship. However, he was cheating on me with several people but only online. I forgave him but it happened a few more times. Last time I felt so dejected like I knew it would happen, so I didn't even react that much.

He somehow always finds a way to make it my fault. I was too distant or too sick making him feel lonely and rejected, so he talked to other people in a sexual manner. Everything I do wrong seems to get him angry, if I leave a dish in the sink or something breaks or I close the car door too hard, it's a huge issue and he will lecture me, call me names like bitch, dumb and idiot for small mistakes. Even if he spills water on the floor, he'll get angry at me for not giving him clear enough instructions on where cleaning supplies are. If he does anything wrong, it's no big deal. He get mad at me if I bring up anything that annoys me in his behavior. 

When we fight he'll also mention that I can just leave knowing full well that I don't have the money to do so. Most of my income from sick leave goes to my rent to him and to buy groceries or things needed around the house. So I can't move before I get a job. When I do try to leave our home he will block my way and sweet talk me into staying or if I leave to stay with a friend, he will repeatedly call and text both apologizing and placering the blame back onto me. He says he'll get help for his anger issues and is working in therapy to solve them. However, we agreed on couples counseling and after one session he decided that it was a waste on money and will not go back. At least until I am treated for my depression, as he thinks this is the root of our issues.

Obviously, this is only my perspective but I feel so conflicted. I try to be a good partner and take care of his physical and emotional needs while getting treatment for my mental and physical health. I try to take on most of the house work, as he has a full time job. I try my best not to be a burden although I know that it's hard to be in a relationship with someone who is sick. I am actively searching for a job while getting treatment and taking care of our home.

I don't know if we're just a bad match, if it's me that's the problem due to my depression or if this behavior is not okay. We're also both on the spectrum so that might be the reason for us miscommunicating. Could anyone offer some outside perspective? I don't really trust me own institution due to my depression."

"You are being abused. 
Maybe not physically but sounds like emotionally and financially. He is going to wear you down as far as he can, keep crossing boundaries and keep cheating online. 
He is going to take everything you worked for and wave it in your face like “if it wasn’t for me you wouldn’t have this, this or this”. 
EVEN your mental health. 
When you didn’t react to the last times he cheated, you may find yourself not reacting and just obeying what he wants to avoid conflict. 
He is responsible for his own physical and emotional needs. When you’re sick, he should be there for you. Not online with whoever because he “feels lonely cause it’s your fault your sick”. 

He knows his behaviour is an issue, so he wanted to stop counselling so he wouldn’t look bad.

"Thanks for your answer. I think he's just so good at being remorseful and he did change his behavior a lot so I kind of thought that maybe he would get be better over time and learn f om his mistakes.

It's hard because he's super supportive and loving 90% of the time it's those last 10% that's really fucking everything up. He also grew up in an abusive household, so I think I've been making excuses in the form of ""he doesn't know any better"", ""he's trying but change is hard"" and ""I know this would trigger him so I am as much at fault"".

I do not have supportive family that I can lean on close by. I do have close friends but the one I would usually go to had already picked me up after fights and housed me severel times. I don't feel like I can lean on her anymore. She's also quite pregnant now, so I don't want to put the extra stress on her. For my other friends, they simply do not have the resources to take me in. They all know that our relationship has been turbulent but I haven't told them to what extent.

Except for the his foul moods I do love him and live a very comfortable life he provides a lot for me as well. He pays for all our dates and also groceries and the like we just live an expensive lifestyle mostly due to my choices I think.

"Hard truths ahead:

You may love him, but choose to love yourself more. This is 100% abusive behavior. That he provides a comfortable life and treats you well 90% of the time doesn’t change that it’s abusive — that’s exactly how they keep you there. Over time 90% will likely become 80% will become 70%, and by then you’ll be even further entangled and it will be even harder to leave. 

Don’t be fooled. I am both autistic and had an abusive childhood. Neither of those is an excuse for treating people the way he’s treating you. I bet your depression stems at least partially from how he treats you — my ex did the same, and then used my depression as a way to further blame and control me. 

People don’t change unless they want to change, and it’s clear from your description that he doesn’t want to. 

Please make a plan to leave. Reach out to anyone you trust to ask for help, practical and/or financial. You can also slowly put money aside in your own name that he doesn’t know about. Even if you’re not convinced right now that you need to, you can agree that creating options for yourself is a wise thing to do. Rooting for you. You can do this."

"Venting. 

I'm sick. 

I had multiple serious injuries that I did not seek care for at the time due to his intimidation and my own misplaced loyalty.

I got out and away not that long ago and went no contact, then spiked a fever with no cold or flu symptoms, just burning up and burning sensation in my broken jaw.

I did all the things and was finally officially advised to fuck off and just go to the doctor on my own.

I went. I told the nurse practitioner that I'd been brutally beaten in the face and my jaw was broken.

*Spoiler: the damage to my jawbone is fucking VISIBLE irl, it's quite obviously caved in and misshapen.*

She said maybe I have tmj. I said I didn't think so and tried to further explain (which is hard with a broken jaw). She cut me off with ""I understand your situation but--""

No. No she did not understand my situation.

I've spent the 3 of last 6 months fucking BEDBOUND and at the mercy of an abuser who liked sex whether it hurt me or not. Several of those weeks I also spent STONE BLIND because he broke my glasses (he loved to punch them off my face and they broke). I have congenital myopia and I am *functionally,* not legally, blind without them. 

I'm 20lbs underweight. I've been through things that prisoners of war go through. I've been beaten, threatened, strangled, starved, and more or less held hostage.

I said *none of that.* I just asked this chubby, cheerful, healthy, visibly uninjured, dismissive heifer, ""Do you?""

She went into an immediate huff, told me I was ""being condescending to her"" (I was, my bad) tried to rescind her order of antibiotics for my motherfucking BONE INFECTION, and slammed out of the exam room. 

Over two words. ""Do you?""

I had to basically mind-wrestle the fucking office manager to get that prescription sent.

I got back to where I'm staying (NOT ""home"") and did not have enough gas to get to the pharmacy. They were closing in an hour so I called my mother. She turned off her phone. Because my parents wanted me to be killed by my abuser. They sat and watched and waited while I was injured again and again about six minutes away IN A HOUSE THEY OWN BY A MAN WHO WAS NOT ON ANY LEASE, offered no help and never said a word, just ate popcorn and watched me slowly getting beaten closer and closer to death and cheering with every blow.

I broke no contact so *my abuser* could send me gas $ to get my antibiotics. I was scared to death, my jaw was BURNING through the skin, my pulse was over 130, and my temperature was quite high. I'm ashamed, but I don't even care. 

Now I am just sitting wishing I had the courage to dump the fucking antibiotics down the toilet and JUST DIE so I can be done with this shitshow of a life. There's a rope hidden under my bed, but that doesn't make a big enough mess. I want to cause a PROBLEM when I go out.

"my ex used to batter me and one time battered me and threw me into the street half naked. he got arrested and charged with domestic abh but i retracted my statement and protected him. cps have pressed charges anyway.

i kept getting criminal detectives and investigations and police contact me all the time about him. they said he was labelled as a very dangerous man and the case was at high risk. they asked about him exploiting me for drugs and coercive controlling behaviour and stalking. threats to kill could also be a charge because he intended to kill me when he attacked me and threatened me before hand. i kept ignoring all of them and the lling GDAS and help services i was fine to not interfere with the case. hes already got alot of other charges including county lines and a suspended sentence and hes back on tag and hes looking at a very long time in prison.

i did everything i could to defend him and try and get the case dropped and protect him whilst struggling to even process what the fuck happened. i started relapsing on ket again and he used to call me a nitty because of it. he ended up cheating on my twice over the course of the relationship whilst i was trying to heal and help him. and he used to block me for weeks which would have me physically sick and completely panicky of why he dosent want me. then hes do some controlling shit which would scare me. 

but he could be the sweetest. the beginning of the relationship was amazing and a little love story. it all just kinda happened. we spent christmas together and made loads of memories and became basically best friends aswell as together. we spent every second with eachother. and every time hed hit me or grip me up hed always cry and apologise and wed talk maturely for a second then he wouldn’t really talk about it again. 

im addicted to me and rely on him so much. we both live in care and i dont have any family and he became my whole world. all i could focus on was him. i care about him more than i care about myself and all i wanted to do was protect him.

he left me 2 weeks ago and ever since ive been panicked whenever my phone rings, i dont wanna socialise or go out, i cant eat or sleep and ive relapsed so bad on ket that ive been in hospital with a bladder and kidney infection. hes talking to me again now like were stull together and talks about shagging me alot but says he dosent wanna date me. i literally jus dont tell him anything or show me being upset so he dosent block me as my biggest fear is him hating me as i really dont know what hes capable of and he can go from sayong im his everything and crying his eyes out in my arms to laughing down the phone and sending videos of him shagging another girl. he makes me so nervous and hes got so much power over me. id do whatever he says. hes very possesive over me and i canf lie to him or do anything without being good w him and telling him n asking him first.

how to i get over him? i’m addicted to him and literally view him as perfect but i know hes gunna hurt me and switch up again and im so scared of him"	__jubjub	post	24.785286260279058	female	White	0.9959413409233093	na	na	na	2	domesticviolence	failed

"Myself and two of her friends found her mid melt-down after he left their house for a bit, with her bags packed & her documents to hand, despite not knowing where to go or what to do. Over a week we manged to set her up with a new phone, safe emergency council accommodation and access to a solicitor, we even managed to get things out of the house. 

She went back two weeks after the melt-down - it was all her fault, he was allowed to be angry at her, they can work it out, it'll be different this time. We don't blame her for going back, he got to stay in the nice house with the dog, whilst she got council accommodation that stank of stale cigarette smoke & sweat whilst staring down 9-12months of divorce and financial proceedings.

It's crushed us though, utterly crushed us - two of the shittiest weeks of my adult life - and now we have to watch as she stepford smiles and he smirks. She'll be on a tighter leash than ever before, it will be a long time before we get unsupervised access.

For those siblings and friends who watched them go back how did you cope with it, were there any organisations (pref. England based) that supported you, does it stop hurting?

"Today I witnessed a domestic incident that gave me a new perspective that I wanted to share, in case it could help anybody out there who's currently being, or has been, victimized by an abuser.

There was no physical violence to this incident, but a lot of yelling and aggression and physical intimidation by a man toward a woman. She had obviously been run down repeatedly by this man, and he was clearly enjoying being a tyrant toward her. It reminded me so much of the violent relationship that I escaped 20 years ago, and other manipulative relationships I've been in, too.

Here's what I saw that made me see things in a new light:

Several times, he threatened to leave her there. Get on his bike and ride away. Saying things like, ""I hate to do this to you, but I have to leave."" ""It's for your own good,"" etc etc. But every time he got up to storm off, he only made it two or three feet away, then immediately turned around and came back at her, again and again. Yup, been there. But that's when I saw it - he *couldn't* leave! He tried and he couldn't! Without her, he loses the ability to feel powerful by crushing something. He needs to be able to abuse someone to make himself feel better, because without somebody ""under"" him, he's nothing, he's left alone with the truth of who he really is. He was captive to the abusive dynamic. Like a magnet. He couldn't leave! So she had the power, she just didn't know it. He looked so small and pathetic.

It may be many years later, but I think I finally feel like I got my power back today.

I wasn't on the street with them, but I wanted to show her what I noticed. I wanted to tell her about the book ""Why Does He Do That?"" by Lundy Bancroft, which is available for free as a PDF online. I wanted to tell her that 1/3 of us women who may have been watching this incident know exactly what she's going through. 1 in 3.... can you even believe it? Anyway, I couldn't tell her, so I'm telling you all.

I am not a doctor or a psychiatrist, not a social worker, etc, I have no training in this area at all. I just have my own experiences. And whether or not I'm right about what I saw, today showed me all of those experiences in a brand new light, a light in which I wish I could have seen them before.

So, if you feel like you were currently beholden to an abuser, I hope this idea helps you. I hope you can see a glimmer of light at the end of the tunnel. I, and so many thousands of women like me, are rooting for you all. You are so very much not alone!!! 💜🙏

The thing is, if he can’t be good to his child’s mom, then he isn’t being good to the child. You don’t give the mother of your child black eyes thinking “oh great Lisa is going to love this”, you aren’t thinking of your child at all. And as long as you stay and continue to allow it, it’s just going to get incrementally worse, that’s how it works. You aren’t a shit mom, you’re an abused one.

"You can’t be a horrible mother when you’ve only been a mother for a small amount of time. You’re only being called a horrible mother so he can continue to abuse and control you. He’s hitting you, hurting your body, the body that grew that baby. Would you expect a woman to be a perfect mother if she had her baby in a warzone or during a natural disaster? No. Because their body has been traumatized. This is not all that different for you. Please try to see yourself with compassion and on the flip side open yourself to the possibility that a partner who has a baby with you, but hurts you, is not a good partner or parent.

It is completely understandable why you are having such a hard time. You’re not failing your daughter. It’s fucked up to be alive. It hurts to be alive, but through pain we learn and achieve grace we can learn to give to ourselves and others. You don’t even need to worry about that. You need time and space. And you shouldn’t let him try to shame you out of it in attempts to control you.

You deserve better than how you’re being treated. Your abuser will continue to, as the other reply mentioned, incrementally treat you worse. Your abuser will eventually abuse your child as well but they might do it differently than with you. 

I know you’re going through a lot but it may be helpful to read up on domestic violence and the pattern of abuse. Once you see the pattern, you notice it more and more, and you will fall into it less. Falling into it isn’t even so much your ‘fault’. Many of the aspects of life that shape us are part of long chains of causality that are completely outside our control. Our society is so individualistic that personal adversity that cannot be overcome is seen as a failing when really it’s that we need community support. There are many nasty forces at work politically and socially that attempt to undermine people for being human and shame them/guilt them into subservience for the sake of control. 

A lot of us are raised in abuse and find comfort or “normalcy” in abusive patterns of behavior and living spaces. A lot of us have grown up with so much instability and insecurity in our lives that even a shred of comfort in an otherwise toxic relationship can feel like an oasis in the desert when faced with the prospect of being alone with ourselves and our lack.

With the values and forces of how our world works, it’s little wonder that you haven’t had the time or space to think about how to get free of these patterns. You’re constantly in pain or potentially distracted either by life’s uncontrollable challenges or the ways in which we choose to distract ourselves to self-soothe. Try to work away from feelings of shame or guilt. Those are feelings that abusers can twist and warp against you as weapons. There should be no shame in self care.

When you have time, when you’ve rested enough, in spite of him, you should start to make an exit plan. You will be doing you and your child a favor."	SomewhereWilling4683	reply	na	na	na	0.9989394545555115	no	no	no	na	domesticviolence	failed

"Everyone thinks it won’t happen to them. Everyone genuinely wants to be happy. We get involved with other people thinking they want the same happiness we do, and they don’t. Their version of happiness is them in control, getting whatever it is they think they want. They will hurt you to have it. That tells you everything. This isn’t even about you. It’s them, they have the problem. They are hurting you because they can’t get their way.

As far as “giving your child a broken home” that’s not true. Family is about love and support and communication. Being there for each other. Helping support each other to grow. You could raise your girl by yourself, with a pack of dogs, or with two weird elderly aunts. As long as you give her the love to grow into the person she needs to be, there is nothing broken. Being a single parent and not having support from social safety net programs can make creating a loving home very hard. It’s not impossible. If you stay mindful and avoid people like your abuser, putting your child in the way of good people who will also truly love and support them, they will turn out just fine and I have no doubt they will be grateful to you.

While “letting things go” may appear to smooth things over with an abuser, I will assure you it will not be enough if your abuser knows they can hit and hurt you. They will continue to and will find whatever excuses necessary.

I have been choked for leaving an empty drink container out. It’s not about what you do, it’s about them taking out whatever is wrong in them on you. You can’t wait, you can’t fix what isn’t truly seen as a concern. They are hurting you because they would rather destroy you than work on themselves. They want their needs met, and their control and sense of power served over your needs, and your personal autonomy.

I’m really happy to read you’re starting to make plans. I hope you can continue to feel encouraged."	SomewhereWilling4683	reply	na	na	na	0.9989394545555115	no	strong	no	na	domesticviolence	failed
"I live in the literal asshole of the southern USA. There is no help. I have called every hot line. I've texted every crisis line. They all refer me to each other in circles. I gave up after being hung up on by either the state or national line after waiting for more than half an hour and called the sheriff's non emergency number. The sheriff's office told me to call 911 even after I made it clear that I was not currently experiencing an emergency.

Ok. I called 911. 

That earned me a call back by THE SAME MALE OFFICER DO-NOTHING who came to the old address *every time* I managed to call, AND THEN LEFT ME THERE WITH OBVIOUS INJURIES. I told him I was hurt. He told me to seek medical care on my own recognizance, bc there was no help. 

Ok. I went to the doctor. I don't have a PCP. I was unable to establish with primary care because I KEPT GETTING THE FUCK BEATEN OUT OF ME.

I told the nurse practitioner I had been beaten repeatedly in the face.

She said maybe I have tmj.

I protested and they threw me out.

I'm physically destroyed. I've been thrown overhand by the throat. I've been punched full force in the face repeatedly while being lifted off my feet by the neck. I've been flying football tackled into a wall.

I need help, but there isn't any. 

I just want to go back so I can at least get a fucking hug before I die, because I will die without medical intervention anyway.

What the fuck? I did. People think that it’s so easy and that help is just everywhere, that is so not the case.  

I called so many places that I ended up having to keep a notebook of places that I called, the people that I talked to from there, and what they said, and everything was the same. Everything was full, they had no more funding, some places I didn’t qualify to go into because it was for women with children, and I didn’t have any children. There was one place that was for those who were Spanish-speaking only.

And all I kept hearing was well if you need something, call me? Well the night that he tried to kill me, one of them anyway, and the police came out I called one of those friends that said, just call me…. and what they said to me, blew me away. They said wow, it really got that bad huh? I said listen I don’t like asking for anything but they are looking for him to take him to jail. I need a place for a couple of days until I can figure something out. this call me anytime you need anything friend directed me to call the domestic violence hotline because there’s help out there.

It is a huge struggle, and I’m sorry that you’re going through it. I am also in a temporary place, but hope to be in a long-term one on my own soon. I feel this so much.

"I know I’m a few days late to this post, but in the event that these are helpful, I wanted to share. I’m so sorry for what you’ve been dealing with. I know it sounds as if you’ve called numerous places. But in the event that some of the info below is new to you, it’s worth it to share. 

For medical help, I’m not sure if there’s another ER, FQHC, or Title X clinic you can go to for assistance. I’m including some info on where to locate some of these resources. I would also consider calling the domestic violence project that’s part of Georgia Legal Aid, Georgia Legal Services Program, the UGA law school DV clinic, or your county or area’s nearest legal aid provider (info on these below). Often, legal aid or other DV attorneys can refer to places that can help, including pro Bono or low cost practitioners who may not advertise their services. You can also get a better sense of your rights and what their obligation is to treat you in an ER, for example.

I know firsthand it is frustrating as hell to run in circles and that in the end we survivors have to do way too much of the heavy lifting ourselves. Coming out of the pandemic, there’s so much need for help and already meager resources are stretched thin. People care about you, and you deserve help, support, and safety. I think that most people doing this work are good at heart and want to help but have limited capacity, which is absolutely unfair. Please keep pushing, you deserve better and I hope you find it very, very soon. 

The first link has ~50 numbers in GA, based on location, as well as numerous other resources further down the list. The next few links have numerous resources by location, too. 

I’m not sure of your county but several counties have their own DV programs or websites with information on emergency benefits and other resources (some of which is included below). If you call your county’s DA or local prosecutor’s office, they may also have a DV unit or at least info about location-specific resources.

"I (23f) & my bf (22M) have known each other for years and years as just friends, but only recently started dating. I was friends with him while he was in other relationships & from the outside looking in, he never ever came across as physically abusive. 

When I started dating him, I knew he wasn’t exactly a stand up guy just based on my knowledge of his previous relationships. But I liked him so so much and he was really sweet to me. Let me also say that I have not been a great gf in past relationships either, which he was aware of. So we both went in with a bit of skepticism. We both were very adamant with each other that in order to build trust, we wouldn’t entertain any random guys/girls on social media, wouldn’t respond to flirty dms, etc. Basically the bare minimum. 

Despite some fights, it has been going alright so far and I still felt like he was one of the sweetest boyfriends I’ve ever had. However, that completely changed last week.

I was in the wrong to start with because I have had one guy friend since middle school (never once romantically involved) and my bf didn’t want me speaking with him so much anymore. Sounds controlling, but I understand I guess. But I quickly found out what he really meant was don’t speak to him AT ALL. But I still didn’t want to lose my guy friend & at the same time I loved my bf. So I lied. I set my friends name in my phone to a girl name. I get now that this is an awful lie and I feel terribly about it. 

Let me preface all of this by saying that alcohol WAS involved…

One night last week he saw my phone and figured out that I was lying to him. He stole my phone and ran down the street with it. When I caught up to him he spit on me, called me a whore, stole my keys and left me stranded in the middle of the street (I was visiting him in another town so I truly was stranded). 

Like 10 min later he showed back up and told me to get in the car and he would give me my stuff back. He took me back up to his apartment and when we got inside, he threw my phone all the way down the hall and pushed me into his room. He just kept yelling and at that point I only wanted to leave, so I asked him to please give me my keys so I could go. He refused so I asked him again and again. Eventually I just tried to push past him and grab them myself but he grabbed me by the neck and threw me to the ground. I was honestly in shock by this.

I tried again thinking surely he wouldn’t continue to put his hands on me. I was wrong. He grabbed me hard by the arms and threw me down again.

At this point I was sobbing and begging him to let me leave. He punched his mirror and shattered the glass & proceeded to tell me that if I asked him again he would “snap”. Not sure exactly what he meant by that and I didn’t want to find out so I just shut up and nodded. He started crying and saying that he was only mad because he didn’t want to lose me. I realized that he was genuinely holding me hostage. 

He only let me go when I swore up and down that I wasn’t going to break up with him and that everything would be fine. He apologized profusely and acted disgusted with himself. He swore he had never done anything like that before and that he would never do anything like it again. I hated myself because I knew that I wasn’t going to leave him. I couldn’t. I loved him too much. 

The next day he begged me and told me he would do anything to keep me and that I was the most important thing in his life. I told him I forgave him but that if it EVER happened again I was done. I told myself that as long as he keeps that promise, things could go back to normal. 

But when I got home and looked at myself in the mirror, I noticed bruises all over my arms and legs. It left me feeling awful about myself. 

Even after all this, I can’t force myself to leave. It’s like I’ve got Stockholm syndrome or something. Or like I never imagined this ever happening to me & therefore this must not actually be abuse. 

I’m wondering is it possible or remotely okay to forgive him just one time? Maybe if he promises to go to therapy or something? I literally can’t leave. I don’t know what’s wrong with me."	throwaway_38942	post	18.34727933403165	female	White	0.9987549781799316	na	na	na	31	domesticviolence	no prediction.

No, you cannot forgive him for this. If you think the abuse will end, you're wrong. He now knows that he can do that to you and you will come back, I understand the Stockholm syndrome- I'm going through the same thing right now wanting my ex back who laid his hands on me and beat me till i was seeing stars but knowing I can't, no matter what. It will be worse next time i promise you, your life is more important than this guy who treats you like dirt. You might love him, but love isn't supposed to hurt like that. He doesn't have the right to tell you who you can and cannot be friends with, it's just not fair, it's a form of isolation. Abusive partners will try and isolate you so you have nobody else, and only them. They crave that control over you and will make you feel worthless, him calling you names, whore, etc. Run, run far away from him and never go back, I promise you, a person who loves you will not leave you covered in bruises. I just want you to understand that you're playing with life and death now that he's laid his hands on you and even went as far as to break a mirror and say he was about to snap, that's terrifying and I'm so sorry you went through that.

I hate this for you. You do not deserve to be treated this way by anyone, especially not by somebody who claims to care about you.

"I was with my ex for five years. It didn't start out nearly this violent, but by the end of it, he had raped me and choked me while I was so sick I could barely stand... Because I called him selfish for not cleaning his pile of junk off the futon for over a week so I could actually sit on it. I threatened a restraining order when I broke up with him for good last week, but I'm still paranoid about him showing up at my work or anything... It all started with little white lies, icing me out, biting me hard enough to leave black and blue bruises when I said or did something he didn't like or found annoying. I'm autistic and struggle with interpersonal interactions and stuff like pain recognition to begin with, but I knew immediately it was abuse. But it was so... Bizarre ? So it couldn't really be that serious, right? Nope. Suibaiting. Reckless driving with me in the car. Etc etc etc. And like I said, eventual rape and choking as well.

But what got me the most was the shame I felt for having let him do that to me. How could I ever raise kids, a daughter, if I let myself get treated like that? What kind of role model would I be? And I started making friends at work and realized I didn't want them to see me as a pathetic victim either, not that those of them I told did. Actually, they were the first people to treat me with respect and kindness in a while aside from my close friends from undergrad who all live kinda far now, so I don't see them as often. Without them, I probably would still be with him thinking that was normal. The other thing that got to me was that I couldn't resign myself to a life like my parents'. I don't want to be like them. I want to be happy and successful and healthy.

All it takes is once... And in your case, it wasn't even once. He grabbed you multiple times. He held you hostage. You didn't want to cross him for fear of what he would do to you.

"If someone threw something across the room or shouted at me, I might forgive that.  They would have to go to therapy for a while.  They would have to show me that they sincerely regret it (not just tell me).  I can understand that these behaviors might be normal in a lot of families.  They would have to learn to communicate with me without frightening me.  It would be difficult, but I could forgive it.

But... if they put hands on me, no, never.  Unforgivable.  Putting hands on another person isnot just an outburst of anger or frustration.  That kind of physical abuse is just domination, power and control.  That person needs a lot of help.  Sticking with them is enabling.  You will inevitably get hit again.

"This sounds eerily like the beginning of my ten year abusive relationship (32f). I was 22 when he first put his hands on me. Told me the same spiel out of fear of losing me. I cut off all male friends except my gay ones. And eventually all my friends together and even isolated from family. 
I forgave him through the tears and all the excuses! “I was drunk!” “I was treated terrible as a child” “my past partners cheated” etc. etc. truth is most people experience these things it’s life, unfortunately. 
I was too, abused as a child and never once thought to put my hands on a partner or yell obscenities at them! I Know how terrible that feels! 
It won’t get better and no matter how much he says he’s going to change or never do it again, he won’t and he will. Please get away while you’re young!!! 
Really wish I had spoken to someone at 22 now I’m 32, share a child with my abuser. Don’t make my mistake! It may hurt at first but in the end you’ll have you’re freedom and LIFE!!!!!"	throwaway_38942	reply	na	na	na	0.9987549781799316	no	strong	no	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.
"I wish you could. I wish I could’ve. He is only 22 years old and showing this behavior and that really worries me. A lot of our mental illnesses come out in us between 18 and 25. I’ve course I cannot diagnose him but I can tell you that he is not safe. Not only did he do that to you but it went around breaking things. All things that could’ve endangered himself and were destructive. It’s not about love it’s about his impulse control and anger issues.  I promise you from experience it only escalates the older they get. Obviously you’re both young, and I know you don’t like that but what I’m trying to say is that you haven’t experienced the amount of stress and pressure that you will throughout your relationship as you age. 

Take pictures of the bruises and sit down and write down all the details of what happened. Take pictures of the damages. You don’t have to tell them what you’re doing but having them is a good idea. You might have to play nice until you’re able to leave but you really do need to leave. You don’t have to do it alone though

It’s important for you to find yourself a trauma therapist, most times you can get a referral from a domestic violence shelter, and start to understand red flags and boundaries for your future. We call what you’re going through a trauma bond. You can Google it. It’s similar to Stockholm syndrome and you have been brainwashed into thinking that he’s worth it. You can break it though. You would go with no contact with him. That means deleting him from every source imaginable.

I believe that when you decide to be exclusive it’s not good to keep up with old relationships but you both should be secure enough that you could possibly keep an old friend. As long as it’s not flirting or causing you to lie. You already know that it was wrong to be sneaky no matter what you do in your life and in your relationship, never ever should therapy physical abuse. I’ve been married a total of 27 years to two different abusive men but I have never once raised my hand to anybody. It’s all about self-control some people just are too immature to have it.

I really recommend that you contacted Domestic Violence shelter/ program and just go meet up with them. Let them help you figure out a way to leave him. There are actually plans and some of them you can find out the national domestic violence hotline. Org website.
Please get yourself to safety. There will be somebody, wait a while so you can heal, that will be every good thing this guy is without any of the bad.  Heal from your past relationships so you don’t carry on the same pain as you did onto another. You deserve more.

I have always had and stood by one rule. Hit me once, shame on you; hit me twice, shame on me. My reason is a lot messed up, lots of therapy to figure out. I push buttons to make violence a possibility. I want to see how much control they have of their tempers/aggression.

"If he is capable of harming you, he will likely do it again. It’s not a lack of self control- He made a choice to assault you, to intimidate you, to manipulate you into doing what he wants. He might cry and beg, and promise it won’t happen again- he’s just using your own empathy against you. I forgave my ex many times, he apologized every time- that didn’t stop him from choking me again.

Also alcohol being involved doesn’t justify or minimize his actions. Just because someone drinks doesn’t make them abusive, but already being abusive and drinking of top of that makes their behaviors come out easier. When I drink I get loud and sleepy, when my friend drinks he gets into a fight with someone almost everytime. It seems like a substance abuse problem, when in reality it’s his abuse of you that is the problem."	throwaway_38942	reply	na	na	na	0.9987549781799316	no	no	no	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.
"I came here to write you my answer before even reading your post. I promise I will after submitting. Thank you for sharing. Truly. 

Your a gem. I so love and admire your ability to see past the bad in people, in the hopes of having the same immense love you're willing to pour into them, might maybe just one day be reciprocated once they realize what YOURE willing to endure for them.

The love of my life backhanded me and busted my lip the first time in my entire life I ever had a man use physical force against me. This was his method of training me as I stepped out of line when I began to get teary-eyed upon discovery is intimate messages with an ex.

When I tell you that I have never felt the way and I felt about this man before nor since, I mean it in ways that still shake me to my core even now, 6 years later. I've never been so obsessed, so madly in love with any one in my life  and I am certain he was just as disgustingly head over heels for me too. 

The intimacy was something unparalleled and unmatched to anything I've ever known. We would stare at each other longingly for hours or get tangled up in one another taking in the smell of each other's hair. I remember one night waking up and staring at him because he slept beside me when I kissed him on his face cuz I thought to myself, ""if it seems too good to be true, IT IS. Remember this moment because this will not last forever"" it was a crushing blow even then. 

I also remember the night he gave me a surprise ass whooping of a lifetime. 

(F, 5'1-M, 6'1)

It was somewhere around 3:00 a.m. when I was awoken from a deep sleep by having ice cold water poured on my face. He then use both of his feet to kick me off my bed before pouncing on me like an animal and viciously attacking me with his fist, knees and feet. It would not be until sometime later that I will find out that this was my punishment for a random number texting my phone an unacceptable hour because that would obviously mean I was being a cheating whore.


We call them ""little things"" at first but eventually I would be picked up by my throat with just one of his hands and slammed into the wall for ""looking at him the wrong way"". he would end up being sentenced to 10 years Max/ 4 years minimum in prison for home invasion first degree and assault by strangulation with intent to do great bodily harm less than murder.

 He's out now. 

Ive spent the time since dwelling in the loss of the love I always knew could never last because its intensity was too much, the fire of our flame burned to hot and it was always leading us on a path that could have killed us both. 

Haven't gotten any better with relationships. I have a 2 year old kid now with a man that had an affair with a prostitute for my entire pregnancy up until mother's Day this year when she overdosed. He's been abusing me since my daughter was 6 months old. He was arrested after having the cops called last year by neighbors after becoming extremely violent with me. It's been 3 months I've been away from him but I'm still not free not in any capacity

I used to be like you and think like you.  give anything to go back to that version of me before I felt broken, in ruins and traumatized in ways I hope you never understand. 


If you tell him that if he puts his hands on you again that you will leave him and that that is a dead ass line in the sand while you still can. But if you say this and he doesn't hold to it, YOU must follow through no matter how much it kills you. If you don't you may be signing your own death certificate yourself

"Get out now. That went way past anything forgivable. He had plenty of time while attacking you to pull back and control himself but he kept going and physically damaged you, and you won't ever really feel safe around him again. 

It's very common for abusers to cry and gain your sympathy afterwards. They do that to keep you trapped and to wriggle out of consequences. 

Everyone in this thread understands you feeling torn, wanting to forgive, hoping it was a once off and reluctant to leave him. We've all been through it. We have pairing instincts, and  leaving someone can feel like you're tearing your own heart out. But once a man has acted this way he will get worse, and each time it will lower your self esteem and your ability to think for yourself. The longer you stay, the more he'll break your heart until you go cold inside and feel the emotional cord connecting you to him break. 

I waited until that happened. I left him 40 years ago when I could no longer bear to be near him and would have died rather than be with him one more day. I'd stayed too long, hoping and trying and still loving, and since then the idea of having a relationship makes want to throw up. 

Make the break, however painful. You will get over him. Save yourself before he breaks you. 

BTW, he never had a right to make you stop talking to your friend. He was already proving he was potentially abusive by stopping you contacting someone. Abusers isolate their victims. It makes it so much easier to keep their victims compliant and stop them leaving."	throwaway_38942	reply	na	na	na	0.9987549781799316	weak	no	no	na	domesticviolence	ethnicity: no prediction, age: 60s, gender: female, explanation: the author mentions leaving a relationship 40 years ago, hinting that she must be in her 60s now. the experience and advice provided pertains to abuse which is usually considered in a female context. however, ethnicity is not specified nor hinted at in this post.
"I could have written this verbatim about my own experience.   
After trying to work it out with proper help he still chose to abuse. Physically and verbally. Maybe it was throwing a plate of food. Or just calling me a whore.  Even after anger management classes. Even after abuser classes.  Even after counseling and medication.  I thought the same exact way. It was just one time. I can forgive and move on. 
Except I never really forgave. I disassociated and tried to forget. But then I started having ptsd and panic attacks. I actually saw him yesterday on the road driving and had a panic attack.  
He ended up with a criminal protection order after smashing up my car because I talked to a guy friend whom I never dated. 
You will have to do your own path and journey but yes believe all the women / Victims here. It always has to start somewhere and I’ve yet to hear a story of it not escalating. Unfortunately the numbers are not in your favor. 

I recommend getting into counseling for yourself. Take pictures of your body and write down everything that happened. Go to a doctor to get it checked out just for medical record and proof. (They won’t report anything as you are an adult). But when the inevitable time comes that police get involved you’ll want to have this evidence for yourself.  Assuming he doesn’t do worse and kill you next time.  When they ‘snap’ bad things can happen. He could throw you down, hit your head and get a head injury or die. He could strangle you and it doesn’t take long to lose consciousness and die. Why choose this life for yourself?

The quote that really got me was: 
“We attract what we think we deserve”. So now I’m working on the self love part.

"It’s heartbreaking to read this post. I’m so sorry you went through this. It’s easy to brush it off. “It’s just one time” “I’ve known him for years” “I haven’t been the best gf in past relationships” “I understand why he doesn’t want me talking to my friend”. 

There are so many men out there that would never even dare act the way he did. Why waste your time? 

The first time my ex husband was abusive, alcohol was involved. I believed he wouldn’t do it again. But he did. Over and over and over until it got so bad that I almost ended my life because I was questioning reality from his gaslight AKA “you make me do XYZ. You’re a terrible wife. You push my buttons, etc”. There is NO EXCUSE. Doesn’t matter if alcohol is involved or not. 

The thing is, every time you go back after being treated this way, you are teaching him it’s okay. That you don’t have high enough standards. He will continue the cycle in a short while. 

It’s easy for internet strangers to say “just leave” & I’m never one to jump to “just leave” except in cases of abuse. OP, he spit on you… he took your phone.. he called you a whore?! This isn’t okay. 

Do you believe you deserve better? Because you might not see it. But no human being deserves to be treated this way. You deserve a love that feels safe. A love that TRUSTS you and your judgement. Don’t spend another second on this loser. Seriously, OP. I work with DV victims for a living. This will only escalate. Beware of his love bombing, begging and pleading it’ll never happen again, promising to get therapy, etc.

"Would also like to add that you may be experiencing a trauma bond, which is basically Stockholm Syndrome that isn't specific to kidnapping but rather to abuse as a whole.

And it took me 6 months to fully register his actions as abusive on a cognitive level... And another 6 to realize it on an emotional level. And yet I still couldn't leave for good. It took another four years and a helluva lot more trauma to get me to leave. I also lost friends who couldn't stand to see me throw myself away like that. I really regret not leaving sooner, but I know now that I still had lessons I need to learn there. I know better now. I hope.

Also, as someone who stayed. I can tell you it got ""better"" in a lot of ways.

I was physically abused throughout a previous relationship with my child's father. I have since sent him to jail and don't want to go in to any details for fear of potentially being identified. What is the likelihood of him being released from jail with a second degree domestic violence (provided pictures and a detailed statement) and tampering with the witness charge?

"Hello! I’m a male prosecutor from California with a couple of years of experience with domestic violence crimes. I can’t give you a definite answer because the likelihood varies from state to state and from county to county (assuming you’re even in the US). A lot of it comes down to which judge is hearing his request to be released.

There are generally four options for release: (1) he can be released without any supervision, this is called “own recognizance” release. That means that the judge will most likely issue a restraining order to protect you and otherwise give him his next court date and have him promise to come back. (2) is similar to one—he gets released, but under supervision. This is becoming more and more popular, at least where I practice. He still gets a restraining order and his next court date, but has to abide by certain other conditions that the judge thinks are appropriate. He may have to wear a GPS monitor, an alcohol monitor, or check in with a supervision officer regularly. (3) is bail, which you’re probably familiar with. He pays a certain amount of money depending on how serious the crime is as well as other relevant factors and then he gets out of jail until his next court date. (4) is the last, most serious, and rarest. In certain cases, where a defendant poses a significant enough risk of harm to others or is a significant enough flight risk, the judge can detain them without any bail—they’re staying in jail until their case is over.

When the judge is deciding what to do, they’ll have the police report, but they may not have the pictures yet. The prosecutor will argue for whatever they think is the option that will protect you the most effectively, and the defense attorney will probably ask for some form of less stringent release. At least in California, you have a constitutional right as the victim to weigh in as well. Please contact your local DA’s office as soon as possible to figure out what is the most effective way of communicating what you need to feel safe to the judge. Your voice is likely to carry great weight, since your safety is the one most affected by the judge’s decision. It might be helpful to write down a short explanation of what you want ahead of time. The judge will want to know (1) how long the abuse has been going on (2) how bad it is; (3) whether it’s been getting worse; and (4) what you’re scared will happen if he gets out.

I hope this was helpful, and good luck! Everyone here is rooting for you."	Opening-Echidna-1676	reply	na	na	na	0.9973815083503723	no	strong	no	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.
"Update: 
Thank you for this information. I am in Missouri. The defendant had priors and was already seeing a parole officer as he's had a history of fleeing/resisting arrest. Each time he's had a bond hearing I sent in my statement explaining my fear, the ptsd I am currently suffering from, and why I wouldn't feel safe if he is to be released. The prosecutor has not contacted me since his last bond hearing. Within the last 2 weeks I have had a dream of him stabbing me to death, family members have asked about him and stated that if he gets out it's best I flee because he's going to kill me, and have been triggered at work (I work with children who have autism and very high behaviors). This was helpful however I am hoping for more clarity given the information I provided. By the way, the last incident was in January and he's been in custody since February.

"What he said! He probably knows waaaay more than I do as a victim. And please, please make sure your safe above everything. And take everything I say next with a grain of salt.

My abuser posted bail the next day. 

TRIGGER WARNING:
I foolishly went back to him, and I'm foolishly still with him. He's not on reddit, so i think I'm good. My report officially said he ""grabbed her by the neck and slammed her head into the wall. Then threw her across a room into a dresser"" 
The officer took pictures of my bruises the night of (first time I ever went to the police, immediately after the fight)  i knew my head hurt and my knee was so swollen I could barely walk. I drove myself to the police station, and they brought me to the hospital in an ambulance. I started throwing up from the head injury on the ride. Luckily, nothing was broken, hematoma to the head, possible ligament injury to the knee (which is honestly worse but idk) The officer took pictures day of. Next day I found hidden cameras in my bedroom, bathroom and living room. I reported then to the police and they arrested him an hour later.

I'm in California, where I hear they are heavy-handed on domestic violence charges. 
EXTRA TRIGGER WARNING:
If you don't want him to be in trouble, don't give them any new information and don't show up to court. Mine got dismissed, even though I KNEW thought it wouldn't. I'm glad it did, because I still here even though I know I shouldn't be.

But in my experience, if the person has a clean record, and if you don't take it all the way, nothing will happen as far as conviction. And if he posts bail, please, GTFO of there before he holds the bail money to you. In my experience, he did. And I wish I left before. If his disrespect got you this far, please, please for your world, get out. 

In my experience, after I reported the physical abuse, the financial abuse got worse. And in every victim I've spoken to that's gone through the judicial system and stayed, one version of abuse got worse.

"TW violence, wounds, blood, grief

It's been two years since a man I really loved, stuck by when he would call me late at night just to yell and argue,  tried desperately to keep alive when he was suicidal and self destructive, all leading to me dropping out of college, beat the shit outa me. Didn't press charges, didn't do anything, walked to the hospital so dizzy I had to stop and sit a couple times, covered and dripping in blood. A breeze could have knocked me over. A kind homeless man gave paraphrased the ""you win some, you lose some, live to fight another day"" speech from Friday as I passed, face covered in a sheet of blood from the gashes on my head from my ex knocking me to the pavement, again and again.  (it almost made me cry for the kindness). The doctor who cleaned me up and stitched and stapled my head was so incredibly gentle, I started crying again. Strangers.

Anyway, didn't press charges. I thought he was temporarily insane - but he was sane enough to run from the cops who, thank fuckign god, just walked around the corner at the right time. Focused enough chase me out of the apartment into the street where he caught me. sane enough to block me on social media right after. That all became clear in my head later, that he wasn't insane. He was committed to the act.

Why... I'm relieved and grateful I'm safe now. But my life isn't the same. *I'M* not the same. I keep hoping to pass quietly in my sleep, but I get up, go to work, eat well, try to be kind to my lovely family.

And even now, I'm too chicken shit to press charges. I'm sure he's having fun, and dating, and living unashamedly. I'm sure he's also had more temper tantrums. I think I'd prefer it if he lived happy go lucky forever, rather than do what he did to me to someone else. And sometimes I just hope hes doing well. Christ.

I just wish it never happened. I so so wish it had never- that HE never felt justified in attacking me. I couldn't even fully defend myself, everytime I hit back, I deflated and felt the strength go out of me as I realized ""this is someone you love who is hurting."" He never had that concern for me. I wish I had done so much differently. I hate living day in and day out just to survive and not give my family grief. I'm not spiraling, I'm not self destructing, I'm just...  a stone rolling down hill, following routine. I've even started dating again. And all I feel is disappointment, or nothingness, or I panic and immediately leave. Or the worse; I don't think I'll meet someone I like as much as I used to like and enjoy him. Christ on bloody broken stick, that's the pits. I'm so grateful I get to see my brothers and friends and family live life and hit milestones and pursue passions. I get my joy from that, and from tv and books.  But it's been two years and I just want to go to sleep.

Except for right now... There's a lot of rage. There was no accountability. None. I don't feel safe pursuing it on my own through, like, community or wahteer., I don'tk now what it would bring me, and I don't want the scrutiny of law enforcement or a trial making me rehash it to... what? Get a conviction two years later? He's left me alone. I still sometiems wonder if I'm at fault, and I make my therapist and some willing, generous, patient friends listen to every detail over and over, every humiliating moment and way I acted, the way he acted, all for the same outcome; he's a violent and cowardly man. Violent enough to attack someone half his sized, and cowardly because he'd never pick a fight he cant clearly win. A classic bully.

Anyway. I'm just having trouble sleeping lately. The grief and sense of loss/rupture of possibility. And the rage, at him, and at myself, for doing nothing to get him punished or simply accountable. If anyone has experience with this or advice, I'd be grateful."	DarkMagixian	post	35.725148474689775	female	White	0.9842228293418884	na	na	na	1	domesticviolence	failed
"I understand. I've been there several times, and never once involved authorities at all. Later on, I learned that this is actually the norm. Something like 9/10 of us don't press charges, for all kinds of reasons! Somewhere along the way I decided to give myself grace, that I had chosen what I chose and the reasons didn't matter. What matters is that I'm safe and healing, and that I'm not alone in my choice. And neither are you!

I'm glad to hear you're in therapy! Keep at it! Sometimes healing is a slow road, but it's worth it. I got lost in drinking for several years first, though.

My experience is that, strange and unrelated as it may seem, volunteering has given me my life back. Over the years I've come to see through volunteering that I am a person of worth and value, that I can have a positive effect in the world, that people can be grateful for me, that I can be respected and trusted to show up, and somewhere along the way I became a capable and confident adult. I love what I do and it is absolutely through giving that I receive. I'm a completely different person than I ever was before, thanks to giving back!

I hope I've helped in some way. 🙏💜"	DarkMagixian	reply	na	na	na	0.9842228293418884	weak	strong	no	na	domesticviolence	failed

"Hello! I’m a male prosecutor in California with a couple of years of experience with domestic violence. Before anything else, I’m very sorry you’re going through this. When there’s violence in a relationship, especially one like yours where your lives are so intertwined, it can feel like there’s no good choice to make. Hopefully I can give a little perspective.

First, calling the police was definitely the right thing to do. It can seem impossible when you’re dealing with someone you love or care for, but domestic violence is INCREDIBLY dangerous. Whatever happens going forward, when things turn violent you need to do whatever it takes to stop what’s happening. It was an emergency and you did what you had to. Never blame yourself for that.

As far as what happens now, I can only say what happens in my county, but I imagine it looks roughly the same in most places in the US. A magistrate will set bail very soon. If he posts his bail, then he’ll be released within a few hours. He’ll get a date when he needs to come to court. Between now and that court date, your local DA will decide whether to file charges against him. Although they’ll be happy to talk to you about the case, the decision about whether or not to file charges will ultimately be theirs, not yours.

Please, please, PLEASE do not let him come back home right away if he makes bail. Immediately after an arrest or release are often the most dangerous times in a domestic violence situation. If you decide to take him back, absolutely do not do that until a few days have passed—you need him to have time to cool down and you need time to think about your options very carefully.

If he doesn’t post bail, then he’ll be brought to court within 48 hours or so. Before he comes to court, the prosecutor will still have to decide whether to file charges. Again, though you can give input if you’d like, the decision is in their hands.

Regardless of what happens with court, you need to make sure you’re taking care of yourself. Google your local victim services agency. Take advantage of the resources posted on this sub. Those people will be happy to talk to you and help you come up with a plan about what to do next. If you have family or friends you trust, I would also encourage you to tell them as much as you can about what happened and what you’re going through. Asking for support from your own community is one of the best ways to make sure you have the strength you need to make whatever choice you end up settling on.

I know that things right now are overwhelming and scary. But you have done nothing wrong—all you did was protect yourself in an emergency. Please stay strong and reach out to anyone and everyone you’re comfortable talking to. I promise that a lot of people are rooting for you, no matter what."

"You will not get normal by getting back with him. He has decided that for you. Plan to not let him home and restrict his custody that protects you and the children. Do not reconcile and beg for charges to be dropped then decide later that you need to restrict access to the children because court will not take you seriously. 

Retain a lawyer through DV agency or a good private firm and file a custody plan for supervised visits because he’s violent to the point of criminal charges. Consider getting a restraining order against him for yourself."	Hayythtbabe	reply	na	na	na	0.9988853335380554	no	no	no	na	domesticviolence	failed

The truth is, more often than not, once they've put their hands on their partner, they'll do it again.  It's very rare a one time incident."	Hayythtbabe	reply	na	na	na	0.9988853335380554	weak	no	no	na	domesticviolence	failed
After months and months of trying to remedy this relationship and ignoring the red flags of emotional abuse, being sexually assaulted really pushed me to the edge and I am leaving him. I’m moving out next Monday. I’m scared of what the future is going to hold, but I don’t feel safe anymore. I don’t feel loved. I don’t feel cherished. I feel like I was used for the last 2 years.

"Long story short my ex is currently in jail for DV (he is not eligible for bail) and he is not allowed to contact me. I am also pregnant with his child which I found out about around the time he got arrested. (I decided on keeping the baby)

My feelings are all over the place. One half of me really wants him to take responsibility for the trauma he caused me. The other half really wants to drop the restraining order, work with his attorney on getting him out on bail and work things out with him. My reasoning behind that is because he was never physical with me when he was sober, our fights only happened when we would get drunk. 

Is it delusional of me to think he could changer after jail and be a healthy coparent? Or do abusers typically come out hating the victim who “put them there” ?"	AltruisticPie4716	post	12.412408897519821	female	White	0.9918588995933533	na	na	na	4	domesticviolence	failed
"Hello! I’m a male prosecutor from California with a couple of years of experience with domestics violence cases. I hope that my perspective can give you a little helpful context.

I’m so sorry about what happened to you. I don’t want to speculate, but if he is not eligible for bail, that probably means either that what he did was REALLY scary, or that this is not the first time he’s been violent recently.

In my experience, many, MANY domestic violence incidents start when the abuser is drunk or high. The feelings that you’re describing are ones that I’ve heard time and time again from people who have gone through this sort of experience—you are definitely not weird for feeling conflicted, and you are not alone.

Our brains are weird. When we love someone, and that person does something bad to us, it doesn’t make that love go away. We’re really really likely to try and explain the behavior away so that the feeling of love we still have makes sense. We’ll say that the violence is normal in a relationship, or that we’re to blame for it, or that some external force is what’s making it happen (i.e. the booze). But that’s not really true. Because many, many, many people get drunk, or even are alcoholics, without getting violent. Drunk or not, he is the person who gets violent. Drunk or not, he is the person who is hurting you. 

I don’t want to sound harsh, but I do want to be crystal clear about what’s at stake here: if he breaks your arm, it isn’t less broken because he was drunk when he did it. If he strangles you, you don’t breathe any easier because he was drunk when he did it. If, down the road, he hits your child, that won’t be any less of a betrayal because he wasn’t sober.

I don’t think that it’s very productive to try and figure out the odds that he’ll get better once he’s out. It’s very unlikely, and for your own safety and your child’s safety, you should assume he will come out the same person he went in as. If you choose to co-parent with him, never be around him when he is drunk. Make sure any time you have together is in day time with people close by. I would HIGHLY encourage you to talk to a family law attorney to figure out the easiest way to get a custody order so that he cannot control you by exploiting your child.

Your post doesn’t mention if you’ve been getting help for yourself, but please do so if you haven’t. Google your local victims services organization and take advantage of the resources on this sub. Because he’s dealing with alcohol abuse, it might be worth looking into an Al Anon meeting. And if you have friends or family you trust, please tell them what has been going on. I know this kind of experience Can feel really isolating. If you feel you can help him change, you might be tempted to hide the worst of what’s happened from the people closest to you so that they’ll be okay with the relationship continuing. But I hope you can fight that instinct if that’s happening. Domestic violence thrives in secret. If the people who love you don’t know what’s happening, he will never, ever stop what he’s doing to you.

You are not alone in this. Stay strong, stay healthy, and look after yourself. You are NOT responsible for his sobriety, especially if he’s hurting you. Your only job right now is to keep yourself and your baby as far away from violence as humanly possible. Right now, and maybe forever, that means keeping your distance from him."

"I have to be blunt because children don’t have a choice. 

He will not change after jail. If you cannot commit to keeping your child outside of a violent home because you want to get back together with your abuser please abort the baby and have a baby when you’re in a better place/different relationship mentally and physically. 

Here’s what will happen if you ride the rationalization train. He will act as nice as he needs to for you to take him back. He will assault you again. Drunk or sober he will assault you again. Your child will be born. He will decide you’re an unfit mother and try to get sole custody and keep you away from the baby. All while you still live together and are the one actually caring for the baby. He might get pissed off at baby crying and shake it to brain damage (shaken baby syndrome). He might assault you while you are holding baby. Baby will hear him screaming and be scared. At some point you may decide you’ve had enough but now you’re trapped into ongoing legal cases to try and keep you as primary parent and him only having visitation/partial custody. You may not be able to afford childcare by yourself so you can work to support you and baby.

Parenting after DV isn’t for the faint of heart and is definitely not the place to let trauma bonds keep you stuck. You can decide it’s worth staying in an abusive relationship but a child doesn’t ask to be born into abuse."

Congratulations on the baby! I want you to know that his abuse of you is not your fault. Many abusers do not have the capacity to love because they lack the ability to empathize emotionally. Therefore, his actions say much about him and little about you. It would be wise to stay the course with the legal proceedings, stay off of his radar, and keep him off of the baby's birth certificate. Otherwise he may try to use the child against you, dragging you through the court system via custody battles and such. It happens often. If possible, cut all ties and get as far away from him as you can. Never let him know where you are or what you are doing. If he can contact you, he will try to suck you back into the relationship via love bombing. If he succeeds, the abuse will escalate. He could also fail to lovebomb and immediately escalate. These types can be quite dangerous. Contact your local domestic violence hotline or agency, and be sure to work with a victim advocate to see what you need to do to stay informed regarding the case. Please learn everything you can about abuse as it will help you avoid entanglements with abusive people in the future. You will get through this and be stronger for it.

Being drunk is never an excuse for bad behavior. Yes, it’s delusional of you to think he’s going to change. What will happen is that he will realize that there’s no consequences for his terrible behavior and he will only get worse.

"Need help regarding my situation with my partner.

I have a abusive partner who is always constantly taking her anger out on me for little to no reason. It can be from putting something away the wrong way or just trying to be helpful in doing chores or even trying to talk. We have a kid and I’m always trying my hardest to be there for them and it always feels like no matter what I do I just get lashed out on by my partner. Would it be selfish of me for wanting to leave and get custody of my son. It’s gotten to the point where I’m afraid of talking to her about anything. It’s gotten to the point of me thinking of suicide when she yells at me and pushes me away.

I still love her but everyday it gets harder. Mind you I have mental health problems as well but for me to lash out at the people I love? Never. I’m 22 and she’s 21 and she’s told me that she feels anger towards me because she feels like I ruined her college career because she got pregnant with our son. Which I get her anger but to say that? When she conceived she agreed too. She wanted him and then it seems like she changed her mind after giving birth. Which hurts. And since then it’s always her lashing out at me for little things. I always try my hardest because of that comment she said it makes me feel guilty. So I take care of my son for the most part. I wake up early to feed him  and change him and on the days I go to my office I put him down to sleep again and the days where I work from home I stay with him in his play room where I also work from as well and I stay with him for majority of the day. Yes she makes food and feeds us both and she stays with him while I’m at work in the office but it always seems that when she lashes out me she always tells me the same thing about the college thing. It makes me feel so guilty.
I’m sorry if this all a mess I just can’t stop crying."

"13 - Failed time and again to get our 1st grade daughter to go to school when the only parent. Avy missed upwards of 40 days of first grade and a similar number in kindergarten. 
14 - Failed to establish boundaries with neighbor boy Ryder who would come over and force himself into our home when I was away working. Where he subsequently molested both our girls. Was not monitoring the children or to forbid him from coming into our home. 
15 - Does not take care of the important duties for the children. Doctors appointments, counseling appointments, parent teacher meetings almost never able to attend and never initiates need to do so 
16 - Can only be friends. Is too ashamed of sex to enjoy it. Limits contact to only during her ovulation period for reproduction purposes only. Receives no pleasure from sex seeks no physical contact or connection. Limited to no physical contact except 1 occasional brief hug. No kissing. Shy to a point where being seen by me is next to impossible. Has told me to go to a strip club instead. Sleep is on separate rooms only. Says mean things to me constantly about my body and sex telling me constantly my ‘pee pee hole’ as she can’t say penis ‘doesn’t work’ as I had a vasectomy. Before that she would tell me it didn’t work because she would awake me nightly during her ovulation week for sex however foreplay, touching kissing were strictly forbidden so if I did not immediately have an  erection she would ridicule me again that ‘my thing didn’t work’ if I said anything that might aid in the situation she’d become angry saying ‘don’t blame me’. To this date when on seldom occasions we do have sex it is always followed by deep regret and saying we never do that again unless I get a reverse vasectomy. She’s 45 I’m 50. I’ve told her I’m done having kids. 
17 - Gaslighting. Always saying she’s doing something or whatever and then moving the goalposts or just doesn’t follow through or you did something wrong or didn’t do something right or you weren’t thinking of constantly and her immediate needs so you pissed her off and now she’s off the hook, again and again. 
18 - Seldom works or earns and never contributes to the household finances. Uses her money strictly on what she needs or wants. Trips to her fertility clinic in Encino CA
19 - McDonalds every day for our kids
20 - Patronizing. If you say something smart she’ll dismiss you with a quick comeback of ‘thanks Dr Steve’ 
21 - Must have her way and will harass you forever before during and after if she doesn’t get her way. 
22 - Addicted to fighting. Has to fight everything everyday. Theirs is no such thing as ‘below’ the belt. She will say whatever she wants no matter how low or grotesque and completely false. Tells you there’s a reason you’re divorced and why your ex girlfriend beat you up. She like Ashley we’re all justified because I’m the worst person in history. Says all this and when I explain I think we should live separately and please not fight continues to dig and dig. If it’s peaceful she’ll fire off some ‘slings and arrows’ (her moms words) to try to insight conflict. Sometimes it’s text other times words. Once the fight has started and she has said something she maybe reconsidered she immediately becomes the victim and I’m the bad guy and she has to flee, block my phone and convince the children I’m a monster and should ’be in jail’. 
23 - She is perfect. She is the barometric decider of all that is right and wrong. She speaks for everyone so there’s no point in arguing. It is from this sanctimonious right she holds that she can pass judgment on all. Therefore since she is always right everything she does and says is justified and she therefore must say it because she’s so right. 
24 - She speaks beneath her breath. This is one of the craziest things. She cannot stop talking and the more she gets worked up the more she cannot control herself. So even if the conflict is over it never ends because she keeps talking shit trying to get the last word, repeat her grievance or keep the fight going in order to continue to play the victim.

"Description of traits: - 
1 - Pregnant and wants more children. Has worked to not communicate what’s going on with her current situation. Got a job at Amazon for the reproduction benefits in the health insurance. Never actually goes to work though. She hates it. She then took out reproduction loans using the job that she doesn’t go to to back the loan. Then travels out of state to a low cost baby factory aka fertility clinic. There it is determined her eggs are no longer viable, she’s too old. So she takes out loans and gets egg donor eggs fertilized with sperm donor sperm and is artificially inseminated with these other people’s baby and comes back home from her trip acting like nothing has happened. 
2 - Hoarder. Grew up in a large 4 bedroom house completely stuffed with hoarded garbage. To this day cannot throw stuff out and holds onto everything. Creates impacted messes of conglomerated matter, decaying food, personal care products left open and leaking like toothpaste. A filthy toothbrush cakes with grime. Apple cores. Sludge of combine remains. 
3 -  Slob. Never picks up after herself. Acts like there is a maidservant picking up after her. Everything goes onto the floor for someone else to pick up after her. She stares at her phone most hours of the day and complains she can’t get any decent sleep at night while being on her phone all hours. Basic skills like doing the dishes, laundry cleaning up all are way off. Example dishwasher, dryer, clothes washer vacuum all packed beyond capacity so that nothing gets cleaned and the machines become broken from being over packed but no matter how many times it happens and how often the machines break and need replacement or repair she is on autopilot. Cleaning is push everything to conglomerated disorganized piles to get to the carpet to vacuum and run the carpet cleaner. Meanwhile first time some is needed and might be lost in the pile it all comes apart in the search and nothing has been accomplished. 
4 - Narcissist. Everything is about her and her wants. Cannot hear anything anyone has to say. Cannot hear anything about herself she doesn’t like and will become angry and verbally volatile when criticized. Yet highly critical of others. Wants constant adoration and compliments. Redirects anything you say back to you. No straight answer. Never answers a question. Becomes angry and violent when questioned. Slamming doors and screaming. Connor be blamed and takes no responsibility at all. Is always trying to redirect blame and responsibility onto others. 
5 - Mean and verbally abusive 
6 - Controlling. Always forcing her ideas and norms onto others. Her way or the highway. 
7 - Refuses to listen. Plugs her ears and says blah blah blah, flees the room, blocks my phone. 
8 - Hypocrite: has a different set of rules for herself than everyone else
9 - Paranoid; thinks she’s being watched or observed and judged by others 
10 - Judgmental. Always stating how what something someone is doing or saying is wrong 
11 -  Does not contribute to the financial stability of the household. 
12 - Sleep disorders. Never gets a good nights sleep. Always sleeps in late and provides no help with the children in the morning getting them ready for school and instead staying in bed asleep though awake.

"I cannot get the loved one to get support, see a therapist etc. This is the second time she’s left her abusive bf and I can already tell things are going to be really tough for me. 

I don’t mean to sound selfish, im here to support her the best I can but I am frankly out of my depth here. I’ve tried everything. Is there some sort of domestic abuse support group for people who aren’t in abusive relationships but have loved ones who are? 

I’m of two minds. I want to be there for her she’s my sister and I love her with all of my heart. One therapist told me that serving as her therapist/allowing her to vent her problems to me & have me problem solve is actually doing her a disservice & enables the same pattern. My other current therapist said to me you can keep saying what you’re saying in the off-chance it reaches her at the right time. 

I guess my second question is, if you’ve been a victim of DV was there anything anyone did (big, small, didn’t do) that made a difference in your life or ability to leave the abuser? 

I hope I’m not out of line here and I feel horrible for even typing it but is it possible that the chaos of leaving & the restraining orders etc. is just another manifestation of chaos to replace the abuse that eventually dies out? I just want my sister to be happy but I know she isn’t comfortable with calm and likes chaos and conflict. 

She has serious self esteem issues. I just keeping telling her she deserves better, she’s worth more, how much I love her, how wonderful she is (it’s all true) but the person she’s with isn’t. In fact he’s changed her personality at this point where she almost isn’t even the same person. Sorry for the long rant.

"Yes, many victims don't tolerate calm well but it's often not because they thrive off drama or something, it's because NOTHING is ever truly calm with an abuser, and the abuse often goes buildup/tension, small trigger, explosion, remorse, 'calm' which is actually just buildup/tension starting over again. 

And yes, it becomes addictive to constantly have these stress hormones going, but it also becomes the natural state and feels safer.

Have you read much about codependency? Melody Beattie has some good books. This might help you understand your need/want to involve yourself and understand her need/want to go back.

I would also suggest reading Set Boundaries, Find Peace by Nedra Glover Taawab. This might be helpful for you too. Abused or not you need to figure out what you're comfortable with and what you are a 'no' to. Someone being abused does not mean you have to have different boundaries with that person. Most abusers themselves have horrific childhoods. 

Much like you want your sister to help herself and get out, you model this by helping yourself and setting your boundaries with her.

"That first therapist is doing a disservice to the entire industry. People being abused stay in a situation for a reason (threatened or bullied or no resources). And then, if they leave, they are usually abused even more (government resources). A therapist telling you to stop being supportive is the WORST thing to do. Would you leave a victim with no resources? No. 

Most women know what they need, but they don't have a way to get it."	chemicalwine	reply	na	na	na	0.9978712797164917	no	no	no	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.
Thank you for your response. Honestly I hadn’t thought much of codependency until my current therapist brought it up that I have those patterns. Will definitely check out Set Boundaries.

"Awesome! Thank you so much for the insightful recommendations. 

Do you happen to have any book recs for like understanding domestic violence from a women’s perspective? My therapist recommended Facing Love Addiction and it just clarified absolutely zero for me. We grew up in the same household, I get there are self esteem issues, but I truly do not understand women who stay in DV relationships. I know GAvin De Becker is considered a victim blamed but his line that the first time a woman is hit she is a victim the second time she is a participant really resonated with me (outside of the issues of housing, financial abuse, children etc. just in the context of straight 2 people in a relationship financially independent that made sense to me) I know I’m missing a lot but maybe it isn’t even worth trying to wrap my head around. I understand it’s somewhat similar to childhood abuse where your identity, sense of self, confidence, knowing and not experiencing loving parents but I don’t understand why as an adult you would put up with the very things that made life so difficult."	chemicalwine	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9978712797164917	weak	strong	strong	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.
"I think this book might help, even if you just read the free Google preview - starting at page 10. [Why Does He Do That by Lundy Bancroft](https://books.google.ca/books/about/Why_Does_He_Do_That.html?id=xEZIpu3SVvcC&printsec=frontcover&newbks=1&newbks_redir=0&source=gb_mobile_entity&hl=en&gl=CA&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false)

Birth order in families, and what events are happening in the family at the time of that child's birth can have a very big difference on how we grow up. I see it a lot where the younger kid is OK, and oldest is 'messed up' and it's important to know many kids experience their parents very differently. And having a sibling there for you can make a big difference to how secure you are. Kids also have different needs.

I think there's a type of maturity that comes in time, and it can be self-protection to think ""oh that would never happen to me"". But if you were raised exactly the same in the life of anyone else, you really can't say that you wouldn't be living the exact way they do. Subtle differences can have a huge effect.

There are multiple authors but I think this book above could help as it illustrates the key function - abusers with intention find the vulnerability of their interest, and then they manipulate it and exploit it to get and keep the victim under complete control.

You are right that the victim does participate in the agreements/happenings of the relationship. They do it together. Healthy abuse recovery often begins with I am not a victim statements, and instead taking 100% responsibility for the life they are in. By law, yes they are victims. But it's not a helpful mindset to stay with as affirming over and over that I'm a victim will keep me stuck. 

In their minds, objectivity is long gone, and it's like being entangled in the most complex web you could ever imagine. 

At first, an abuser seems so attentive, wants to hear your whole life story, so interested, really just understands you. But that's not what happening, instead they're finding your gaps. Your fears, your vulnerabilities, what you simply cannot bear that they can use to shut you down, to threaten, to control."	chemicalwine	reply	na	na	na	0.9978712797164917	no	no	no	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.
I’ve been with my fiancé for 8 years on and off. Kids together. He has a long history and wrap sheet. Numerous protective orders in the past, jail and prison time etc. Even have a news article about him doing unbelievable things to me… A protective order doesn’t stop him and neither does prison. It’s a mind game. I managed to get the cops called before he knew once and the cops came out and gave me a little phone as he took mine and busted it before they got there. The abuse isn’t only physical it’s sexual even resulting in a child. Mentally, physically, emotionally, sexually. He’s the bread winner and even with reaching out for help there is none.

"I’ll preface by saying - no not a child of dv

However, something I discovered in trauma therapy was we talked about how I had memory skips in the events. It frustrated me because mentally walking through some of the worst events was a way we worked through my fear; and then I’d be trying to remember what happened next, and the memory just wasn’t there. Time would jump forward and I’d be in a different room or space. 

During a traumatic event, your brain protects you by not remembering every detail. You may know basically what happened - but not always specific words or actions. Others may be on loop in your mind until you break free from the cycle of it. You may remember the most violent moment, but not the dispute that started it or vice versa. 

You are very likely going to have different memories then someone who went through it; because different things are important in your brain then theirs. Different key moments.

My question here is , what are are are options for childcare? is there anything like this that is covered by the state or government? Her biggest issue right now, and the reason she staying with him it’s because, without him, they don’t really have too many childcare options.

She’s aware that she needs to leave eventually, but frankly, right now she needs to complete her residency and any complications in the process me literally leave her on the streets. So calling the cops to file charges is an absolute last resort (they’ve been over many times before).

"My best friend(21f) started dating this guy(25m) over a year ago and he seemed perfect for her. Let us call him R. She quickly moved in with him and then quickly got pregnant. After a couple of months of the pregnancy, her family berated her and told her she was making a mistake. They frequently told her how much they did not like the guy she was with, that she was too young, and that she needed to make better choices. Over time R started showing controlling traits, rude behavior, and emotional abuse. They often got in fights and this gave her family more of a reason to not like him. They are very controlling and opinionated people which also caused her childhood trauma. This led to her going no contact with everyone except me and her grandparents. Several times she called us and wanted out of the relationship due to major fights and abuse. He threatened her with things like making her homeless, leaving her to be a single mom, or taking their unborn baby. She grew up with a single mom and never wanted this for her own child. Fast forward and her baby is 2 months old. She stopped seeing everyone and never leaves the house. He is still treating her badly but she has always seen the best in people.

We usually talk multiple times a week and check in with each other. This last week my texts stopped delivering and my calls went straight to voicemail. I started to feel this overwhelming anxiety and worry for her safety. I reached out to her grandparents who told me she tried to leave him again, cops were involved, but she ended up staying. Since then, no one has heard from her. I found R's phone number online and text him. He sent a vague text saying ""Hi, this is best friend. There has been too much drama and I want to move on with my family R and baby"" and then I was blocked. I believe he took her phone away and is keeping her isolated.

The police won't do anything because she refuses to talk to them due to his threats. When her family shows up at the door she makes them leave. I cannot get in contact with her anymore and have no idea what her side of the story is. I know she isn't safe and has been in this relationship for a while now but being able to talk to her when she needs me has always made me feel better. She is my favorite person in the world and I feel like I cannot do anything to talk to her, let alone help her. How do I go about my day-to-day life without constantly worrying and panicking over something I have no control over? Is there more I can do for her?

"I understand you're really concerned for her safety and it's hard because you know he's most likely abusing and deliberately isolating her.

Hopefully you can get to her when he's at work, if he works. 

Just be there for her when she unexpectedly calls you to help her escape. If there's any way you can discreetly let her know that you're there to support her and her child, and that when she decides to finally leave him, you'll help her.

The fear she's feeling is real, he's most likely threatening both her and the child and any immediate family/friends she has.

Yes, she needs to get out, but he's most likely destroyed most of her self-esteem by now.  She's reliant or forced to go to him for everything.  You need to find a way to speak to her without him knowing.

"I hear my neighbors have crazy verbal fights alot recently. I hear the man who lives there screaming at literally anyone who comes around. He had someone working on his house a week ago and he's screaming profanitys at him for probably no reason.
 Just an hour ago I hear him and a woman screaming. I was super concerned and then I heard a child's voice as well. I could hear banging and the sounds of a physical fight so I call the police. My balcony from my apartment looks down at their backyard, for reference. I could still hear a fight going on while on the phone. Like punching noises and a woman screaming. The 911 operator asked me if I wanted a follow up when they checked out the house, I said yes. 
They just called me back and made me feel super bad the cop said it's just a boy and his dad watching a movie and it freaked them out that I had cops show up. I know what I heard. 
I'm just worried if I did the wrong thing. Did I put this woman in danger? I'm worried that he will blame her for screaming and also so freaked out that they said there was no woman in the house.

"You are going to rebuild. Not repair, rebuild.

He's clearing your system like a drug because being trauma-bonded to an abuser functions *just like drug addiction* in the brain. This is why no-contact, no-socials-stalking, complete cold-turkey is so important. If you want to be done for good, do not ever look at or hear about your ""drug of choice"" again if you can help it.

Next steps (what I am currently working on) are dependent on the person, but you should know that this rebuilding period *must* take a long time. It will take much longer to heal from abuse than it does to move on from a regular break up. Abuse doesn't just damage you, it destroys.

I had to ""go dormant"" for a full year. Barely left the house or my bed, just therapy sessions and work shifts and binging TV shows. I started an SSRI and slowly started rediscovering the things that I like. It has been a full year since I escaped, and I am getting better.

Fill your time with close friends and family, and try to find old hobbies or new ones that fulfill you. I advise against dating again for an extended period. I am still not dating, and as much as I want companionship, I can tell I am still not quite ready for that.

Don't break the no contact. Re-enforce it.

This frozen state, I call it ""time stopped"" and you nailed it calling it frozen. This stage is normal. The world you know is no more, and that creates disregulation. It's debilitating, it's exhausting. The emotional roller-coaster drains your energy fast, and that might be what causes or a partial cause that creates the frozen feeling.

Keep moving forward. Do the opposite of what your mind tells you. Your wind will say ""talk to him, listen to what he has to say, he deserves a chance to speak"", so you do the opposite. When your mind tells you are paralized, you start moving. You seek friends, reconnect with them, seek family, go dancing.

"Two years ago, we bought a house. Our neighbour had also just moved in. About six months later she started dating an abusive man. 

In the last two months, the fights have been horrific. But we do not know this woman. So we had no clue what to do. On Friday, we heard her screaming that he was hitting her, so I called the Guards (the police in my country). Out of what I assume was fear, we heard her defending him when he arrived. Then he threw her phone into our back garden. The problem is we can't find it. There's some suggestion that he's been getting into our back garden in order to get into hers. He's been using the phone since it was thrown. He has all her passwords. 

He's threatening to share ""things"" with her new boss. 

I just knocked into her house, a basic stranger and told her that she can ask for anything. She kept saying sorry to me. I kept telling her this isn't her fault. 

I do not know what to do."	Low_Engineering8921	post	39.678474337576255	female	White	0.9985979199409485	na	na	na	1	domesticviolence	failed

My friend is in desperate need of help. We met online about 5 years ago now, and I knew from the get-go his family was not taking proper care of him, but not to which degree. He is disabled and has cerebral palsy amongst other things, and cant do too much by himself (especially since his family never pushed him to try). Me and others that hang out in discord with him regularly have tried our best to motivate him to get on disability, or find some sort of income if possible to help get him out of his situation. But his uncle that he lives with takes the disability checks as he has control over the account and fails to use them to help my friend at all. This all came to a head yesterday, where me and him were talking and it came up that he has a cue-tip tip stuck in his ear that he cant get out, and that has been in there for about a month now. He said he's asked his uncle and older brother that he lives with to help but they refuse. He is also constantly hungry. His household is lower income so I get the scarcity as I come from a similar background, but he mostly is fed ham only sandwiches and sometimes ramen. As we talked I could tell it was really getting to him, and he began to cry because he said he felt so alone. This really hit me as well, and I just wanted to know if there is anything I can do to help him as I cant stand to see him live the life he has as he deserves much better. I should say as well that I have met him once in real life. I picked him up from his home and the conditions were terrible. I would like to do it more but I'm just not financially able.

"I’m currently going through a really tough time since me and my abusive ex broke up. I can’t help but think I’ll always be attached to him and want him even though he never treated me with respect, I just feel like I’ve gotten used to being treated like that, that it started to not bother me anymore. Im really fighting myself to not contact him because I know I need to heal and move on but something inside of me tells me I never will and I should just deal with the abuse.

If anyone with a success story who left and is doing a lot better now could reply and maybe give me some tips on what helped you? Did you go to victim services and did they help a lot? How was trial (if you had one). Have you met someone who treats you better and is it easy being with someone who treats you well for a change? How are you feeling now and do you have PTSD or trauma flash backs? I just have a lot of these things on my mind and I feel like it might not be possible for me. 

I feel like he’s changed me. It hurts so bad because before him I was in a very healthy 2 year relationship with someone I loved very much, and now I can’t even imagine someone treating me that good anymore. I don’t even know if I would like it if that makes sense? Anyways just had to get some things off of my chest and Any response will help.

I’m going to make this short because the full story is too much to write and I just dont have the mental capacity to write out everything that happened in the relationship at the moment so I’m just going explain the pregnancy and afterwards. I do plan on posting the whole story soon just to get it off my chest. Anyways My child’s father was an extremely abusive and violent person. To sum up the relationship he put guns to my head, tried to stab me, when I didn’t want to have sex he would hold me down and basically rape me, beat me to the point of black eyes, bruises and busted lips and physically would restrain me so I couldn’t leave when I was trying to get away from the relationship. Anyways I finally managed to leave but a week later I found out I was pregnant. We both moved to a different state together because I had some obligations I had to fulfill. When I was around 2 months pregnant he woke me up yelling about stuff that didn’t make sense. He was a diagnosed paranoid schizophrenic and at this point he stopped taking his meds and was doing drugs so it was really bad. I tried leaving the room but he threw me down and sat on my stomach. I was screaming I couldn’t breathe and was trying to drag myself from under him. I scratched his face trying to get him off me. He then took my car and debit card and drove out of state to his parents house then called me and said he wasn’t coming back. Leaving me stranded in middle of the winter with nowhere to stay, or get around and he took most of my money. His parents usually didn’t let him come to their house but he showed them the scratches on his face and convinced them that I was abusing him so they took him in. He would call me hundreds of times a day threatening and harassing me. Fast forward in the pregnancy I moved back to the in because my family lived there so I moved in with them. He would call me begging to get back together and I would say absolutely not. He  would cut himself and send me pictures to make me feel bad but it didn’t work so he resorted to saying he was going to come to my house and stab me in the stomach and shoot and kill me. Two weeks before I gave birth I was at a coworkers birthday party, he found out where it was and showed up high on meth with his friend. Tried to drag me outside so I hit him in the face trying to get him off me because I thought for sure he was going to kill me if he got me outside. He eventually grabbed me and slammed me to the ground so hard that I had dinner plate sized bruise. I filed for a restraining order the following day to which his mom said “why is she getting a restraining order? She hit you too”     When an officer tried to serve him the restraining order his mom answered the door and refused to tell him to come downstairs to be served. Basically helped him avoid getting served. Which really sucked because I kept having to waddle into court almost 9 months pregnant to get a continuation until he got served. When I was in labor all alone at the hospital he kept calling me telling me he hoped me and our daughter died during labor. When I was discharged from the hospital, sleep deprived and recovering from a c section I was really struggling because I was alone with no help, my baby wouldn’t latch, I had a 102 fever and I was in so much pain from the c section. He was mad because the next day was Father’s Day and I didn’t plan anything for him or get him gifts. He continued to threaten to kill me saying his wanted to torture me and strangle me and look in my eyes while I died. Then he sent me a screenshot of his text with his siblings where he was saying he was gonna pay people to hurt me and one of his siblings replied saying “god knows what she said first” which I literally was just ignoring him. His siblings even texted me saying that I put my hands on him too (referring to the times I was trying to get him off me) he continued to break the restraining order and everytime he went to jail because of it his family bailed him out and even paid for his lawyer. The judge in our case said he had never seen such awful abuse and threats. Thankfully the judge shut down his victim blaming and called him out on it. Him and his family would call me saying I was wrong for keeping my baby away from her father. In one of his tirades he even mentioned our 3 month old daughter being raped. He would call our daughter ugly and threatened to kill her too. He showed up to my house and beat me while I was holding our daughter, dragged up into his car where he had a knife but I managed to run back into the house and lock the door. I let his family meet my daughter which went okay. But 4 months ago my baby daddy OD and died. I went to his burial with my daughter and his family spent some time with her there. But now I’m out of the storm and finally coming to terms with how fucked up the past 2 years has been and how much I’m fucked up from all of it. Like there so much worse to the story but I just can’t write it out right now. Like I didn’t even realize how bad it was until now that it’s all over. I feel like a shell of a person, I’m not the old me anymore. Im realizing how traumatized I am, how I flinch at everything, how paranoid I am, how anxious I am. I just isolate myself.  I’m trying to heal but don’t even know where to start. His mom sent me a letter asking to see my daughter (whose 1 now) again but I just don’t think I can handle being around the same people who condoned his abuse, even blaming me and saying he was the victim. Tbh I didn’t even want them to meet her the first 2 times but people kept telling me I shouldn’t keep her from them. Personally I just don’t want them in her life at all. Some of his brothers also have charges for violence against women. So it’s clearly an issue throughout their family. My mom keeps telling me my daughter will resent me if I don’t involve them in her life. Even the thought of being around them gives me anxiety attacks and flashbacks. I just really don’t have it in me to be around them or communicate with them. I really don’t want them in my daughters life at all	justfckinaround	post	27.81999662892097	female	White	0.9859689474105835	na	na	na	14	domesticviolence	no prediction.

"The abuser’s family and your mom are full of shit. You absolutely have every right to keep your daughter away from trash. You’ve been through too much and they still expect to see your daughter? For your own peace stop communicating with them and giving them visits. You and whoever else you deem safe are more than enough for your child. 

Because of how much they supported your abuser i’m going to go further and say end visits for legal reasons. It wouldn’t surprise me if they tried claiming you were violent/unfit and filing for “grandparents” custody rights.

My son's abusive father was in his life till he was 13 and he wants nothing to do with his father's family because they didn't protect him.  Instead they told him to get over it or didn't believe it.  When your daughter is old enough to understand I'm sure she'll feel the same way.  Why didn't you protect my mom?

Thank you so much. I feel blessed by this rare opportunity, even though when he first died Ill admit I had some sadness. Partly because we were best friends for 3 years before we got together and he showed his true colors and I was still mentally stuck in that trauma bond even though I wouldn’t talk to him or let him around me or my daughter. But now that I’m out of the storm I realized it is such a blessing. He was dead set on ruining my life as much as possible. He would lie to my friends and families saying I was talking behind their back, trying to turn them against me, went on a smear campaign, threatened to make false cps reports to get our daughter put in foster care and said he was going to make our daughter and tell her lies. I don’t have to look over my shoulder when I’m in public or feel like I have to appease him to keep peace, I don’t have to worry about my daughters safety, going in and out of court constantly. I felt like a hostage and like he had all this power over me and my life. I’m finally starting to feel excited for the future and less depressed I’m even starting school this week. It feels like a million pounds has been taken off my shoulders and I can breathe for the first time in 2 years. I have horrible luck so idk how I got so lucky on this.

"Hello, I have been in an abusive relationship for 5 years. I have been through it all, hitting, slapping, pushing, choking, hit with a belt etc. I’ve also been slapped in my face with his loaded gun. I feel like I don’t even know myself anymore. We have a 4 year old daughter together who unfortunately has seen some fights sometimes. I left one time and actually got my own apartment, barely but I did. Within a few months he was living with us there and promising us a better life a house etc. I stupidly fell for it. Now we are in a house together with my name on the deed unfortunately. 

Lately has been so bad. He has thrown things I’ve confided in him to my face such as sexual abuse I experienced as a child and the neglect my mom shows me. He yelled out over and over again last night “your dad never want you and your mom still don’t want you” at the top of his lungs. I haven’t been able to even sleep I keep replaying this over and over in my head. 

At this point I feel I have no one. I have good relationships with his family but of course they wouldn’t care to hear me when he’s actually their family. I feel sick to my stomach, I’m not being the best mom I can be because I’m so depressed in the moment. 

What can I do?? I have no money and my car that I use is actually his. 

The only plan I came up with is to take a loan out of my bank, which I’ve done before and paid off, use it to get a used care and deposit on an apartment. 

Is this stupid idea? What would you do? He’s heard my plan before and laughs saying I’m going to fail because I won’t survive financially and my daughter will be raised just like me-without a dad. 

Please give me words of encouragement❤️

Hi all, I wanted to explain my process with getting a restraining order against my abusive ex, maybe it can help someone. 

before:

i called the domestic violence hotline thinking i’d never have enough evidence to go to the police. i had multiple events with pictures. the sweet lady connected me with a company who assisted me with the domestic violence restraining order. so i was able to tell them events of abuse and they filled out the form and filed it for me. 

you can also find the form by googling “dv-100” or “request for domestic violence restraining order” 

during: the abuser has to be served the restraining order with the court date on it (you have to go to court for a domestic violence restraining order)
you do not need to get a lawyer, there’s so many people who do it without one.
be calm and speak your truth. look at the judge when you talk. the judge will tell you if it’s granted and when it will expire. 

it does get overwhelming, but remember you’re getting your justice and you deserve your chance to speak your truth."	whydontyouwhisper	post	38.551827639444845	female	White	0.0014546411111950874	na	na	na	0	domesticviolence	no prediction.
"This is my very first reddit post so I apologize for anything I do wrong! I’m very new to this. I (21F) am a domestic abuse survivor. I haven’t been around my abusers since I was about 14 years old since DCF intervened, but still it feels like they hang over my head every single day. Due to various reasons, my abusers never faced any legal repercussions and live happily in a three story lavish home while I live in a studio apartment and struggle to pay rent and take care of myself. 

I feel the effects of their abuse every single day while they carry on without a care in the world, and it’s hard not to feel bitter and angry and sad. I’ve been in and out of therapy, psych wards, the whole nine yards since I was able to talk and I feel like nothing helps. None of my friends or my partner have faced domestic abuse on the scale I have, and it’s very hard to relate to “normal” people sometimes because of it. 

My relationship with my partner feels strained as of late because of my mental health issues due to the aftermath, and I want to get better for him. He’s laying asleep next to me right now while I’ve been awake all night. He tries so hard but he doesn’t understand my feelings sometimes and I really feel like I needed a space with people who do understand. 

This is the first step I’ve taken to really truly attempt to get help and meet other survivors. I’m just not entirely sure where to start, and I really would like advice. 

Once again I’m really sorry if I posted this wrong or something, I’m very anxious using new social media so please forgive my anxiety!!"	pastel-penance	post	27.980507684890007	male	White	0.011966881342232227	na	na	na	1	domesticviolence	no prediction.

i'm (14) scared of my boyfriend (14). he's a drug dealer and he's hurt people. we have been dating for about 5 months? the only people aware of what he has done are his friends and my friend who i'll call v. v (14) and i used to be really close but after i started dating my now boyfriend we drifted a bit. still, we're close enough that the other day when i was freaking out over everything he's done i called her. i'm not going to act like i didn't know the whole time everything he had done but i didn't want to be alone and i liked feeling loved by somebody. when he turned up to my house a while ago with bloodied knuckles i didn't know what to do. i bottled it up and left it alone until recently when it all came out. we fight a lot and anytime i say something and i get scared it'll anger him in a way i just start apologizing profusely. on the fourth of july we hungout for independence day and it was awkward in my opinion. i was planning on breaking up with him the day after but i felt like i couldn't. i have no clue what to do. i asked my parents how to break up with him and they said i'm not thinking clearly. but they don't know. i'm scared and this is a last ditch effort. i refuse to go to the cops because if he was lying about all of this and everything that i've seen proof of then it's gonna look bad on me. the last few times things have happened to me the cops have been completely uncooperative (i.e. when i was SA'd by an ex and when i was receiving death threats in the mail) i still love him but i know he isn't good for me. i'm worried i'll get hurt if i say anything. he's never actually hurt me though. but he did hurt his last ex. i'm genuinely at a loss of what to do, so i'm using this throwaway. please help.

TL;DR: i'm scared of my boyfriend because he's a drug dealer and has hurt people and i want to break up with him but i don't know how to do that without him hurting me possibly"		post	14.665605095868251	female	White	0.9375064373016357	na	na	na	5	domesticviolence	no prediction.
"If he’s hurt people, including his ex, he could hurt you. He hasn’t yet because it’s early days of the relationship and he’s still trying to hook you in before he shows you that side of himself, but he will eventually. I’m willing to bet he didn’t clean the blood off his knuckles before he visited you because he wanted you to see it and implant the idea in your head of what he is capable of so you would be afraid to upset him. And it’s worked because now you apologise profusely for everything. 

Please be careful that he doesn’t find out you’re planning to leave. Get a proper safety plan in place first. The breakup phase is the most dangerous time for you (in terms of likelihood he will turn the violence towards you). 

It isn’t safe to break up with him to his face. Is there a way you can just disappear from his life without telling him face to face? Even if you don’t feel like it’s domestic violence, you should call a domestic violence hotline because their experience means they can answer your questions about how to break up with a violent person. They can help you make a safe plan to break up with him."		reply	na	na	na	0.9375064373016357	no	no	no	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.
"Honey, you sound like you’ve really been through it, and you deserve better. Five months is not a long time, and it is best to nip this in the bud. 

First, write what you just told us about him - that he fights and hurts people, that he deals drugs, that he scares you to the point that you think he will hurt you - as a numbered list, like a list of groceries. 

Do you have a “safe person” in your life - an older sister or brother, one of your parents? If you do, tell them you have something really important to ask them about. Sit down with them and explain that you want to break up with your boyfriend, but he is a criminal you are scared of being physically hurt. Try to do this by the end of the weekend - though it’s ok if you do it later, too. Ask them if they can be there for you, as the next few days might be tough. 

If you are going to see him soon, try to act normal for now. Do not warn him that you are going to break up with him. Do not break up with him in person or before you talk to a safe person. Do not tell a random friend at school before you break up with him. Do not let yourself be alone with him, especially after you break up. 

If he goes to the same school as you (or you walk there) you can ask your school guidance counselor if you can arrange a week or so of sick time to get your schoolwork sent home."		reply	na	na	na	0.9375064373016357	weak	no	no	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.

"I have no family I'm in contact with as they're all also abusive.

I would have left years earlier but as I struggled to find work and refuse to live with abusive family, I had nowhere to go. I also was in denial over the fact I was being abused. The behavior was normalized for me from ""family"" and past ""friends.""

Things escalated to the point that I knew I had to get away no matter what. I started talking to a few friends and there was an immediate outpouring of support.

But my life is still in shambles and the support is largely gone. I barely ever even get messages asking how I'm doing. A friend I briefly stayed with never called me unless I called her and kept ""forgetting"" to friend me on social media. There was drama with her abusive mother calling the police on me while I stayed with her for causing me to have a combination autistic meltdown/CPTSD flashback from triggering me beyond the point of me being able to remove myself from the room. The friend admits her mother is abusive but I took the hint she sides with her and doesn't want to be involved with me anymore. 

I have friends for when there's a dire emergency, but I have next to no one day to day. I had to cut off two people who had been major emotional support for me for, like the friend with the abusive mother, blaming me for my trauma responses despite knowing how much healing I've done. These same people gladly constantly vented to me about their own problems despite knowing the absolute hell I was going through. I was more patient with them than they deserved. But a few little times I lost my temper with them, though I apologized, they treated me like shit for it and I refused to stand for it.

This is the kind of loneliness that drove me into an abusive relationship in the first place. I'm so tired of being so lonely. I'm so tired of being made to suffer for refusing to allow myself to be abused. 

Everyone wants to help until they see what trauma is really like.

Sometimes I wish I hadn't bothered to leave. At least I wouldn't be constantly worried about being homeless again and abused by homeless shelter staff and residents. At least I'd have more material comforts to enjoy when my abusive ex-husband wasn't home. I wouldn't have my freedom, but freedom doesn't feel worth it sometimes after what it cost. I'm in no danger of hurting myself, but sometimes I'd rather die. I'm just so fucking tired. I just want to go home to the safe home I never had.

 I'm happy keeping to myself for the most part, but I just want one person to be a constant companion in my life who isn't doing it to take advantage of me. It seems that's too much to ask. It seems you either put up with abuse or die.

I'm just so tired and it never ends. 

I'm legally separated, but the ex is dragging out the divorce as long as possible. He's refusing to pay the agreed on spousal support while I'm struggling to avoid eviction from the shitty apartment I worked hard to find and he makes 6 figures and has support from his rich mommy and daddy who always were his priority over me.

"Hello, I am so sorry. And I want to say I can relate to a lot of these feelings and I think many other survivors can. 

It’s almost like after a funeral how everyone checks in on the loved ones for a month or so after and then…..life goes on for everyone who isn’t the survivor. 


So many of us lose basically everything, but I promise one day we will all regain it in tenfold.  The work is long and hard. I’m over 2 years since I escaped and I lost my job, and wasted a ton of money getting divorced and waiting to get shit separated.

"I appreciate the support. I'm glad you've been able to build community. I keep trying and I have some online but the several fallouts with the few friends I have are incredibly painful. Complicating things, one of those friends I've always had feelings for. But he's married to someone else and while I think he returns my feelings to a degree and his spouse is likely also abusive, he chooses to stay with her and I have to respect that. Though it unfortunately makes wanting to date again even more complicated. I relied on him a lot emotionally for a while but we had to pull back from each other to not cross a line into emotional cheating which was part of the fallout. It did progress into an emotional affair tbh which I'm not proud of but is what it is. I broke it off when it was clear he had no intention of leaving his wife and was barely talking to me anyway.

 It wasn't right, though I was desperate for the support which saved my life on a few occasions. I'm over my abusive ex but not over that yet. He was using me too, making vague promises of a future real commitment he had no intention of keeping. I'm trying to move on and date sticking to saying I only want short term atm and being clear about going through a divorce. I've connected with a few people online who have so much of their own shit going on they seem to have next to no intention of meeting in person. The people who are willing to meet up push for it way too soon. I deserve someone who makes me a priority and treats me right but it's feeling like it will never happen."

"So my last post detailed what happened but to make a long story (and 1000% taking blame for my part in the fight) we had a verbal altercation (that I started) then I tried to say sorry & put my arms around her to hug her and she bit my finger. I then grabbed her by the throat to get my finger out of her mouth. I told her to never do that again. My concern is she told me that people who grab the throat of someone are 750% or something more likely to murder their partner. Obviously this has terrified me & I am looking for counseling. My questions are 
1. I felt I was defending myself (not trying to justify my actions in any way i just want you to understand my mindset in the altercation). So is this different (in the statistical sense) than someone who initiates the physical violence & grabs their partner by the throat for some arbitrary reason ? 
2.what should I look for in a therapist/counselor for my personal sessions? Should i use the same counselor for personal & couples or different therapists/counselors? 
I can’t imagine ever hurting her & want to make sure this never happens again even if I’m getting attacked by her (not justifying her hitting me & it clearly needs to stop but I need to get her to agree to go to relationship counseling with me first) so I need to find way to deal with it until we can go to therapy together if possible."

"You didn't start the fight your girlfriend did. Then you apologised for the fight she caused by being selfish and she bit your finger and wouldn't stop.

She abused you, you defended yourself. So many people have told you this and that this is a major red flag. She's manipulating you and she sounds like a narcissist.

She asked for space and blocked you and was then upset you respected her wishes and didn't try to contact her via another number. If you had contacted her with another number she'd be accusing you of stalking her instead.

You need to leave her. She's not mentally stable and she's trying to convince you that you're the problem.

"I just read what happened, she is manipulating you because domestic violence usually happens to women.  First she woke you up to ask you to buy her something.  You were tired so you got into an argument.  She then proceeded to tell you to leave the bedroom.  You were the one sleeping!  You tried to apologize by putting your arm around her (very common move while laying in bed).  Her reaction was to bite your finger.  You went into self defense mode to get your finger out of her mouth.  She is the abuser!

Coming out of a marriage of domestic violence I know what choking this statistic is referring to.  If you went to choke her to shut her up.  If you choked her trying to make her lose consciousness.  Not doing it in self defense.

Counseling for anger management might be a good thing.  She needs counseling for violence!  There is no reason to bite someone like that unless you are being attacked, and unless you are not telling the story correctly she was not being attacked.  

With her blocking your number and email and telling you to give her space but turning around and complaining about you not contacting her another way.  This shows she has issues she needs to work on with a counselor.

These are red flags, she wants you to think you are the problem.  You might be a little bit of the problem but she is most of the problem."	Upseticecream	reply	na	na	na	0.9956014156341553	no	no	no	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.

"Let's not minimize. 

Abusers who strangle their partners or kill them by strangulation aren't doing it in a place of cool, rational, intentional strangulation. These are crimes of passion that happen in the moment. Strangulation can be (and often is) reactive, and not premeditated just like OP grabbed his gf's throat in the moment as a reaction to her biting him. But what ""provokes"" an abuser will vary from argument to argument.

Those homicide statistics get to the point that people who have done this once are more likely to do it again and escalate, but they don't mean that it has to be a calculated move."	Upseticecream	reply	na	na	na	0.9956014156341553	no	no	no	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.
Strangulation is a cool calculated move, no question. It might start in the heat of the moment but it takes thought to wrap both hands around someones neck and squeeze the life around them, it takes 3-5 minutes, it’s not a reaction brought on by the heat of the moment like a slap, which happens and is over. It’s similar to punching someone versus beating them to death, one of those is going to take a deliberate investment of time. Strangulation is no different.

"Someone told me that a sign of a good friend is being able to go years without talking and just kind of pick up wherever you left off. 

I am kind of in the same boat as you, I was never good at making friends to begin with but had a healthy set of acquaintances, most of whom didn't like him even before he turned into a raging narcissistic monster - Its like they could see something I didn't.   I dread talking to them and hearing what they think about him so I probably won't reach out to those people.  I pushed away all but the closest relatives and friends in an effort to keep the peace, the few that will judge me can sod off, I will make new friends.  I also pushed away a decent group of friends that I met through a video game, which may be a good source for me to be a bit more social though thats not the same as in person (if you like gaming, it might be worth a shot). At 47 I am content to not date again if that never happens, I don't want to risk putting myself through this again, but some friends would be lovely.

"The dissolution of my relationship and incarceration of my ex actually allowed me to realize that a lot of my friends were parasitic leeches taking advantage of my vulnerability to further exploit and abuse me for their own gratification. The basis of those ""friendships"" was in their ability to predatorily data-mine information to speak about me anecdotally to their other friends and family and centralize themselves in my situation due to their love for drama and prey on my susceptibility to coercion and agreeability that was cultivated from abuse- they constantly asked for money (knowing I gave my ex money all the time or he just stole from me), used my home for a place to do laundry for free (knew my ex used me for a place to stay), would invite me out for food or drinks or go to the bar with the expectation I pay for everything without letting me know until the end, etc. One even asked me to take a loan out for him knowing my ex stole all my savings and gambled it away...

They didn't actually care about the very real violence and suffering I was enduring because to them it was just excitement and they felt gratified by kicking me when I was down because it made them feel better about themselves because ""at least I'm not *letting* a man hit me and cheat on me"". The ""support"" they showed was actually disgusting, and for some reason they would overemphasize their place in it all and make it either all about them or all about literally everyone else, even hypothetical future partners of his and show way more sympathy for them than their literal friend in front of them. I cut them off and went no contact, blocked them on everything full shebang, when I realized all of this.

I have another friend I've known since childhood who said directly she wasn't emotionally available to me and she wasn't there for me for around a year (she's a mom and a wife and a business owner) and didn't resurface until a detective reached out to her when my ex was first incarcerated to try and locate me and they relayed the message she said to them that she wished we were talking (she had all my contact info though so it was kinda weird, that and she facilitated some of his abuse through a particular act she did).

Despite EVERYTHING I've been going through and have gone through she still isn't emotionally available and speaks about her stuff all the time and the disparity between the quality and quantity of the support given and received between us is pretty extreme but she's kind of the only friend I have and she isn't as bad as the others. She still does the same things others did which is centralize herself a lot with an overinflated notion of her place within the abuse and thinks she's a target despite even the detectives saying the only one in danger is me. I am thinking about cutting her off too because her lack of self-awareness is really bothersome but again, she isn't *as* bad so I'm conflicted. I kind of have a propensity to be surrounded by abusive, self-absorbed people so it's nothing I'm unused to just something I'm angry about and sick of.

None of my friends were ever exposed to his abuse, he met two of them very briefly and zero conversation occurred between them so I would understand their hesitance to be my friend or fear for their safety if I didn't protect them from the very abuse I was enduring, but since that didn't happen I have definitely been confused over a lot of their cognitive dissonance and lack of consideration.

It's actually quite common for people to realize that they've been preyed upon by more than one abuser when they're fleeing an abusive former partner and I love this meme that sums it up.

In terms of making friends, take it slow and realize that you are way more likely to fall into abusive friendships and relationships when fleeing an abusive partner. If something doesn't feel right you are always permitted in communicating that and/or walking away. I think it's best to re-acquaint yourself with who you are as abusive relationships not only isolate us from others but from ourselves. If there's a particular hobby or pass-time you previously enjoyed and want to do that again then do it and you might make great friendships from that. Be mindful of group therapy as a lot of narcissists love group therapy for the ego-gratification they get and prey on them to seek out new supplies. Another aspect of re-acquainting you with yourself is through self-reflection and figuring out your boundaries because boundaries are KEY to self-preservation and protection from potential future abuse."	arist15	reply	na	na	na	0.9957228899002075	no	strong	no	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.

My whole life I’ve been subjected to abuse, violence, words, etc. I’ve only ever been in one good relationship and that’s my current one. I have a lot of trouble with self confidence and being comfortable with myself. I’ve recently tried repeating a mantra over and over again when I get stuck in my head to try and avoid going back to self harm. But it’s been so hard lately. I try not to compare my partner to my past but when something happens that happened in my past it’s hard to see it without seeing how it happened in my past. I have trouble reading body language sometimes so I ask my partner if they are ok and sometimes that upsets them. Idk what else to do tho? How do I function like a normal person and have a normal healthy relationship with my love when all I know is pain and abuse. How do I stop always thinking it’s my fault when anything happens. Arguments set me off so bad. My partner knows and understands my past but I just want to be better. I’m in therapy but it’s been three years. I know things take time but I feel hopeless today.

"About three months ago I (40F) managed to leave my husband. I'd known I needed to for about a year, after he physically hurt me and then, when he found out I'd told the police, forced me to tell them I'd been drunk and high and made the whole thing up.

The divorce process is going to be protracted and messy, he'll throw everything he can at me, but I was as prepared for that as you can be, I think. I'd got as many of my ducks in a row as I could before I went and I don't \*think\* there's anything he can throw at me that I haven't seen coming. I've got a solicitor who's helping me through the scary stuff and I'm just having to tell myself that he doesn't control me any more, I don't have to do what he wants any more because I no longer have to consider whether he'll make my life miserable into my decisions. My friends and family are being brilliantly supportive.

But. BUT. No one, not one person, knows what went on, knows what it was like. That's partly because I'm ashamed I let myself get into that situation, partly fear that people won't believe me or won't understand, partly (I'll admit it) fear that if he finds out I've told people he'll escalate even further, and partly just that I still see the good in him, so I feel like it would be unfair to ruin his reputation by, erm, telling people the truth about him. I do know all the above is not rational, but I've found it just impossible to tell anyone about it.

And so I'm lonely. Because I can't tell people what \*really\* happened, I find I don't really talk about it at all, at least in any detail. It hurts too much to try and talk about it and have to talk around this great huge secret that's weighing me down. It means that although there's a few people I can talk about the process, legal stuff etc to, there's no one I can cry to. I don't even want to cry about the abuse, necessarily, but because of THE SECRET I can't cry to anyone even just about the fact that I'm getting divorced - I am sad about that, even though it's for the best.

So I'm writing here to get it out, I suppose. He was sometimes violent, but more often he threatened, humiliated and coerced me. I was scared of him. And no one knows. And although I knew there were going to be so many things about this that would be utterly shitty, I didn't realise how lonely it would be."

"Good for you for leaving; I know it’s so so hard but you are doing the right thing to stay safe and take care of yourself. 

When I left my abusive ex about four years ago (10.5 year relationship) the loneliness was absolutely crushing. Just like you, I didn’t want to tell any of my family or friends what happened because I felt ashamed and guilty. I got myself into individual therapy a week after I left, which helped immensely, but about 5-6 weeks out of the relationship I sought out group therapy, which was really a lifesaver in many ways. This was a group of women and a man who understood exactly what I went through and I was able to cry and unburden myself each week in that group, and my story also helped others. It was amazing to talk to the people in that group each week without feeling any judgment, and they also helped give me advice (through sharing their own experiences) in when and how to tell my loved ones and how to deal with some of the court issues. Hearing others’ stories made me feel much less ashamed and less alone too.

I highly recommend group therapy; I looked forward to it every week and still miss that group a lot since I moved away from the area four years ago. If you have any trouble finding a group, your solicitor may have information on where to find one. Also, doing regular exercise that I enjoyed was huge in keeping my spirits up.

It's so uncomfortable to suddenly be alone. To hear their voice in our heads, to see them in our dreams. Our brains miss the chaos we have become accustomed to and the silence tries to make us go mad. Hang in there. This is normal and the after effects of abuse. Time will be your friend and heal. There is no magic wand or timetable as it is different for all of us. Welcome the quiet through all its uncomfortable ness. Take time to get to know yourself. Try new things or go back to the things that you previously liked. Get in counseling, trauma specific, join a group at a local shelter. It gets better, it just takes time.

Did you struggle with remembering how bad it was? I know it sounds mad but I'm genuinely having moments of ""did I just blow that way out of proportion?"", even about the incidents involving physical violence. Towards the end I'd taken to having a voice recorder on my phone going when I knew a blow-up was likely - I listened to some of the recordings yesterday and they shocked me, like that really was some bad shit and here was me only a few months out wondering if I'd imagined half of it.

Re trying not to go back, I've had moments but I've found it helps to keep in mind one or two incidents, even just moments, that were unequivocally just not OK that I can kind of take out of their little box in my brain and look at and remind myself that even if everything else is fuzzy and confusing, those things happened and he did them and they cannot be justified.

"Yes, I had soooo many doubts that I was blowing it all out of proportion. When I went to the first group therapy session, I told my story and ended with, “that’s abuse, right?” and they were all like “uh yeah” lol. I can laugh about it a little bit now but at that time I was constantly questioning every single thought and memory about what I had been through and I think it’s very common to do, especially when our abusers had been so successful at beating us down psychologically. 

It’s incredible to me to look back at that frame of mind then and now, and even over four years out, I still have the occasional doubtful thought that creeps in. But now I have the tools to deal with those thoughts and know that what I went through was 100 percent not acceptable and that in no way shape or form did I deserve that kind of treatment. Hearing others’ stories and finding healing in that group setting was very powerful and really helped me get to where I am today.

The recordings are so helpful too! I just got out of a relationship with an alcoholic (different guy) who would become verbally abusive when drinking and I recorded some of those conversations to help me remember what I don’t want to go back to if I ever start missing him. I’m choosing now to stay single for a while to cultivate a relationship with myself and ensure I stop picking unhealthy partners."

"I'm sorry if this is the wrong place to ask, I am happy to move it to a better place if there is one but I figure the folk here have experience with this type of thing and might be able to give me some insight.

I have a hearing for a 2 year protective order coming up this wednesday and I'm getting some mixed messages about whether I need to bring a lawyer with me.  From what I can tell I don't have to have one, though having one would help, but my brother (who has been a otherwise godsend through all this) is starting to freak out about how I am screwed if I don't line something up quickly.  He is concerned that I wont be able to let them listen to the audio recording of my husbands last meltdown in which he threatened to stab me, but I am not convinced they'll even need to hear that.  The burden of proof in Virginia for protective orders appears to be lower than that for civil court, and considering that I was granted an emergency order the day of the incident and a 2 week order 3 days later without needing to do more than explain myself I think I will be ok though I am kicking myself.  

My anxiety levels are super high right now and I already struggle to call people, I have managed to line up doctors appointments (he had us in a covid lockdown since feb 2020, no doctors outside of emergencies)  but at the expense of using that as an excuse to put off calling a lawyer.  I will need one for custody, regardless, but am stressing over Wednesday.

When I had my hearing I ended up getting a consultation with a lawyer and asked him a ton of questions. For me specifically the judge asked me to explain everything that happened so went in date order and explained everything that happened. She didn’t ask any follow up questions and after I said my part my abuser had to explain why what I was saying was false. I had video evidence that I submitted which the clerk originally told me I couldn’t do, but the lawyer explained how and I submitted it anyways and they accepted and used it. The video itself was enough for them to keep the order of protection for the full 2 years even though he claimed I lied about everything else.	paisleymanticore	reply	na	na	na	0.992782711982727	no	strong	no	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.
I think to decide either way you should read the rules of civil procedure for your county.

You can put the recording on a flash drive, run it into the court so they can security check it and then you can also submit a transcript of the time stamp and what is said and make sure it's all served on the respondent.

"The process is like this, it's an actual trial. In all trials in America the person accused has to see all evidence against them ahead of time so they can plan their defense. So all evidence you plan on introducing, have that served to him and to the court with a declaration (usually a form you can print off from your states legal forms website 8f they have one) explaining the evidence and the events. Write your own chronological script that explains the evidence and other incidences so you have a reference when you make your statement to the court. I think the general rubric is that you have 3 instances of behavior that constitutes domestic violence, and that you feel threatened or intimidated by this person. 

The judge typically asks why you are seeking a protection order or what you hope to accomplish that day. You say, ""Your honor, I am requesting an extension on the PO because X's behavior towards me dating back to YEAR has caused me to believe he does not respect my boundaries and could do me further harm. The reason I believe this is because [read your chronological script].""

Your ex will get to make his own statement. Do not look at him, make faces, make noises or roll your eyes. Stare straight ahead or straight down.

You get to respond to his statement, so take notes of disagreements of what he is saying so you can refer back to them because you will respond to his statement after he is done. 

This is where you can introduce evidence. If he says the abuse never happened say ""Mr. X says it didn't happen, but I have Exibit A with a picture of my bent glasses from when he hit me, this was on MM/DD/YYYY. I have notes taken dating back to 2019, for Exibit B. Mr X would have the court believe this is a long running scam of mine to get back at him but that is not the reality, I took these notes in reaction to his abuse. This abuse was also recorded by me on my [device] and I have submitted the flash drive and a transcript of that recording. Describe the incident and read the transcript.

You can call witnesses too, or have them write out a sworn statement and they need to have it either notarized or written on a declaration form. And you can cross examine his witnesses if he brings any in. Make sure you take notes while they are speaking so you remember what to ask then if you cross examine them.

Then he may introduce evidence, you can make a legal argument as to why his evidence doesn't hold up or provide context about his evidence.

Then you can make a closing statement, it can be an emotional plea for justice, just conclude the only way you will feel safe and free is with this protection.

And then you win.

DEMONS

I stared at the creature. It cringed back from my level gaze, which was odd, since it was fully eight feet tall and resembled Baphomet. Its dragonlike tail clamped firmly between its legs. Its horns quivered.

""You...you *live* like this?"" it rumbled, aghast.

I snorted. ""Is there another option?"" 

""The...the pain! The loss! The horror! This...this is *monstrous,""* whispered the monster, wringing its clawed hands.

I found that ironic, but stifled my laugh. Laughing hurt my crushed ribs, anyway.

The sleep paralysis demon shuddered and edged its way backward a bit, eyeing me as though I were a rabid dog. 

Ok, that was too funny. My broken teeth showed fanglike when I grinned. The creature ducked its head defensively.

Sympathy got the best of me. ""Hey, my dude. I'm not going to bite.""

The demon swallowed. ""N-no. I'm supposed to be the one biting *you.* I feed on fear.""

""Well, have at then, I guess,"" I told it indifferently.

""No!"" The word came out in a howl.

My eyebrows shot up. ""Oh come on. What's the hold up?""

The demon's glittering eyes cut to the side nervously. ""I feel pain. I feel loss. I feel horror. But...where is your fear?""

""Beaten out of me,"" I answered. ""You get used to it.""

The demon seemed to consider this. I could almost hear the gears turning. It sniffed at the stale air of the otherwise dark and empty house. Its houndlike nostrils flared, catching scent.

*""Where is he?""* 

""At work,"" I said. I gestured inefficiently from my supine position in the bed. I couldn't really sit up anymore. Moving hurt, but not moving also hurt. I was past caring.

The demon's eyes narrowed. ""I think I may have gotten this one backwards. Would you mind if I just...hang out a bit? And wait?""

""Sure,"" I told it. Company was always nice. I didn't often see folks anymore, not in my current condition. Even an eight-foot night terror was better than no one.

Gingerly, the demon perched its scaled behind on the edge of the mattress. I winced a little as its weight sunk in.

""Oooh, sorry,"" hissed the demon, wincing back.

""Don't worry about it,"" I told it with a grimace. 

It shuddered a bit, then seemed to get ahold of itself. 

""So when does he get home?"" it asked me conversationally.

""In an hour or so,"" I answered, glancing at my phone. The screen was full of hearts and smileys from his messages on last break.

The demon snaked out a forked tongue to lick its lips. ""I'll need a place to hide. Til he falls asleep.""

""Closet's over there,"" I said with another painful, awkward gesture. Ouch. I sank back against the lumpy pillows, feeling my shattered bones grind with the motion.

""Thanks.""

""Yeah, no problem.""

We sat in companionable silence for awhile, the demon and I.

Eventually a car pulled into the drive. Booted feet walked up the front steps. The front doorknob rattled loosely as it turned.

The demon looked up, grinned, and slithered impossibly into the closet. The door swung silently shut behind it.

Later that night, when the man beside me began to scream in his sleep, I kept my eyes shut. None of my business.

"TW s*icide

It's a daily thing, but since I'm no longer a minor, and my brother is still one, I'm unsure if anything can be done? Could it be possible to file a restraining order..? 

I've thought about talking with the church of my school, because my parents don't think it's a big deal.. i just want to get away from this situation. Idk if the school will actually care since it isn't as severe as it could be (it's mainly psychological abuse and dead threats, although he does get physical like twice a week) 

I'm so used to my parents brushing off what I'm experiencing, so I try to remain as calm as possible whenever my brother attacks me, and since he doesn't get physical as often and whenever he does I manage to get away/he doesn't leave any bruises or anything so I end up brushing it off too…

The thing is, a few days ago he was saying how he wanted to kill me (which didn’t surprise me since he threatens me like that almost every day) and how he just wants to see me suffer, and I realized that most families don't allow that kind of attitude… it's very weird having to protect me, my mom and my dog whenever he gets angry because he does get physical and I'm scared of what he might do, I remember months ago being scared of him r*aping me or my dog while I slept…

idk man I just feel awful, everytime this happens my parents are WELL aware and they always minimize the situation, so I don't know anymore if I'm just overreacting or if something is actually happening… i just cry myself to sleep every night, and wake up crying.

Aw, I can't imagine what you are going through.  Have you given all details to your counselor?  If he hits you, it's assault.  But obviously that would affect your family if you reported it.  So maybe your therapy can help you with healthy boundaries and how to deescalate scenarios for your mental well being.	stupidassspamaccount	reply	na	na	na	0.9981890320777893	weak	no	strong	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.

"I'm so tired. It's been two days post beating and it still feels like no time has passed at all. I knew before we went what was coming, I'm always so hopeful things will change why am I surprised when they never do. 
He yelled at me the entire drive home I took it whatever the driving crazy taking my phone screaming calling me a bitch pulling over randomly to threaten to throw me out if I didn't speak what can I say that won't make him more mad. 
We get home finally after 6 hours together he starts packing his things freedom finally right.. nope. He comes to me says this is let's shake on it it's been a good run I shake and say thank you he said is this really it I say yes. Mistake. Let the choking begin grabbing me by my neck slamming me on our bed elbowing me in the back of the head. How does every time it somehow gets worse.. punching me everywhere choking kicking me everywhere kneeling on my face with his knees stuffing shit inside my mouth while I choke slapping me crazy while I just have to lie there and take it hitting back will always make it worse worse worse. Spitting in my face making me feel it. Grand finale a full chokehold me lifted in the air like a child you're happy to see I could feel my neck cracking I was passing out he pulled so hard I could've been gone just one more moment one more second why does this part me cry..nothing new nothing new and that still wasn't the end just the part that still holds me. I can't sleep eat or think. I'm back at work since my face isn't swollen anymore. No one in this world but God knows but who could I tell that wouldn't look at me in disgust.

"Please call the domestic violence hotline. This is not your fault. NOT. YOUR. FAULT.

Please get help to leave and get somewhere safe. Call the hotline, a women's shelter, the police, somebody. Nobody is going to be aiming disgust your way unless it's the guy who beats you. Any horror or disgust will be with *him* in mind, not you. I would bet that 99.9% of the people in your life would be on your side and help you get safe and start over. Don't hide it anymore. Get safe, and tell your story. Get an order of protection against your guy, and press charges. There are people available who will walk you through the process."

Please don't let this continue.  Getting out feels hard (it is hard, i am on day 11 of no contact) but he *will* eventually kill you.  He got lucky in that he didn't accidentally kill you this time, but you know that he knows that he could have and he simply does not care.  Mine described how he wanted to choke me unconscious but he was worried i might accidentally die and he'd go to jail or I'd lose my bladder and he'd have to clean it up (not that he would have...), he gave zero f's about what my death or injury would do to me, or my kid (who heard the threat).  This guy doesn't care if you die, clearly YOU care if you die, and you need to do right for yourself.  This last time the fact that mine was shoving me around until I stumbled and fell while punching me in the head and chest this time instead of just the arms or ass (again, kid within earshot) made it clear ot me that he could have given a shit less if he accidentally hurt or killed me.  THAT part hurts.  Your man is capable of controlling his anger, he is doing this because he feels small inside and you can't fix that.  If you feel you can't leave yet then at least call a DV hotline, check out the myplan app, or something similar.  Coming to Reddit was one of the best things I could have done for myself, too, i realized it was all textbook and nothing special, and i had to go.  You can do this! He doesn't deserve you.

"Honey let me tell you one thing if anybody looks at you in disgust it is not directed towards you it is directed towards him. People are disgusted that any human being could do such a thing to another. I know the feeling it’s common that it feels like there judging you but I promise you they’re not. They may say some things that aren’t exactly appropriate or accurate but it’s out of shock. I’d say see your doctor and be honest, call the national domestic hotline and  the police. They will all help. 
Take lots of pictures of yourself and each bruise or mark, write down the events as you can remember them best going back as far as you would like, have a record of all the days you’ve missed work because of the abuse and your medical reports. Those things will help give you credibility in your story.courts love a paper trail. While you’re in his presence, play nice. 
It’s important to keep him calm so do the things he likes, make his favorite foods and let him be right. You need to form a plan.


My abuse was equal to yours , I escaped with nothing but a sliver of life left. I knew he was going out of town for a whole day so the weekend before I played nice. I was obedient and soft and eager to please his whims. He thought that the beating he had just given me actually worked and I was “back to the way I used to be “ yes it was disgusting but I had a son living with me and he had a daughter that was with us part time so I need to keep them safe. 
I had arranged  a place to go with somebody from my church, she  hid me in an abandoned apartment in the worst part of St. Louis. It was a place he never look for me. 
Eventually he found me and 
What I did next is what I should’ve done the first moment. There were 4 domestic violence shelters within a two hour radius and I called every one of them every 4hours until one of them had a spot for me. It completely changed my life. They aren’t much fun and there’s some rules that are there to protect you But I was able to find a lawyer that represented me for free, Housing for two years after the shelter edge a super minimum cost which they ended up giving me at the end of it to use towards my first apartment of freedom.

I fully regret not calling the police. He was an RN with a daughter from his first marriage and I have been told that if there was a police report a violence, he would lose his career. I realizeD that he made the choice to do what he did and he couldn’t found control himself because he didn’t do it at work or when he wanted to impress people.

Now I’m a domestic violence coach. I have seen hundreds of women in your position.
I’ve been researching for eight years and what I really need you to know is that once they choke you, they strangle you it turns into an addiction. They start playing with life and death and most of the time they find that edge and take a woman’s life. And the victim starts to welcome death at that point. I know I started to want him to kill me.

You need to report him and the shelter will help you do that. Take lots of pictures. But most of all you have to leave. He is a sociopath/psychopath not just a Narcissist or abusive, he’s deeply disturbed. He can’t get Tt while he’s in prison. What he did was attempted murder. Also I want you to know that there is a program called safe at home. If you live in the states it’s run by the Secretary of State and it’s an address protection program. They will help you hide your address with a PO Box. It’s how I finally got free because mine continued to stalk me

Please google the national domestic abuse hotline and they will refer you to wear to find your local help. It will take family friends, coworkers time to adjust to the reality and they might feel very sad and guilty that they didn’t see it sooner and prevent it . Some people choose to take the side of the abuser because they simply cannot wrap their heads around the possibility he could be that evil. Try not to worry about them

I learned not to trauma dump on the average person because it’s more than they can handle but I’ve had a trauma therapist since day one. Someone who helps me even to this day with my PTSD, triggers and coping mechanisms. 
I promise you will heal from this and when you leave him it might be complicated but it will be better. You will wake up and be sad about the past and miss him but you will know that today will be a day without violence. 

This is all just the beginning and people will help you deal with each step. But you’re a warrior and you are in control.

"Congratulations on being free! Congratulations on day 11! Celebrate every single day that you’ve made the choice you did. You’re amazing. Keep going and make a plan ahead of time of who you can call for a peptalk or what you can do so that you don’t break the no contact. It’s a bummer to start all over again but it happens to all of us.

If I can give a suggestion of what I did, I created an email and whenever I wanted to talk to him I would write an email to that address. Of course he was never going to see it but it was incredibly therapeutic and I got the things out that I needed to . One day I realized that he would never be the man that he pretended to be in the beginning and people tell us that we have to face the fact that they’re two different men so I decided to write a eulogy and metaphorically bury the man I thought I loved. What was left was mentally ill and deranged shell of a person. Now I feel pity for him.

Take your kids and find a trauma therapist to work with all of you. My sons head triggers I didn’t even know about but they haunted them. I escaped 10 years ago and I still see a trauma therapist once a week. I think I will forever because of the severity and length of my abuse.

As someone who has experienced physical abuse, from a partner i was in a relationship with for only three months, i really struggle with how much i let this trauma effect me. Obviously i experienced something tumultuous, but since i was only in this relationship for a short amount of time i struggle with truly feeling the extent of my trauma. I often feel i am being dramatic, or not dramatic enough and have not been able to tell most of my friends what i experienced. Since this event occurred, the man i was in a relationship with has told me he wishes he had killed me when he used violence upon me. Obviously this is something very upsetting to hear, but i don’t even think i had much of an emotional connection with this man so i don’t know how to feel about this? How does one live with a trauma when they can’t even decide how they feel about it? Does anyone else struggle with this?

"First I think you’re trying to my hard to label and identify. Keeping it very simple, the jerk put his hands on you and made you afraid for your life. He took away your sense of safety. That’s all you need to know. The length of time you were with them doesn’t matter or the bond you felt with him does not matter. You were abused. It would do you good to tell people what he did and simply say it’s so confusing. I was in too violent marriages one was 14 years and the other one was eight. So it was repeated abuse over all that time and most of the time I still couldn’t wrap my head around what it happened or why. 

Our brains are wired to think the way theirs are and so most women go and talk to a trauma therapist for a while.  What you’re going to want to do is to understand the WHY of things. It’s easier for us to blame ourselves and feel like we attracted this person or we caused them to be that angry and they hurt us.


The truth is that they were attracted to you because you are strong, empathetic, most likely and natural caregiver and you gave them a chance with an open mind. 

There’s a great book called why does he do that by Lundy Bancroft. That will give you tons of answers but if you do look for a therapist look for one that specializes in PTSD and trauma therapy.

It is a serious thing and you are not being dramatic.  It is surprising to me that he acted violently so soon in the relationship because normally they groom you for a while.
After my experience with abusers I recently began to date again and I’ve been in a relationship with a man for three months myself. I’m about to end things because he is showing the red flags and signs that he is a narcissist and I mean the mental illness kind because of other Behaviors. He’s begun controlling me but he hasn’t show me any indication that need hit me but I’m not taking a chance because I don’t even deserve the controlling part.
Take all threats seriously, stay as far away from him as you can. No contact. I think because He hadn’t done all the prep work to get you trauma bonded you didn’t develop feelings but you would’ve if you stayed. Congratulations on leaving 💜 you will heal well."

Thank you so much for this thoughtful response. I do have a counselor and I’ve had one for several years and honestly what really frustrates me is that i now have ptsd from some jerk i barley dated.

You are incredibly welcome. We have to watch out for each other. I’m glad you have a counselor. I think all of us should with this crazy world but with all my trauma experience I can tell you that you can overcome this and he won’t haunt you for the rest of your life. You will learn coping strategies that will block the thought of him the minute it enters your head. You are 100% right he doesn’t deserve one scrap of space in your head. He is not worth it. There will come a day where are you forget to think about it all of a sudden and you will feel free. There is a fact that survivors need to remember. Every seven years every single cell in your body is brand new. Our skin completely renews every three months so very shortly he will not have touched a single spot on your skin and Along The 7years you will have a body he doesn’t even know. That is giving me a lot of comfort not all men are like him but being a Survivor we have to be a lot more picky about who we trust in who we go out with. We are fragile but we don’t want to re-wound.

"It’s less an act of violence, although you can definitely have something violently snatched from you, as it is mean, angry and controlling. Controlling behavior is often a step before abuse. Abuse is mainly about control over the other person, but in the worst cases having power and unrelenting control over someone. 

I’m not sure what work wasn’t done, but I guess say, if it is housework, how much did he do? Is this a case of everything has to be a certain way and finished by the time he gets home to HIS house after work? Because then yes, that’s building into abuse and control. 

If you were both working on a project together and you hadn’t finished your part, and he needed you to before he could finish his? Maybe anger or irritation would be somewhat more understandable, but snatching away your phone and keeping it from you until he gets what he wants? That’s still controlling, and in general it sounds mean spirited. Still not a good sign, definitely a red flag.

I hope your husband can take communication well and that you can step up and tell him you won’t tolerate that kind of behavior. You’re not his kid, he’s not your parent or your lord and master. He’s supposed to be your partner, and snatching away an important personal item that has valuable data on it, as well as your means of communication to anyone else other than him, is too far. 

If he doesn’t respond well to that, and can’t work toward recognizing that behavior is at the very least controlling and he should stop: you know that maybe things aren’t going so well and might get worse. If that’s the case, I would continue to evaluate things and start planning an exit strategy because if he can’t take criticism and attempt to change his bad learned behavior it will likely just get worse from there."

"Massive red flag, this will only get worse.  Trust me I've been there twice.  It starts small and gets bigger, not that this is small.  

You didn't do housework and were chatting on the phone. So what? You are allowed to not do something, sure pull your weight, but it's not just down to you and even if you did nothing doesn't mean someone can snatch something off you, let alone shout with it.   By the way, if you want to talk on the phone, you can, nothing wrong with that.  But by taking the phone and acting like it got in the way of something he needs you to do is a slippery slope to isolation.  Goodness knows what the other person on the phone thought.  

This is no way for a grown person to treat their partner, whom they should love and support. Of you didn't do the housework so what.  

Make some plans, keep a separate account, squirrel away odd things and if it continues, leave.   Don't waste years like I did, feeling sorry, thinking it was true when he said if he didn't care and love me so much he wouldn't get so upset.   It's manipulation.

My ex wanted his house to look like something out of a magazine. He was a neat freak but didn’t do the work himself. I am disabled and so it’s not easy for me and I’m OK with the house looking like it’s lived in. They caused a lot of problems in our relationship including him complaining to family members
The thing that always upset me was he didn’t like it that much why didn’t he help to get things in order. Why didn’t he care enough to see that I was overwhelmed and I was using my phone as a distraction.
My husband was very abusive and it started with things like that. You’re not a child and he can’t ground you or punish you. I would consider that an escalation and abusive. If he has anger management issues I would give him the choice of getting help, which would include anger management, or you’re done

Find yourself a trauma therapist so she can help you sort what’s abusive and what just mean.  It also wouldn’t hurt to define why or if you have an objection to housecleaning. I know I was depressed over the relationship and so I just had zero motivation. Other times I just didn’t want to perform under his schedule. If it wasn’t important like people coming to the house for dinner in an hour then it could wait. 
Even if there was people coming to the house he definitely overreacted and had no right to treat you like a child.

"Forget red flags, this is already an act of violence. This is especially serious because he chose to take your phone which is your lifeline to the outside world. It is how you contact your friends and family and by taking it away from you he effectively took control of your ability to speak.

My loved one smokes and if I “confiscated” her vape pen because I want her to quit that would be abusive. Even though it would be “for her own good” and even though taking away the vape would not restrict her autonomy except that she would not be able to smoke. The fact that she would not be able to do something she had every right to do because her partner did not want her to have the ability to choose would be abuse. It would be very serious.

For someone to think that they are entitled to that kind of control over their partner there has to be a lot already going wrong in how they see themselves in relation to you.

I study intimate partner violence and I am a survivor. What you experienced falls under psychological aggression, specifically coercive control. That is intimate partner violence. My therapist would advise that you need to tell him snatching your phone is not right. You may not be able to talk to him in the middle of the argument. But it is important for you to revisit this topic and let him know that behavior was wrong. This is setting a boundary. Don’t let him violate you.

"Together 15y and married almost 5 of those years. There's elementary aged kids, a house, pets....and a mom who has been lining her ducks for MONTHS on end. 

 I think the final straw was hearing that my husband and inlaws were discussing me in front of the kids. Playing the telephone game with young children is less than ideal but my youngest randomly felt obligated to let me know that the three adults in the room had some things to say about me at the fourth of July gathering that I went to for the sake of my husband and kids. The last dv episode sent me into a serious depression. I really didn't want to go and fake that smile. Y'all get it.  But I went...for my kids and I am soooo upset that I didn't insist upon staying home. He knew I was depressed. He knew I was doing that for them. I dropped them off at the in-laws and darted to McDonald's. While I was gone it seems  there was some extra  special time taken to say some severe sentences. While I can't possibly know the whole story, there was enough flooding from my kids' mouths that when paired with the family dynamic history, the shoe couldn't not fit.

 Unbeknownst to me,( til yesterday afternoon) my husband evidently  is vehemently against my having a loan with my name on it. The loan is to pay for estate matters. The estate is my deceased father's. Yeah.. it's MY DAD and MY HEIRSHIP. That's right folks..... Not his place. I tried to let it go to the county to spare myself the mental load while I focused on mental health and surviving motherhood. He ignored my emotional boundaries ( there was a whole conversation about letting go) with it and called the estate lawyer behind my back. He's been making so many plans for that property because he sees it as a hobby land full of space to target practice. That place is filled to the brim and spilling over with traumatic history. I came from some super bad shit (and am writing an autobiography). He knows that. This is no secret. We've been together 15years. Because the loan is  thru one of his personal connections he feels like it should be he who takes out the loan. I don't need legal advice or hints. I have a lawyer. If you know about estate stuff, you know. Not going to happen. No thx. 

   Anyways. Last week I was psychologically abused and ended up triggered. I have PTSD and have had that condition since I was six. Well after my mind had decided it had witnessed enough I kind of shut down and idk... The best way to describe it is that my entire attention span absolutely flatlined. I essentially immediately spiralled into depression. I'm on meds. I'm in therapy. Nothing more could have possibly helped my brain in that moment....
That detail about meds only helping so much in that moment bothered me for the laaaaast time. I knew that I was one more occurrence away from where I am sitting now; a separated wife. And that occurrence arrived randomly and when I least expected it and was delivered in the most painful possible way; through the mouths of my children. I don't pry. I don't ask. I know my in-laws suck. After all I cut them off many years ago due to the boundary stomping. My weasel of a partner never stopped having contact during the cutoff and even was sending them pictures of the kids. That picture business I only discovered recently when I perused his hard drives and also found images of my best friend in his porn file. I should mention that the kid photos came off his mom's laptop. He backed everything she had on the laptop onto two separate hard drives. The time stamps when I saw them absolutely infuriated me. The damn trickle truths really blow when you find out it's all they are... Anyways I digress... my besty  and stbx are not a thing. Those images were not sent to him. Some of them were pulled from social media and others were pulled from one of my old backups. He literally organized her photos out separately from mine. If you were to open the xxx folder, you'd see her stuff and then mine tucked away in another folder. She was a click before me. Whhhhhhat the ever loving..... She was absolutely disgusted. I sent her images and videos of what I found. She was horrified.  This was last fall when I made that disturbing discovery. Her and I were night dancers back in the day and so when she got implants she sent me a photo of them after the swelling went down. Stbx had that photo saved. This woman is one of my three very best friends. I didn't meet her through my husband and no, before you ask, I didn't meet my husband at a strip club lol. He always hated that I was a dancer. I blazed my own trail despite his jealous nature.

   Back to the inlaw cut off. . . That happened in 2014. He got caught secretly talking to his mom. He had a throwaway number...the whole bit. I honestly didn't expect to see him texting a contact titled mom. I wasn't even looking on purpose. I just saw it. He didn't hear me coming into the room. That was in 2016. I was absolutely disgusted and y'all would be too if you experienced what I did when my first born was brand new. I tried to say goodbye to enmeshment and covert narcissism but I guess I had it coming when I reintroduced the idea of contact. Four years. I cut them off for four years. When I knew my kids were old enough to articulate themselves and say the word no...and when I thought my husband had put in at least some work...only then did I consider contact. Joke was on me. He lived a total lie. The proper term is enmeshment but what that also is called in a dysfunctional family system is emotional incest. So ... I was never put first in any real way. Over the years the DV worsened as it typically does. I was in a good place when I chose to take a chance on my in-laws. I sincerely regret with my whole heart having done that.

 I know their dad seriously needs therapy. I also know he won't go to therapy. I did not expect that he would throw THAT subject matter out there in front of the kids....at a family function...on a holiday.. I mean... It's like it didn't even occur to the three of them that the kids have totally perfect hearing I guess. My daughter told me she had a sad secret. After she started to spill the beans, my son chimed in without hesitation. They basically corroborated each other's recollection of events. Financial abuse has been a problem in my life and now he's brought it to their full attention. They can't possibly know what a functional financial situation looks like or is supposed to look like not just because our marriage blows major cobwebs but also because they are under the age of 10. And he spoke that way to his parents who are on his side. ...IN FRONT OF THEM. There's been a lot of terrible abuse experiences over here. That was my final straw. I had his clothes on the curb, all dv resources ready, my phone was charged, all important documents had been gathered ( for MONTHS), and within 45 minutes time after my daughter ratted the three of them out, I notified my husband(who was still at work) his parents, my best friend who lives close thank fuck, and the director of a dv shelter a county away that tonight is THE NIGHT. Best friend has a boatload of law enforcement connections and her Mom is a dispatcher. Both her and her husband were going to show up if they hadn't received confirmation of his exit or mine...and they were probably going to show up with law enforcement. So.... Was I terrified? Absolutely. He's a second amendment type of human. I'm isolated but in a metro area so not all hope is lost. One family car. I don't have a job and not because I don't want one. Trapped. 

Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned. That fury is multiplied to the nth degree when that scorned woman has young children. I was Darvo'd for the laaaaast time. I was shit on by my in-laws in that manner for the last time...as a married woman at least. 

It's hard. 

A few  thoughts I'd like to share here for women at this very point in their journey-  It's important to recognize when you're being treated like an exwife so you can shuffle on into that title accordingly as soon as humanly possible. Additionally, if abusers abused all the time, they'd have no one left to abuse. 

Last night sucked. Today sucked. I'm not withholding kiddo access. That's not the path I'm on. The kids spent time with him earlier and he's already accepted the situation to the extent that he discussed with the kids the potential for overnights whether it's the hotel he's checked into or his parents house. I'm not super opposed to it but I will not be sending them to my in-laws for a hot minute til the kids have had a few therapy sessions under their belts. My son's therapist is the absolute best. He told me what to say and do and what not to say and do for the time being. Basically how to not make it worse for the kids'mental health. I have no one but a few close friends and only one of them lives in close proximity and she has her own family and a full plate. I have leaned on the mental health system, social services and the school district as much as possible throughout all of this. 

Go me, right? 

Still super hurts. Grief is grief.

But I did it. 

I 
Did
It

And I did it all for my kids.

I am doing this for them so that one day if ever they encounter such a situation, they will know that it's okay to let go of something unhealthy and they will know how to act on letting go. I never wanted to be separated and I still am struggling with the word divorce. I also never wanted to be abused ever again either. I'm certainly won't be an abused wife anymore.

"I was in the bathroom singing and my brother barged in demanding I stop singing, so I sang more quiet, thinking he wouldn't be able to hear me through the wall. But he did. He took my phone and disconnected our home phone so I couldn't call the police.

He then told me: ""I am a person who is very close to murdering you in cold blood, just do what I say.""

Next he told me: ""Always walk around knowing I could bash in your skull at any point""

My question is this: He's my brother, is this even classified as domestic violence? My next question is: what are my options here? It would kill my mother if he had to go to court again, I can't do that to her. But I'm just really scared of him. So what do I do? I want him to stop telling me he'll hurt or kill me. This isn't the first time he's said something like this and he has also already hurt me in the past, but it's been a few years. So, is this DV and if yes, what do I do?

Yes, domestic violence can also be familial violence. Given his threats, I would take it seriously and report it. It also seems like this is not his first rodeo, so talk to the authorities and also get a restraining order if possible. It would be even more unfortunate that something happens to you at the cost of him. Normal and decent people don't get triggered over some singing. Even if it is at a low volume.

"It has been almost 8 years since I left. I am doing amazing! I have a whole new life, got my masters degree, I am 100% independent and have a great job. I am doing better than he ever was. 

But I am afraid to delete his number out of my phone. I have his contact information blocked and I know I can block a number without it being saved in my phone but I can’t do it. 

I am going to have to talk to my therapist about it…even though talking about this part of my life is so painful for me. I have done so well with blocking it out of my mind. I don’t want anything to do with him or those memories. I can’t let any part of this effect me.

It has been nearly 3 years since I left a dv relationship and I still have nightmares of him finding me. They’re still pretty frequent and I thought they would have stopped by now, when did they stop/ slow down for everyone else?

"It has been 7 years for me, and sorry to say that mine haven't gone yet.   They were never constant, but have always tended to come in groups, especially when I'm really stressed about something (even if not related to him--I think my mind still hears him telling me how I can't do it/cope/etc, even when I'm not conscious of that).    

&#x200B;

Mine come in waves, like three times in a week, or many, many times for a month, then nothing for a while.

&#x200B;

I still have breakdowns, especially late at night, but those have lessened a LOT since I had PTSD therapy  (just recently).   

&#x200B;

I've also found that when I hear, smell, taste something that reminds me of him, the flooding memories come back and I'm going to have nightmares again unless I can process it all and talk through it with someone, which helps.   

&#x200B;

Luckily, I've moved far from any area we've every lived together, so those sensory issues don't come up as often.   Travelling home to visit family (where we met and lived for a long time) brings back a lot.

&#x200B;

If you haven't had counselling or therapy, I highly recommend it.   I was sure it wouldn't make any difference, as it never did in the past, but 12 sessions had a huge impact on me.  I plan to continue, but don't want ongoing therapy forever, so will have ""top up"" months each year to work my way through things at the pace I can manage.

&#x200B;

A lot of things can affect how long it will take you to recover:   the level of abuse, length of relationship, your own personality, how much impact he still has in your life--there's just no one time period for any one person to expect, we are all so different.

"My best friend has a kid with someone who honestly has no empathy for her or anybody else for that matter. He constantly belittles her, demands things, is physically abusive but laughs it off and says he's play fighting or joking around. Randomly slaps her or punches her, destroys their house, is physically and verbally abusive to their dog, throws his daughters toys, stroller, etc around until they break and then has more angry outbursts over them being broken.. and most recently.. 

Joked and said he wouldn't care if his disabled 2 year old daughter was dead. He does all this with either a devilish grin on his face and absolutely no remorse and lots of gaslighting.. or a blank stare followed by laughter and acting like it isn't a big deal.

Sociopathy & psychopathy are pop culture terms, not an actual diagnosis. So no official ruling of what sociopathy “is” and “isn’t”. The diagnosis is now known as Antisocial Personality Disorder (ASPD). You can look up ASPD in the DSM if you are curious of the diagnostic criteria for somebody to have this disorder. But only a doctor can diagnose it. Not that it matters whether he fits a diagnosis or not - regardless, his behaviour is abusive and the low empathy is a good reason to fear for their safety. Normal healthy people do not find those type of jokes funny, when he grins or laughs when he says it that shows he is enjoying the fear and discomfort it is causing her. Sounds like your friend does not realise it’s unsafe because her sense of normal was warped by her upbringing - perhaps speaking with a DV counsellor or hotline about her relationship can help her learn more about what’s normal vs what’s abuse.	toasterpoodle92	reply	na	na	na	0.999370276927948	no	no	no	na	domesticviolence	failed

"I just left a relationship where my ex put his hands on me. For some reason I’m not upset and I don’t have anger or rage. Has anyone else experienced this?
I left the first time and I have thought of going back, I now know that isn’t the right decision. I kind of felt like he was drunk and it wasn’t full force. I felt like he had been so frustrated that violence was his only option and even though his emotions got the best of him, he didn’t fight me like a man (I’m a woman) because he was only trying to scare me. I do know that that anger will eventually turn into him losing complete control and possibly killing me.

"Honestly I didn’t experience real anger until 1.5 years after. And that was short-lived. I cut off my capacity to feel that in our relationship (along with a lot of other feelings, including basic desire to eat, pain, and so forth. It’s weird how abuse erodes your senses. It’s a survival thing). That said, anger manifests in different ways. For the longest time, it’s been internalized for me— shame, self-criticism, his voice in my head. 

But when you do feel anger, it opens you up to all the feelings you’d been suppressing. And that’s a good thing. It’s painful, but good, because now you are externalizing and recognizing that he was responsible for his behavior.

This is my first time posting in this Reddit community. This is going to be a long post. I have a situation that I would like to hear people’s opinions and perspectives about. My friend (24f) and I have known each other since we were children. It’s been about 5 years now that she’s been in a toxic and abusive relationship with her boyfriend. They have a son together. She got pregnant at 18 and ever since then, he has been the sole reason she’s been depressed, and suicidal, and is constantly manipulating her. Just yesterday, I found out he had punched her in the face and she now has a swollen black eye. This was in a public park in broad daylight with other people around to witness it. Her other friends intervened and managed to get her away from him. After that, she told me she still talks to him and picks him up from his job. She drinks nearly every day because to her it “numbs the pain.” She also got in a car accident while she is under the influence. Thankfully no one was hurt but every decision she is making is completely wrong. She says she knows that her bf is a piece of shit but she still loves him. She’s saying all this to me while crying and barely able to stand. I’ve pleaded and begged her for years to get away from him and cut off contact but she won’t. She won’t listen to me, her grandparents, her friends, her father, anyone. I’ve told her that if she stays it’s only a matter of time until he kills her. If he can easily assault her in public with strangers watching, god knows what else he’s capable of. He’s not afraid and he has nothing to lose. Yet, she still picked him up from work last night after she dropped me off at my house. Today, I’m going to go see her and tell her I no longer want to be around her, her family, or anything that has to do with her. I can’t take it. I can’t take seeing her be abused and the pain of not being able to convince her to leave. She says she loves him and still wants him in her life. I don’t want to be around when he eventually does something so bad that it’ll be irreversible. The pain and mental anguish this has caused me and others around her is too much to bear. I know there’s no one solution to these issues but I still need to know, what should I do?

If you’re a fan of direct action might be worth getting together with her family and having her living away from abuser and pushing her into taking appropriate action (police report, restraining order, establishing custody, not contacting abuser, mental health treatment, whatever else). A lot of families of homicide victims claim they wish they’d done something/more. Otherwise if her autonomy is the biggest deal cutting her off for your mental health like you’ve mentioned is fair.

I have been with him for 3 years now. We have a 6 month old daughter and he stepped up as a step father roll for my 2 older children (7&5). My 5 year old really believes that man is his dad because he’s been there since a little after his first birthday. I have endured so much from this man in such a short time I can’t wrap my head around it. Everything used to be fine it was never violent. We argued and that was it. Recently his mom had passed ( a year ago ) and they didn’t have a good connection at all. I believe he has bad mother issues. He got extremely angry and violent with me. I attempted to leave in March and got back with him a few weeks later. He promised he would change he “ misses his family “ “ he won’t ever do it again “ . I took him back because I truly love him. Anyways fast forward to May and he was already being abusive again. I thought if I just left it alone and let him go thru his emotions he would be fine. A few days before my 5 year olds birthday we got into an argument he had hit me and I had a metal cup in my hand, I had pushed his face away with the cup I did not hit him, he grabbed the cup from me threw me on the ground and began to punch me in the back of the head and then he threw the cup at the back of my head causing it to start bleeding, I was freaking out and he just told me it was all my fault. Then on the day of my 5 year olds birthday we had gotten into a small argument that ended up with me on the bathroom floor with a black eye. I immediately covered it and left the house with the kids. I stayed at a family members house for the whole day nobody noticed it. I would go home at night and things would get bad because I would reject his advances, he would try to lay with me and rub up on me. I didn’t want any of that I just wanted the man who I fell in love with back. I left the next morning with my children to go to my family’s again and returned that night again; that night we had gotten into a fight in front of the kids where he had me pinned on my bed and was hitting me with this probably 3 foot tall fan that sits by our bed. I have bruises all over my legs. That was enough. I packed clothes for over night for me and the kids and was trying to leave. The man who once treated my oldest kids like they were his own was now taking it out on my kids. He was telling my oldest he had to find clothes in the dark, telling my youngest it’s my fault that we can’t be a happy family,etc. while I was packing he was telling me I had 5 mins to get out ( mind you the house is in my name, I carried the work for most the relationship ). I left to my family’s house and asked them to call the cops. I couldn’t do it myself. That was on July 3rd around 11:45pm. The cops came to take pictures of my eye and my statement. They went and arrested him around 1:30am. I felt so sad for him why? How come I can love someone who is so evil. There’s so much more I could put, this was just the most recent occurrence..

why do we? love our abusers?  and why the guilt?  good question.  if we only knew the answer to those questions.   then we would know, but i doubt if it would be any different.  anyway, we do know that men and women are hardwired to be together.  but then, now we need to deal with our guilt.  first, you gave him some of your precious time and love.  but you don't owe him any more of it.  and you gave him a place to stay.  you made a home for him.  do you believe in karma?  well if you do, it sounds like your karma with him is done, and you can move on.  no need for guilt, you lived the chapter and the chapter is finished.  you have have important chapters left  in this book and no time to waste.  but if you own the house, then the law can help you take possession of it.  I think the local domestic violence shelter can guide you.  stay safe and thank you for posting.	Independent-News8141	reply	na	na	na	0.9986542463302612	no	no	no	na	domesticviolence	failed
"It's not your fault! That is how thr cycle goes. They desperately want connection so they pretend and cover up their abusive nature until they feel they have enough control to do it and for to to still stay. The death of his mother has also probably awoken some negative emotions that possibly he doesn't know how to face so it comes out in anger. The guilt can also come from how they react and gaslight us after abuse. 

No one should be feeling guilty except for him. You have done nothing wrong! You are protecting yourself and your children. You can't keep living how you were, your children notice everything and it will give them life long trauma. 

You are so strong and you are doing all the right things! You don't deserve to feel guilty at all. Keep pushing through and over time the guilt will fade."	Independent-News8141	reply	na	na	na	0.9986542463302612	no	strong	no	na	domesticviolence	failed
"There was a study with pigeons that I read about: they trained pigeons to push a lever and food would come out. Once the pigeon learned that, they started making it work to release food only some of the time that the lever was pushed. The pigeon would try to push the lever even when food no longer would come out. The pigeon would try until it collapsed in exhaustion.
This is what abusers do. They love bomb you at the beginning and you feel great. Then they start withholding the love intermittently. They get you trying to figure out how to get the love back. Maybe he had a bad day/childhood/illness. This can't be the real him. Etcetera. Then they throw a little love in the mix with the grumpiness and anger. 
It's so confusing and exhausting.
What helped me was to realize that the angry/bitter/revengeful side was who he really was and Prince Charming was just an act he used to get what he wanted.

"Of all the things that my ex has put me through, he will be facing a jury for 2 misdemeanor charges, and 2 felony charges. All related to breaking and entering, stalking, illegally using a tracking device.

Part of me is elated, because I’m glad he is being held accountable for some of the things he’s done. Another part of me wishes that he would also be held accountable for all the physical, mental, and financial abuse he put me through. 

So, the state of Illinois is pressing charges on my behalf. I’m wondering, could me going to the trial help sway the jury?

I would ask the victims advocate first. They may need to call you as a witness and you want to be untainted from other testimony.	funfettiready	reply	na	na	na	0.989193856716156	no	no	no	na	domesticviolence	failed
"The only reason you need to justify going is wanting to go. It's a good idea to go with a support system. 

In terms of your presence potentially swaying the jury, especially in the context of breaking and entering, stalking, tracking devices, etc. there's nothing to really substantiate that idea and in fact an argument can be made that your presence in court might make the jury feel or think that you aren't actually scared of him or in danger because of your ""willingness"" to be around him when not subpoenaed. Especially if you look at him, make eye contact, etc. 

I understand that that is not at all the case but in terms of ""optics"" and jury influence that's something to be mindful of. They won't necessarily know you are the complainant but if there isn't anyone else in court (since jury trials aren't open to the public) and you're surrounded by multiple people providing clear support it might be obvious. Others might view you being there as an act of bravery, but since they are tasked with determining whether the things he is being charged with did or didn't happen your presence could have unintended consequences that may lean in your favour or his. 

So your decision-making regarding going should not take into consideration its impact on the jury because that is simply out of your realm of control. Go if you want to and if you feel that it will empower you. Just know that you most likely will find it distressing, especially if you have to sit through lies being told about incidents and your character and if the jury finds him not guilty. 

If you're to be called on as a witness you would have already been subpoenaed by now unless court isn't for a long time and they've yet to deliver it to you, so that's another thing not to worry about in terms of impacting your decision on attending the trial."	funfettiready	reply	na	na	na	0.989193856716156	no	no	no	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.

"My abuser whom I have had a no contact order with for 3 years broke into my house a couple days ago. This isn’t the first time and it probably won’t be the last. To be honest I rarely report anything he does and yeah that’s not really the point of this post. 

The point is that I reported it this time! And nothing has been done except they called him and talked to him. The officer called me today and said they would have a detective reach out to me and help me make a safety plan! A safety plan! That’s supposed to protect me and my child from stalking and controlling behaviors. I’m not sure if there will be further actions considering he’s on misdemeanor probation from beating up me and my 6 month old baby at the time from 3 years ago. 

I’m just really upset because this feels like the whole reason I never report what he does in the first place. I feel like they are victim blaming me in a way.

Husband has doesn’t care about how I feel about anything. He’s always right and flips everything to me. He’s a sneaky alcoholic who’s in denial even though his medical problems are all alcohol related. I make him depressed and his alcoholism is my fault. All I try to do is have conversations in calm non accusatory tones and now he is completely shut down. I have to get stuff off my chest about what’s bothering me and he can’t even have a constructive discussion without it ending in him threatening to kill himself. I’m at a complete loss for what to do and how to approach him. All the decisions are made by him and when I give my input he won’t listen and shuts me down. There are many things around the house that need repair and he refuses to do them and if I mention hiring someone to help he insists on doing it but never does. For example roof leaks, hasn’t mowed the lawn in years, tub constantly leaks now for 5 years, fence falling down, driveway needs a redo, list goes on. He does work full time and I know he’s overwhelmed by all these things. When I offered to call to hire people to fix these things he says no I’ll do it but never does or it cost money, which we have. He make well over 6 figures a year and by no means are we living beyond our means. I don’t know where all this money is going. I have to ask him to buy tampons and get gas ( he decided to downsize to one vehicle which I’m not comfortable with) and he goes out and buys anything he wants. He also gets angry at me for no reason. He snores heavily and when I ask him to roll over he yells at me, says I’m making it up because he can’t hear himself snore and proceeds to slam his pillows and stump his feet and mumbles under his breath that he wants to put a bullet in me. I’m so sorry for the rant, I’m just so frustrated and don’t know what to do anymore. I can’t just move out as I am disabled and he financially support me (he told me that I wouldn’t have to worry about finances once we were married. I can’t get any disability payments because he said he makes too much money.I know he’ll call the police if I take our only vehicle. He also take week to two weeks off to go up to camp with our only vehicle so I’m stuck. I don’t know what to do or how to even start.

"first off i want to say i’m sorry you’re going through this. i am in an emotionally, sometimes even physically abusive relationship with my boyfriend & i know how draining/painful it can be. i recently started seeing a therapist and she believes my boyfriend may have borderline - i don’t want to diagnose your husband, but some of his behaviors/actions are reminiscent of borderline characteristics. with your husband threatening to kill himself, drinking, deflecting responsibility etc… these are all on par with borderline. it was hard for me at first to comprehend this could be a possibility for my boyfriend because he doesn’t necessarily present traditionally, but after researching and reading up i am beginning to realize this could very well be the case. i’ll attach an article i read about borderline and the abuse cycle that really helped open my eyes. even if your husband does not have full blown borderline, he may have borderline tendencies.. it is always helpful to learn ways to avoid triggering our partners if they truly have BPD or such tendencies. that is one way to lessen the severity. i would suggest you reach out at least one person you trust to tell them what is happening: a friend, family member, colleague, or even a therapist. i was ashamed and embarrassed to have continued to let my boyfriend treat me like this that i avoided telling anyone for a really long time & it ate me alive. i haven’t even told my boyfriend i started therapy, feel free to message me if you need to talk and i wish you the best of luck

Thank you for reading my post. I’m all too familiar with borderline personality disorder as well as bipolar, depression and alcoholism because my mother has all those. I’m getting help with my mental health so I understand my past trauma with my child hood. First of all I got married way to young to have any wisdom about life and living with a partner. My husband use to be the nicest guy, now I’ve realized he is just like my mother. I’ve come to terms with knowing I can’t change anyone or even help them unless they want help. He doesn’t see anything wrong with how he acts. He tells me I knew he has a hard time opening up but he doesn’t even talk to me period. If I ask about his day and what he thinks about topics or even tell him something funny, I get one word and an eye roll. I can be in the middle of saying something and he walks away. I know he doesn’t listen because he’ll talk over me the second I open my mouth. When he does that I’ll say you’re not even listening and maybe I’ll go hang myself ( or something obsurd to see if he is listening) and he keeps talking about him and doesn’t notice what I said. I don’t mean to be rambling but I have no one to talk to that remotely gets it. So thanks for taking time out of your day to read and respond to me.

i completely understand, being in an abusive relationship can bring a loneliness i am all too familiar with. my boyfriend was so charming and exciting when i first met him too, i think that is just the game with people like that… they know what to do you pull you in, and once you get comfortable is when they switch up… it’s really confusing. and it’s hard enduring such maltreatment knowing i shouldn’t, yet it’s hard to leave also. i get interrupted and talked over all the time too, im sorry you have to deal with that. i came to this sub when i didn’t know who else to talk to, i know i already said it but you can message me if you need someone to talk/relate to, no need to thank me!

I’ve been thinking of leaving for the past 15 years. But I hesitate because I don’t work because of a debilitating condition and have been told I don’t qualify for disability. My husband supports me and our five cats. I’m glad we don’t have children but I consider my cats to be my children. I can’t leave them with him because one, they are what’s keeping me going and I can’t live without them, and two, he clueless as to how to take care of them. He can’t tell if they get sick or something is wrong because of his ignorance like I can. I’m home all day with them and very bonded and attached to them. So that kinda where I’m stuck. I have no contact with any family and have no friends. And how am I going to be able to find a place that will take me in yet alone afford them. I would do anything for them and might as well just off myself if I can’t be with them so rehoming is not an option. Most of the time I feel I just need to accept my situation and live with it rather than go through a messy divorce or stressing my babies out. I don’t mean to be a burden to you, thanks so much for responding to me and my mess. From the bottom of my heart, it really means the world to me.

if you don’t want to read, just know last week during a fight he (22m) told me (21f) to shut up, threw his phone, and got in my face during a fight. not at all once, but over the course of the fight. 

today he said i was saying dumb shit (me bringing up my concerns abt our relationship) and got in my face again. he then like 10 minutes later starts hitting himself and saying things like nothing is ever good enough and i always want “more more more more more”. is this okay bc i really don’t even know what to do anymore. at the end of the fight he said he will try to go about my concerns better (said he would try to give me words of affirmation more) but i feel like he’s said it so many times at this point i dont really believe him. im not sure if hitting himself can be considered abusive really but i was also like wtf are you doing? i thought he was punching the bed at first bc that’s what it sounded like but when i asked why hit the bed he said he was hitting himself. any help or advice is appreciated and sorry for all the details

edit: i think it’s important to note we are mostly long distance and met online. i have been staying with him for a big portion of the summer and im learning new behaviors like these that are making me question everything and honestly scare me for the future if i stay. i love him so much and he says he would never hit me but there are a lot of red flags and i feel it just keeps escalating and don’t see it stopping.

Happens with my husband of 23 years all the time. He doesn’t care about my feelings and emotional needs. It always ends up with him saying it’s my fault somehow and gaslights me to the point where I question my reality. Never owns up to anything and threatens me by saying he’ll just kill himself along with my precious cats to make me happy. I’ve given up because it always goes the same way with never a solution. He flips everything back to me and makes me feel like I’m the crazy one. Then he eggs me in and baits me to kill him. Well, I’m not that stupid and won’t fall for his tricks. I’m very depressed and all of a sudden now he’s depressed because low and behold I made him depressed and become an alcoholic.

In the interest of caution, without much actual information to go on, if there is more than one person riding with him then I would think there's no reason to expect much of a threat  - though I could understand not wanting to ride alone with this person if they are giving off some sort of vibe.  If there are concerns consider reaching out to some trusted adults to make them aware of your concerns ahead of time, and consider making a voice memo recording of interactions if you cannot avoid the situation.

"Hi there, long time viewer, first time poster. I’m in my second marriage, the first ended due to abuse and I’m coming to terms that this marriage also has abuse components too. I’m working with a therapist on an exit plan, I have my go bag list ready, and I’ve been at my parents for the past week which has provided clarity. We also share a 4 year old son. Here’s some of what I’ve experienced. Below is where I need advice. 

Emotional abuse:
My husband has become more extreme in the past two years. He used marijuana and his use has increased dramatically in the past 6 months. He also hasn’t worked in 4 years, originally to care for our 4 year old, who is now in full time preschool. I have asked close friends who know us both and they have also witnessed this change. I have a friend who is a former law enforcement officer who approached me last week and expressed concerns based on my behavior that I was experiencing DV, but encouraged me to seek out councils of friends since he only knows me. I have since talked to several friends about what I’ve been experiencing at home and they agree with former cop. Some examples are:
Husband insists he is going to “break me” and make me a cleaner person or complying with his “rules” about ensuring dishes are picked up promptly (I. E. No dishes left, instantly take them out to the kitchen)
Several instances where I feel compelled to come down from working (I work from home) in order to panic clean so I can keep peace
One instance where he burst into my office while my door was closed (usually means I’m in a meeting) to rant about banned books and how “they” are making our children read “trans books”
Any issue of cleanliness around the house circles back to me

Financial abuse:
I am a sole income earner and I haven’t been able to figure out why our budget has gotten tighter and tighter. I figured inflation. This weekend I looked into one account that currently he only has access to. He has spent 528 dollars in the past pay period (2 weeks). 220 on marijuana, about 100 on takeout for him and my son, the remainder on PlayStation purchases. 

He has not caused me any physical harm, but I have been afraid he will. 

My therapist is helping me next week come up with an exit plan and a plan for notifying my spouse that I want a divorce, as well as plan for any sort of reaction from that news. 

My question is, do I reach out to a domestic violence organization for help? My ex cop friend feels I need to report him for DV, however I don’t know that this will qualify under our laws (US, Washington state) - obviously still early in the process and have not engaged a lawyer yet. I have parents in the area that are willing to take my son and I in and a friend out of the area where he doesn’t know where they live in case I need that. 

For those that made it down this far, thanks. This is obviously anxiety producing and planning and feeling like I have a plan in place helps me to feel in control."	Affectionate-Push953	post	39.92952445213207	female	White	0.993475615978241	na	na	na	1	domesticviolence	no prediction.
I would reach out to your local domestic abuse advocate and get their advice. Unfortunately, I don’t believe you can file a report unless he physically hurts you. I was not able to file a report with the police until he eventually hit me. (I’m in Iowa)  I think it’s great you’re talking with your therapist for an exit plan! Also, since you’re the sole provider, maybe consult with an attorney so he can’t drain your accounts or continue to spend money on unnecessary things.

Not sure what flair this would fall under but I need to get my kids and I out of this house. My husband is a ticking time bomb and the emotional and mental abuse gets worse every time. My oldest is 4 and tells me she’s scared of her dad when he comes home in a bad mood. I need advice on what to do and how to do it. Please. I don’t want this festering into something worse.	comeondutch	post	41.190295566650505	female	White	0.9987156391143799	na	na	na	7	domesticviolence	no prediction.
For me I documented everything. The next time he had an outburst and assaulted me, I called the police. Got a restraining order. Went to trial and was granted a final restraining order. Got custody of our child too. At the end of the day it’s a piece of paper… but it saved my daughter from having to be around the abusive jerk off.	comeondutch	reply	na	na	na	0.9987156391143799	no	strong	no	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.

Hello, first of all I’m really proud of you for making the decision to leave, it’s such a challenging one and it’s not easy. I would call your local domestic violence hotline, they will be able to help you create a safe plan to leave and will also be able to connect you with DV support groups and/or shelters if you need one in your area.

"document events with dates and times, if you have a phone with a notetaking app it might also have a voice recorder built in, or there are a ton you can download online.  

The best piece of advice I got was from my brother, he said if I was on the fence about leaving or wasnt sure if/when i could leave to  go ahead and make the safety plan anyway.  That way if you have to leave in a hurry (i did) you have everything lined up and ready to go.  This may include having a bag packed or finding some friends that might be willing to put you up for a few days (mine only got sketchy details).  He also pointed out that every women's shelter has a social worker of some kind that could get you in touch with resources (even if you are not trying to stay at the shelter).  Deciding to go is way harder than planning what you would do if you DID go .  

there are some apps online related to domestic abuse, as well, i used one called MyPlan and it is protected with safety features in case they find it on your phone.  It has some solid starter level advice, now that I am out its not as useful but it was valuable at the time."	comeondutch	reply	na	na	na	0.9987156391143799	no	strong	no	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.

Even if you had not fallen, even if you were not hurt - if they did it while they were angry or argumentative then yes, it is definitely abuse.   If this was anything more than a playful and welcome shove  then its a warning sign that there's more to come if you stick around.  Physical abuse starts small and then escalates.

I tried working things out with my ex after I divorced him. After our divorce in 2020 he became abusive. He’s been in and out of jail for 3 years. I kept going back. He promised he would change. I just wanted our family together. I feel stupid for not leaving him right after the divorce. On my birthday, he came to my house and attacked me and my neighbor. I ended up bruises and a concussion and my neighbor ended up in the hospital with 2 staples in his head. Court is coming up. I have weight 240 Beginning of May and now I weigh 206. The stress is eating me alive. He has always been a very involved dad. Now he doesn’t see them. I’m raising 4 kids on my own. I’m angry. I’m very angry. I hurt for me and my kids. I even miss him. Like what is wrong with me?! I feel so alone. I feel so stressed. How do I move on from this?! When do things get better?

"I left my abuser. I kicked him out months ago, after nearly being killed (nearly being killed for like the third time, but the last one was *reeeeeaally* close) but he promised (ughhh, ik) to do alllll the things. I continued to speak to him via msg. He said all the right words--of course he fucking did, I am an idiot.

I had some things that belonged to him and I recently agreed to run them by where he was staying. 

I was not there for 30 seconds before he became hostile, scared me, and then screamed at me as I ran, for ""abandoning him"" like I owed him my presence. He called ME abusive for BEING AFRAID. 

Nothing has changed, nothing WILL change, and I have lost my last deluded spark of hope. I tried to be cool and let him know (once I was safely back to my place of residence) *why* I was afraid and how his reaction to my fear drove me away. Nah. He flipped the script entirely and told me a fantasy story about how I was YELLING AT HIM. Poor, poor him.

This man has *purposefully* endangered my life, again and again. He's thrown me across a room one-handed BY THE THROAT. I'm not about to start yelling at this motherfucker, not EVER, I'd prefer to live, thanks. It was the most obvious gaslighting possible, so obvious that even I could not help *recognizing it.*

He was blocked across all my social platforms but now his number is blocked too. 

And I am not ok. I have a counseling session in a couple days but what do I do til then? I keep texting the crisis lines and they're useless. The DV hot line is worse."	dreamcat000	post	26.769330236606855	female	White	0.9994729161262512	na	na	na	13	domesticviolence	no prediction.
"You’re not stupid, you’re not an idiot. I know you feel in some ways like you went back, but you didn’t truly.

Part of this whole process for each of us is getting used to accepting how these experiences have changed us. You can handle the next few days. You have your own space, you are safe. 

You’re going to make more mistakes, but in one way or another we all go through this. Once you recognize how terrible abuse is, and what it does to your body, you do everything you can to avoid it. More importantly, once you’ve avoided it and found some safety you’re going to have to put feelers out to see what else is safe and what isn’t. Abusers simply can’t be let back in. We all try to see if they’ve changed. 

They don’t.

There’s nothing stupid about finding something out for yourself. He tricked you and he’s never going to view your relationship the way you do. This is not about reaching a person to him, he wants to control a resource. He will snake around however he can to make sure he has it again. You know better now, and you won’t make that mistake with him again. Feel good about that. Even if you found something out the hard way it’s progress.

"I don't have my own space. I am crammed into the sewing room at my parent's house. Their actual guest room is for real people. They blame me.

I had two cats that weren't allowed to come with me because cats are just extra pain in their ass, even though I am used to caring for them alone and this is a giant house where they would never even have to see the cats. I am nothing but a pain in their ass too, and this has been made clear to me since childhood, when I was heavily psych drugged before puberty for conditions I did not have. 

Those medications *damaged me,* but they aren't sorry. They blame me for that as well.

I have spent my entire life trying to be less of a pain. I nearly killed myself getting a bachelor's degree with unaccommodated autism, because they wanted a college educated kid. They didn't even hang my diploma until I got my feelings hurt about it, more than a year after it arrived. 

I got married in a desperate attempt to quit being a pain in their ass. My beloved husband kept trying to twist my head off, so I divorced him. *My dad kept up a friendly acquaintance with my ex husband for years, despite that.* Why not? Dad hit me too when I was a child. I deserve it.

I just want to encourage everyone here I can. There are so many stories and the more I see and read them the more I feel like our culture is failing us. Women aren’t equal to men, and it’s still so obvious regardless of what’s on paper in amendments and the law. This is where that inequality shows itself the worst. Men controlling women and their children , and that cycle of abuse and control dominates people’s lives until they break it. And the people who by their nature will try to break cycles will get abused more, as we see here and in so many cases.

"No one asks to be here. No one chooses their parents. My parents were both basically adult children and did a number on me too. 

I don’t know why I’ve never wanted to pursue suicide. I think mostly it’s because I still experience good things. In the weirdest ways, even in dark moments where people were hurting me (even with the people who were hurting me) I found strength and joy in simple moments and it’s these sort of things that allow me to keep going. Somewhere in me, there’s a voice saying, it would be a shame if this were all for nothing.

I have a number of privileges I try not to take for granted. But I know what it’s like to feel like a disappointment. I know what it’s like to be conditioned to feel like you’re always the problem and unwanted. You might also take comfort from how in so many ways, even if you don’t see it right this moment, you’re breaking the cycle. 

When I went back to my mom last, my bedroom was the futon in the foyer. I spent the rest of that summer depressed, reading, trying to take classes to get back into school. And even when I was about done with school and had my degree, the 2009 recession hit and I had to hold down 4 part time jobs for years. All the while, back and forth in relationships/friendships with abusers.

It was only until I started to believe in, and feel my own worth that things got better. I think you can feel that way too. Your parents failed you. That’s not your fault. Your husband was the wrong person and you may still be working through conditioning from your folks that lead you there.

I don’t know how wise I am, but do your best to take your time, own and care for the space you have, and feel your feelings. I’m so sorry you lost your cats. My dad killed mine after I left the last time. I’m so sorry they’re not even letting you stay in the guest room. 

I think the best thing you can take away from this is that none of this is happening to you necessarily because of anything you did to deserve it. Your parents are abusive, and you tried to find a partner to get the hell away from your parents, they turned out to be abusive.

"So long story short.  15 years ago I left a violent relationship, one which had left me in hospital at times and included mental, emotional, control, physical and sexual abuse.

Fast forward, I spent 15 years casually dating but basically remained single, healed through therapy and thought I was emotionally healthy etc.  I have now married a man who is beautiful inside and out.  Protective and wouldn't harm a hair on me or the kids.  We have experienced differences of opinions but it's always been respectful, calm, never shouting or physical. 

Last night we fell out, bound to happen we have a lot of kids and we disagreed on one of them.  Just talking and we were both getting frustrated with one another, so I got up and went to leave the room.  He asked where I was going and I said downstairs, that I didn't want to continue the conversation I was getting upset.  He jumped up to give me a cuddle and I freaked out. 

I asked him not to touch me and he went to cuddle me again and at that point he said what's wrong, I'm not going to hurt you, and he backed off.  He looked upset (retrospectivly I can see this face) and I moved into the corner of the room.  He came toward me and tried to hold me in a cuddle and I flipped, I held my arms up and started to panic, I started to cry and tbh didn't really see him, although it was him there, I pushed him away and really was in a state kept saying get away, don't touch me.   I then said get away from me again crying and panicked and he got to his knees to show me he didn't mean to be a threat, he stayed still until I calmed down and stopped breathing heavy and panicking.   

When I sat on the bed, he talked to me but was so hurt.  He said he could see my distress and just wanted to hold me safe and let me know I was safe.   I always tell him his arms are the safest place I've ever been.  He really is upset, saying he can't get the look on my face as I looked through him out of his head.  

We talked, I have no idea why this happened.  Never happened in 15 years and why with him, I know he wouldn't hurt me and I've explained I know this and trust him.  

Any ideas or advice please? How do I stop this happening again, how do I understand and how can I help him understand it wasn't his fault?"	LowerBeautiful2806	post	27.119316249374588	female	White	0.9751972556114197	na	na	na	26	domesticviolence	no prediction.
"Most already said it. He shouldn't have kept coming towards you when you said BACK OFF. It's not about his hurt feelings, his wants or needs at that moment but your need of having your BOUNDARIES RESPECTED so you can feel safe. He crossed them. Several times. And made the situation worse by doing so. Hopefully when you sit down with him and tell him that, he can understand and learn to never do this again.
Again this isn't about him and his hurt feelings. He needs to back the eff off when you tell him. It's about you and your need of safety and RESPECT."	LowerBeautiful2806	reply	na	na	na	0.9751972556114197	weak	strong	no	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.
"You told him you needed to go downstairs because you were unable to continue the conversation at that time. Instead of letting you do that, he tried to put his hands on you. You told him not to touch you, but he disregarded your request. He prevented you from leaving the room. 

Instead of backing off, he turned it around and made it seem like he's the one who is hurt, and you are responsible for hurting his feelings. Now you're in the position of trying to make him feel better.

Anyone who has been a victim of abuse would react the exact same way you did. It's important for you to realize you did nothing wrong here. Your reaction was completely normal. If his feelings are hurt, you are not to blame for that.

Abuse victims spend a lot of time trying to make the abuser feel better. We spend a lot of time smashing down our own feelings and needs and boundaries in the hopes that our abusers will stop hurting us. 

I'm not saying your husband is an abuser, but in that moment, he acted enough like an abuser (by blatantly disrespecting your boundaries) that you reacted the way an abuse victim reacts: with fear, panic, shame, guilt.

"I had an especially violent childhood and a violent marriage. If I am upset - I can't be touched. Like not at all. 

In my current life - my family knows they must ask to touch me. Only my children are exempted from this, but they tend to ask. 

This hasn't always been the rule in my house - but as I have opened up and my current husband & I go through trauma therapy - it is the rule now. If I am overwhelmed, upset, or anything like that - he has to ask to touch or give physical comfort. If I say no - he doesn't do it. I will then prepare myself for physical hug or touch and initiate it when I am ready. If my response is I don't know if I am ready for a hug - we can try it, but once I move away, all physical contact is dropped. 

I am heavily triggered by physical contact. My skin will itch, and I won't be able to breathe if someone goes in for a hug without asking. It isn't about them - it is about my body's response to keep me safe. I lived in unsafe environments for decades - so asking me if touch is ok helps a lot. 

It might help if you two tried that type of permission in any type of sensitive or high emotion moment."	LowerBeautiful2806	reply	na	na	na	0.9751972556114197	no	strong	no	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.

"I'll take this one step further. He's crossed a boundary which is never ok. He's pushed you because of his insecurities. He needs to babk the fuck away from you. No means no and stop means stop. When someone goes into retreat from triggers it's well past time for EVERYONE to stop and take a break from each other. There are no blurred lines in healthy relationships. Blurred lines are what perpetrators create and he went there. All men do thinking they're in control of the situation. 

Power and control is ours to define. You are your own separate individual and need to protect clear boundaries without ambiguity.

You're defending his vulnerabilities and he's defending yours. It's ok to fumble in relationships. It's not ok to repeatedly fumble. This is not a new norm and if it's not a consistent pattern of behaviour stop it in its tracks by reminding him that he was experiencing his own abandonment issue unrelated to your F6 response. You both need to tap out when things become escalated to engage unemotionally. It's ok to be emotional about topics but when anyone becomes emotional stop and take a break with an agreement to return to the topic in 5 minutes, 5 hours or 5 days. Whatever is needed to remove the heat/reactive/irrational elements. Circuit breakers are vital for all relationships. Otherwise you risk his codependency which is what he showed you. He can engage in men's behavioural change groups with peers to show that this behaviour isn't ok. It's not your trauma it's your normal reaction to his abnormal response. Don't own this one because it's not yours. Doing so risks undoing all your fabulous efforts. He tried to control something beyond his control and massively overstepped..whether he did it for abandonment is his issue to resolve but assuming the best of him read the book to deepen your understanding of attachment models and don't allow anyone to ever use it as an excuse for abuse which is common AF"	LowerBeautiful2806	reply	na	na	na	0.9751972556114197	no	strong	no	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.

Honestly I'd just say you need to let him know that if you go to walk out of the room he should let you do that and let you come back into the room in your own time.
He shouldn't have pushed for a hug or any physical expression of affection after the first time you told him no.

"I wanted to update.   We spoke about this last night.  This had never happened before and he didn't know how to react, he said he just wanted to help and let me know I was safe.  He also said that while he was hurt to see me that way and that he ""failed"" as a husband to protect me and help me, that he 100% will get over those feelings and he also said that in future despite wanting to help he will stay across the room or away from me, basically whatever I need. 

We also talked about where that came from and what I think in my past may have caused that response as he didn't know a huge amount.  

Let me make this clear, I have read that this is a blurring of lines, he shouldn't have come near me, he could become abusive etc and that he should have respected what I was saying.  We did talk about the respecting what I was saying, and he understood and took that on board, but he wouldn't ever hurt me, put me in danger or manipulate me.  He just isn't like that, he is nothing like my ex and he was abused as a child and wouldn't ever break any sort of consent, his trying to hold and comfort me came from a place of love and I am not making excuses, we talked about a plan if this ever happens again and also if it does then I will also get professional support.  

There are some bad people out there, my ex used to manipulate and I can see how some people might think that it's a slippery slope, but this man isn't one of them.  I wrote the post to try and figure out what happened how to stop it happening and find a way forward.

"This is a perfect example of how to work through this trigger.

Your husband didn’t realize what was going on, and tried the best way he could - because he is of the mindset that physical contact means safe, secure and loved. 

Your flight or fight response is deeply rooted that touch can mean danger. It can cause you to shut down or shut out. 

If he is wanting to reassure you with physical warmth in a heated discussion; that would be a wonderful boundary to keep something like this from being a trigger event again. Ask for consent to reassure you with a hug.

T/w - my ex would physically restrain me if I attempted to exit an argument. From blocking exits, pushing me into a room, holding me in a bear hug so hard I couldn’t breath / left bruises and at times until I passed out. I haven’t experienced a trigger like this in my current relationship, and his conflict de-escalation took is also space, but this experience you’ve had will likely open a conversation between us of what to do if one of us is wanting physical reassurance in a heated discussion. 

You’re reaction is completely valid given what you’ve been through, and I know you don’t want to hurt his feelings with your reaction and was never your intention.

OP-respectfully, you will likely never be able to make this not happen again. It’s called “triggered”. And it is just a side effect of trauma.  I’m sure you know the term but this is exactly what it is. He triggered you. I understand he is not abusive. But it is important to have a discussion here with him when you feel safe and not triggered. To just let him know that despite that you’ve not often been triggered…that was very triggering for you. Have a therapy session together if you need. Therapy is healthy and doesn’t have to mean your marriage is falling apart before you seek it out.

"This. 

Him not giving you the space you needed is what triggered your response. He needs to understand that it’s not him, it’s the trauma you suffered that’s so deep rooted in you that when he came and put his arms around you—at that moment, not “when you feel safe”—your whole body went into protection mode. 

This is the trauma that your ex caused, and if hubby really wants to help, he should let you have your space so you could collect yourself and come back to the conversation a bit later.

Explain to him that it’s not him that you are walking away from at that moment, but all of the feelings building up and overwhelming you—and him trying to calm you when you asked for space triggered a instantaneous reaction that even you didn’t expect.

He obviously didn’t want to hurt you, but “smothering you with love” when you needed space wasn’t the right response for him at that moment. Ask him to understand that even though you normally feel absolutely safe in his arms, that sometimes you just need to get some fresh air to clear your head—and yes, maybe even get away from the moment.

Tell him he’s not the problem at all, but ask him to respect your boundaries—especially if it looks like you’re struggling like you were. The best thing for you would be for him to let you just walk away, and then when you have calmed down, you two can start the conversation again. But “forced” hugs only trigger anxiety to the point where one reacts in a negative manner.

"I’m not sure what to do. My partner can be very verbally abusive. He is the kind that uses fuck, cunt, etc in most sentences just when he is normally speaking and that’s not what bothers me. What bothers me is when he becomes frustrated he starts to verbally insult me with those words. He is jobless at the moment and I am paying for our food. He wanted me to get him alcohol so we went out together so I could buy them, we were both in a good mood at this stage btw. I accidentally took a wrong turn and he flipped. “You are a fucking idiot! Why aren’t you paying attention to the road, you’re such a dumb cunt when you drive!”. It was in an aggressive tone, he was instantly mad simply because I took a wrong turn. I offered him to drive and he refused, upset I just drove home and said don’t worry about it. He asked for my car keys and my phone (Apple pay) so he could go get the drinks himself. I turned around and said no, I’ve told you many times before I don’t like you swearing and talking to me like that so why would I buy you alcohol? His response was “I talk to everyone like that! I don’t give a shit about your stupid little feelings, you’re a fucking…” and then he took off out the door and disappeared for 2 hours. 

It’s 2:30pm, this happened around 7:30pm last night and he still hasn’t said a word to me and is punishing me. What the hell did I do wrong? How do I stop him from talking to me like that? It hurts and I’ve been laying here wondering all day why I stay.

Only he can fix him and you could die trying to change him, either literally or figuratively. In my experience it will always be something, it doesn't matter how perfect you make things for him if he feels like using you as a verbal punching bag he will do so. Took 4 years before mine added physical to it, I really regret not leaving sooner. He needs to work on himself if this relationship is worth saving, without your help. If he cant do that for you nothing you do will help.	Emily-Isabella	reply	na	na	na	0.9994871616363525	no	strong	no	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.

I would leave even if it was to let him know you can't tolerate that kind of abuse.  Emotional abuse is still abuse.  Those kind of bruises don't just heal.	Emily-Isabella	reply	na	na	na	0.9994871616363525	no	no	no	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.
"I got out of a relationship recently that started out like this. He kept getting worse, hitting/breaking/throwing things, the swearing and insults soon became threats and aggressive hand movements in my direction (grabbing for me, swinging at me). Eventually he pushed and held me against the wall and I moved out. 
If he's not willing to acknowledge that what he is doing is wrong and change his behavior when you've talked about it, I'd say leave before it gets worse"	Emily-Isabella	reply	na	na	na	0.9994871616363525	no	strong	no	na	domesticviolence	failed
"Preface: I just left my abusive partner of six years and father of my 14mo daughter. I moved in with my parents. 

So this is a post is what I wish I could say to my mom, but won’t. I know I am the asshole in this situation. I just need to vent with no judgement. 

You have been telling me to leave him for years. You constantly tell me I deserve better, and that I should be with someone who appreciates me because I am a good person. 

I asked for your help. I asked if i leave can my daughter and I live with you. You say yes, and let us live with you. You told me that I’m throwing a huge wrench in your life and future plans and if it wasn’t for my daughter, you wouldn’t let me move in. 

I left and moved in 5 days ago. You told me that I was doing the right thing. Yesterday I went to the courts to file an OOP and petition for custody. You decided to express how upset you were at me for staying with him, and how stupid I was to have a child with him, after all he put me through. 

This morning, I told you that I was going to the precinct because he was sending me threats and I wanted to see what I could do. You told me that you really were scared for your life. 


I can’t tell you how hard it was for me to have asked you for help, because I don’t want to upend your life. You don’t deserve to have to take care of me because I made bad choices. 

I am truly sorry for putting all of this on you. I am so entirely grateful for your help. My daughter is in a safe place because you let us in. I feel guilt for depending on you, but I had to selfishly put us before your feelings in order to survive. 

You’re upset with me for staying? Don’t be, because I’m carrying enough shame for the both of us. You are scared for your life? I would never want you to ever feel that way, especially because of my choice to be with someone. That scared you are feeling right now, I understand it because I have felt that way for the past six years. I’ve built my life around that fear. You think I’m stupid for procreating with him? My daughter is such a beautiful person, and everyday I feel so fortunate to be able to experience a life with her in it, but I wouldn’t have her without my abuser. So I’m battling these emotions of hatred for being abused by him, yet I do not for one minute regret having my daughter, whom he was part of making. 

I have spent the last 6 years staying silent for my abuser and now I will continue keeping my feelings to myself for you. How can I complain when you have done so much to help me out? I would never want to say anything to sound ungrateful, because I’m not. 

If I could say what I wanted to say, it would be this. I am in the midst of doing something so scary, and you have taken many opportunities to make it about you. You have pointed out so many more reasons for me to feel awful. And I really resent you for that."	maguado1808	post	35.415822878597936	female	White	0.00470744026824832	na	na	na	4	domesticviolence	no prediction.
I'm sorry but your mom sounds like a jerk. I've been staying at my mom's (it's day 8). I had to tell her I failed to tell her was stupid enough to marry him  so hed have insurance in case he got COVID. I had to tell her I bsed her hard months back when she asked if he'd been hitting me. She left her bedroom so I could sleep in the same room as my son, after already giving up her entire attached apartment to my brother after his second divorce. I disrupted my cousins visit with her mom and my brothers visit with my nephew, I had to have the cops called to my aunt's house when he threatened to show up, and for bonus points my dog couldn't deal with the food change and had liquids coming out of all ends all over my aunt's house. I feel like shit for imposing on them, and that feeling of not wanting to buden others contributed to my putting off leaving until I pretty much had no choice cuz my son and i were in danger. You did what you had to do for your daughter now and it would be awesome if your mom could do right by you now too, the past doesn't matter, only the future of not putting up with abuse.  I'm sorry she's being like this to you, it's too soon to have to deal with that too and you are not an asshole. My mother is driving me crazy in her own waytoo and I'm sure my kid is slowly driving them insane but I finally let them help me for the first time in my life. I feel like shit a bit too but I can't let it get in the way.	maguado1808	reply	na	na	na	0.00470744026824832	strong	strong	no	na	domesticviolence	failed

I really need advice. I’ve slowly been squirreling away clothes, personal items, money, stuff like that in a secret secure place. I contacted an attorney in another state to help me change my identity as well. (I love the name I picked). Three days ago I was home being the perfect wife when I got a call from a doctor at a hospital in another part of our state. At the same time my SIL showed up with the police to my house. I was informed my husband (🤢) collapsed and was taken to the emergency room. My first thought was please be dead. That was not the case. I was “escorted” by my SIL to the hospital. Fortunately the doctors spoke to me alone. This is where I’m confused. They found a tumor in his brain. And according to the doctors it’s been there for a long time. I asked if it could have caused a change in personality and they said yes. Especially combined with diabetes that wasn’t under control. (I don’t think he knew he had diabetes). He’s scheduled for surgery tomorrow. Am I naive in hoping I get my old husband back or do I keep my plans in place to escape? I’m torn too between wanting him to die and hoping he lives? Is this normal?	Extra-Mission5850	post	49.344227125868585	female	White	0.9671530723571777	na	na	na	7	domesticviolence	failed
"I can't tell you what to do, I can only say what I would do.

Based on you wanting to leave the state and change your identity, it sounds like the abuse here goes beyond a personality change making him mean so I'm going to assume there was violence as well. Yes, it's possible that surgery could ""fix"" the personality issue and things will go back to normal - but the brain is a tricky animal and once it's rewired, it's hard to wire it back - this is why trauma based mental illnesses are so hard to treat. You also need to consider that a psychologically abusive person could use a medical condition to gaslight you into believing you were never abused at all.

Please talk to a therapist. From my understanding there are no guarantees he’ll be better. And trauma will still be there. It’s like when people tell me my wife became violent because of PPD. I don’t know if that’s true because it’s been long term but we had kids super quick so maybe. But she’s almost killed me at this point and I’m not sure I could be comfortable even if she agrees to treatment.

"This is no easy answer. 

I like one person suggestion of taking every medical file you can get your hands on and having a psychologist review and see if the types of medical issues he has could indeed cause the abuse you have endured. 

If you get confirmation that it’s possible, the whole other state and name change may not be necessary, but I also wouldn’t jump back in to day to day and hope for the best. I might separate and sit down in a safe environment with medical professionals and explain that you won’t be his caregiver during recovery. You are hoping the surgery and controlling the diabetes may bring him back to who he once was; but you suffered severe abuse and need to be in a separate home for now to see if it is a change or not.

Time for plain speech with a neurologist. Not necessarily his. See if your MD can facilitate an emergency consultation with a neurologist or neuropsychologist.

"There are questions you need answers to, but they are questions no-one can answer. 

The extent to which your husband's health problem influenced his behaviour cannot be known. The results of the operation and treatment cannot be predicted. And no-one can know what choices your husband will make when he can leave hospital. 

What you do know is you have been damaged by his behaviour. Repairing yourself while nursing a man who has hurt you and made you afraid of him is too much to ask of you. Let your SiL care for him while he recovers, and he can try courting you again, starting over. You need time and distance to see if he is now someone worth being with, and if you can recover enough to enjoy being with him.

Take your time. Care for yourself and give yourself space. You may find it's best to say farewell and good-luck to him, and start  a new life for yourself."	Extra-Mission5850	reply	na	na	na	0.9671530723571777	no	no	no	na	domesticviolence	failed

"I agree. Even IF his behaviour returns to normal. Your relationship to him has been forever changed in many ways by what you’ve been through. E.g. your boundaries, thought processes, fear, and self esteem. Even if his behaviour changes YOURS is now also not normal (not your fault, the abuse has trained you to behave a certain way and set that cycle in place). You can’t undo the damage and return YOU to normal with healthy boundaries to have a healthy relationship, if you’re still with him. You need to heal. 

And that’s a big IF. Can you get a medical opinion from a Dr who knows about both DV and brain tumours? Finding out not only if the tumour caused the abuse, but also if the surgery is even guaranteed to fix it. It may put you at ease that you’re doing the right thing by leaving.

Also consider how dangerous it is to stay if he DOESN’T change. In which case his medical trauma will likely worsen the abuse."	Extra-Mission5850	reply	na	na	na	0.9671530723571777	weak	strong	no	na	domesticviolence	failed

"I did mine without a lawyer and won. The extension hearing is like a trial, you must submit any evidence ahead of the trial but a judge may still hear it. You have to have that evidence served on the respondent too.

Then I wrote a script, so I could keep dates and events straight. The judge will ask why you are seeking a protective order and every line of the script should answer that question within the brackets of the law. So don't include silly arguments you two may have had, stick to things like harassment, breaking your property, physical altercations, coercive control, stalking etc. Dates it happened. Text messages, pictures, videos on a flash drive, witness statements, and actual witnesses you may wish to call. Look up your state law and only introduce what could fall under the law. Keep it in a chronological timeline of events.

Im 37/M and I know a woman who is 61 and she currently rents a one bedroom apartment with her son and a dog that is very precious to both of them. The son is in his 40’s and is abusing drugs and he is an alcoholic. He is a former heroin addict and is abusing his suboxone as well. Stress has been escalating because there was a sharp raise in rent, and she was the only one working and her rent has been raised to almost $2000. She lost her job last week. She is devastated. She has also been drinking and has depression and she states her medication is not helping. There is some domestic violence from the son to his mother, I don’t know the extent, but the other night he was drunk and throwing objects at her. She has no savings. Her son is doing odd jobs occasionally and is not making nearly enough money. She is looking for some type of rental assistance, for which I believe she went somewhere to ask about it and she was basically told “no”. Not sure where she went. But she needs some type of financial assistance and is at extreme risk of homelessness. Can anyone help me by making suggestions of where we might look for help, even a shelter for women? Please help if you can. She is the sweetest lady. She lost her other son to heroin overdose, and her sister who she was close with was killed in a car accident a year ago. I believe her son may be isolating her. She is extremely vulnerable.	d394164p	post	45.535664709905966	male	White	0.937253475189209	na	na	na	2	domesticviolence	failed
"Yes adult protective services. I also lost my son to an overdose/Fentanyl poisoning. Here are my thoughts and suggestions: 

1)Loosing a child would make it very difficult to walk away from or let go of another child. Especially when that child is suffering from the same disease that took your other child. 

2) Overdose, like suicide, can complicate the grieving process. The ""complex"" or ""complicated""  aspect means grief is deeper and prolonged. The guilt associated with overdose is the same as suicide. Again, this will make it difficult for her to walk away from her son who's alive. Her grief and mental/emotional health are probably at an all time low and as you said she's very vulnerable. For me,   the domestic violence began after I lost my son and moved in with my daughter's father (i needed time to grieve and figure things out). I can't tell you how lifeless this made me. I already had most of the life stripped out of me when my son died and to have someone become so heartless during this time- I was frozen. I couldn't even respond or process any of it at first. He left me paralyzed. I can imagine it's similar for her. 

I could go on and on but here's some possible help you can encourage her to seek out. 

1) call the police next time he is throwing shit at her. She will never do it. It may save her life or open the doors to assistance in the future. For example victim witness programs have funding for moving and counseling. They have referrals to other resources. Dv shelters may be more inclined to assist with police report. Etc. 

2) adult protective services can be helpful for the same reasons stated above. In addition,  they offer resources. Just being referred opens the doors to these services and resources. More importantly, this gives her an out without all the drama and less guilt. Having someone force you to do something or having someone else with authority make  you leave may be what is needed. 

3)A resource she may already have without realizing it. . . 
There are now thousands of us who have lost a child to an overdose who've banned together to bring awareness and stop the Fentanyl poisonings. What were 3 -4 groups a few years ago has turned into hundreds. Facebook alone must have at least 50 groups. They are all close nit. Many of us are working in several groups or at least involved in support groups. This is a good place to reach out. Especially if she has some history within these groups. Just venting could open doors or lead to suggestions that could help. A good support group if she's not already involved is Not In Vain. She could find them on Facebook. We've had a mom loose her life to domestic violence and the moderators are trained to look out for this kind of thing. I just found out they are helping financially for services like funerals, but also for emergencies. Possibly something like this. It doesn't hurt to try. At the very least she could build a good support system with women who are suffering like her, some who are dealing with other children who are using and in addiction. 

Hope this helps. Praying 🙏"	d394164p	reply	na	na	na	0.937253475189209	no	strong	no	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.
"Hey all. My partner and I separated at the start of the year. He moved out last August, and we've been long distance ever since. Before that, it was a year of horrible abuse, violence, verbal, sexual. It was the worst time of my life. 

It's all so confusing to me. We've had to stay in contact because he needs to come and get his stuff out of my place, and I had to help him with some applications. Well, I guess I didn't have to, but I did anyway because, for some reason, I still want him to get his life on track even if I'm not in it. Because of the distance he hasn't been able to come over to get his things 

In April I tried to set boundaries for space. Then, around that time, my cat got sick and she's only just started properly recovering the past 2 weeks. I hate myself for it, but I depended on him for emotional support because he has a strong bond with my cat, and I didn't have anyone else, friends or family, to support me. I know he really loves her and cared about what was happening. 

The thing is, we'll have nice conversations. He had severe ptsd when the abuse was happening. We've learned about how ptsd is commonly associated with violence. It all sucks really. He tells me he has been working on himself and I do see changes although it's too little, too late for me, and I've told him it's over. I'm still dealing with ptsd from him, and I've lived through a lot of shit, but what he did is definitely the worst thing that's ever happened to me. I told him it's taken a lot for me to maintain any kind of positive relationship with him. 

I'm just confused I guess and I know you guys have given me great perspective before. There's no way we can stay in each others lives, right? We promised each other we always would. But that was before the abuse. I imagine meeting someone new, and telling them I'm still in contact with my ex who horribly abused me. I don't really think that's acceptable. It sucks because I don't have family and his family kind of adopted me into theirs. So I guess it hurts that I'm losing not only him, but 3 brothers and a parent as well. I just don't know what to do or how to tear myself away from this.

He's carrying heavy, heavy trauma from a thousand different kinds of abuse when he was a child, in and out of state's custody because his parents were strung out (extra confusing for him because they were and are genuinely loving of their kids, they just became unable to properly care for them). He was repeatedly SA'd as a minor by much older women. As a very young man he suffered in a terribly emotionally/financially/and eventually physically abusive relationship with a girl his own age for more than a decade, before she took literally everything in the divorce, alienated his child, and blackened his name with untrue allegations of him abusing his daughter. These allegations were thoroughly investigated and found to be false, but the damage to his psyche from all that was immense.

As far as I know, I was the only woman he has dated who did not abuse him. 

So he abused me, instead.

All that rage had to go somewhere, and I was a safe target. I loved him. I still love him. He knew I'd forgive him and I am not big enough to really defend myself, not without stabbing, shooting, or poisoning him, and I don't have that in me. (I don't *think* I have that in me...let me not get ahead of myself. If things had gone on the way they were going, I might have.)

I threw him out of the house we were renting. It is my family's property but not MY property, and bills exist, so in doing this I made myself homeless too.

I'm hiding in my parents' spare room and have been for a couple months.

We have good conversations, too. I miss him. But now I also have night terrors and permanent physical damage. I'm fairly certain my literal life is going to be shortened due what has been done to me. I'm destroyed, and he did it. He's sorry, but that doesn't fix me. He's traumatized by what he's done, and that doesn't fix me either.

He can't hurt me over the phone. He could say mean things if he wanted, ig, but I always have the option of getting off the phone.

Irl you can't just hang up or hit block. Irl if they lose their shit and put their hands on you, it's just too bad so sad.

All that to say I know it hurts. I know it's hard. I'm struggling too. 

Just remember that this person is a danger to you, no matter how bad they feel about it or how much they regret their actions, no matter how supportive they have been while you are apart. When you are in someone's physical power, the script can flip very quickly. People who would be violent toward someone who is smaller and weaker than them have deep fucking ISSUES that they may not ever overcome. Even with all the help in the world. 

If you meet someone new and begin to slip out of their power, they may react *very* badly.

Personally I never want anyone to touch me ever again. I hope I get over that. 

I hope I have the strength to move on.

I hope you do too."	zophzz	reply	na	na	na	0.9981927275657654	no	strong	no	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.

I totally get where u are coming from. I was stuck with the trauma bond. Even after being beaten so bad and choked so bad I pissed myself…. The next day he said sorry and he would get help. Of course I felt sorry for him bc he was “trying so hard”. They are just demons in disguise. They will lure u in by talking about all the fun and old times. All the memories. Anything for him to connect with u again. It’s the mind games. Control. It took me 3 years to break free. Looking back I still can’t believe I put up with it all. I was a dumb bitch but was memorized by his charm. He will tell u he’s working on himself just to pull u in again. Don’t fall for it. I honestly believe that men who are abusive don’t change at all. Don’t go backwards. Don’t feel sorry for yourself by thinking u are losing everybody. I get what u saying tho. It hurts. I feel stupid for even calling my abusive ex the other night drunk. I called to tell him how much I hate him. But I feel stupid that I even thought of him. Fuck them	zophzz	reply	na	na	na	0.9981927275657654	weak	strong	no	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.

"As much as I can listen to myself bitch and bitch into the void I’m trying to get my shit/life back together, finally, and it’s been really difficult both trying to find resources or just DIY it all -  

Does anyone know of any virtual support groups? Affordable/sliding scale type actual clinician-led therapy groups that target the trauma aspect would be ideal - but any dv specific support group. Nada where it happened, been since or am now. 

Is it like this everywhere - help scarce, disorganized? Most all hotline staff were very kind - just, vibe of underfunded/lotta bureaucracy in the way of getting you hell beyond can offer in that call, or shelter. Unless the latter is like a hub to the rest. Even in a midsize city it was “we only have advocacy via crisis line and shelter” then next week “yeah, we just … but Agency B has groups.” Them: “yes, next groups in 3 weeks, signup in 2” - “Support group? No, sorry” - “Just SA group, oh the one for bilingual pagan basket weaver survivors just went on hiatus. But you coulda met an advocate ongoing, if we’d not been understaffed to offer til you’re fleeing cop aided/abetted stalking/payback for kicking HIM outta YOUR house…” 

Really tho, anything specific to our recovery, unless a pit of after school special style condescension (already had unwanted brush w legal system) or toxic positivity. I’d hope it wouldn’t be, just traumatized from said intrusion on top ex himself, after being thru the wringer as a pain patient in the shithole’s medical system. Hence trying to white knuckle it back to city from before, where I’ve a great therapist. Can’t take any more uninformed stigma re either; finding anyone who truly gets both (by website/profile alone, too burnt to call asking) is like unicorn hunting - even if not spinning wheels in the wilderness w a lone, grim behavioral “fuck your feelings; behave yourself” health clinic. (Sorry not sorry. Am a therapist. Assembly line managed care gives me hives, even w raging imposter syndrome these days)

And does anyone happen to know, also -

a) if you can still file for mental health reimbursement from a state crime victims fund if “your” case was dropped? Including if you hid from being used by a zealot DA who threatens traumatized women w material witness warrants for not wanting to be used as live bait/trauma porn?

b) are there any financial resources, both for if you’d land in btwn being too flush to need it it, and so much in need as to qualify for SNAP - and don’t have kids? Like, someone just able to tread water w my biz, but enough of a ptsd case to be flailing in limbo for unplanned months unable to unfuck my head and pay rent back home in a major city? 

And last, for dealing w debts/credit messes the fucker saddled you with? I read about a new process for such cleanup, but it seemed new and not clearly laid out. Plus it was on a trafficking survivor org’s site - not sure if it applies to dv tho obvs a good deal of similar financial/coercive control abuses btwn the two."

"I tried all the numbers given to me by the hotline, and none were able to help me. We own a house, and my mother passed just before we broke up (I got a small inheritance); but I am disabled, and have zero income, including SSDI.

Any money I spend doesn’t get replenished, so I have to be extremely careful how I spend it. It’s not going to last long at all, and they’re trying to get me to spend it “so I can divorce my abuser”.

I’m so done with everything. I know that if I do what they want I’m not going to “win”. It’s just how my life works. I’ll spend it, but then it won’t be enough—they’ll need more (that I won’t have) to get me the things I need to win, then they’ll say, “Oh, sorry, I really thought you’d win, or at least get something”. Then, I am completely broke AND still fighting for my life?

I doubt I will be able to eventually present DV to the judge, because he left the day before APS showed up—after HIS doctor called them on my behalf—so no charges were brought against him.

I’m just so tired of fighting anymore. The worst part is that I need (especially financial) help and have no idea where to start—my disability doesn’t help me at all because my neurological issues slow me down. 

I’m sorry for dropping in and dragging you down. I really hope you find your answers. 🙏🏼💗"	Motor-Cupcake7577	reply	na	na	na	0.9963502883911133	no	strong	no	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.
"No, don’t apologize. It’s just seeming more services, especially once you’re out of relationship/if you don’t need a shelter or have kids are really thin. Like there’s the impression of things but it’s smoke and mirrors when you try to pin it down. That’s been my experience in multiple locations across 3 states from midsize city to rural in the past year as I’ve been crashing around, house sitting or “borrowing” unoccupied inherited homes. Which has been really lucky to have bcs I’m self employed and things have been so rough I took some time off then I’ve been working way less. It pisses me off I was harassed outta my house, but then again it sucked trying to make rent alone when I don’t have it together to work as much and woulda been worse in a more expensive city, not to mention full of memories in a town I hate. 

I’m not clear who you mean by the “they” that’s trying to pressure you to sell your home etc - unless you mean your abuser and they are wanting to separate also. Not the legal system I hope? Tho I’d believe it. One of the most validating things I heard/read was that many have felt the way they treat us denies our agency/tries to control us just like the abuser re the power dynamics bcs it was so true for me. That’s why I just shut out all communication - blocked numbers, no fwd address, shitload of crazy privacy measures to not be found to subpoena. Along with being forced to relive trauma and be attacked by him/his creep lawyer friend so they could try to fluff their stats/pat themselves on the back. For a slap on the wrist - they were undercharging the fuck outta it, he broke in and held me hostage after I broke up w him, that’d just provoke him more. And they wouldn’t even investigate or let me talk to the DA - crazy bitch who’ll threaten bench warrant/arrest to make you if don’t want to testify/be used as live bait. 

I’m sorry you’re dealing with chronic health stuff too on top. It’s a whole other mess what that damned state I was in for him did to my care for chronic illness/pain I had. And I’ve heard nothing but horror stories about SSDI/SSI - like it being very difficult and dehumanizing to qualify, paying very little, and being made to sell off assets/possessions. Plus being punished essentially for managing too much hours or earnings in part time work, or marrying if they’re not on it too and employed. It’s disgusting- like, we’re punishing you for being disabled, you can’t have nice things or proper adult marriage rights, and you must live in poverty. Rah rah America!

But yeah, it makes it all harder for sure when you can’t function mentally or physically at your best. It’s not the same but chronic pain and ptsd fog are a bitch for that too. I’m only staying afloat bcs I’ve been lucky w housing and im self employed making a high hourly so w/out rent i can survive barely working tho my pet’s been seriously ill including a week in vet ICU which woulda cleaned me out entirely if I hadn’t sold some music gear. But hey prob not as much as SSDI would make me sell off."	Motor-Cupcake7577	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9963502883911133	weak	no	no	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.
"That’s just about the gist of it. And yes, it’s the government that doesn’t want me to have any assets if I want “help”.

I have been creating eyeglass/cellphone caddies to try to sell, unfortunately, I haven’t had huge success, I’m guessing because of the price. It takes me about 9 hours total to make one, and I have to make an income, but I guess $100 is too much for a handmade wooden “table”? But, I got a lot of great responses on the photos and requests for a pattern, so I’m trying to get my designs online so other woodworkers can make their own. Hopefully.

I truly hope you find the resources you need to make a better life for yourself. We deserve better than this. 🙏🏼💗

" Are these red flags? I've been seeing a guy a bit over a month and half or so. I don't know why hes perfect and so attentive but then acts like this. We went to dinner then I stayed with him the night. Like that night everything was fine. He was like ""Tell me if I do anything you don't like, etc"" about sex  It was healthy.

After first date, I sent one text saying something nice, he didn't text me back for 3 days. Then I just didn't respond to him for a week and half because I just didn't even understand what hell that was, and I felt awkward.  That already made me feel weird from the beginning. Told counsellor about this and she said guys do this sometimes cause their friends tell them to. So I've gone out with him like 6 times since then. Met his friends (His mums in iran and siblings in europe)

Like went out to dinner then stayed at his after. He's been really good and caring etc like he takes me to nice places and buys nice food etc. So he knows I not on birth control. I know he doesn't want children for a few years he already said this. We've been using protection then there's multiple times he's asked to do it without. I think about 4 at least. One of the times the condom actually came off inside me twice that night (accident) and he got it out, then said I've gotta go get the morning after pill which was fair enough, but then he actually asked to do it without for the rest of the night since the next day were going to be going to the chemist.

So we did that, and I got it at the chemist with him and in the car he asked ""Did you take it?"" I was like yes. Then the next time (a few days later) he asked to do the same and I said I'm pretty sure I'm not meant to be taking the morning after pill every few days. I told him I was seeing a doctor about birth control soon and to just wait. I didn't sleep with him without condoms except that night it came off so I just kept telling him no and made him use them. He always had boxes at his there was no reason to keep complaining about them. 

Then another night I was actually half asleep not talking, like my eyes were closed and was turned away, and he came back into his room and lifted up my leg then I woke up properly and I'm pretty sure he was about to start having sex with me without a condom. Like if I hadn't of woken up I don't actually know what he was trying to do. We had already had sex earlier that night like why does he even try to do that while I'm sleeping. Then every night after this when he comes in and I'm asleep I feel different now since then. 

I haven't actually processed this yet because he knows about my sexual assault, and I don't think he'd do that to me. Then the other issue is he goes on about other women he's been with, and it makes me feel insecure. I don't know if it's on purpose. And the last time I saw him he told me I should try to talk to my abusive narcissistic father more, and be closer to him and forgive my parents, because ""you'll miss them when they're gone"" this is the only time I got angry at him and told him off. I said there's nothing to miss and he laughed, then I asked why he's laughing that it's not funny then his tone changed, and he asked why I'm arguing with him, he tried to explain himself more i just asked him to stop, then he gave me money for food while I was getting out of the car and just stared at me for some reason. I didn't hug him just said thanks about the money and closed the door. 

That morning triggered me so bad I wanted to get away from him and haven't spoken to him since Monday. Like why would you say that to someone with abusive parents. I don't know if it's his own trauma from losing his dad young and coming here on a boat from Iran when younger and all that. That's why I've been easy on him, but that morning was way too much. He also told me did ice ""only 3 times"" about 6 months ago with some girl he was sleeping with. I didn't realise he had dabbled in ice(meth) either. He reckons its fine if it's for fun and not an addiction. That 

Gambling or drugs are fine in moderation and its not the same as addicted people because hes smart with money, and always has savings, etc. That he only smokes weed sometimes now.  Also that ice was boring and he's not interested in doing it again. It was before I met him but wth!! I don't know where that came from because we discussed ice destroying communities and what I saw living in low-income building. Like he waited until 2 days ago to tell me this. 

Also talking himself up constantly and repeating his story to me. Like I get it you worked from the bottom up that's good. Then he goes on about people being lazy and not working, etc and about addicts. Like he said I've got no reason to not be working and studying full time now, that he'll buy me a laptop, that it's so easy to work in this country and he had it worse where he came from. ( I actually start a new job in 2 weeks) 

And that he can't believe I don't know how to drive properly yet. (I'm on my learners for one more month) Like i didn't say anything bad about him not knowing how to swim. He says that stuff then says something nice after. Says about his mother teaching him how to treat women good but like acts like that to me. It's so bizarre  like I don't get it."	lovecatsx	post	25.138732095209477	female	White	0.9980156421661377	na	na	na	9	domesticviolence	ethnicity: unknown, age: 20-30, gender: female, explanation: the writer is likely to be a young adult woman, deduced from the nature of the relationship she is describing. however, no specific ethnic cues are given.

"When you are starting to date someone, and right out of the gate you feel ‘weird’, that is your intuition telling you something is wrong and to get away from this person. Yes, some guys DO have friends that tell them what to do, so what does that tell you about that guy? Does he make ALL of his dating decisions by committee vote?

Every time he did something that was out of your comfort zone he was limit testing you, to find out how you reacted when your boundaries were crossed. The way he brought up topics you told him were closed, like your family. Being negative about not having your license, or implying you were lazy since your job hasn’t started yet, and then saying nice things after? This is something many abusers will do to keep us confused and off balance. We WANT to believe this person is nice, so even though they just said mean or hurtful things, when they follow it up with a kindness then that is the thing we tend to believe is true. We will convince ourselves that ‘they didnt really mean to hurt my feelings, they simply didnt quite understand my situation.’ Or ‘I’m being too sensitive.’ In reality they really did mean exactly what they said, they were testing the water to see if they had found a ‘good victim’ or not.

"Help please...sexual assaults?

Hi, sorry for the confusion I'm just...really confused. Me and my partner were going through a terrible time this year, had been sleeping seperately for a few months but decided to enjoy a night out together as friends as an attempt at re-connecting. I made it clear it was a night out as friends, and I didn't want him acting super couperly with me and like it solved all our problems. Long story short we got on great all night, and when it came to bed time I said I would sleep in our friends kids bed, to avoid sleeping together, but he was drunk and acted wounded so to avoid the argument I agreed to sleep in the same bed, knowing it meant getting cuddled, not being totally against that, but specifically said before bed ""we're not having sex"", anyway I woke up with his fingers already inside me, not being kissed awake or even him rubbing against me, like they were already inside me, I was kind of drunk and too shocked to do anything about it so it led to sex, I instantly cried after and knew it felt wrong. I know it wasn't rape. I was raped before and this is totally different. But I'm wondering if people would think the initiating sex on a sleeping person falls under ""sexual assault""? A little relative background information too, in the past he has woken me up touching me to initiate sex, I didn't like it as it was very triggering of my previous SA and asked it to stop, which it didn't, so then I demanded it stopped, which it did. Anyway, it was bad enough when we were in a good place but considering the fact that we were already in a really bad place, hadn't slept together in months, and I made it clear I didn't want to, I just feel like all that makes it worse, and completely unacceptable.

This is sexual assault and while I understand that you don't want to label it that way - this is also rape. Not all rapes require violence. You are not able to consent while sleeping and you made it clear before falling asleep that you did not want to have sex.

"I’m so sorry this happened. He purposefully choose to ignore your stated boundaries.

"Hello! I’m a male prosecutor in California with a couple of years of experience with domestic violence cases. What you’re describing is, as some other commenters have said, most likely rape, at least in California. At the very least, it’s a very serious sexual assault.

I’m so sorry this happened to you. It makes sense that this might have felt different to you—this is a person you have a different kind of relationship with, so the feelings are going to be different.

Whatever you decide to do in terms of speaking to police (which I would strongly suggest you do), please try and push back against the natural instinct to excuse or minimize what he did. This is not okay because you had sex in the past—you made it VERY clear you didn’t want it to happen this time. This is not okay because you were drunk—being drunk is not the same as agreeing to sex. This is not okay because he was drunk—being drunk doesn’t mean you lose the ability to respect other people’s bodies. And this is not okay because he wore you down and got you to cuddle with him—again, you made it totally clear you didn’t want to have sex. The fact that he waited until you were asleep and defenseless proves that he knew what he was about to do was not okay.

Please distance yourself from him as much as possible, and if you can, start planning how to get him out of your life completely. This kind of violence and violation shows he does not value you as a person with autonomy, rights, and dignity. It will not stop. It will probably get worse. Please use the resources on this sub to get started on finding the help and support you deserve. If you have family or friends you trust, tell them what happened and ask for help.

"I (48f) have been with my husband (42m) for several years. He's always had an explosive temper, but until around a year and a half ago it hadn't been directed at me. 

He's become increasingly verbally abusive recently. He's very aggressive, and while the verbal abuse is destructive and awful, I'm also concerned that he's going to become physically violent. 

My benefits are tied to him, and the contract job I was working just ended. I simply have to find a job before I can leave. 

To complicate matters a bit further, I also have multiple sclerosis. I'm currently in remission (thank goodness), but this means I'll need an employer that can offer some level of accommodations.

"This is how I explained to my youngest who was 4 at the time:

Your “other parent” did something bad. It was something not allowed by the law. The police had to arrest “them” so they can get help and be safe to be around you. They couldn’t see what they were doing was wrong and the only way for it to stop was for the police to tell “them” they were wrong and give punishment and help. When you do something bad do you have to go in time out? Does that time out help you think about how not to do the bad thing again? And leads into a discussion about right and wrong. I ended that conversation also with, “I love you very much and your ____ still loves you very much. It will take _____ some time to work through their big feelings and be safe again, but they love you and will do their best to do that.” 

For my oldest (then 11) I asked her about what she had seen and knew about. However, she had been asking me to leave for a couple years. We had an open conversation but not one where I over shared specifics if she wasn’t aware of them. I did give her the option if she ever wanted to ask specific questions about what happened that she could. I also reassured her that she could know the truth and still love the other parent. Her relationship with her other parent was between them, and as long as that relationship always created a safe space for her I would always support it. 

The best advice I have is to create an open conversation and communication about right and wrong. Start with simple questions, leave space for an answer, and give lots and lots of reassurance of safety and love."

"Ok, so a little side note here: my daughter went through SA, involved the pastor who involved the police, currently awaiting her soon-to-be ex's sentencing, and divorce papers have been served. She has 2 littles, ages 3 & 5. They know that Daddy did something mean to Mommy that's not allowed, and because of that he needs to be punished. It's been 2 years that this process has been in the works, with delay after delay after delay. The kids have adjusted fairly well. They have been known to mention, very matter-of-factly, about *""when Daddy goes to jail""*. I think they see it as a sorta grown-up time out. 

This might be different if your kids are older, or witnessed some really hairy stuff. If their parent was a real piece of work during the arrest, or if they were brainwashed (more or less) against you. 

We've tried to help by giving the kids a bit of structure and by affirming their mom's authority. Ironic, really, since my husband is emotionally abusive to me, and I'm sure there will come a day when I've done had enough."

You absolutely did NOT ruin it! What you did was show your children what is ok to accept in a relationship & what isn’t. Your kids are young they’re angry mommy is gone & don’t understand why. What you CAN do to help them now & forever is to #1 get them & yourself into therapy & #2, mirror what a healthy relationship is & that you will not stand to be abused. This will teach them about what is & isn’t ok in their future relationships & what they should & should not accept. Imagine when your daughter is grown a man striking her in the face, or a woman doing what your wife did to you to your son. Would you want them to stay or would you tell them that no one deserves to be abused & that they need to stay strong for them & for their children! Please, tomorrow start looking for therapy!

I'm sure you didn't ruin it-- it will take time to deprogram them. I'm so sorry you're going through this. It would be a good idea to get into counselling-- together, you & the kids, as well as each separately. Keep being the parent. Show them you love them and they can trust you. It's going to be a lot of work, so develop that support system around you. Have the hard discussions, age-appropriately, so they understand what has happened. They're going through a self-protection stage. They'll test you, and drive you crazy, but be the strong loving parent they need. Be truthful. Don't try to buy their love.

Idk I know she legit could have killed me. A couple weeks ago she knocked me down the stairs while my back was turned and hurt my ACL. Then this attack with strangulation makes me nervous. I don’t want my kids to grow up around this. I think it’s my fault but I don’t want them to think that they should live like this. I have a therapist and we talked about how this is bringing up a lot of childhood trauma as well as the actual trauma of it happening. My dad beat the crap out of my mom and I don’t want my kids to watch my wife beat the crap out of me. But it’s so hard to see someone I love too much face legal consequences, I do love her so much. She’s the mother of my children and they love her too. I feel like I broke up my family and that the kids will never forgive me. My therapist said we have to accept my negative feelings and thoughts while realizing it will pass and things will level out.

When are you going to hold her accountable? You’re doing your children no favors by carrying the blame for something you did not do! YOU did NOT break up your family, your wife did that! When you say “I don’t want my kids to grow up around this. I think it’s my fault but I don’t want them to think they should live like this.” What do you think is your fault? Bc you can’t make someone push you down the stairs, you cannot force someone to choke you! Someone always has the choice to walk away! Also, you say that you love her, too much even, but why? She doesn’t love you. She abuses you, is turning your kids against you! Honey, that’s not love, love doesn’t hurt!

 Sorry I just feel bad. A lot of people mentioned that this might be PPD/PPA related so I feel like I’m holding her responsible when she’s sick. I don’t want to be the man that abandons his mentally ill wife like you read about men dump their wives when they are ill but not the other way around. But I really think it’s dangerous and I don’t want my kids around it. Idk it’s hard not to feel guilty. She was abusive before but not really physically just emotionally and sexually I guess. So maybe PPD accelerated it but I think it was already bad. I’m just having trouble wrapping my head around the fact my marriage is probably over and she’ll be facing legal consequences.

"Please use paragraphs and point form sentences. Paragraphs a max of 4-5 sentences.

I work with lawyers as a consultant on complex domestic abuse files, and I work independently with people (usually women) leaving abuse.

It is very common to encounter very long paragraphs and pages of narrative. These are difficult to read.

IME abused women often give a lot of detail, and I believe are efforting to justify their calling the behavior abuse, or experiencing it as such.

You are justified! 

Abusers make us explain and justify every single aspect of everything. But relatively healthy others don't need this. 

And are more apt to provide answers, to take on your case, to engage on your file and to know how to help you if you can help them in this small way - brevity.

"Absolutely! I find tables work good for most people and situations

---
Use a table with separate columns for - date, parties involved, issue/event, outcome
** outcome is important (i.e., I felt scared to leave my house, I couldn't focus while driving, I felt dread about leaving the school)

Or

List very briefly at the top what the top issue & need is in a few sentences, then give more explanation 

Ex initially agreed to sign kids' passports but has since refused multiple times. We are traveling in August.
Table columns for: dates signing was requested, what ex did/didn't do, list outcome/what you expended (left work early to pick up papers); or a few short paragraphs, but the reader is clear from the start what the issue is *and where they can help/are requested to help* instead of them having to figure out what the problem is abd what parameters are at play.

---
You can also break tables into types of issues & can also use a bit of light color.

Try to be clear on what your needs are. Your valid healthy needs as a human being. Look up the UN convention rights of the child, or UN human rights and use the simplicity of those statements as a base.

Ie you need to be able to attend work then list things ex does that infringes on that need.

Just be sure to list the outcomes for anything you're expressing. Ie ex demands I sit at the kitchen table where he spends hours berating me for things like the time I forgot to buy milk at the store. He screams at me that I'm an idiot and that I'm inept and stupid and I cry and look at the floor until he leaves the room. If I get up before he does, he physically intimidates me by slamming his fist into the wall and using his body to block doorways. This exhausts me and I can't perform basic tasks at work the days after this happens. This happens every few days.

"I sometimes feel like this. The few people I have dated (with serious intent) since my abusive partner that haven’t exhibited red flags are 2 out of something like 7. 

And the two in question: one we were better off as friends and are still friends, the other had other craptastic red flags (homophobe) in spite of having also been abused. 

I don’t believe most people when they say most anything about their status in life. None of us are doing amazing. Lots of things are going wrong all over the country and the world. People living in a state of ignorance can pretend like things are great for them, but just because they don’t know better or haven’t bothered to develop the curiosity to figure out what’s actually happening to them. Ignorance doesn’t somehow absolve that their values or ideas are too naive.

But you will get faster and better at identifying shitty behavior, and you will walk away faster and faster. I mentioned in a previous post a while back, but (while doing everything necessary to be as non-toxic as you can) drop details about yourself and what you’ve experienced to people you want to trust. Give them the opportunity to be let in. But watch and wait, and see what they do with it.

I had a conflict while trying to make some new friends about a month ago. 

I dropped some info on two of the people involved. One of them, I caught accidentally over their shoulder, immediately texted my sensitive info to the person I had the conflict with. Using my details against me to make sense of and downplay why I stood up for my boundaries.

"I think the best advice that a therapist has given me, that isn’t even advice I follow all the time is: you have to accept yourself where you’re at. 

I know it’s tiresome and cliché to say “we are all a work in progress”. I don’t like aphorisms or anything that sounds like an empty prayer. I like that simple message though. Accept yourself where you’re at. It’s like how Mr. Rogers would say “I like you just the way you are” but more directly at yourself. No one means to end up in a fix. No one wants and actively puts themselves into a bad situation where they are going to be abused. I’ve seen so many people talk like they’re cursed, or that they must have done something to deserve this. 

No one deserves abuse. Abuse hurts you, and it takes time to heal. So just like you’d take your time and nurse your broken leg back to good health, you’ve got to take one day at a time with your heart and mind too. 

It’s okay to feel frozen. It’s still an emotional state as far as I’m concerned. It’s the state of burnout and exhaustion. You gave too much and now you have to take things back for yourself."	Ohiogirl1789	reply	na	na	na	0.9986750483512878	weak	strong	no	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.

"A week ago Sunday my husband smashed a glass plate and flying  glass hit our son who recently turned 8. DH was having a meltdown because I wanted to visit my cousin who was visiting from Florida a second time in a ten day period, during a 4 day weekend (that was the theme, at least, it's hard to know what actually set him off this time or any other).   The tantrum began when I slept in and within earshot of my son who told me he was ""sorry I got yelled at"" when things calmed down and I got food made. I knew it wasn't over and 30m later (ik cuz I was recording) he continued it in front of the kid, liberally calling him a retard and me the n and k word (we are white of non Jewish descent, but anyone who opposes him is a kword). After breaking the plate he proceeded to chase me around the house hitting me in the arms, breast, and face while I tried to find a broom (..and not fall, he tried twice). That was it, for me, hed been hitting me since 2019, verbally abusing us both for years, and slapped the kid in late April this year (first time he'd hit the kid). I was done, finally told my family the whole story of the past years and got an emergency protective order and then a 2 week temp order 2 days later. I have the right to stay in the house but I'm at my mom's for safety. 
My son has basically been acting like we're on vacation, he knows his dad's is at his grandpa's house but nothing about how long that will be, and he didn't even ask it like ""where's dad"" but more like ""Is he at our house"". He's said he likes being here, he says he wants to stay longer, my mom and aunts are slowly trying to teach him that no one is going to lose their shit at him if he spills something or throws up in the car. Kid hasn't mentioned his father or the abuse directly, other than to tell cps his dad yells at him alot. When I asked cps they unhelpfully said I could either ""ease him into it or rip the band-aid off"" and I don't know what to do. I intend to get a 2 year no contact order when the temp one expires, I intend to get full custody with supervised visitation and knowing his dad it's not impossible he'll never see him again.

From the sounds of it your child has been so traumatized by this man he doesn’t care where he is, as long as he is not there with you. Knowing that Dad is at Grandpas puts him at a safe distance. As you have things settled, then you will be able to tell him what you are doing to make sure he is safe. That you talked to a judge and he decided that Dad can’t see us for a long time because he hurts us when he gets mad, and he isn’t allowed to do that. (Something like this, breaking it down to kid level) That if he ever has to see his Dad there will be someone with to make sure Dad is nice, and has to say nice things. I wouldn’t bring anything up until you notice him becoming concerned, or worried. Or if you decide to go back to your house, because then he will start to worry about where his Dad is again. Does that make sense?

"hey guys update it’s really only getting worse from here. I told the police but they said investigation could take weeks to months. He has gotten some of my friends to turn against me and told them about my intimate details, things we did together, said that I “begged for him,” told everyone how I loved it etc.. im just so uncomfortable. I can’t take it anymore. He’s been sending people screenshots of our private conversations to attempt to prove a point. It’s so disgusting. 

He even texted my friends while we were all together, they read these disgusting things about me in front of me and I feel so ashamed and embarassed. He told them how I used to “sell myself” I just needed the money. I’m at my friends house right now just crying in his pool because I feel so defeated and humiliated.

"I’m not aware of the previous post. I don’t know what the details entail so I’m just responding to what I see here:

I’ll pass on some perspective. When I was your age I told a friend of mine I used to masturbate with pillows. She held it over me and used it, and my shame, against me multiple times. 

I’m way older now. If someone brought that up to me today I would laugh in their face and say,  “So? How is that your business?” Sure it would shock me at first but like, seriously I bet millions of people have masturbated with pillows. 

I’ve known people who have so many different kinds of kinks and none of them are anything to be ashamed of. Unsafe kinks are a different story but you can research that on your own if you haven’t already. Main thing is, your bf breached your trust, I wouldn’t see him or anyone associated with him again.

I know you and your peers are verging on young adulthood. But a lot of people are never really given the experiences nor the incentives to actually grow up. Most people don’t change much if they don’t leave home. Frequently, and especially in the case of abusive people, people don’t really grow much out of being the ego-driven amoral monsters we can be as children. A huge part of maturing is understanding how your actions effect and affect others. Your bf clearly only cares how he can amuse himself.

Your bf and even some of these “friends” are not mature and not good to put your trust in. Honestly, there’s a lot of nonsense in this life focused on making fun of or devaluation/belittling people who are open and vulnerable.
Try to look at yourself not with shame, but with pride. You know who you are, and who you are is someone with kinks. You’re entitled to your privacy and to not be judged by immature or puritanical types, and aside from that it’s no one’s business but yours and your consenting partner.

Keep pursuing things to stop him from sharing your details. Otherwise, you will eventually leave, or he will, and this will fade in a few weeks. I sincerely hope no one continues to harass you.

My husband is verbally, emotionally and financially abusive and has strangled me in the past. I’m working on an exit plan after a bad fight last week kickstarted the physical intimidation like before he hurt me last time.

"The guilt is normal because in so many ways your spirit has been crushed by this abuse. You only feel guilty because you want all the things you’ve taken time/effort/energy to build, but none of the “security” of partnership, home, and building a family mean anything without safety.

I know it’s not helpful but I ignored the guilt. People have tried to make me feel guilty about so many things that were wrong for me. Try to remind yourself that so many things in our society and culture have been built to the advantage or benefit of abusers. Even this guilt may be from some pressure put on you by people in your family or past that expect a gross and outmoded form of partnership which is unequal to you. 

Eventually you can ignore it, but that doesn’t help right now.

Get out of there. Get you and your child somewhere safe. Follow through with the plan because he will keep bending back and forth because he knows he doesn’t have full control.

"I can only speak to my own experiences and feelings in regards to my domestic violence experiences. But I have heard from others and we’ve had similar feelings. 

I think a lot of people stay in abusive relationships for different reasons. And I think a lot of people who haven’t experienced abuse or they were able to get out after one experience of violence towards them, judge those who stay in violent relationships. And I think that makes things worse for the victims. The blame gets shifted from the abuser to the victim for staying as long as they did or continue to do. It’s like telling the victim that they deserve this because it’s a consequence for choosing to stay. 

I think this is so dangerous for the victim. It adds to the emotional hardship that they are already facing.

I am happy I found this sub. I wrote a long text but realized that if my wife found it, she would know it was me and her the text ist about. So I'm not posting the full context to my story. My text is deleted, but it felt good to write my true feelings which I usually only make up with myself. So thank you for that.

Short version: I got groomed, ""classical"" toxic relationship, from posivity and praise to social isolation, shouting and physical abuse, and I'm still in this marriage, trying to provide her the best life I can (financial provider + 99% of chores) as to not make her angry. I'm basically just trying to survive until she dies, and keep up with whatever she wants me to do until then, to not suffer even more. I don't have the power to get out, she is too strong and too forceful and at the same time keeps me too busy and puts me down enough for me to not miraculously regrow confidence or strength.

If you would like to know more, also considering my case is the ""non-classic"" domestic abuse from f to m, I'm open to answer questions.

I have not documented the physical abuse because she forced me to delete pics I took and made it worse afterwards the first time I did. Next time, she checked my phone again and I was just glad the first experience had me not make pictures again. She, on the other hand, mentioned ""jokingly"" that I was hitting her to friends, plus I also defended myself once during the earlier days (tried to keep her off me, which left a mark on her arm), which might give her ""proof"", because obviously I did not check if she documented the situation. This, adding her smartness and manipulative behaviour, makes me heavily fear a divorce for both, financial reasons and for my own well being.

I will most likely be filing bankruptcy. I’m only 26 so I’ll still be young when it’s off my credit. She deliberately hid maxed credit cards from me so I didn’t know about them until my wages were garnished. I have multiple judgments against me. It ruined me because I had to work massive overtime to keep up and not lose my house and keep the lights on. It was deliberate because she knew it would be extremely hard for me to get an apartment or anything with destroyed credit, garnishments, and so much overtime I’m exhausted and can’t think, as well as having to pay her bills too. We have some savings but in a bank account she can access and she wouldn’t let me take any out. It’s hard. But better than having zero income too, it’s just not as easy as you’d think it would be.

"This is hard to condense into a post but I will try to just give a general outline. I’m looking for some insight and advice, but here’s a little context:

My best friend’s boyfriend went through a 2.5 year period of emotionally abusing her. He had this obsessive, persistent belief that she was cheating on him (even though she has never once given him any reason to think that and is genuinely one of the most loyal people I know). 

It got worse with time. Most nights that we went out together with our friends composed of him calling/FaceTiming 15+ times in a row and blowing up her phone with texts. After she would have a few drinks, almost every time, she would have a complete breakdown and pour everything out about what was actually going on in her day to day. Otherwise, she would bottle it up and be vague when we would check in with her when she was sober. 

He started tracking her by placing tracking devices under her car, used black lights to try and find cum on her car seats, put microphones in their shared bedroom,  continued to obsessively FaceTime her over and over when they were apart to check on who she was with, went through her phone without consent and with no reason to, would go thru her Instagram and Facebook follower/friends and interrogate her about random men, drive past her house to see if she was home and to make sure no strange cars were there. 

There were many nights where I drove to her house and picked her up sobbing. Throughout this whole period, i was constantly questioning if I was doing the right thing and if I was doing enough - where it was it appropriate for me to step in and how much I could even really do, as i knew it was ultimately her decision about whether to stay or leave. I was always worried about her safety and the possibility of his fragile mental state snapping and changing everything in just a moment. 

A few friends and I had an intervention with her, and we really tried the best we could to support her and be completely honest about what we were seeing and that she didn’t deserve it - that we were always here for her with no strings attached, no questions asked, no judgement. Just call us. She is my best friend and tells me everything, and I didn’t find out until months later that she tried to kill herself. That was a real moment of realizing how bad it was. 

Fast forward to about 6 months ago, she tells me he’s going to rehab and that he was addicted to street adderall, which is essentially meth. He has been on the trajectory of recovery and now lives at a sober house. Their relationship is seemingly going better, and I admit I can see some change from the outside - he’s not constantly FaceTiming her when we’re together and she’s not having breakdowns when she has a few drinks her. I genuinely do believe he is getting better, but I also feel that he just generally has the mindset in which he makes his insecurities and his instability on her problem and responsibility. 

It feels so hard to forgive him after seeing what he put my best friend through. He wants to meet up to talk and “make amends” but I don’t even know where to start. I do believe people can change and and that everyone is worthy of understanding and benefit of the doubt, but it’s just so hard for me to wrap my head around what “making amends” would even look like. You drove my friend to suicide. You completely traumatized her, broke her trust, and stole 2.5 years of her life due to your choices and your paranoia. I really don’t know how to best support her because I know she loves him and wants us to be able to share openly about him and their relationship. I know she feels this uncomfortable tension from me (we’ve talked about it) when she talks about him and she wants to work on repair and eventually be able to bring him around to social events.

I’m wondering if anyone has had any experience with something similar to this or has any advice about how to approach the conversation with him (she will not be present for it). What does repair look like without just brushing aside the years of hurt as if they’ve disappeared and left no mark? ?

TL;DR my best friend’s boyfriend abused her for 2.5 years but got sober and is looking to make amends. How do I approach this conversation with understanding and belief that people can change for the better while also holding him accountable? I don’t trust him and I want him to understand the gravity of the damage he caused."	Fit_Ad1920	post	24.322969592697895	female	White	0.011753065511584282	na	na	na	4	domesticviolence	no prediction.

"I definitely wouldn't see him. He wants to ""make amends"" so that HE can feel better, not because he's truly sorry. (That's just my take from my own experiences. May not be accurate).

He needs to have at least one full year sober before he jumps back into this relationship with your friend. If I were her, I'd dump him for good and live my best life.

I never got to a better life for myself.

I never got to find peace and healing. 

I understand all of the very real reasons why it is so hard to get away from our abusers. Obviously, I was never able to overcome them myself. They exist and they are so valid. 

But if you have even the slightest ounce of hope, courage, options, chances, and safety to do so, I hope you take it.

My time may have run out. 

Don’t let your time run out before you get to a life where you feel free, alive, hopeful, peaceful, calm and strong. 

If you ever have the chance, take it for me.

I would give anything to have that chance now.

I hope you can change your story."	amongthewildflowers9	post	29.945768922907536	male	White	0.12338986247777939	na	na	na	15	domesticviolence	no prediction.

I once thought I had no hope, no chances to make it, no options. I lost my identity, my innerself connection, my hope, my purpose. I went to therapy seeking help to make the decision to stay and keep trying, or to run far with nothing. I learned I had options, that I mattered, that I have rights, and that my rights have been taken from me and violated. Now I am rediscovering myself and starting to awe myself at my qualities.

"I’m out, but petrified. It’s been a year now. 

I lost my SSDI on a technicality because I was abused/gaslit by a few ex-doctors (didn’t test me for an illness that I turned out having—MS, SLE, EDS, MeCFS and more), so that only makes it that much harder. I can’t work to re-earn credits, so I’m pretty much dependent upon a small inheritance (my mother passed two years ago), and my kids. 

He left me with all the debt, and I don’t have enough to pay for food/housing, and a lawyer. 

But it’s better than dealing with him.

I’m not jumping for joy in this situation after 35 years (yep, 35–and he made sure we had no savings), but it’s better than everything we went through when he was here. I have been NC with him (he doesn’t reciprocate, unfortunately), mostly because I know there’s nothing I could say that’s going to change his behavior. His texts alone are enough proof to me that he’s not learned a thing since I have been NC. 

But, I understand you. It’s hard to leave, especially after you get sick. That was one of my last “excuses” for staying with him: I’m “damaged goods”, not desirable anymore… I had so many reasons why I couldn’t “just leave”. 

After the last episode with him though—involving a 🔫, an all-night “mantrum”, and then him leaving for “a prescription” and not coming back—was the final straw that broke the camel’s back. 

I told him that night that either things changed or I was done, and he figured he could just continue his games without consequence. His biggest mistake? I always keep my promises. He called my “bluff” and lost. 

I just wish I didn’t have to worry about money/future like this. I thank God every day for my (adult) kids—they make sure that I have everything I need. 2/3 are also NC with him, sadly. 

Best of luck to you with however you choose to live your life. My thoughts of comfort are with you. 🙏🏼💗"	amongthewildflowers9	reply	na	na	na	0.12338986247777939	no	strong	no	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.

Hi all, the incident happened 4 weeks ago and there’s been a lot holding me back from filing a police report. I spoke with my cop friend about the options and I decided at the time I didn’t want to do it. Now that some weeks have gone by and the situation at hand my partner deserves consequences. Is it too late to file? My marks and bruising are gone but I still have photos of the incident and one from 2 years ago.

Not too late to file a report but depending on the area you're in there might be less that can be done. If you've pictures of the aftermath of what that person did it might be easier. If you do report, it will be on file if he does this again and it will be easier for him to be prosecuted because of his history. it's always beneficial to report, even if you don't get the justice you deserve right now.

He owes over 10,000 in debt for our house and he has 20k at the last place it’s in both our names so if I apply to my own places I won’t be approved. I held off on doing anything in hopes he’d pay a large chunk of debt so I can keep my house. He hasn’t paid anything yet and has been staying at his brothers for 4 weeks now.

"You can file a protection order. You don't need a lawyer to do so. Go to court, ask questions, do it. It gets approved the same day and he gets served right away. That will keep him out of the house. So you and your son stay. He has to keep pay the mortgage. If he doesn't you still will have a hearing for the PO, and you have to have your evidence ready. You can do this without a lawyer, but it will be hard for you if he gets a lawyer. You have to say your truth. The judge decides if your case has merit go keep the PO and you can ask the Judge for spouse maintence, and child Support. 

If you were to the police to denounce him, that will get him arrested and he might loose his job. The protection order kicks him out of the house and keeps him away from you. 

Check the laws in your state. You won't get evicted this soon. Foreclosures take months, but you need a source of income in the mid time. 

You mention 30k in debt, and which at least half is yours. It isn't much debt. Seriously. It might sound different today but you'll get back on your feet soon.

Everything feels so weird right now. He doesn’t know that I caught him cheating yet so things are normal between us and it’s so weird. I feel like this is the perfect time to leave and I’m feeling good about it but also so strange. Never seeing him again is making me so sad. It’s all so hard to comprehend. Everything in my life is about to change so drastically if I can do it. I think I can. But it also seems so far fetched. So unlikely… I’m definitely scared. In less than 2 weeks I think… I’m not sure when exactly…. I don’t have too much of a plan yet. I hope I can keep it inside that I know long enough or that could ruin everything.

"I spent the last 6 months knowing I was going to have to end things but stuck in a logistics rut, he finally lost his shit so badly last week I had to rush through it and I'm still kind of reeling with this new reality. 
I gotta say I felt like such a bullshitter these past few months, he'd talk about future plans with the house and vacations and I'd just do what I could to smile and nod along. I continued to have sex with him on demand even though I hadn't enjoyed it since late last summer, after I got over 5 months of not being able to feel intimate cuz he beat me the next day (both times). He beat me the day after that time too.   It was one more thing that I felt bad about, maybe things were my fault, maybe it was getting better ... It was not. Just go, get out when it's safe, it only gets worse as time progresses. If he is ""only"" cheating on you that's plenty of reason to escape, if he's hitting you too it will escalate the longer he goes thinking you'll never leave.  Don't feel bad for assholes.

It is really hard faking it. We’re supposed to move across country in a few weeks. We’ve been going out to nice dinners the past few nights, enjoying each others company and talking about how great our future will be. It’s really tough because sometimes I forget I’m not going too… I don’t wanna have fun with him but I have been. Of course he’s going through a phase right now where he wants to spend time with me and have fun together. I wish he was being distant right now it would be so much easier. It seems surreal that I will suddenly not have him in my life anymore. I will also lose my job (I work for him) and a few of my friends (they also work under him) as well. I have known for a long time that I wanted to leave. I still thought things would get better and I always tried to make it work.

He is away for work, and this is the opportunity I’m taking to leave. I have already moved out, he does not know, and tomorrow I’m going to court to file an OOP and custody.

I am not going back on my decision. I am leaving and I’m taking my daughter and myself to a better and safer future.

"She can, but it’s super trivial for him to argue that in court. It’s not remotely a defense against him being the dad. Despite MRA claims if you’re married it’s pretty easy to establish paternity. In most states it’s a given, in others it’s assumed but the bio dad comes forward he can fairly easily make a claim. Shitty husbands try to claim infidelity and refuse to be put on the birth certificate all the time and the courts give zero shits. There are zero states that not being on the certificate denies him rights. 

However, the courts will look down on OP and say she’s trying to keep the dad from the kid. She needs a lawyer immediately. She needs an advocate to walk her through it. She’s post partum and scared. I’m really worried she’s going to listen to this birth certificate thing and think her daughter is protected and he can’t access her. It’s not true. She needs help.

I looked it up when my wife told me she’d say I wasn’t the dad and take the kids. She absolutely will get in trouble for hiding the kid if he files for temp custody as a married father, unless she grabs a lawyer and gets things rolling on the DV charges. Men accused of DV get their kids all the time. Hopefully she already has it in process. She needs an advocate, she can’t do it post partum and alone.

Male domestic abusers are way more likely to murder the kids.

"I was psychologically tortured by the covert narcissist I married. He never hurt me physically. I sometimes wish he would have just hit me instead.

When my friend was hospitalized with a broken nose her husband gave her, everyone understood she had been through something traumatic. Everyone rallied around her and protected her when her husband started stalking her afterwards. Her nose healed and she got out of her marriage. She of course had lingering trauma from it all but outwardly she healed  and the world accepted her abuse story.

But for my marriage, not even I understood how much trauma I was absorbing until one day I couldn't absorb one more drop and my eyes finally opened. When you show up around people who love you, after having been reduced to nothing, your self esteem at 0 and you feel guilty for having regular human needs, no one who hasn't experienced it actually gets it. It's just words! Walk away! Leave if you can't handle it! Takes two to fight! Wow he seems like such a great guy, what did you say to provoke him? Hell, most of the people will believe his story instead, I've found. He's such a charmer if you don't know him well.

This isn't about competing in the suffering Olympics against those who have been physically harmed. I didn't have it worse, but I just want to say to those in similar situations and feeling doubt, that this was domestic violence, too.

A covert (fragile) narcissist is the more manipulative narcissist. They will bully, but their real power lies in psychologically disarming you by making you pity them because they're so weak. They control you by using your best qualities -- your niceness, your empathy, your deep well of kindness, your big heart -- against you. Once they have your sympathy, they obligate you by way of favors that make you stay in because it'd be wrong to leave after they fixed your car or whatever. And how awesome are they? They did you a favor! Would a deranged narcissist do that? No!

And then little by little they eat away at you, change you into their image, enmesh with you. You become a hostage of your own guilt for leaving someone so wounded. Leaving them would be a moral failure of yours. Thinking more kindness from you will set it all right is Stockholm's syndrome. They imprison you with the false shame they gaslight you into believing. You are to blame for everything and they make sure everyone knows it. You know something is wrong but you're already up to your ears in quicksand and don't seem to know it.

They take responsibility for nothing they do wrong, no matter how small or obvious. But for you, they have a list of grievances a mile long you must accept as evidence of how bad you suck if you so much as raise an eyebrow at them. Nothing, and I mean nothing will ever feel resolved. Mine would bring up something I said in joking banter, YEARS after it was said, as if I meant it seriously and it was used as the reason he wouldn't help me with a simple chore or whatever.

If they can't avert accountability, the sob script comes out, the script they repeat to everyone about why they are so weak and pitiful and can't be held to regular adult standards. If you tell them to save the monologue they become unglued pathological liars, or just straight delusional.  That script is the only existing structure of their inner self, disagreeing with it destroys them.

Mine went as far as writing his victim script into a screenplay and getting people in our town to act out his script under the guise of him making a movie, to regain this structure after we split. I am not joking.

Mine, would incessantly tell everyone how humble and big-hearted he was. In reality he was the most greedy, thieving, entitled, cruel, vapid bastard who ever lived. When I told him a nicer version of that, it shook him at his core. He hammered into my head with incessant repetition that would make a CIA brainwasher take notes that he was so humble and sweet, he was practically Jesus Christ himself and he did this until I agreed. Everyone has to believe his script or it isn't true and he becomes unglued.

Me? There was no me. There was good him and bad him, I was bad him. Good him took credit for all of our family's triumphs, bad him (me) had to take credit for all the failures. In reality, he did nothing but work (covert narcissists typically become obsessed with an admirable pursuit that allows them to passively brag, since they don't really brag directly. But bragging about being hardworking is acceptable, so he worked and earned very good money. Many use religion). I was in charge of everything else, and I worked too (but it never counted for anything) and so I was the fall guy for the failures, the buffer between him and life. He often created so much chaos and it was my job to stabilize us to keep the plates spinning while he threw plates at me. *Learn how to play guitar to impress me! Do all the chores! Raise my child alone! Mow our huge lawn with a shitty mower! Pay the bills on time! Learn how to play the mandolin! Run all the errands! Why are you sitting down? Oh looks like you dropped a plate! Do you even want this family to succeed? You're lazy and selfish and spiteful and you dropped the plate on purpose so all my hard work was for nothing!*

 It was my sole responsibility to carry his emotional load for him and to process his emotions for him, because he has no inner self to do this. I bottled my emotions up and decided they weren't important until he'd antagonize me to become reactive and I'd explode, and then his status as victim would be reestablished and I went on a guilt trip. I often felt as if he was a toddler I had to soothe all the time.

If my existence reminded him that I wasn't him, but an entirely different person, he criticized me for trying to have something for myself that somehow disagreed with who he was. I was selfish. Self absorbed. Just a spoiled princess. He lived like a transient, so this meltdown might result from me wanting dental care, good shampoo, or buying birdfeeders because I liked watching all the birds in the yard only I took care of. It wasn't his hobby or one he told me to have, so I was reminding him of my autonomy with this grave insult.

The coercion started nearly immediately but I didn't understand that's what it was. ""If you don't move in with me I'll have to break up with you."" By the end it was, ""If you don't hug me I'll take your car away."" ""If you don't commit tax fraud for me, I'll divorce you and take everything from you."" Divorce was a big threat because I raised his daughter from a toddler to a teen and as a step parent I would have no options to have any custody and I felt protective of her. In the end I did take custody of her by way of guardianship.

He peed on me in the shower, because he had to shower with me every single time. He farted on me every chance he got. Once he farted directly in my face at dinner in front of his friend. Just in case I forgot what I meant to him.

I endured this for 13 years. And yeah, I am coming out of this stronger and better than how I entered it. I learned a lot of lessons that grew me up because I was a mess of a human when I entered this. But the cost is steep. I have no idea how to act around people anymore. I feel judged by everyone. Small criticism shakes me to my core. I apologize for everything. I feel feral because he was feral and I took on a lot of his mannerisms. I was isolated so long I felt like an alien when I tried to rejoin society.

And I am still enduring his abuse every time I have to interact with him in court. I won a domestic violence restraining order for harassment and coercive control but he still abuses me in court, in front of everyone, and no one knows what's happening because it's like his own secret language for me and only I understand what he is doing.

So, if you aren't being physically harmed, but you identify with my story, you are surviving abuse make no mistake. 

I got away from him 8 months ago. These 8 months have been hard but beautiful. I enjoy every second away from him. I always stayed because I thought I'd miss him too much and hate being alone and those thoughts trapped me in. I have not missed him once. Not one singular time have I felt my life would be better if I could share this moment with him. He was the most joyless, fraudulent, self-centered soul I have ever encountered and every day was worse than the previous with him. I fantasized every day in the last two years of my marriage of hanging myself from our balcony. I am so glad I decided instead to walk away. I will likely come out of our divorce wearing a barrel and shamed out of town. But I'll rock the barrel, and I'll leave our shithole town and go have fun in a big city. I am so excited to leave it all behind. There can be a light at the end of it.

I’m a survivor of DV and I’d rather that than the psychological torment that was inflicted on me.

With the psychological abuse, I thought I was going crazy bc no one saw or endured what I did and it was never done in an obvious manner. As a result I felt very alone in my recovery, no one understood what I was going through and no one knew how to help.

For  physical intimidation (he has blocked exits, touched me and made threats of spankings) a mixed bag in terms of it helping me realize what was going on.

On the other hand, fear that he might hurt me was used for further control and manipulation. It's a whole added layer of complication if you're trying to keep everyone  staying physically safe. Your friend, for example, was at a heightened risk to her life for leaving. It has messed with me so much trying to figure out what to do and worrying about physical safety.

"I’m sorry for what you’ve suffered. I’m challenged by the line *“I sometimes wish he would have just hit me instead”*, because while I can appreciate the sentiment of what’s being expressed, the praxis, from my experience is very different.

I understand that DV is often seen thru the lens of physical abuse, but it concerns me to see it put on a scale with other forms of abuse.

These are different harms. And different harms carry different pains. And some different harms carry similar pains. I don’t think that idea dilutes the validity of anyone’s suffering.

This really touched a chord, and I’ve seen a few posts to this effect and it’s irksome.

I think survivorship is about camaraderie. Not about using weights to try to say “we’ll, I’d rather be psychological tortured than physical”, as an example.

"Yes. It's okay to almost wish what you would almost  wish for. In fact I think it's normal in general for the body to sort of long for  a physical manifestation of what it is experiencing inside in order to understand what is happening. Physical abuse can make it faster to parse although the  acute situation is more of an  immediate emergency. 

Also many  abusers who use physical abuse start with something so subtle that you don't believe it's even real and then it's like a boiling frog situation. I think even some of those who have had physical abuse would have rather had a hit out of the blue, than the slow build up. 

I think almost all of us here on the sub can relate to. ""If he/she had only done ___ behavior out of the blue, I would have realized what was going on.""

"We've been together for over 30 years. I have a lot of regrets, and 90% of them are tied to him one way or another. I don't think it's possible to burrow any deeper. There isn't any physical violence anymore, thankfully -- there was, the first 4ish years, and... well, suffice to say, at a certain point I told him if he ever did it again, he'd better make it good because it would be the *last* time he did it to anyone. For some reason he took me at my word. The psychological stuff, though? It took me until maybe 10 years ago to clue in that that's what it was. Now I'm going through perimenopause, where your bs meter is maxxed out, and your thought process is different from when estrogen softened the edges of reality a bit. I snap back now, stronger and more often. I have way less patience and I see through most of the tactics he uses. I was put on an antidepressant and I stay far more calm and cool-headed during conflict (which of course is largely manufactured by him), and it drives him nuts. He's so used to my dissolving into tears, that he doesn't seem to know how to process it. He'd make a point of bragging how calm he was, only now he puts it down in me (of course).

When it came to the good food, was it a matter of ordering what you wanted in restaurants, cooking what you wanted, or you were with people that cooked for you?  What were the dishes that had your taste buds going?  

&#x200B;

> Had good sex.

Did this happen in the space of new committed relationships?  Dating?  One-night stands?  As for the sex being good and not bad, was it simply the basics of not being selfish, solid communication, etc.  Or was it more specific like, your partners had better bodies than your ex, had better equipment, etc.?

"I tried to make clear my intention was to reach people who were wrestling with whether their similar experience was abuse or was valid and counted as domestic violence. I see a lot of physically abused people here question if physical abuse is even actually abuse, so I know there have to be many reading here that really question their experience if they aren't being physically assaulted. And I often feel kind of like an outlier here because I did not experience physical abuse from my intimate partner but that is obviously my projection. Everyone here has been accepting of my story. 

But in society it's worse, I feel like when I try to explain why I was able to take my stepkid away from her sole custody parent and I won a restraining order all I can say is something like ""my husband is mean and says mean stuff"" and it feels so obtuse and silly. But inside I feel slashed to pieces by it all and just can't really explain why it matters so much and so to explain it to regular people I often say I sometimes wish he would just hit me so they'll understand. Even my stepkid said that to me separately one time without ever hearing me say it.

I'm sorry if that line was insulting to your or anyone's experience, truly. You are right to stand up for that experience and I'm glad you did. Thank you for exploring this so deftly with me.

"I'm so sorry you went through all that. I am in a group online called Betrayal Trauma Recovery [btr.org](https://btr.org). Most of the women there experienced covert abuse similar to yours. So I may be more familiar than the average person and forget. Most of the coaches are really great, in case you're looking for more support. Yes I imagine that the lack of support and understanding from others is hard. I have gotten that too from people even though my  husband has gotten a little physical, in my area of the country people tend to think I'm  overreacting and that he just lost his temper.

I don't think there's a lot of competing here, but rather there's a lot of people (mostly women) in society who tend to think, ""Wow, if my parter/spouse had ever been physically abusive, I would have figured it out immediately and gotten out of the situation without any help, I would have stood up for myself."" So I think what you said is just triggering reminding us of how people think we're just unintelligent doormats.  I would have thought that about myself too, that I would have figured it out, but then it happened and I actually needed people to talk me through the situation because the mind games are so intense.

Nonetheless, even in the middle of things, I would STILL sometimes almost wish he would do something worse, just something to help me ""wake up"" to what was going on.  So I totally validate your feelings. I think we're just trying to say, ""just because we got abused and didn't figure it out, we're not idiots and we're not any less intelligent/not more willing to accept abuse."" Does that make sense?

I usually tell people that my husband is very abusive but I don't want to go into details because it's too personal. I know they are assuming that if I'm trying to leave, that he's probably physically harming me, but I don't really care. Staying vague has gotten me more support.

I dont know how that would statistically work. I'm not sure if the studies on choking involve mutual violence or violence from one party only. I will say that an environment where you do become mutually violent can put you in a very spot. The bones in the throat are extremely sensitive, and imagine if you had crushed your partners throat. Many abuse victims look at fighting back as defensive only, not a mutual abuser. I believe in the eyes of the law many places, you would be looked at an offender still, and charged with murder of you were to kill your partner while defending yourself. Many abuse victims are in prison for killing their abusers.		reply	na	na	na	0.9982549548149109	no	no	no	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.

Another mom suggested these baby safe cup feeders that I can try. I want to have him sufficiently able to eat from me before I get the actual custody stuff so I can prove to the court I can feed him.

Unfortunately CPS warned me since she hadn’t directly targeted the kids that 50/50 is still a strong possibility once we go to court if she gets parenting clases and therapy and shit. Hopefully she will become a better person but idk. I want better for my kids than I did.

For some hope, I had similar struggles except for violence as a teen. A lot of self harm and addiction. I went through rehab and I managed to be more stable. Obviously considering the marriage I got into I still turned out stupid, but much better than I could have. I’m not in prison or doing drugs on the street.

We’re supposed to move in a few weeks and I already was upset about that.

OP, it’s really hard to function when you are sleep deprived and in trauma-freeze mode, but if at all possible you have got to keep yourself functioning enough to get yourself and your emotional support  animal safe. Exhaustion is a great persuader, and will allow you to believe that these predators will look out fir and care for the things you hold dear. That won’t happen. They will just use them to hold you hostage. So please, keep calling the DV shelter, stress the desperation of your situation and the need to find a safe place for yourself and your pet. Even if you can find somewhere to temporarily foster your pet, that is enough. Yes, you might be homeless for a bit, however it is better than dead, or on life support. I don’t mean to minimize your situation or your fears, honestly I don’t, but you are in clear and immediate danger. These people are unstable, and you need to get out. NOW.

They were lazy and said since they weren’t st the actual incident they couldn’t do anything, but the DV advocate at the center told me that the state law has a mandatory arrest for DV so she’s escalating that with the police.

Stay away from booze, find a sitcom that takes the edge off things (I watch Big Bang Theory), and find a way for you to go through the hardest moments. Sometimes it’s literally one minute at a time.

I still cry and suffer, but I learned how to take the edge off the worst of the pain with little things. You can keep yourself busy with preparing your place for your kids, a small project like painting a wall or rearranging cabinets. If you have friends, call them. If you have family, let them invade you with food and attention. If you have no one, check single dad groups. 

The thing with crying is that it can happen at any time for any reason. Think of it as a way for your brain to evacuate the pain, not as an indicator of how the future will turn out.

"He destroyed me. I'm a 100lb female. I am 5'3 1/2"" in my shoes. I am 40 years old.

By the end of our relationship I was catching combo punches to the face by this ex cage fighter who is three years younger than me. I have reset my own broken jaw more than once. I am missing two back teeth thanks to a right hook. He strangled me multiple times. On the last occasion of his strangling, I lost bladder control, my trachea cracked, I was unable to speak normally for weeks, and my singing voice,  which I valued greatly, was permanently damaged. 

I have lied and lied and lied to cover this shit up.

After the last beating, which almost resulted in my death, I threw him out of the home we shared, my late grandmother's. I can't pay the bills alone (I do not own this property) so I made myself homeless. 

He whispered sweet nothings and promised he had changed. He kept up this illusion for 2 months. My stupid ass went back. 

This morning he decided he didn't believe it when I said ""I love you."" (??? DUDE YOU NEARLY MURDERED ME AND I'M STILL HERE WHAT MORE DO YOU WANT???) so he stood too close, loomed over me, and *yelled,* ""DO YOU?""

I got scared and told him to step back.

He screamed ""FUCK YOU,"" spun on his heel, and left me. 

So *I* left.

He barraged me with messages while I was driving away.

I tried to talk to him when I got ""home"" (my parents' house, I'm disabled in more than one direction by now, none of it is documented, and I'm fucked). He tried to twist things and tell me I had abandoned him. That I drove for more than an hour to a different state *on purpose just to hurt him* by ""denying him the reassurance he needed,"" and it was all *my* fault.

I told him I would not see him again until some conditions were met: that he got into therapy and got out of his parents' house, where his sister and her hubby are smoking fentanyl enough to fuck *me* up through the wall in a different room. He had blamed his former abuse on drugs, so ok. Get out of the drugs.

He did not reply, but he's changed his Facebook status to ""single.""

When she was almost 12 the atmosphere in our home had turned heavy and we let the kid move back in with her grandmother (she lived there as a toddler/kindergartener before her mom lost custody and she was homesick).

I have a flight for us 3 and were going to pretend to be going to a doctor appointment. Hes never been to one and always sleeps during the day…But once we are safe in the airport should i tell him that the kids are safe with me or explain why i left? i plan on getting a protective order once i get to my destination. words of encouragement would be greatly appreciated. i keep telling myself im doing thr right thing. we only have a few days until the flight.	shalomcxc	post	29.179905646888606	female	White	0.9982498288154602	na	na	na	34	domesticviolence	no prediction.

In my opinion, no - do not leave a physical note, don't give him any type of headstart to take action. If this is in the United States and you're taking the children across state lines, I'd recommend contacting an attorney. (Technically, you don't need his permission to take the children as long as there's no court order in place, but you want to avoid him trying to use the legal system against you.) You also want to immediately file for sole custody when you apply for a protective order. If you feel you must let him know the children are safe, send an email at the very last minute.	shalomcxc	reply	na	na	na	0.9982498288154602	weak	no	no	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.

"No, do not give him a heads up.  It took every once of will that i had not to respond to mine a few days ago, there was an outstanding protective order but they couldn't find him to serve it (they were not motivated, it was a civil thing) and i think if i'd told him during the first couple days that it was pending that he would have dodged them longer and shown up at my moms house.  Prior to being served he had sent me a non-apology about being ""mean"" to us (flying broken glass hitting the kid, my bent glasses frame from him punching me in the head and the bruises on my arms were merely ""mean"") with some sunk cost fallacy distractions about how long we'd been friends (27 years) and i drafted a response, pared it down, drafted another one - pared that one down, and then finally got talked out of responding at all.  3 days later I re-read what he wrote and don't even understand why it upset me, it was all thoughts i had and i felt validated yet angry that it took me getting beaten and leaving to get validation, and now i'm like wth where even IS the validation you though you saw?  Once you've landed? I don't know, custody is definitely important (working on mine now) but you don't want him reporting you missing.  Perhaps have a neutral third party contact him, i ended up calling his dad to find out where he was so they could serve him and I told him i wasn't able to say much or speak to my soon to be ex considering the no contact order that was pending.

point being, all the pity and concern for his well being will turn to anger soon enough.  i am 100% sure i will bad sad about this again later, but i am trying to channel all the suppressed rage of the last decade-ish to make sure i protect my kid."	shalomcxc	reply	na	na	na	0.9982498288154602	weak	strong	no	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.

Don’t leave a note. It will somehow be used against you. I was in a painfully similar situation where my three year old was assaulted as well as myself. I had to flee with the children while he was sleeping. We did get a protective order (best decision I ever made) and finally got done with court. Be mindful of state laws and do your research. When I called the domestic violence hotline before leaving I was told I had 48 hours to inform him of where I took the children.

DO NOT LEAVE A NOTE...Get away clear first. And silence is the best goodbye. Any further correspondence could be done via legal teams . But my advice ( from experience), if he's a real narcissist RUN AND DON'T LOOK BACK. Raise your children alone and in peace, these types will re abuse  you through the children( its merciless).

Contact your local domestic violence shelter for guidance on your exit and safety plan. Be sure you have a DV advocate to support you along the way. Ideally, contact a lawyer now and get everything in place so he can be served after you've reached safety. Its likely he will use DARVO tactics to become the victim so by making sure all your ducks are in a row with a lawyer and advocate, you're covering all bases.

"I'm sorry for what you and your beautiful little ones are going through. You are an amazon mom, you look after your kids, care for them and love them. You are worry for their future mental health, and all that only people who truly deeply love someone do.

I Agree with prior posts. Do not tell him absolutely anything. Do not explain yourself. Don't leave any notes or call him from the airport. If you leave before you talk to the cops on your county, maybe you should contact them to tell them you and the kids are safe and that you run away, this is in case he calls them and badmouths you. But, check the laws in your state first, family law, domestic violence, etc. 

File a protection order as soon as you are safe. You might have it a bit hard if you move to another state, but you need to have one. 

Once you are safe call all of your friends and tell them you are OK. Don't tell anyone where you are. 

I think your plan is good, and I am glad you are planning! This says so many great things about you. 

Keep in mind that some states punish the parent who lives the household with the kiddos and issue amber alerts. I know you have all of the reasons to run, and it's for your safety and the safety of your kids. But if you have never reported him, and he is one of those charming narcissists, he can potentially make himself believable. 

If you own the house or your name is on the lease, the joint accounts, credit cards, all financial matters, etc, have it docs all organized and available. All these will matter if when you make your move. 

Once you are safe cancel your name on all accounts you share with him. Get all of the money out your joint checking account. If you don't, he will. 

Don't neglect the lease, the mortgage, bills in your name, etc. You don't want creditors damaging your credit score now, you have kids to provide for and you'll need money to pay for lawyers. 

Best of lucks for you. I hope you can escape right away. Every minute is important. Also, take with you all evidence, and make a copy of it. 

You can also file a protection order in your state and stay in the household if you choose. I understand your need to leave, overall it might be best to put distance in between.

There very well may be a custody battle (I’m in my third year of it right now, and statistically, abusers like to maintain control through claiming parental alienation and trying to gain custody).

"Great advice and you got my upvote, but unless you are also a minor - it is definitely not appropriate to offer to go to direct messages for something like this. I'm not being accusatory - just pointing out the obvious for you.

That being said - the issue with going to the police is that they are only going to help you if you can provide some evidence. Hopefully you can. Otherwise, it will depend entirely on which officer you talk to and even how busy they are that day.

A school counselor is a great first option. You can go into the office and let them know you want to see a counselor. Explain the whole situation to them. They will be the most likely to help you in a professional manner. It is also much less personal that way - it is their job to hear your story and to help you.

I just blocked you from every single place I can think of. So after this message you won't be able to have any type of contact with me. You destroyed our family with your actions and have been unable to say ""sorry"" and have shown to have zero respect towards me and even others. You are selfish and a horrible person. Do not touch any of my stuff as I know exactly what I have left in the appartment. I will go there on Monday night but I do not want to see you at all so I want you to be away as I have no idea how long it will take me and I don t want to ever see you again.

And never come close to me or my daughter.

I never thought I could stop loving you but you do not deserve that.

Adieu

I want to add that he also still owes me quite a bit of money and him blocking me everywhere is clearly also him not taking any responsibility for that either.

Do any of you have any tips on how to handle the situation on him coming here to pick up his things? I don’t want to be around, but i’m also scared he might take some of my things or break something."

"I would be there for sure. Have two strong men with you so he doesn't try anything. Sometimes the police will come out, I think? You might drop by your local station and ask them for help. Tell them it's a DV situation and you want them there for safety while he picks up his things. 

Another solution is not to give him the option of coming back. Tell him you've put all his things in storage and paid for one month. Give him the address and code to get in. If he says you've kept some of his things, make him prove it.

"I’m afraid it’s happened.
He broke me.
I don’t cry anymore.
Crying means I care.
Crying means I want to fight.
But what happens when no fight remains.
When you haven’t been bruised,
But you are still damaged.
When it’s not a worm that pierced your skin
But a seeping rot that creates empty space in its path,
As the outside looks fresh and red.
Forgive the analogy.
Sometimes talking in parallel concepts
Gives distance to the reality that he finally did it.

"It’s terrible you’re feeling this way, and I have felt similarly. In my own experience, the answer is both yes and no. The body keeps the score, abuse changes you, but so does everything in life, even good things.

Our personalities in many ways are built of our coping mechanisms and habits, most people’s personalities never change at their core. However, for example some of my old partier friends have had kids. They still want to party sometimes, but a whole side of their personality is now devoted to their child. 

Likewise with abuse, my humor is going to stay a bit dark/snide, but I absolutely have moments now where I’m over at a friend’s house and speak in cutesy silly voices to their cats while giving them head pats. I experience joy, I have a lighter side again. I never really lost it necessarily. 

Abuse doesn’t break you, and aside from permanent brain damage, nothing technically should or will. You are only changed. 

The reservation may never go away, but that is part of your mind attempting to keep you safe. I’m still reserved, especially at work and with strangers. Many times I slow drip and volunteer information about who I really am to see what people will do with it. I am often disappointed. But there are other reserved people you can love and trust, you will find them and you will help each other to be safe and heal.

Just be careful, stay safe, give yourself grace, space, and time to take it slow."	discretescream	reply	na	na	na	0.9960464835166931	weak	strong	no	na	domesticviolence	failed
"I had lost mine too. I became serious all the time because my life was so serious. It comes back with healing and freedom. Seriously embracing the fact that you are free and nobody is controlling you. Several weeks after escape I sat with a gallon of ice cream and a package of Oreos in my bed I made a mess. I made every picture of my house crooked and every other rebellious thing I could think of and it really cheered me up.

I forgave everybody, for me not them, and letting go of anger, frustration, revenge and our wishes allowed me to hand them over to karma. And I’ve been lucky enough to see karma in action and yes it’s more punishment than I could ever of dished out.

But the best thing I’ve done For me, I got back to an even better version,  was  I joined the app tictok (because of covid).  It does have a depressed side of it that can trigger and trap but there’s positivity and inspiration. My funniest videos are when I’m my saddest because I’m trying to cheer myself up and make at least on person smile. I started out using audios that I lip-synch two of every fight song available. It felt so good! I have course cannot sing to save my life but I sure can look like I am and have the fun of doing it.

I started to see myself differently and to get support from other people. I’ve met hundreds of survivors and even created a second account just so I could help other survivors.

It’s some thing I definitely recommend. Of course that’s just one option. I’ve also volunteered to take care of kids which gave me the ability to act silly and a friend of mine started working at an animal shelter which made her feel so good about herself that she just got back to who she was.

I’m sure a trauma therapist would tell you that anytime you can access unconditional love, it heals. Working with the elderly was another thing I did, I just went in and visited once or twice a week and they are so happy to see you that they confirm your worth.

"Good question. I wondered the same. But then I realized, perhaps I don't need my old personality back?

It took me a bit of time to adjust. But after around 2 years of healing, for me it is sufficient to be just happy with my current life and personality. And in general, I am incredibly happy now.

I realized, that there are two major changes: yes, the abuse changes you. But freeing yourself from the abuse and living a new free life also changes you signifficantly.

Interestingly, People who have only known me for around 3 years have mentioned that I became so much more  relaxed and changed signifficantly for the better. I didn't realize this myself.

If you hadn't experienced the abuse, your personality would have developed in one way. Instead, through the abuse and from your strength to liberate yourself, it has changed in another way.

You must have built up a tremendeous amount of strength and courage to be able to free yourself from this situation. Now it is up to you, to shape your life, how you wish to live it.

All the research I have seen has said an anger management class can accrual make them worse and is not appropriate to help change their behavior. I'm scared for my kids when they are court ordered to have regular visits with him again and I'm not there for him to direct his anger towards.

"I’m not sure whether the court will accept this but if you have access or can find any peer reviewed studies that confirm or at least show it is plausible that Anger Management courses aren’t enough, try to have your counsel present it.

So currently he’s allowed supervised visits, is the supervisor you or someone from a social service? Again, if there’s a way to show in court your skepticism that would be good to add to what I’m assuming is a hearing you’re referring to in August.

I know it’s a little fucked to suggest this, and I don’t want to necessarily contribute to parental alienation (turning your kids against him) but if the children prefer not to see him, especially if they are over the age of 12: they do not have to and the court cannot force them."

At age 5 he was tested as gifted now he has an IEP for learning disabilities.  He's been away from his father for 18 months because his father's wife didn't want to deal with my son anymore.

Not that it helps but the judge accepting anger management vs batterers’ intervention class makes no difference except delaying his visits longer because batterers’ intervention are also ineffective.

"I’m not here to argue with people. I’m trying to watch what I say and give support as cautiously and conscientiously as I can.

I’m referring to parental alienation as a psychological term. If a parent is actively trying to turn a child against the other parent in any way, it undermines the child’s sense of safety and security in general. It is a concept that is hard to prove but I have experienced it.

My abusive parent actively unduly criticized, undermined, emotionally abused and manipulated me against my other parent. And while my other parent did attempt to keep me safe from the abuser, they also in their own way practiced parental alienation against my abusive parent denigrating even their good qualities and otherwise treating me like I could turn into our abuser if I got to close to them. My other parent did not fully grasp that we were being abused. I grew up thinking all of this was normal. 

Healthy Parenting, so far as I know, would involve the parents taking their issues (especially abuse) to each other and leaving the children out of it. Children have not developed enough and are still developing their personal tools in how to properly deal with conflict. If children are brought up knowing they cannot trust their parents word and don’t know who to turn to: I promise you it doesn’t help them out as they become adults."

While this is not the place to start an off-topic conversation about your beliefs surrounding abortion, women should feel safe & comfortable coming here to ask for advice, look for support or just vent on any & all topics that relate to DV, & sadly, the termination of a potential pregnancy is part of that. Especially given the fact that for women, pregnancy is one of the most common times for abuse to start &/or intensify. Not only are pregnant women at greater risk of abuse than the average person, but it is also used as another way to control the victim & prevent them from leaving. Not to mention the greater risk involved when bringing a child or another child into a relationship where abuse is happening. It’s also worth mentioning the fact that many states in the US now require CPS involvement for any home experiencing DV that has children present, even if the child has never been abused themselves or seen the abuse. I KNOW for a FACT CPS has no qualms about removing children from these homes either, as I am a former foster parent & had several children in my care that were removed from these types of situations. That means that a pregnant victim also has the potential of add'l trauma being added by having to fight CPS to keep their child. So, if a pregnant victim comes here & is considering, or has decided on termination, they should be met with nothing but unwavering support just like at any other time. Regardless of what a woman’s reasons are, they are hers & hers alone & she should not be forced to or made to feel so uncomfortable that she has to find support elsewhere bc someone else doesn't like the fact that she's considering abortion.

"I, 34 female, am in a long term relationship with my fiancé, 38 male. The relationship started off like a dream with him worshipping me and treating me like a queen. I’ve been in multiple relationships before but he is the first person i have ever loved. Like every couple, we ran into problems at one point and one of those problems was that i used substances 3-4 times a month. When he found out, he was extremely supportive and promised to help me. Only two days later though, when he got drunk, he called me a fucking whore and a dirty drug addict. He physically attacked me and ended up hitting me and pushing me off the bed, with me falling on the floor and him getting on top of me, pulling my pants down, slapping me and saying “i will put you to sleep now” proceeding to choking me until i started to feel dizzy. He let go. I was left hurt and scared. 
He did seek help for his violence, stopped drinking for a while, apologized over and over again and promised to change. 
I don’t think i ever got over this incident that happened about 6 months ago, and i still have an immense amount of anger for him. I feel unsafe often.
Since then multiple other abusive instances have happened, with him threatening to go to the police, me telling him to get out of the apartment and leave forever, him threatening to tell my parents about the substances, and to ruin my life. Yelling and pushing each other had become the norm at times when we got into fights. 
But as many bad moments there were, there are also good ones. Planning our future together, getting engaged, great sex, immense love, support, him worshipping me every step of the way. 
About a month ago he got jealous during a concert, when i said “mm” when one of the musicians presented himself to the audience. He ran out and left me there stranded. I was shocked and angry. I have been treating him very badly since. I have given him chance after chance to apologize but he thinks he’s in the right. We’ve had limited contact lately with him sleeping in the living room and me in the bedroom. I have been telling him multiple times that i want him out of the apartment. I know that this is wrong, and that he doesn’t feel safe in the relationship. 
Yesterday, he came home and packed his things and left. I begged him to stay but he said it’s too late and that i need to take the blame for everything that has happened lately. He told me how bad i have made him feel and i honestly did not realize and i feel so horrible about making him feel this way and not realizing it. He had people waiting in a car outside to take his stuff and leave. I told him that we both would need to recognize our mistakes and work on the relationship but he insisted that i need to apologize and take the blame for everything that has happened lately. 
I don’t know where he is, we have texted a bit since and there is hope but i don’t know if i should try to save this relationship. 
I don’t think that i am over all the abuse he has done to me yet, and it is very hard for me to accept all the blame now even though his violence, jealousy, problems with his ex wife, money problems, empty promises, lies, etc have put a big strain on our relationship as well. I know that i have anger problems, yelling at him way to often, and not being able to control my feelings at times, but it feels wrong to me to have to be the only one doing everything i can to make the relationship work. Am i seeing things wrong or is he exaggerating? Is the relationship worth saving?"	Alien_armpit	post	22.28001507967818	female	White	0.998701810836792	na	na	na	29	domesticviolence	no prediction.

"Someone who loves you will never abuse you like that. It sounds to me like what feels like love is actually “love bombing” where the abuser makes their victim feel amazing by showering them with attention, praise, etc. Then he abuses you physically and emotionally and gaslights you into thinking it’s your fault. Please take a few minutes to read about love bombing, trauma bonding and gaslighting. It also concerns me that he strangled you, as statistics have shown that abusers who engage in strangulation (even if it’s just for a couple seconds), are exponentially more likely to eventually murder their victims. 

I spent 10.5 years in a relationship that began with many red flags that I ignored and rationalized away and progressively became more and more psychologically, emotionally, and physically abusive. I once left him after three years and moved out and then got pulled back in for another 7.5, and I wish every day that I had listened to my gut instinct about the relationship and not gone back. I left at the point where I truly believed he would kill me someday and that’s no way to live.

Him moving out is actually a blessing because now you will have the space you need to come out of the brain fog abusers can put you in making you ashamed of your own behavior (another term to research is “reactive abuse”) and making you feel like it’s your fault and you deserved it. It’s not your fault and you NEVER deserve to be treated that way. That man is not capable of a loving, healthy relationship and you deserve better than that. 

PLEASE learn from my mistake and leave this man for good. I know it’s so, so hard, but keep coming back to this subreddit and if possible, start going to a group therapy and/or individual therapy for what you have been through. The individual therapy I went to was vital to start healing, but the group therapy was even more so because it was a group of women (and one man) who understood exactly what I was going through and it helped me stay strong in my decision to leave him.

Fifteen month is still an early relationship. He has shown you who he is: that he is willing to strangle you, leave you vulnerable, make you feel bad about yourself and otherwise harm you.

"I know how the abuse cycle messes with your head-- been there. Please, though, don't try to save this relationship. It's like putting out a house fire with a garden hose-- you might be able to douse a few little hotspots here and there, but there's always that roaring fire waiting to consume. Get rid of anything he left behind (& sell that engagement ring, honey), cut all ties, and move on with your life. Get clean and stay clean. And *come* clean, too, with your loved ones, about the abuse and your substance issues, if it's safe to do so. Don't allow him ammunition. If he thinks he's getting revenge by outing you and hears, ""oh, we already know... poor thing... too bad she had to face this alone for so long"" it would likely take the wind out of his sails. You might want to look into a restraining order as well.

Read back to yourself what you wrote about how he has abused you. Does that sound even close to him worshipping you in ANY way, let alone EVERY way? He has choked you, left you at a concert & blackmailed you! Now he’s manipulated you into apologizing bc HE LEFT YOU at a concert!

I just got out of a similar situation 3 months ago. The good was so good but the bad was dangerous. I know it’s hard but please at least make contact with your local DV shelter.

"You’ve got to save yourself. One of the things you’re talking about when you mention yelling at him or being angry is called reactive abuse. After a short time of being abused and disrespected we naturally act out and react.
You’ll be able to see a trauma therapist and work through all of the abuse and your own personal reactions to life, you will be OK because we do heal but before any of that can happen, you need to save yourself. 

I am married to abusive men after being raised by an extremely abusive father and now I coach other survivors. One thing I know from extensive research and experience is that the studies show if a person is able to choke/strangle, they are just abusive they’re a sociopath. If they can do that, the next step is death. 

I want you to know that you can have love, admiration, a best friend and a partner in crime who never even once raises a hand to you. There’s fighting in relationships of course but I’ve learned that you can be married for a long time and call each other anything more than a jerk or a turd. So there’s enough to be any name-calling. A man who loves you will not be jealous because he believes in you and the foundation of trust between you.
I wouldn’t look for a relationship for a while until after you’ve healed from what has happened to you and you learn about red flags and reactions. You are worth so much more and nothing that you could ever do earns you physical violence. Somebody can walk away from you if you’ve heard them that bad but revenge and losing control is not allowed.
Call your local domestic violence shelter for help. They can help you set up up short term escape plan as well as an emergency exit plan."	Alien_armpit	reply	na	na	na	0.998701810836792	no	no	no	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.

"**""The relationship started off like a dream with him worshipping me and treating me like a queen. ""**

Don't they all?

I mean do you ever get into a relationship with someone when they call you a whore, choke you, berate you, threaten to ruin your life and blackmail you? If he's shown these things on the first time you met him, do you think you'd give it a chance?

&#x200B;

**"" Like every couple, we ran into problems at one point and one of those problems was that i used substances 3-4 times a month. ""**

&#x200B;

Yup, every couple has a problem but not every couple results in family violence to the point of being choked, getting dizzy, threatened to be killed ""I will put you to sleep now"" and being slapped around whilst they pull your pants down.

&#x200B;

**""He did seek help for his violence, stopped drinking for a while, apologized over and over again and promised to change.""**

&#x200B;

Did he? did he change? no? as a matter of fact he got worse. It became a cycle of abuse.

It's called the honey moon phase when he's all apologetic, sweet, kind, etc. etc to try and win you over and then the moment he lost his shit again, what happened?

&#x200B;

Left you stranded, emotionally coerced you and made threats against you to socially isolate you.

&#x200B;

I want you to think about your life before you met him vs now.

Hows your mental health now compared to before?

Hows your friends? job? things you used to enjoy.

&#x200B;

Compare what you have now vs what had then, and ask yourself if its worth it.

&#x200B;

Im going to be very very blunt about this as someone who works in FV.

&#x200B;

He's shown a significant amount of high risk factors.

&#x200B;

1. Strangulation.

2. Excessive jealousy.

3. Emotional control.

4. Physical violence

5. Threats to kill.

6. Social isolation.

7. Perpetrating FV in the community - That time when he left you stranded due to his jealousy and forgetting about your welfare?

&#x200B;

The mere fact that he's blaming you for all of it.

You've already said the words yourself.

&#x200B;

**"". I don’t think that i am over all the abuse he has done to me yet, and it is very hard for me to accept all the blame now even though his violence, jealousy, problems with his ex wife, money problems, empty promises, lies, etc have put a big strain on our relationship as well.""**

&#x200B;

but because he's gaslit you the whole way through, you found a way to blame yourself ""i have anger problems, i yell at him etc. etc.""

&#x200B;

Hi. If someone has choked me, emotionally gaslit me, slapped me around, threatened to kill me, blackmailed me, etc .etc. fuck yeah i'll have ""anger problems"" or express my anger.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Your next step should be safety planning caue he is a very violent person.

He will escalate so you need to plan a way to get rid of him.

It has made me realize how horrible the entire situation actually is and that I was always trying to find excuses fro why he does what he does. I have since told a few people about what happened, since I never shared before and the were all shocked. I have received an immense amount of support which feels great.

I just blocked you from every single place I can think of. So after this message you won't be able to have any type of contact with me. You destroyed our family with your actions and have been unable to say ""sorry"" and have shown to have zero respect towards me and even others.

I want to add that he also still owes me quite a bit of money and him blocking me everywhere is clearly also him not taking any responsibility for that either.

He abused you to the point you changed.  When a nonviolent person starts to show violence towards one person it's because they are scared.  Everyone acts differently to trauma.  I'm sure you've heard of fight, flight, freeze, and fawn.  Your body goes straight for a fight most often.  Now you are kinda in the fawn stage where you are feeling some codependency...

Choking is internal, like when someone chokes on a piece of food and can't breath. Strangulation is external pressure cutting off the oxygen. I'm not sure why victims would use that term to protect their partners. When it happened to me, I said choked in the police report because i didn't know the correct term. Not to downplay anything. That part of the article is a little confusing.	Alien_armpit	reply	na	na	na	0.998701810836792	no	strong	no	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.

Oh wow, thank you for explaining it to me. So if my partner had put my hands around my throat and squeezed, even if I could still breath. That would be considered strangulation not choking? I always say choking, because strangulation is so horrible. And honestly as long as I could still breath, I never saw it as an intent to cut off my air supply.

"If your partner is squeezing your throat, or even covering your nose and mouth with a hand, it is extremely serious. I thought the words were interchangeable. I think most people think the same. Yes, what they did was strangle you.

 I think whether you can still breath or not is not relevant. First, you can't be sure whether they intended to cut off your air supply and just did a poor job.

I am currently unemployed but have a job lined up with Starbucks, just waiting on the background check. My kids, 9&10, are currently home with me for the summer. 

I had to get a protective order against my husband in May, and he stayed in VB Psych for about a week. Came home ""a changed man"" so I took him back, and of course I'm worse off now than before. Found a hookup app on his phone today, and he's trying to gaslight me about it rather than take accountability.

"You’ve already got a solid start as far as prioritizing things. Get the job, save money, have as much self control as you can. Remember to breathe, get space and safety in as many moments you can to breathe slowly and fully. That will help you think and keep your mind clear to make the best decisions you can. Finding the space to be alone and have a calm moment and breathe slowly and intentionally will help slow things down.

The next priority after securing money is finding a safe space to be. If you can keep the apartment by yourself, keep it. If not, especially once your kids leave at the end of summer, shelters are always an option although potentially scary. There are likely women’s centers near you that you can get resources from and hotlines or other services you can call to help you organize more.

If you or the kids are not safe from him currently, if there is a way to reinstate the protective order, I would find a way to do that soon. If he does anything to physically harm you or the kids again that’s got to be the end, you need to tell/call someone who can help you have him removed. Whether again that is someone at a women’s center or on a hotline who is trained to point you to the actions or services you need for your specific situation. 

As far as apartments, Zillow and Trulia are pretty legit sites that will help you find an apartment in your price range.

You don’t deserve this, and this isn’t your fault.

I am finally free, we had been in marriage counseling, and it was not working. Monday I finally found the courage to bring the divorce papers with me. He was furious on the drive home he proceeded to call me names and act crazy, I took my kids and our stuff and left the home. Since he has been texting me nonstop all while bad-mouthing me on Facebook.  He added me as a friend today because I told him he needs to get out of my home so he's having a garage sale to make some money. After I added him, he started bad-mouthing me on my own posts on Facebook. I am not responding because I am done caring about what he does. When I left I took all my guns, computer, and clothing and my kids also took their stuff. He says the bible says a woman should stick with a man no matter what he does... He pulled a gun on me and at another date threatened to shoot up my job. He has also hit me in the face before because he was drunk. I cannot take this anymore I will be glad once this is all said and done. I would rather be alone than to ever date anyone again.

I have a lot of self-loathing for even marrying him. I should have known when, a week before our wedding, he repeatedly pretended to punch me in the face and laughed every time I flinched. That night I ran off to a Denny’s at 2 am and just drank black coffee to get some peace and spent the time he was sleeping on a suicide chat line. He said I secretly liked the things he did just like I secretly liked it when my father did. 5 days later I married him.
I’ve been having horrible night terrors for weeks. I was prescribed something to help but it doesn’t. I just ended an over 2 year relationship because he did something my ex used to do (not abusive in and of itself) and it messed me up and I couldn’t stop associating the two.

"hi everyone, I posted here yesterday about my boyfriends mistreatment towards me. I opened up to some friends about it and they all encouraged me to leave, so I tried, but I couldn’t. he sent me a series of messages and calls about how much he loved me and needed me and how im his princess and his baby, that we can try, that he’s staying no matter what and he didn’t mean what he did and how he’s relapsing, telling me about dates we had and how he fell in love with me, how he’s obsessed with me, etc. I felt so guilty I couldn’t go.

I know that if I try to ghost or argue he’s going to show up to my house or harass my friends about it until they bother me because of him. I don’t like my relationship being public or everybody knowing about or fights, and I’m afraid of him hurting me if he shows up again. I don’t know what to do. I feel really trapped. I don’t want to be dramatic and call the police or something because I feel not only like they wouldn’t believe me (being that im a black girl and he’s white) but that if anything did happen it’d ruin his life; i don’t feel like his abuse is purposeful and rather that since we’re both so young he hasn’t learned to control his feelings especially since he’s currently in an abusive household.

He’s not sorry about ruining your life. You leaving a relationship that offers nothing to you is not ruining his life. Frankly abusers deserve to have their lives ruined but that’s a separate topic. 

If he shows up to bother you and harasses your friends you need to report it to police and continue to avoid him. And continue to avoid him. Whether he wants to meet up or just shows up you need to avoid him or he will attack you. It is that serious not over dramatic.

You did good by telling friends about it.  Breaking up doesn't take two parties to agree.  If you want out of the relationship, you're out.   Let him know to respect your decision to end the relationship and to not contact you anymore.  If he shows up at your house, don't open.

Reach out to the domestic violence hotline. I was given a free counseling resource. I haven't booked a session yet, but I'm planning to.

"It helped me tremendously. I wasn't aware of how violent my soon to be ex- husband was. I have major depression and PTSD from domestic violence.  10 months away from him and I am still recovering. I lost the connection within my own self. I lost my identity, my purpose in life, my innate creativity, and much more. The damage domestic violence causes is huge and often invisible.  The scars are psychologically deep. 

I have been in psychotherapy for 3 years, and started CBT on my own. Soon I start group therapy, as well. Recovery can be a long journey, but it's a good journey, better than the abuse life journey.
Do seek therapy. You'll find amazing things about yourself that you probably have not discovered yet. If I may, I suggest,  find a therapist who is a licensed psychologist with years of experience, or a psychiatrist who does psychotherapy.

I didn't start therapy until many years later, when an unrelated event at work set off a full blown panic attack.  Realizing that I probably needed help, I went through my insurance and found my current therapist.  The main goal was to address the PTSD from DV back in the 2000's, and eventually also other issues like anxiety and personal boundaries.

Absolutely! You go to therapy to help yourself learn techniques and tools to combat symptoms of the abuse, to help you grow as a person, and for all sorts of recommendations on more things you could try to feel better. It's someone who listens without judgement. Who isn't going to be out for their own agenda. Sometimes family and friends mean well, but they can have these. Also try listening to podcasts about starting therapy. I like to take notes during therapy and then create small affirmations from them to refer to in my planner. It helps me between sessions.

"I don’t know if I belong here and I apologize in advance if this is the wrong community for me. I’m not sure if what I’m experiencing is abuse and I think I need some external perspective because there is no one I can talk to about this.

I’m a 25-year-old lesbian, and my girlfriend of two years (also 25) loves me to pieces. However, she struggles with her emotions and trauma, and sometimes when she is really activated she acts in ways that are not ok. Afterwards she is full of remorse and self-hatred. This is a cycle that started when we moved in together 9 months ago.

Usually we will be in an argument and she will get so frustrated that she becomes violent or malicious. She has yanked my belongings from my hands, or headphones from my ears, thrown my things. She confiscates and denies me my belongings during these times. She has thrown furniture at me. She sometimes tackles me or pushes me or damages my things, but the shock of what she’s done usually snaps her out of it. I have learned to pick up on when this behavior is starting, so that I can try to leave before things get bad. But usually when I try to leave she grabs me or blocks the exit. 

We have been doing a lot of work within our relationship to try to get past this, mostly around communication and both of us getting comfortable setting and respecting boundaries so that things never get to the point where they become unsafe. Over the last month or so I’ve been feeling extremely good about our relationship and confident that our past cycles are behind us. I’ve seen progress and effort from both of us. However, I was wrong. Last night some of the same things happened. My partner yanked my headphones from my head, mocked me when I begged 
 for them back (they are my known self-soothing tool), pushed me, and prevented me from leaving the apartment when I felt scared. I’m in a state of despair because I keep telling myself this won’t happen again and then it does.

I had a candid conversation with her about it in which she admitted that when these incidents took place she felt a desire for me to suffer, she said she wanted me to feel as bad as she felt inside. She says she now feels overwhelming remorse and self-hatred. She tells me that she understands if I decide to leave because she doesn’t deserve me. She also told me that she can’t guarantee that it won’t happen again because healing is a complicated process and she is struggling to cope with her daily life.  She said she is trying her best but it isn’t enough.

Another thing, I find myself having dreams or flashbacks about my ex, in which I feel safe (my ex never crossed my boundaries) and I find myself comforted by these memories. I end up missing  and thinking about her more when things are difficult with my current partner. Sometimes I want to reach out but my partner is against me having any contact with her, which I understand and respect. Nonetheless I feel very guilty for feeling the way I do towards my ex and I am very conflicted.

There are so many things I love about my partner. We have so many dreams for the future. She is a gentle and loving person at heart. For us to move forward I know that she needs me to see that in her and support her growth. We have so many ideas about what a future together could look like and get excited about it.

What I need is an outside perspective. I don’t know if this is abuse. I don’t know how to act in the wake of this incident, mainly given that she says she can’t guarantee that it won’t happen again (I appreciate that honesty so much). Part of me wonders if, given what has happened, the only way to move forward is to put my foot down and not stay in a relationship that can’t guarantee my safety. But I also have invested so much into this and have been wholeheartedly believing in things getting better, and they have been. I don’t know what to do.

Disclaimer, my girlfriend is smaller than me: a few inches shorter than me and barely over 100 pounds. I can lift her easily. However, the amount of power that she has over me in these moments where she becomes unpredictable is terrifying to me.

"So here’s the thing. She’s assaulting you. That’s what it’s called, assault. She’s forcibly restraining you, by not allowing you to leave, and she’s assaulting you, both physically and mentally. 

Instead of actually apologizing, she claims to be overwhelmed with remorse, but tells you she can’t guarantee she won’t do it again, and she’s trying her best. Do you not see what a load of shit that is? She can absolutely guarantee it won’t happen again, all she has to do is keep her hands off you, she has control of her hands correct? She drives, brushes her hair, feeds herself, her hands function just how she tells them to. She’s not out randomly assaulting strangers because she can’t control her hands, she’s assaulting you, in the home you share with her.

Not only is she assaulting you, she’s telling you she’s more than likely going to do it again, but, since she’s giving this her “best” effort, and taking into account how much “she struggles with her daily life”, you should either accept it, or you can leave. She isn’t “trying her best”, it’s not like keeping her hands off you is a Herculean task, most of us manage our “daily lives” without shoving our spouses to the floor.

"Sweetheart, I was once like you.

She is not sick. She is not impaired. She isn't abusing you because she is activated.

She doesn't think like we do. She doesn't play by our rules. She is using mental health words to avoid accountability and allow the behavior to continue. All abusers unfortunately use the exact same strategies. I'm sorry, but her pattern is very obvious. You are not the cause of any of this. You also can not fix her.

"First, please don’t think that your situation is complicated or atypical. Abuse abuse abuse and it doesn’t matter what your relationships situation is. Size doesn’t matter either. I was a much bigger woman then my very short and small husband but first of all I would never dream of doing what he was doing to me man second it’s more of a mental control then a physical one.

I am speaking as a woman who married to narcissistic abusive men after being raised by one. I also coach survivors of all relationship situation’s. 

You mentioned that she has been through trauma. Being somebody with PTSD I can say that some times the paths can come out and haunt us affecting our behavior. This might not be related but your early 20s and sometimes win mental hits issues come to light but either way it sounds like she might need some trauma therapy if not to work out her past but on her present feelings.

I would not proceed any further in the relationship and may be considered moving to your own space again while you figure things out. I would suggest a couples counseling. She needs better coping skills and you need to understand.

So far it’s difficult to know whether or not she carries behaviors or tendencies of a narcissistic personality disorder but the cycle of abuse that you can easily find on Google is exactly what you describe. the acting out leads to the embarrassment day and apologies mixed with promises which leads to getting counseling and then back around again.

If you’re like most of us we feel like we have to have new avenue unturned before we actually surrender that a relationship is not worth investing more than we already have. Your personal safety comes before anything else and you will find another relationship that’s worthy and doesn’t hurt. Especially knowing you’ve already had it once so always take steps forward never backward, always progress. Whether she’s going to progress with you or not it’s up to her and then ultimately up to you. She definitely hast to know you’re serious or she’ll keep playing this victim role like it’s something happening to her and my heart does go out to her if she has been abused herself but with my experience with extreme abuse, I’ve never abused another human being in my life and I can’t imagine that I would.

PP is FREE, say you don’t have health insurance and long as you put your income on the self attestation form as less than $1500/mo, ALL your care will be covered at zero cost to you. They don’t check your tax records or anything to verify your actual income. Just attest $1500/mo or less.

Hey!! So glad I seen this! So join the r/abortion sub group! They seriously made mine sooooo much better. I had any questions answered without judgement. I even found out how involved aid access really is with the US! Don’t be like me, I ended up having 3 with mine. My 3rd one I couldn’t afford an abortion, and didn’t have the right resources to get one. I had the hardest time the entire pregnancy! And for 4 months after.

Please do not, absolutely do not listen to the antiabortion people. They don't give a damn about you and they dont give a damn about the child either. They just want to control women but pretend it's god they're listening to. Having a child from an abuser can make a life of a woman, and of the child, PURE HELL. Read up about legal abuse in custody battles, for example onemomsbattle, an abuser can distroy your life by dragging you in court for years and years.

I did not let him know when I gave birth. He was not present at the hospital at any time. I did not add him to any paperwork or birth certificate. You as the mother have every right to deny him access to being at the hospital with you.

"I think my husband is dangerous. I believe has the potential to kill me and harm children.

My husband is extremely manipulative. Sometimes he seems really dumb, especially around other people. But he’s not. He’s really not. He systematically turned my parents against me by showing a high level of empathy a tragedy that happened in our family. He then took that and sort of trauma bonded with my parents. I Don’t know how else to explain this. My parents think he’s this sweet guy who is a little slow and when I try to explain to them how he is, it’s like they trust him more because he seems honest and more open than I am.

He tells everyone I’m crazy and that I’m the abusive one. Anyone who will listen, even people I’ve never met. He tells them that he just wants to help me. If others are around when I try to being up the abuse he turns to blackmail and says things like ‘I got something for you since you want to say that’ or ‘what about you doing ____’

My husband has choked me several times. Locked me out the house. Took my car keys and phone so I couldn’t leave and couldn’t call the police. I also think he has raped me but I’m not sure if what he did qualifies as rape.

We don’t have normal sex. When we have sex he likes to say thing like ‘I’m going to molest you’ or ‘I’m going to do bad things to you’. He knows I was assaulted as a child and it makes me feel like he’s getting off on it. There have been times where I don’t want to have sex, I’m dry and he will still try to force himself inside of me. He is actively trying to get me pregnant (I’ve been secretly using spermicide and bc) and he says that he wants a daughter that looks like me. The way he says it is so creepy that I am genuinely afraid that he could harm children.

I have tried to tell his parents, my parents, our church, the police etc.

He keeps asking for proof whenever we’re around others but the abuse I’m suffering through isn’t as easy to prove as more severe physical abuse. I Don’t have bruises and scars to photograph from when he choked me but he has proof of me fighting back from him chocking me. 

I’m not sure what to do or how to prove it."	throwrascaredwife	post	27.9132267069328	female	White	0.9977327585220337	na	na	na	12	domesticviolence	no prediction.

I agree with the other commenter — get safe first (away from him), worry about the proof later. Connect with domestic violence resources and you’ll discover that people (especially women) who have similar lived experiences won’t need concrete proof in order to believe your lived experience and offer assistance and protection. He’s making it about “proof” so that you feel like you are empty-handed and powerless without it, and have no one to turn to because no one else will believe you without proof.

"You need to leave first in secret and without announcing your exit. Your social network is abuser-friendly so telling so they’d step up has failed. If their reaction to “my husband choked me” is “didn’t happen” there’s nothing they can do for you. At best they will ruin your safety planning. You are being raped along with reproductive coercion, there’s nothing unsure about it. 

Don’t argue the abuse with him expecting change or validation. He’s getting amusement out of the control he has over you. Do keep it up if needed to pretend things are normal because he’ll escalate if he senses you’re about to leave. 

Proof that’s not audio, video, written media is often your own recollection of events over time that show his pattern of abuse. If he choked you, write it down. If he told friend A that you’re crazy, write it down. Anything he’s done that fits with this post write it down. If you get medical care disclose the abuse to your care provider so it’s part of your medical record. Do not hide that you’ve been strangled. (And actually you should see a doctor and get checked out. Strangulation can kill victims weeks later from delayed onset strokes, brain damage from the lack of air, etc). 

After you’ve escaped, you can decide if it’s worth trying your local police again or trying a different set of police if you relocate."	throwrascaredwife	reply	na	na	na	0.9977327585220337	no	no	no	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.
Your situation sounds awful and very dangerous. If he is using your family to drag you back you need to avoid them for a time until you’ve established yourself  safely. Pulling up stakes and getting yourself to a shelter in another town might be a way. Some shelters place dogs in foster care. They would be safer there than with your abuser. It seems imperative that you drop efforts to get anyone in your circle to believe you right now. The only important thing is to get you and your dogs away! So sorry you are trapped by this abuser. He sounds so creepy.	throwrascaredwife	reply	na	na	na	0.9977327585220337	no	no	no	na	domesticviolence	failed
"OP, this kind of manipulative, covert abuse is common, which is great to hear as far as ‘knowing you aren’t the only one and solidarity’ kind of validation goes, living with this type of abuser is terrifying…especially when there is no place or time that you are able to feel safe. It is impossible to take a breath.. really, just breathe. I recognized much of your peril from when I was married. No one should endure this. 
Are you able to visit your doctor alone? If so, the next time he forces himself upon you, (Btw, yes this is considered marital rape. I don’t know if the ‘marital’ qualifier is necessary, however consent actually is! If you are saying No, Stop , crying or resisting, he should be stopping.) get in to see your doctor or gynecologist the next day so that the abuse can be medically documented. This will help you as far as actually being able to prove that you are a victim of abuse. Also make sure that you remove your husband and all of your family members from every single HIPAA which would give them access to your medical records, appointments, hospitalization, doctors visits, behavioral health etc. Be aware that medical clinics have separate HIPAA auths than Behavioral Health Depts, even when they are in the same facility. This way none of them can call your doctor and ask about your health, or provide their ‘opinion’ on you or your state of mind. You can also call your local rape crisis hotline and ask them what they would  recommend. They might suggest that you visit the ER for a SANE exam, which is a rape exam, done by specially trained medical personnel. You can ask for a rape crisis advocate to attend, and I recommend you do so. You will NOT be forced to press charges, however if there is any evidence that can be taken it will be preserved, and you will have the option to press charges at a later time, should you choose to do so. The ER visit doesn’t show up on your insurance, as you won’t be billed, and it isn’t part of your records. 

It’s important to protect your pets. Call your DV shelter to see if they have a pet friendly shelter, or if they can direct you to a resource where they can be temporarily fostered. If not you can call United Way,211 and ask if there are local pet shelters that can assist you. Another resource would be breed specific groups that might be willing to open their doors to help you out. For example Pit Bull groups will rally around to assist owners of Bully breeds. 

Your DV shelter will be able to help you create an escape plan. The WILL take you at your word, and can advise you on how best to prepare and stay safe. While you prepare can you get on a long term birth control like  Norplant? Something he can’t see, which won’t need hiding and can’t be sabotaged? Just a thought. 

Above all stay calm, and don’t tell ANYONE what you are planning. From what you have said there probably isn’t anyone who you can trust at this point. Even a ‘friend’ would tell him your plans thinking that they would be doing so in your best interests! If they only knew how wrong they were…
Don’t tell him a damn thing, no matter how angry, tired or desperate you become. Find your birth certificate, passport, bank book, and anything else important and hide it away where you can get to it fast. Scan documents and lock them in the Cloud where he cannot access them. Delete the Reddit app, access your account  thru your browser and then clear your browser history. Make sure he can’t access your passwords. Here are some links you will need:

https://www.rainn.org/resources
This is for RAINN, the National Rape Crisis Hotline. They can connect you to local rape crisis support.

https://www.thehotline.org
This is for the National Domestic Violence Hotline
From here you would enter your zip code and the nearest DV shelters phone numbers will pop up.

"if you're in the US see if there is a free legal assistance available to you so you can exercise your rights (or have the attorney do it for you since its hard af to stand up to an abuser + their attorney). If you lived with them for 8 years, you're likely entitled to some of the property / support, but it can be a terrible fight to get what you're due. 

Truly though, if there is a DV shelter/group near you talk to them. Someone should be able to help you so you aren't tossed into the streets with nothing.

"Oh my goodness. If you’re scared to call the cops, you go to the ER and tell them you were sexually assaulted. They can do a rape kit for you, and they handle it very carefully as to respect you, because they don’t want to traumatize you further. From that point you can decide not to do anything further, but at least you have that option in the future. Also while you’re there you can safely detox from alcohol, because it does sound like you may have alcohol poisoning. They can provide a counselor for you.

The root of my problem is alcohol, it was how I met my abuser and how I got i to that car with the rapist. I keep saying im losing my mind all the time but I’m just holding on for that court date but I’ve had some angels come through 4 female neighbors who also been in abusive deadly relationships have stepped forward and given me friendship and support. There are so many of us out there it’s crazy but I feel we can find healing direction and strength in one another even you helped me. Victims and survivors need each other because were easily blinded by the love were in with our abusers can’t leave until we’re dead or destroy ourselves afterwards if we don’t have that strength to let go. It’s important we share our stories and support one another the law can protect us from our abusers but we light the dark path for each other as victims and survivors to move forward when one sister gets lost and doesn’t know what to do or have the strength to do what she needs to do people like you shine a light, encourage them and give her the knowledge to help her way through so thank you."

I was raped when passed out drunk, and the only way I knew about it was because it was recorded and I happened to see it when looking at the Apple TV photos app on the living room tv. 

For the longest time I felt shame for being so drunk that I couldn’t stop it, and the worst shame came from not remembering this happened. If a video wasn’t made, I would never have known. If I wasn’t drunk….this wouldn’t have happened. 

I got help for my drinking, because I definitely used it to self medicate my pain. But I now know that me being drunk that night, was not any excuse for me to be raped.

divorce is an option but idk my family is an immigrant family where divorce is shamed and she revealed to me that she can’t because she doesn’t wanna have her side of the family worry for her and that we’d have nowhere else to go even though the reality is that eventually we r gnna have no where to live anyways bc my pos father doesn’t bring home any money at all bc he relies on my mother for everything (my mother is a stay at home nurse for elderly and the woman she worked with is currently on vacation for a long period of time and so my mom has stopped work till she’s back which could be more than a year) and any money my dad does bring he gambles it all away or gives it to his friends not once thinking about his family ??? i don’t even want anything materialistic i just want to be able to go one day without u begging my mom to ask her friends money to pay the rent or without u using her ENTIRE paycheck leaving us not enough money for food unless she takes bits out of our savings ???  my mom idk She is so. insistent on staying with him and i’ve told her several times that i’m leaving once i’m 18 if she does so because my entire life has been ruined by him and at the very least i want to be able to not have to put up with that shit if i don’t have to legally. but truthfully speaking i just Can’t leave my mom with him and my sister especially because she is so mentally unstable where she is constantly tormenting my mother for incredibly expensive things which she will always end up getting, destroying things in the house if she doesn’t get what she wants (recently all the fans in the house) or talking about how she’s gnna kill us all in our sleep (in a recent explosion of hers, she literally went searching for the knives but i had told my mother to hide them beforehand which i’m so fucking glad i did because i don’t want to even imagine what would’ve happened that day)

my sister has gone to the ward for thoughts of wanting to die or hurting others and she got a therapist who dropped her within one day and ghosted my mother. my mom was then given a virtual therapist who clearly was not gnna work bc my sister will refuse to get on the zoom and would very likely just hurt my mother if she asks her. i don’t even think therapy will help her at this point i don’t know what will like i don’t even know what’s wrong with her she’s just outright insane. will laugh right after threats of killing us Doesnt care at all when my mom gets hurt and she will constantly put her hands on my mom ??? right now she’s literally giggling with her friends on the phone after she put her hands on my mom and hit her with the last fan left in the house and my dad like always went to go blame my mother for it sahing it’s because of how she raised us (very wrong. my sister is exhibiting all the things he has done to ruin my mother and mines life. Every last bit of it.) and so i literally got out mid shower and yelled and cursed him out in order to protect my mom. like always he yells at me saying i always take my mothers side and says the same to my mom saying my mom always takes my side? why would i take ur side when my entire life you have always been the reason i wanted to end it? u were supposed to be my dad and i’ve given u so many fucking chances and each and everytime h never fail to remind me how u wish u never had me how i’m not ur fucking daughter??? 

i don’t even know what to do. there’s So So much . rhat i want to say. What the fuck do i even do ???? i can’t even kill my self because i don’t want to leave my mother behind but i can’t keep living like this??? american mental health system is absolute shit bc why the fuck did they send my sister back home if she’s just getting worse and worse by the day??? i try gooogling for answers and i still don’t know what to do. is there even a way to admit my sister somewhere where they can just. Keep Her. bc she’s just So. Mentally unstable to even be around others????? i don’t want to keep living in fear that one day she comes home with a weapon or one day she does hurt my mom or i really bad she is too mentally unwell and gone to even take care of her at home?? whag do i do about my dad Can anything even be done abt what he’s done to me and my mother our entire lives?????? fuck man i’m literally writing this all right after my sister hurt my mom and cursed my father out (for yelling and shouting at my mom) and he stormed out. i hope he never comes back but that’s clearly too good to ever happen to me"	RunAwayAndHideWithMe	post	18.064879771318687	female	White	0.9973213076591492	na	na	na	3	domesticviolence	ethnicity: unknown, age: 17, gender: female, explanation: the passage indicates that the author identifies as a 17-year-old female. the ethnicity is not clearly stated in the text however, it is mentioned that the family is of immigrant background where divorce is traditionally shamed.

"i didnt know a domestic violence shelter was a thing tbh, i guess calling the police is an option but im afraid to do it without my mom fully agreeing to it. she says she'll call but its usually a heat of the moment thing bc when i ask her abt it she says if it happens again thats when she will call the police. im still in school, failed most of my subjects bc of all this nd currently attending summer school which im grateful for bc im out of the house now mor often. my school counselor is sort of a deadbeat, he has dismissed other kids when theyve come to talk to him nd the most advice my teacher was able to give was talk to my counselor. im scared to call the police on my own or even do anything abt it despite wanting to so bad bc truth is this has been my life for so long like im scared for it to change if i ever take action despite wanting it to change so bad? does that make sense??? i want things to change but i just dont know. what if this is the best it gets and the change is not as good as i hoped for what then??   


i talked to my mom recently abt it all. if we were to ever call the police on my sister we have papers from the mental hospital that explains her issues. i dont understand my sister one bit bc she threatens to call the police on my mother who has done no wrong yet goes on screaming how she wants to kill us all nd has literally went on searches for the knives in the house ?? how does she not understand that shes in the wrong ???? as for my dad we r slowly getting tight on money again and soon we wont have any left to pay the rent bc he is forcing my mom to spend all the money on her savings acc rather than use the money he makes when working (decides to waste it on gambling nd other women) nd my mom said she will finally put her foot down nd say smth nd i guess possibly move in w my aunt while getting mor professional help for my sister but idk... she alwats says that she'll put her foot down nd never does..

"I understand completely. Many of us who experience abuse have difficulty relating to others who have no concept of what happens. And it can be frustrating and overwhelming to feel that no one else can understand. Add to that your lack of control over the situation and it's no wonder you feel this way.

I am so sorry you have not found a supportive adult. Are there other counselors at your school or administrators that seem like they might listen? Where I live, all school employees are mandated reporters, which means if they hear or suspect abuse they HAVE to contact authorities. 

Please try to find resources in your area. Google ""domestic violence resources city/town"" (with your locality as the city or town) and see what you find. There are state & national resources available as well. 

Scroll through the domesticviolence and emotionalabuse subreddits - people list them there.

"TW: rape, self harm, pedophilia, racism 


me and my boyfriend have been together for about five months, it’s been my longest lasting and best relationship in a while. it’s my first time being with a man ever and ive only been with women before. he is so unbelievably sweet and kind and patient with me no matter what, and i want to preface this by saying that what im gonna say doesn’t reflect everything good he’s done for me. he’s helped build my confidence so much, kept me safe, treated me amazingly, spent all his money on me, and loved me, and I know he loves me.

but when he’s not great, it’s really awful. im gonna make a timeline of things he’s done since we started dating for reference:

1) the first fight we ever had was a few weeks into our relationship when I caught him watching porn after we already discussed it as a hard boundary for me. I remember crying thinking I wasn’t enough for him, and he said it was because I wasn’t doing enough for him during sex, so I started doing more.

2) we’re an interracial couple and i found that he used to say racial slurs not long before we got together. he tried to excuse and defend himself but in the span of a few months he’d said the n-word 10-20 times both hard r and not in derogatory manners. he swore that he’s changed and it was just a mistake, and then tried to convince me that he told me he used to say it. i never remember him telling me that but it makes me question if he did or not.

3) he raped/coerced me incidentally. he feels awful about it and has apologized, cried, cut himself, sent me paragraphs of guilt and apologies, and shown extreme remorse about it. i still feel horrible and sick to my stomach about it, i feel so afraid around him because of it and often fall in and out of love due to it out of fear. i feel so gross and dirty all the time. it’s terrifying. i told my friend out of anxiety and then i felt guilt because he said if I lied and told anyone he raped me, he’d be upset. 

i told him that i told my friend last night, and he said he doesn’t want anyone to view him as a monster and that I twist the story to make him seem worse. we had sex a few days ago and i just zoned out, i wanted to cry. it was like i could feel everything but my mind was somewhere else. I’ve never felt this way before. i he couldn’t get it up for me after and said it was because he was high but I thought he didn’t want me anymore so I cried anwyay. I spent all day getting ready for him, shaving, cleaning my room, setting the mood, just for that.


4) he asked for nudes of me from when i was being groomed as a child, he got off to them and during sex unwarrentedly called me his little girl and stuff and referenced the age I got raped at. I feel worse because I enjoyed it but I always break down after. i feel guilty because sometimes I ask for these things and I want them and I enjoy them, and then like he says I turn and make myself out to be a victim. 

there’s other stuff but I don’t really want to talk about it. he’s never put his hands on me and only yelled at me once or twice. I don’t want to leave him because I’m so afraid, i don’t want to be alone and I’ve already dedicated so much of my life to him. I feel so bad. sometimes I want someone to help me or save me or care, but everyone thinks I put myself into this position and I did but I just feel like I can’t escape. when it’s not like that, he loves me so much, and I forget everything he did, I just feel warm and nice and fuzzy when he holds me and calls me pretty or strokes my hair."	18-angels	post	20.008741623313387	female	White	0.007858075201511383	na	na	na	12	domesticviolence	no prediction.
"If you are having these feelings now, it's very unlikely that your feelings will ever change. I'm not saying they couldn't, but this does not sound like a healthy relationship to me. 

I am 38, so I'm coming from some experience here, I would leave. With him only being 16 and already crossing your set boundaries, that behavior is not likely to change and will probably only escalate. You are both so young, you will find as you grow into your 20's and 30's you will change even more with what you want, like, dislike, etc. 

If you are finding yourself questioning your safety, happiness, health, etc - leave. You get one life, don't live it for someone elses happiness. You are 18 and have your whole life ahead of you.

"Hold up - he asked for pictures of you when you were groomed? So he asked you to give him CP? Or am I misunderstanding something.

Abusers aren’t really these big bad wolves we can easily spot most of the time. Abusive people are people, and therefore they are full of contradictions, like all of us. They can do and say very nice things, but there’s really nothing that excuses or outweighs shit like rape or CP in my book. The fact that he reacts the way he does, by basically centering himself and his pain after he hurt YOU, or downplaying your feelings after using your trauma to get off (whether you wanted that or not), is concerning and a sign of what’s to come.

"i’m a 20 f for context. i wouldnt say the guys a predator over a 2 year age gap and you definitely wouldn’t call someone that if they’re born underage or legal. This is definitely a situation where you need to realize what’s best for you. You’re only 16 and have so much ahead of you full of love, pain, heartbreak, laughs etc. you have time to grow and figure out who you are and what you need in a relationship and it seems like the guy doesn’t understand that with him being 2 years older than you which is surprising. but understandable  since women tend to mature faster than men especially if trauma occurs.

This person has assaulted me before only apologised because they were told it was the right thing and not long after tried to justify what they did. We are not in a relationship we are technically related not biologically but grew up together and happen to live together. I walk on eggshells everyday but today something shifted I feel this person has hatred for me and could take me and everyone we live with out I have nowhere else to go and have mental health issues I’ve been suicidal lately and part of me wants them to hurt me and only me fast so I can be done with life but I have a feeling it’ll be violent and brutal if they choose to end my life.

"There should be a domestic Violence hotline available 24/7. And also if at any time you feel like you’re unsafe or they might be violent call the police! Say you have been assaulted before by this person previously and now you fear for your life. They will come quickly as they cannot ignore a call with someone fearing for their safety and their life. Make sure you put emphasis on the fear for your life. 
They can also be there to support you collect/pack your things and picking up your stuff if you needed. (This you may need to go into the station to prearrange/pre warn the sargent to arrange a time and day so that they can arrange and ensure you have an officer to be available and to be there for that whole time so you feel safe.) 


Both the hotline and police will be able to help either finding alternative solutions make assessment of the situation, call emergency services if you feel suicidal and get you treatment.

"They don’t need to assault you. What they are doing is coercive control. They are using intimidation and violence around you to insinuate fear as a means to control you and make you feel inferior. From what you are describing they are successfully creating a hostile environment and slowly destroying your psyche. Generally a person who exerts coercive control will not like to get their hands dirty. So by doing the violent outbursts and showing aggression they can I still the same fear and cause the same anxiety and psychological distress and effect that someone would have by physical abuse. The difference is they didn’t lay hands on you or “assault “ you in anyway. They could get intimidation but that’s not as big and generally not in their mind. They will feel like they’re outsmarting the law by doing this. The technicalities surrounding legal ramifications aren’t as black and white than if he did hit you. Most countries have different laws that will vary state to state regarding prosecution of coercive control under domestic violence law so in some ways if you did want to press charges that might be an obstacle but it seems that’s not in your mind right now. 

However, you stating that you are suicidal is worrying albeit not uncommon for those that are victim to this type of abuse. Because as said before they don’t need to hit you to get the desired response from you. They won’t kill you. They will however keep on destroying every part of your psyche; from you confidence, to your positivity, character, sense of self etc. until you reach that point where you see no escape but to do that. And by that point they have won. 

And as for the police. You don’t have to press charges. I was just saying they have access to support services if you wanted to leave, and also can support you to pack your stuff should you want to leave to support you because leaving is the most dangerous time for a victim and the most  likely point for homicide to occur so for your safety it’s best to not do it alone. And I was also suggesting that if at any point you feel that he really might kill you and your family then call the police. Even if he hasn’t hit you and you feel that he will call them. That is what they are there for. To prevent you being the next face on the news. 

If you are really worried, suicidal with thoughts of self harm. Please please please go see someone, don’t let it manifest. I work in mental health and if you presented to me I would have to hold you on psych hold so this is worrying especially since you don’t seem like you want to seek help. I completely understand and know how scary this situation is but you won’t be able to move forward and see how much life can offer and how happy you can be because it’s clouded by your constant state of hyper vigilance from your surrounding environment combined with anxiety, depression, your negative self talk and constant suicidal ideation. 

Because at the end of the day. You have a right to feel safe in your own home. You have the right to be treated with respect and without the fear of violent retaliation and intimidation. You shouldn’t have to feel that the only escape is by taking your own life.

"Hello everyone, 

I am in NYC and i am finally going to get my daughter and myself out of our DV situation. 

I’ll try to keep this short. My partner, her father, is out of state for work. We are packing up our stuff, and leaving, going to get an order of protection Wednesday. I will tell the courts that he won’t be home until the following week, so they know when to serve. But my question is this. I know that there can’t be any contact between us, and I don’t want there to be, but I also don’t want him thinking something happened to us, because I won’t respond to his calls/texts/etc. this is all before he gets served. 

Up until this point I have been putting up a charade with our conversations bc I know that we won’t be able to leave freely. And I intended to do that until he gets home and sees our stuff gone. If I give him any hint before then that we are leaving, Idk what actions he’ll take to prevent that from happening. 

Does the no contact on my part start the moment the order of protection is filed and approved? Or does it start when he is served?

I just don’t want him to be thinking we are dead somewhere. And him coming home to see our stuff gone is honestly the best case scenario with him finding out that we have left. 

Is there a way that he can be contacted to let him know that he will be served? 

Any insights on this will be greatly appreciated. TIA"	maguado1808	post	24.818719507538376	female	White	0.9919106364250183	na	na	na	5	domesticviolence	no prediction.
I did the same thing to my daughters father. I packed up while he was at work and got an order of protection which was granted that same day. I debated about writing a note, but ended up telling his parents instead right before we left. At the time they were very apologetic and supported my decision in leaving. If you think he’s going to avoid being served then don’t let him know. You can simply leave a note saying you don’t feel safe and are leaving and he’ll get more info when he’s served. Definitely don’t contact him at all after it’s been granted though.	maguado1808	reply	na	na	na	0.9919106364250183	no	strong	no	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.

There will be at least a week between when it’s granted, to when he’ll be home in order to be served. I’m concerned about that no contact during that time. What can I do to let him know that we aren’t dead from an accident, but without telling him what we are doing so he doesn’t avoid being served?"	maguado1808	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9919106364250183	weak	no	no	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.
"Honestly if I were in your situation I would let him believe something happened to you rather than telling him you’re leaving and having to deal with any backlash. I blocked my daughters father the day I got the OOP so nothing came through because I didn’t need to explain myself to him. At the end of the day it was the consequences of his own actions. If we felt safe we could have stayed, but they made us resort to fleeing while they aren’t home and we shouldn’t be made to feel guilty for it. 

Maybe someone else will have a better idea, but at the end of it he’s going to know what happened once he gets back to town.

"Thank you for saying that. 

I think I feel guilty, and I will feel guilty. But I think that’s a side effect of being in an abusive relationship for so long. You’re right. His fear will be temporary. I have feared for so long for myself and now, for my daughter. 

As I’m writing this, I’m reading back what I posted and my response to you, and I am asking myself, “why is it important to me that he knows that we are safe?” I don’t have just one answer to that, but the answers have the same reason; I’m putting his feelings before my own. That’s something I need to stop doing, and not because I want to give him a taste of his own medicine. I would never want to intentionally be the cause of someone’s pain. But at the end of the day, I have to put myself first because. And this is a consequence to actions. I know he won’t see it that way, and he won’t hold himself accountable for his actions. I still need to move forward, despite his feelings of that. 

I really like that you pointed out that his actions have made me resort to fleeing when he is not home.

"You’re definitely not alone. I felt guilty at first too, but now that several months have passed and I’ve had time to reflect I’ve found peace in my decision. There’s still moments of stress because he wants to be involved in our daughters life and I’m trying my hardest to keep her safe, but at the end of the day I wouldn’t change anything. 

I personally silenced my notifications from him and his family to avoid the anxiety I feel when they text me when I have important things going on. I typically don’t see them until I actually have the downtime to look through my phone and it helps me manage it better and not be as frazzled.

This is the hardest part, but in a few months you’ll look back and be so happy that you made this leap and won’t regret any of the decisions you’ve made. I wish you and your daughter the best of luck!"	maguado1808	reply	na	na	na	0.9919106364250183	weak	strong	no	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.

"This is valid. Leaving an abusive relationship IS a very dangerous time. 

When you're in the relationship you start to do a lot to stay safe. You probably even start viewing life through his lens. Your fear is at an ultimate high right now and you are feeling very alone and there is a lot happening trauma-wise that will likely grow for a time.

The thing is lots of women do go back. But everything comes at a cost and with an abuser, the cost can include your life.

Lots of women also leave and stay out, and that can be you too. But that means rewriting your whole life.

But yay, this time you get to be the star and the main character, not him.

Yes you will have hard times, but you will have amazing times too, and you will get to feel and celebrate them without all the conflict of him.

So maybe you don't feel done your story with him yet. But maybe some part of you, the part of you writing this post, is ready to take apart the old story and start a new one."	iwillgetoutokay	reply	na	na	na	0.9975730776786804	weak	no	no	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.
"it does get easier. it just takes time. i thought i would feel that way for forever and within a month or two, my bouts of sadness got further and further apart. 

i found myself questioning if it was really that bad (it was.) and romanticizing any good parts between us. what i did to keep myself from returning was, i just reminded myself of the bad parts. i reminded myself of the anger and the violence. the mean words. i reminded myself of how terrified and alone i was. 

i cried A LOT when i first left. because i had so much love for him in my heart. i just wanted him to “get better” so we could “go back to before”. i cried like everyday. let yourself cry it out. cry as much as you need to. but remember why you left. always remember why you left. your safety is more important than anything else. you did the right thing. remember how your safety was not valued by them, and how you deserve more than that.

To answer your question. Cut off all contact. Even people who are in contact with your abuser. It'll be extremely hard, but trying to have someone who only loves to torture you is much harder. You'll be surrounded with grief, eventually, you will see the light at the end of the tunnel with time.

"I am going to copy and paste from another post on here:

I wish I could say that it gets easier. I also wished that in those first few days, even months, and maybe after a year or two, I missed him - regardless of the abuse. I hated admitting it to myself that I actually missed him, and then having that inner battle of going back but having every reason why not to. 

It is a very difficult time especially because we 'feel' that we are alone when in reality we had been so isolated from everyone for being with just him and only him all of the time.  If it were so easy to having survived domestic violence then it wouldn't be an issue. 

Although, it isn't being taken more seriously when IT SHOULD! All I could say is that you are not alone in the sense that you are not the only one who has been through it and there are a lot more than we know who are going through it now too.  Just keep on moving forward, don't look back and keep (at least me) updated when you do start to feel better.

You don’t need to have evidence but included that just to illustrate how delusional abusers are evidence or not. 

Gaslighting also includes them putting words in your mouth, willfully misunderstanding you, and telling you what you’re thinking and feeling. Anything that they do to warp reality when they’re interacting with you I’d call gaslighting.

"I’ve been out of my abusive relationship for over 6 years now.. his favorite thing was strangling and occasionally suffocating me. He threatened to kill me several time. Shortly after we broke up, he got into a new relationship and this girl reached out to me, which I thought was odd.. so I asked if he was hurting her. She asked to meet up at a park, just the two of us, so I did. She told me he was just replaying the exact same shit he did with me. It’s like it was just a strategy for him, I always thought he was just a hothead. Anyway, she didn’t leave. They’re still together 6 years later and she’ll DM me sometimes in the middle of the night. she doesn’t tell me it’s bc they’re fighting and he lost his temper.. but I know that’s why.. we’re not friends, but she feels like I’m the only person who understands. I’ve been having a lot of nightmares recently, all involving him. In the past week I’ve had 2 different nightmares about him killing her and I don’t know what to do. I feel like I have an obligation to help her, but she doesn’t want to leave him. She doesn’t want my help, anytime I’ve brought it up in DMs she denies that she ever even met with me or told me what was going on. They’ve been together since late 2016 and I feel like at this point, she’s living on borrowed time. This was longer than I expected.. sorry, I’m just very stressed.

"When we stay in something that we know isn't healthy for us, it's because we are getting something we need (or think we need) from the interaction.

Does it feel validating to you to know he is still like this? Are there things you can do to validate your experience and strengthen your 'NO not for me. Even hearing about it is NO not for me'.

Do you feel safer in a way to stay connected on a fringe of his life?

The other thing is, when we feel really focused on someone else's life, often it's an avenue to put off or avoid feeling through healing an aspect of our own.

Would you have liked a 'you' when you were with him? Do you think that might have helped you? The idea seems nice but the truth is it probably wouldn't. And once out, the people who said NO, I can't sit back and watch what he is doing to you and what you are accepting as acceptable... those boundary points, those key moments are truths we can hang onto. There's a fine line between support and enabling. Having someone who knows gives us the sense we did something. They would say... they would call the police... they would ________. But those responsibilities are on you, the one in the relationship, not them.

Normally I would suggest you not losing contact with her, but you were, not only a victim, you were his victim. That just makes me want to run as far away from them for you. If you feel you could actually help her then do so - right away, but if not then I am so sorry for her, but the efed up part about it is we can't force her to leave just like he practically forces her to stay.

I also know what its like to be choked. 

I’m really very sorry this has happened to you, you don’t deserve it.

I’m sure they’ll begin to understand this moment of vulnerability is going to be very difficult for you, and give you the time to talk about it.

I think something else to make a point of, in case you don’t tell them or they possibly don’t understand, is that sometimes you need to wait to tell someone. Sometimes in spite of how much you like someone, they will give cues and other signals that they just aren’t going to be able to handle/understand this level of violence.

"Updated Below\*\*\*

My Fiancée (f25) an me (m36) were in bed an she woke me up to start asking about something she wanted me to purchase for her an I was extremely tired from working 12 hour shift the night before. We got into a verbal argument an she went to her side of the bed. After a few minutes I felt bad an knew that I acted upset only because I was cranky/tired. I told her I was sorry an she was like get out of here go away (out of the bedroom, we were still laying in bed). I tried to put my arms around her to tell her I was sorry. She grabbed my finger and bit it really hard. I endured it initially but after a few moments(probably seconds) I began to get worried that she was going to bite my fingertip off. Do I think she was actually going to bite it off? No, but its hard to assess that rationally when your finger tip is being bitten hard out of nowhere. Now I'm laying on the bed with one hand in her mouth being bitten an I reacted by grabbing her throat with my free hand an pushed her head off my finger an told her never to do that again. She has since moved out half of her things & is living at her girlfriends now. She is telling me that she is scared of me now (which I understand). I told her it was a reaction to having my finger being bitten (I have never placed my hands on her before in any kind of physical/harmful way in the past 18 months). She is convinced I am some sort of abusive monster an that it will spiral downward. I'm not sure what to do. I am no way trying to blame her. Imo I should have been able to deal with having my finger bitten. I don't think men should ever even hit women I think its the most pathetic thing ever. I love my fiancée deeply an can't imagine ever hurting her physically or emotionally an it breaks my heart that she thinks I'm some kind of monster. I guess I have two questions that I'm looking for help with.

1. again not trying to blame her in any way but from my perspective I was trying to stop her from biting me an to restrain her with the only option available (my one free hand as I was laying in bed). In retrospect I should have probably yelled or screamed at her to stop but It was happening so fast an my brain just reacted out of fear. Is this an indication of an abusive trait or something that could develop into me being abusive? If so what should/can I do to get help? It disgusts me to think I would ever hit an woman.
2. what should I tell my fiancée? I have apologized an told her I'll seek help/counseling to understand what I did wrong. I'm hoping I can prove to her that I'm not this monster an would never do this again even if she is biting my finger off ?

"Kudos for acknowledging that two wrongs don't make a right, but it does sound like you are being scapegoated here. Was she as apologetic for her physically abusive behavior as you were? Is she also seeking help/treatment for her problem with violence? Does she acknowledge her role is creating a situation in which physically protecting yourself became necessary?

I would suggest that if you do go to counseling, that you insist that she do so as well AND also agrees to see a counselor together. The purpose of that would be for you both to hear a (qualified) third-party's opinion on what happened and get help to set agreed-upon rules about how to handle conflict in the future. 

However if she is not acknowledging her own abusive behavior or being as proactive about addressing it and earning back your trust as you are with her, maybe it might be better to step back from the relationship entirely until she is willing to look at herself."

"Update: Thank you to everyone who replied.

So Today I called her in the morning. I told her I was sorry again , asked how she was an asked her if she was willing to talk to a therapist, psychiatrist or psychologist. I told her that she could select whoever it was so that she would not think I was making any kind of biased selection and that I would agree to any kind of counseling that she wanted even if we don't get back together it would be good for both of us. She refused. I asked her if she could at least admit that biting me was wrong & that she was .01% to blame for the escalation of the argument. She did say biting me was wrong but it was my fault that I made her do this. She also said that I had crossed a line & nothing will ever make her feel safe around me again. She said ""if I had just slapped her or pushed her"" that she could get over it but grabbing her by the throat was to far. She said she loved me then hung up on me an blocked me. Is this a normal reaction by her? The part that I think I'm most in shock over is that she is unwilling to even talk to a counselor with me. I don't know what to do now if anything but wait to see if she contacts me. Any other advice ? Thank you so much"	Upseticecream	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9970946311950684	weak	strong	no	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.
"I would say never ever lay your hands on your SO and doing so once is an indication that you may do it again, given the right provocations.  That though would be too simplistic in regard to your situation.

For one she resorted to a severe act of violence, her biting you in that moment was with intent to cause you harm.  Your reaction was there and then to defend yourself.  Your reaction was very much warranted, how you did it by going for the neck could be instinct to target the most vulnerable spot, or could be that you in turn sought very much to show her that at any moment you could end her life, so power and control.  Only you know which.

However, it truly seems that your relationship as much as you love and intend to marry her, has the signs of being toxic and unstable.

Yet you desire to continue, that being the case.  Give her all the space that she wants.  Don't try to convince her that you are not a monster and she is safe with you.  

If she decides to come back then you will have your chance going forward.   Make it clear that neither of you are to intentionally inflict physical pain on each other.

If she does not come back and this is the end, then let it be so.  The fact of the matter is that she got you to a point where you had your hand on her throat, warning her never to do that again... So if she does it again, her fate could be worse, choking or ultimately death?....

"I've been out of my abusive relationship for 3.5 weeks now, but we stay in contact since we have a 10 month old little girl. I want my husband's family to still a part of my daughter's life, so my daughter and I spent time with them yesterday. They know how my husband is and they say they understand why I wanted to leave, but they always say, ""I can see both sides."" ""I'm not on anybodies side."" It makes me so mad when I hear this. It's not like I want them to be put in the middle of having to choose sides and I know I'm not perfect, but this statement infuriates me. 

After this discussion yesterday I found myself driving home and even this morning driving to work, thinking about all the things I wish I would have said. I replay the conversation we had and I get mad all over again. Yesterday, his sister said it's frustrating that I don't want to do marriage counseling. I could feel my blood start to boil. I just wish people would educate themselves on something they know nothing about before giving advice! I've tried explaining why marriage counseling isn't advised for this and they disagree."

It messes with your desire to be believed and understood! Unfortunately most people won’t understand and won’t listen to reason, especially about an abusive loved one. It’s really challenging to have to maintain contact through coparenting. Over time you will experience more peace as you establish a new and better life as a free woman and you won’t care as much about them and their lack of knowledge. Getting them to acknowledge the abuse is a waste of time so when they make comments just bite your tongue, hold your peace and let them keep on in their bubble of ignorance.

">It messes with your desire to be believed and understood!

You're exactly right. I feel like there's nothing I can do to get them to understand. It just makes me feel crazy trying to explain the dynamic to them. They look at me like maybe I'm being a little dramatic, I don't know. I just wish I could make them read, ""Why Does He Do That."" 

I have to come to a place of accepting that if they're going to be in my life, I have to be okay that they will never understand and never agree with how I went about leaving. They know he's aggressive, but they thought it was wrong that I didn't tell him I was leaving before I did it, also that I didn't tell the family I was leaving, and that I took all our daughter's stuff like she wasn't coming back home.

"I don't know if this post belongs here but my therapist told me to give it a try. 

I just recently got out of a relationship with my ex boyfriend. Now all the red flags were there from the beginning but I chose to ignore. I just thought he needed help. Some red flags were divorced, has kids but no custody, no child support, living on the road for 5 years, only part time work and no money saved. And in his early 30s. I know I should have known. 

But my first relationship. A guy liked me and I liked him. The chemistry was amazing. Super easy to talk to. About literally everything. I opened up about my home life, personal insecurities, work life etc. Just like I thought he had been truthful about his. 

He was living with his then gf. Played the whole ""she's horrible. She doesn't treat him right etc"" and I thought maybe I could help him. I didn't think I was a bad person. He would always come to me with things and I'd help him out with food and spend a lot of our free time together. He eventually moved in to my parents home 3 months later. We moved into the basement. Terms of everything living were laid out before hand and he agreed. Contribute a small amount of money for groceries, laundry, and help around the house since my parents could not do it. It was better than paying 1000 a month for an apartment. He agreed. He started doing things when I asked him around the house. I would come home after working both jobs, cook dinner, clean, do the laundry. I figured he did the hard work I can at least do the simple stuff since I worked more. Then my mom wasn't happy with a job we did and got mad at us and explained how she wanted it done. So we said ok, we didn't know because she seemed ok with it and didn't stop us. That's when he stopped doing things around the house. He felt his work was never going to be appreciated after that one incident. When everything else he was doing was fine. So he said he was never going to do a thing for them again. I said ok. Then since you're not working, maybe you can do the chores that I do every night after I come home. The couple things like cleaning our room, taking out our trash, doing our laundry, washing our dishes or even cooking dinner. He would start a fight after every time I asked him to do one small little thing. All he would do was sit in bed on his phone or go out and work on his garden. 

He got mad at me once because I didn't have sex with him and counted the days that I didn't. Said I never made an advance at him and he's been waiting for it. So I apologized and said I've been tired because I work 14 hours a day. And the time that I would go and spend with him he would just go out with his friend. It then slowly got worse from there. Arguments about stupid little things. It was a fight every other day. Then he would go get liquor and make it even worse. There would be nights where he could keep me up all night arguing about my past and then get mad when I told him I needed sleep and he said that wasn't his problem and sleep half the day away and then be mad I was tired the next day or didn't have the same attitude toward him. 

Then he would throw my past in my face. He would use my low self esteem against me. Call me beautiful and strong one day and then call me weak the next. He would call me toxic because I stopped telling him how I felt. Because every time I told him how I felt he would say I have everything. I shouldn't feel that way. He had a harder life than me. I didn't know myself. I wasn't ready for this relationship. 

Then the day came where our money went missing. Or at least I think it was, I never knew how much was in it but trusted him that he counted correctly. It wasn't a lot. But he was mad. He kept blaming my family saying someone stole. He started drinking and kept asking again and again who took it and why did they take it. I kept saying I don't know because we had no proof. He got mad and slammed his drink down making a mess everywhere and tossing money at me which ended up having a little plastic bottle in it that hit me. He said he doesn't care about money. So we got a safe and cameras to see if anyone took anything. I thought everything was solved. We took the steps we could take. He didn't want me confronting anyone. So that was the best I could do. 

Fast forward two weeks later, he's been drinking all day because it is not a good day for him mentally. I knew it wasn't. I was there for him if he wanted to talk but he asked me to leave him alone. A little while after he said that he asked why did I leave him alone when I was just up the stairs. He got angry because he couldn't find something of his and started throwing things and then the money thing came up again. He started asking the questions again and I was so beat down from it I just said whatever he wanted me to say. Which is what I did whenever we would argue and it would be for hours. He kept asking why was HE was robbed. Why HIS money was stolen. He then took the safe I bought and threw it against the wall. Causing damage. After the chair was thrown and walls were hit and things were kicked before but that was my last straw. I told him to leave. I was very close to being the next target. I tried to keep things calm for so long. But my health was declining because of the affect I let his actions and words have on me. There is a lot more to this and I'm sorry it it so long but I needed to know if this was some sort of abuse? Was it happening all along and I didn't realize it? I'm more than happy to clarify situations. Words exchanged. The aftermath. I just needed to talk to others that might be going through what I am"	ScienceNerd1001001	post	25.81764169784267	female	White	0.0060362424701452255	na	na	na	1	domesticviolence	no prediction.
"Multiple TW: Physical Abuse, Threats of Violence, etc

I already knew that this was worse than emotional abuse, but I wanted to do a quick search just so that I had something to substantiate what I was going to say. My quick google search says that this wasn't *only* emotional, but physical abuse.

**""Physical violence** may include: hitting, punching, kicking, slapping, strangling, smothering, using or threatening to use weapons, shoving, **interrupting your sleep, throwing things, destroying property**, hurting or killing pets, and denying medical treatment.""

&#x200B;

For me, it escalated to being thrown around, pushed, leaving bruising all along my arms and ribcage, being slammed on the ground, held down, having swelling on my nose because he clapped in front of my face to intimidate me but ""accidentally"" caught my nose, and much more... but I convinced myself that it wasn't abuse because he never actually hit me. I was threatened, emotionally gaslighted, and belittled until I cut off all contact and disappeared.

&#x200B;

Noone can really answer whether or not this was happening all along for you or not because we didn't experience the same things...but I'm so glad that you got out when you did.

"CW for DV, SA

I dated this boy in high school for 3 years. At first he was perfect. I opened up to him and he really made me feel seen. We became incredibly close and spent all of our time together. I’ve had a lot of family issues and was often isolated as a kid and it led to a whole bunch of social issues that made it harder for me to make and connect with friends. He never let that bother him and seemed content with the amount of time we spent together so it really pulled me in. I opened up to him about all of the traumatic things I had been through. He knew he was the only person I had ever trusted enough to tell. A few months later he started doing things that bothered me and really made me feel like I wasn’t a priority. He took his best friend (another girl) to prom instead of me, he never did anything super special for me like he did his previous girlfriends, and he constantly hid me from his friends and made me feel like an embarrassment. As you can maybe imagine, this started creating a lot of insecurities early on. I started getting desperate for his approval and to make him stay. 

I forgave him each time. I should’ve ended it there but I was so sure in the moment that he would never lie to me and he truly loved me. He reassured me of this all the time, often using grand statements like “soulmate” and using promises. To me, those type of things carry a lot of weight and I don’t make promises I can’t keep. He often threw them around and made it hard to keep up with when he meant it. 

Over the next few months we broke up for the first time. Most time when he dumped me I would get a sob story about how he was hurting me and needed to leave, only for him to return a few months later. I always welcomed him back with open arms. When we got back together we agreed to not keep anymore secrets. To both of our surprises, we both came out as bisexual and non-binary to each other. However, while I was supportive of him and his journey he begged me to not present or tell people about my identity until he had broken up with me. That intensified the abandonment issues I had as he basically established then that there would be a next time, making me constantly afraid that at any point he would be another person to leave my life.

Again, the next few months got worse. He would start screaming at me in the car when I gave wrong directions and shoving me when I made him mad. He never hit me too hard or enough to leave a dark bruise, but it did hurt. More so emotionally than anything. I walked around all the time like a scared little kid. I was walking on egg shells terrified that the next thing I said would start another screaming match. All of my childhood trauma came flooding to the surface in my desperate attempt to get him to stay. He confided in my best friend that when I looked at him afraid it made him want to hit me harder, so I started dissociating everything. Pretty much everything from here on out is a blur. 

Sometimes during sex I would fake an orgasm because if I didn’t he would take it so personally he would hit things around me in frustration or he would get so upset with himself that he wouldn’t let me touch him. I started being afraid to tell him no to anything sexually. 

Every few months we’d go on a date where he’d be extra intimate and tell me I was his soulmate and he’s never met anyone like me, we’d have sex, just to then dump me the next day and get back together a week later. This cycle continued frequently. Sometimes he’d break up with me on important days like the anniversary of my dads death or the day of my SAT test. He’d always give a speech about how he was hurting me and couldn’t bare to anymore so he had to leave. When he went to college and I was still in high school the pattern got pretty predictable, he’d break up with me while he was in school and get back with me in the summers when he had nobody else around, convincing me I was the only one he ever truly loved each time. Every time I let him back in my self worth went lower and lower. He would often come to me in the middle of the night sobbing and apologizing for the way he treated me just to forget about it the next day. He was absolutely unpredictable with how he felt about me and he jumped back and forth between different girls at his college and me.

After our final breakup, we continued to be friends and he would tell me about his new girlfriends and how much happier he is just like he would do while we were on breaks. 

Eventually, I stopped letting it bother me. One final argument between us and I was blocked by him on most social media for good. He’s in a relationship now that’s been on and off as well and I got into a relationship with the most kind, beautiful, gentle, woman on this planet. She’s truly my everything and makes me feel so loved and safe. I’m so grateful for her. But everything I do I’m afraid I’m turning into him. My biggest fear is someday lashing out at her. One time she tugged me across the street (not maliciously it was a playful tug) and it sent me into a panic attack. I felt so bad for making her worry about me and being so broken in front of her. I know it’s too much to take for her sometimes. My mental health has become a burden for everyone around me but no amount of medication or therapy has helped. 

My therapist says I have PTSD, but I just don’t want to think he did anything that bad to me. I still see him as a good person and I feel guilty for hurting him despite him hurting me. I think about it all the time. Sometimes I feel stuck there. I tried reaching out to my ex for closure. To apologize for the things that I did and to hopefully hear from him the same but he told me to not contact him again and the final social media account of mine was blocked. 

Any time I brought up the trauma he caused me he told me I always played the victim and made him the bad guy. He told me he didn’t remember any of those things happening and brushed it off. It made me feel so crazy. When he brought it up it was always my job to forgive him and comfort him, otherwise I risked losing contact with him for months. These things only happened behind closed doors and I feel like I can’t be the only one he treated that way and if I was, did I do something so terrible to deserve it? Everyone loves him and part of me still loves him as a person, though I’ve come to realize I never had romantic feelings for him in the first place, at least not the way I do about my girlfriend. Yet, I feel guilty every day and despite reading this over and knowing what he did was wrong, I still remember him as a good person and my old best friend. I still wait by the phone hoping to hear that he’s doing good and he’s playing the newest smash bros update. I feel guilty for my girlfriend that he’s still on my mind sometimes, but I can still feel the way my body hit the ground when he shoved me and it’s just not something I can shake off. I’m hoping that if he still sees the good in me everyone can.

I (36F) left my now ex-wife (36F) nine months ago and have realized (through time, space, introspection, and a good therapist) that my spouse has a LOT of psychopathic traits. I’m realizing I have been a victim of psychopathic abuse which seems to be much less common or talked about than narcissistic abuse.

"Yes, my ex was diagnosis by a court psychiatrist/psychologist (can't remember which as it was years ago) with narcissistic personality disorder verging on psychopathy. Psychopathy was definitely an accurate description. 

He was deliberately cruel for fun, treated me like a toy, a game, rather like a cat plays with a mouse, keeping it alive and torturing it. He had ZERO empathy and told me some pretty disgusting things upfront like ""I'm breaking you and building you up as the wife I want you to be"".
He would admit to the social worker that he had punched me in the eye, for example, then when they told him he could give me a brain haemorrhage and kill me, he said he only tapped me gently. When challenged, he said, ""She punched herself in the face. All this with a straight face and eye contact. His eyes used to fill up with black, like black holes surrounded by red where the whites were, eating up his irises. That's how I knew he was about to have a violent episode. Just like a cat's pupils swell when they're hunting. He raped me violently after beating me, telling me that I loved it. He said it excited him when I was crying, struggling and shouting no, get off me, you're hurting me.

Psychopaths are experts at pretending to be kind, loving and empathetic in order to lure victims in. He was all that and then he would switch. Absolutely terrifying."	reginaphalange617	reply	na	na	na	0.0051878346130251884	no	strong	no	na	domesticviolence	failed
"TW

My ex was a sadistic, abusive person who excused their sadism as ""bdsm"". They talked about being turned on by the thought of killing me or seriously injuring me. They beat me, strangled me, and raped me. 

It started as light consensual bdsm but soon transformed into non-consensual abuse, and I would not be listened to any time I revoked my consent when things got out of hand. The non-consensual strangulation left the bedroom, and it became very scary.

They were diagnosed with ODD early in childhood, which became conduct disorder. I did not grasp the severity of their mental illnesses going into the relationship, and I tried to be sympathetic because I knew they had been seriously abused by their parents during their childhood and teenage years, when I should have run.

Based on how they expressed to me that they had a lack of empathy towards people and animals, and a strong desire to commit arson and other destructive inclinations, I suspect the conduct disorder developed into ASPD. 

Being with them was very frightening, yet interesting. Before them, I had thought of people with ASPD as monsters, and I thought they had a complete lack of care towards human and animal life. This person seemed to sometimes WANT to care, but just couldn't feel things the way we feel. They didn't understand it when I tried to explain, and they were occasionally frustrated by their inability to understand. Though, their moments of ""clarity"" and their longing to be ""normal"" could have all been a show. 

I've never met anyone else like them, and I never want to again."	reginaphalange617	reply	na	na	na	0.0051878346130251884	no	strong	no	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.

I’ve seen the mask slip and she’ll be dark and blank in the eyes and admit that she intentionally lies to people but doesn’t care because she doesn’t care about anyone.

She said she should have had an abortion. When I pulled her up on it she called me a liar, asked me why  I make up lies about her. I don't think she's a psychopath, because she's got several different personalities. Maybe she has DID, and one of her personalities is a psychopath/sadist, and the others are completely unaware of her psycho behaviour. Else she's just a basic covert narcissist.

" I've been with my partner for almost five years now, with breakups sprinkled here and there--the longest of which was 2 months. Most others didn't last a day, no longer than 3. I've known he was abusive since about 6 months in, at least on an intellectual level. It took another 5, one of which was in another country, to fully realize that emotionally. When I came back from studying abroad, I broke up with him--but my father convinced me to get back together with him.

It started with lying and gaslighting, icing me out, and biting--non-consensual, all over my body, hard enough to leave black and blue bruises, usually in response to something I said or did that he didn't like. I didn't really register any of that as abuse up until one time while I was having a panic attack he grabbed me by the hair, pulling it and forcing my head back, and getting up in my face during a ""fight""--I had been trying to tell him how he made me feel when he would fuck me just long enough for him to cum, zip his pants up, and then go in the other room to hang out with my roommate.

But all that is beside the point: it got worse, ofc, because I didn't leave and stay gone. When I got my own apartment during the pandemic, he moved in the day after--after we had a big fight and he threatened to break up with me--and he didn't even tell me he was moving in, I thought he was just coming over and then his mom called me asking for directions so she could drop off his furniture. The pandemic made the isolation worse and he got more and more violent. Throwing and breaking things, he put a hole in our bedroom door, reckless driving when I pissed him off, etc. One night he told me he was gonna hang out with friends and I asked him if he was gonna drink. He said no. I told him he could if he wanted, again, no, he said he wanted to come home to me and promised on his own accord not to drink. A couple of hours later and he acted like that never happened, so he was met with his bags packed at the door. Big fight, ended up staying together. He had the audacity to ask me to unpack his shit since I was the one who did it, to begin with. I told him hell no, and then he raped me the next day. I told him to get psychological help or I'd have to report and leave him. He kept telling me he would. During another argument a month or so later, I bring up talking to someone again. He shoots back that he is. I ask who--it's his boss, and she agrees with him that he didn't rape me. I ask him what he told her and he recounts a VERY different version of events--I know my version isn't wrong because I wrote it all down and have the messages I sent my friends after it happened. If I hadn't done that, he would've absolutely succeeded in gaslighting me. Eventually, he admits to the rape and supposedly tells his boss that he lied to her--I have no idea if that's true or not. Then he decided to move back in with his mom to ""save money on gas"" after we found out my financial aid was cut and I wouldn't be able to afford rent on my own--and he completely abandoned me too. Not just financially. I didn't see him for over a month after he moved out. Every date we had planned he canceled last minute and he didn't even really text me, let alone call. So I finally broke up with him--this was the longest breakup. I started seeing another guy, I was on a lot of drugs and suicidal at the time and obviously drowning financially. Other guy left, my physical health got really bad--lost a lot of weight and strength, couldn't keep anything in me, and couldn't even stand to shower. Drs had no idea what was wrong--ex swooped back in to save the day by convincing me to sign a 1bdr yearlong lease with him and get back together with him so he can take care of me. I told him I would never consider a 1bdr with him again, so I wouldn't feel trapped in the relationship or the lease because one of us could find a sublease, but he managed to talk me out of that too. Now, that lease is up in a week. I spent the first part of the last year high out of my mind thinking I was doomed to end up just like my parents and that I would never be happy again--then HE ended up in the hospital for a couple of months. And I realized it was SO MUCH EASIER living by myself again. That I enjoyed it. That I needed to, yet again, get the fuck out. He has tackled me to the ground in this apartment, hands wrapped around my throat, WHILE I was sick. And even though that was at the beginning of this lease, in between then and now were his hospital and recovery months. Recently, his behavior has gotten bad again. Issues with consent (I told him I wasn't ready for penetration so he slathered on some lube and just did it anyway, for example) and disregarding my feelings, though nothing physically abusive. I've known since January that I have to leave him for good this time. I've been planning it for almost six months. And now there's just a week left and my dad got in my head again. ""you don't have to break up with him right away you know"". He knows because I'm moving back in with my parents, which is pretty remarkable in and o itself. I'm a neuroqueer liberal arts student trying to get a master's in social work and my family is uber-conservative, unsupportive, and ofc downright abusive at times. They were and still are toxic at the very least. I've been disowned for NOT being racist by them before, literally.

I'm so scared I'm making the wrong decision. I have Borderline Personality Disorder as well and I'm wondering if I'm splitting or making problems where they aren't any. I really don't think so but I feel like I can't trust myself. My friends all hate my boyfriend. I'm ashamed of myself for being with him still. I don't want to introduce my new friends and co-workers to him, etc. It's better than it was--he's not AS abusive. Maybe he's not abusive at all anymore. But I'm still not happy. And I still don't feel safe around him or trust him.

To make matters worse, I owe him a considerable amount of money. I do plan on paying him back because I told him I would, but it'd have to be over time and I was planning on having a mutual friend mediate for us if it was needed there because I want to be completely no contact. I also was planning on breaking up with him over text after we were completely moved out, but:

Our lease ends on our 5-year anniversary. Exactly. And my dad made a comment about that too. I don't want to break up with this man over text on our 5y anniversary but he has proven himself to be dangerous and I'm worried that if I do it face-to-face again I won't be able to stick to it, just like every other time before. I need this to be it. I don't know. I guess I'm just looking for reassurance. Am I doing the right thing? Is there a better way to go about this?"

"Your life is in danger so it’s important to leave as soon as possible. Be careful not to let in that you’re considering leaving as once he works it out, your danger level skyrockets. 

I’m thinking maybe the 5 year anniversary is a day he will be expecting to spend time with you and is particularly aware of your whereabouts, so it might be safer to pick another day soon after that he won’t be home? Or even earlier, e.g. if that day is likely to be a dangerous one for you, both being your anniversary and him possibly expecting sex etc, and the end of your lease so him being on high alert from then on that you might leave. 

Is there any way you can pack up and disappear before your anniversary? Somewhere, even a shelter, you could go to in the meantime until you go back to your dad’s? Chat to a DV hotline about ideas where to go and to go over your exit plan. 

If you do leave a little while before the lease ends, have a chat to a DV hotline about what that will mean for you. Some places have laws that allow DV victims to sever themselves from a lease early. It may be wise to take photos or a video walk through when you leave, and let the landlord know once you left that you have escaped due to DV, and will pay the remainder of your lease.

"(I am being gender specific, because I believe a bit of misogyny is at play here, but I am aware this can be applied to people who identify differently. )

Ignorance is bliss. Yes? No? 

A woman tells her male friend a story about a man being abusive. Provides audio evidence. Friend REFUSES (remaining ignorant) to listen “to people screaming at each other.” (Only one person is screaming…the abuser.) 

Friend says “if I had SEEN it happen, I would have killed him myself.” 
How often do these things play out publicly? How often does it happen behind closed doors? Seriously, most abusers are calculated and cunning, and dare not risk their status or reputation by acting out in such ways publicly. So, you just don’t believe her? 

Next thing friend says: “Why did you stay? Why didn’t you go to the police?” Lots of answers to these two victim blaming questions. Love, and fear will suffice for this scenario. So, since she didn’t leave immediately, or run to the police at the get-go, you just don’t believe her? 

Woman suffers post traumatic stress and psychosomatic manifestations of abuse. But fuck her, it’s her fault for staying, for not immediately reporting it, right? 

People who she once considered friends side with the abuser, because it’s convenient for them. 

Abuser avoids ALL accountability, and goes on searching for his next victim.

"Much like sexual offences, domestic violence cases are falsely reported at around 3% which is the same as any other crime.

As you've said, there is a serious lack of understanding and a humongous lack in empathy when people disclose, which means that many people don't leave, drop charges etc because they feel hopeless and alone. This is then spun as ""oh, they must have made the whole thing up."" 

The false reports being the reason for people's lack of empathy and understanding is a myth, perpetuated by abusers and yes, a lot of men, to discredit people who dare to speak out. People falsely report theft all the time, but when someone reports theft they aren't automatically seen as lying.

Also - the victims asks (so to speak) more of the community/society. The abuser only asks they enable/let them off by turning w blind eye. Supporting us means taking in and acknowledging horrific behavior. Empathy for us. Accountability and justice to them. And so on. It feels obvs to me now. Judith Herman (psychiatrist, pioneering PTSD researcher) says this similarly in the beginning of Trauma & Recovery (classic book about), and re reading floored me after escaping a clusterfuck trifecta of abusive relationship, systemic abuse/gaslighting by the medical system, and lotta fake or fair weather friends outing themselves. 

Sadly, lotta fucking people are spineless, don’t know “how” to respond and thinking nothing is better than risking not getting it right, or just plain lazy. And we humans have an irrational impulse that can tell us if we stick out heads in the sand and don’t let in we’ve seen it, it can’t happen to us. Conversely, victims can get viewed pretty much superstitiously as if we’re literally contagious, disease vectors of social contagion."

My spouse and I had a pretty physical fight over a month ago. He hit me in the face and pushed my head into the corner of a wall. I hit back as an immediate fight response. And I feel like I’ve turned into a shell of a person because of it. Currently feeling like I can’t feel any emotions besides sadness and anger. Usually I get over these fights pretty easily but there’s just something different about this one. My heart feels empty. I’m temperamental and extremely defensive if their attitude changes in the slightest. Just curious if I’ll always feel this sad and blank.	sheakeit	post	1.1624934372932145	female	White	0.9994148015975952	na	na	na	2	domesticviolence	no prediction.
As long as you remain in an abusive relationship, yes. Responsive violence is not the same as the violence enacted upon you. It has a chronic, all encompassing effect on who you are, how you feel, how you think. It’s not healthy and it doesn’t ever end well. Consider getting out.	sheakeit	reply	na	na	na	0.9994148015975952	no	no	no	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.
I was involved with a guy up until about 4 years ago, when I ran away with pretty much nothing. He caused me to lose almost everything. He threatened to burn the house down. Threats of gun violence. Busted teeth, head butting, face stomping, choking. Would prevent me from leaving the house to go to work hoping to cut off my income. I was trapped. For one of his domestic violence cases, he was sentenced by a judge that primarily handled juvenile cases. The judge told him, you’re getting too old for this, when people are still acting this way (in his 30s), the next step up is a murder case. The judge was tied by the misdemeanor charge he was facing and was sentenced to some pitifully short jail sentence. That said, he still had keys and basically squatted at my house. I tried to make him leave, but the police said they couldn’t make him. After he was back, one time he grabbed my jaw so hard it crushed my molars and it caused me to start spitting on gushing blood from cutting my cheek really deep. Blood was dripping down my face, onto my clothes and pooling on the floor. I ended up begging to go to the hospital and checked myself into the mental unit just to get away. Complete denial of why my face was bruised. Came home a few days later, “I cleaned the blood out of your shirt. You should say thank you.” Monster. Then my wake up call was when he gave me an upper cut to my jaw, broke more teeth, and I couldn’t even close my jaw for several days. That was it. I’m doing whatever it takes to leave. No car. No money. I didn’t care. Ended up hitching a ride with a friend that was an otr trucker. My friend made arrangements for me to stay with a friend of a friend out of state, and picked me up an hour away from what was no longer home. My statements got him only a few months in jail, with his attorney asking why I didn’t call the police when he did these things. The monster would take my phone away or break my phones. I was prevented from calling police and leaving during those hot moments. Total victim blaming. My statements weren’t good enough. As I have tried to move on with my life, he has now been charged with first degree attempted murder on someone else in a dv incident. Shot a girl multiple times. Left for dead. The guilt I feel is real, but I tried. I tried so hard. I warned the judge. Hopefully this is the case that seals his fate to prison, but I feel terrible he had the opportunity to do this. That juvenile judge was right. It is haunting.	Longjumping_Sail2542	post	25.415734193925964	male	White	0.9964050054550171	na	na	na	3	domesticviolence	no prediction.
I'm so sorry you're dealing with such a burden, and I'm so proud of you for doing everything you could to have the justice system do its job.

"It’s real simple. Consent. 

I’d say she didn’t want to be hugged (restrained) from behind and smothered with kisses (assaulted), and she want to make sure to impress that fact upon you, making me think you’d likely already been verbally told her feelings about it, probably several times. Now you want to go “I was only being affectionate and she assaulted me”. 

By choosing the word “bear hug” to describe what you did to her, you draw the inference that you are much larger than she is, do you realize that? For me it illustrates that you were aware that what you intended to do was physically restrain her, to force capitulation. That’s assault. And the reason for restraining her was to force “smothering kisses” on her, that she would not be able to reject, or stop, so without her consent, because she was being restrained, by you, correct?  That’s sexual assault. 

You’ve decided that what you did was affectionate, and her response was assault and uncalled for? Uh, no."	CarobAffectionate708	reply	na	na	na	0.9922652244567871	weak	no	no	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.

**TW: Violence** My ex-spouse assaulted me just a month before our divorce was to be finalized. They were intent on murdering me and would have done so if another person hadn't intervened.

For some reason, the police chose to believe my ex when they said they didn't do anything and I was the one that had attacked them. They decided they couldn't be sure what, if anything, had happened, so they just left.

When I requested the police report, I saw that they had my ex listed as the victim. I attempted to reach out to local DV services for over a month to determine if I could get a restraining order against them even if they were listed as a victim. I never heard back from them.

My ex has now decided to weaponize my child. They are insisting that they can drop by anytime they want to see my child, even though our custody agreement clearly states this is not the case. They are also trying to make my life very difficult in a way that puts the well-being of my child at risk in regard to scheduled visitations.

What are my options here? I want to never have contact with this person. They are not legally allowed into my home but the continuous harassment and threats to not follow the custody agreement are really wearing me down- physically and emotionally.

I have additional proof that they were not the victim. Can I still get a restraining order? I don't even know who to contact or turn to about this at this point."	Simple_Employer2968	post	37.16215736679838	female	White	0.999376118183136	na	na	na	4	domesticviolence	no prediction.
"Yes you can absolutely get a restraining order. Since the DV agency has been worthless so far, you may file one by yourself or consider having your attorney file it for you and represent you at the hearing to finalize it. Because your child is in danger too it you should include your child on the restraining order as well. Usually restraining orders can modify custody arrangements or force the existing custody order to modification to take the RO into account. 

The police failed you too but I would recommend reporting the assault even though they took your ex’s side. Report it because it happened and you have proof he wasn’t telling the truth. Leaving this alone will leave out a boost to getting your restraining order and everything else you need on the divorce/custody side of things. You have to be relentless and annoying about calling multiple times a day or even visiting in person until they take a proper report and the DA presses charges against your ex."

"Some non lawyer thoughts:  Since your ex is listed as the victim, it might be a good idea to hire a criminal lawyer to help you to avoid any potential charges, or at least correct the record.  They'd know what to do in this kind of situation, kwim?  Ask your divorce atty if they can refer you to someone or even a lawyer who specializes in domestic abuse cases on behalf of victims.

  It's so upsetting that you're the victim and needed another person to intervene but the cops wrote it up wrong.  It sucks about what happened with DV support in your area. That you called for weeks for help and didn't get a response is awful. I'm assuming they don't have a 24 hour hotline if you couldn't reach someone. I'm sorry that you're not getting help.  It sounds like you're going to have to really advocate for yourself which is why I think you should at the very least talk to a lawyer. 

Did the police take a witness statement from the person who helped you?  Is that person willing to speak to the authorities on your behalf.  Did you have injuries at the time that needed medical attention?  Is there a documented history of prior abuse like police reports, emergency room reports, etc.?  It is in your best interest to gather every bit of documented evidence you can think of.  You might want to log and document every contact your ex makes with you and your child.

I don’t know why he (24m) thinks it’s ok to request photos and a letter from me (34f) while there’s a restraining order in place and he’s locked up. But he did and through his brother. When I got the request it gave me hope for some reason but also made me cry. He specifically asked for photos of us together and a letter from me. I had to think about it because I know there’s a restraining order in place but it’s not like I’m sending them to him directly. I can’t send a letter but I did give his brother pictures of us together. It was up to him after that. All this makes me do is think he misses me. He still loves me? Or is this still a tactic? I can’t tell. Idk what to expect when he gets out which should be in September but could be sooner because of good behavior. I mean, he was made a trustee. I have no clue who he’s been talking to and telling his side of this whole situation while he’s in there. I still love him. I think about him every day. Hard not to when I still have his possessions and regardless of what anyone thinks, I’m going to hold onto them because I don’t trust anyone else and his brother can’t take the car. I feel so lost in this. Wanting to figure out a way to move forward without burning bridges that I’m sure everyone else who knows the extent of our 3 1/2 year relationship thinks I should. I started reading that book someone posted to link to about “Why Does He Do That?” so I can better understand and help myself to do better. Does he think there’s hope for us? Does he see the error in his ways and how he seriously needs to grow and change his thinking?  Or does he just feel lonely and I’m one of the ones who hasn’t given up on him. Idk right now. But his request has left me torn. I know his behavior in the past has been anything but healthy. I go back to good memories but can’t forget the bad memories either. I stopped smoking weed to help myself with my dreams and to save money but my mind seems to want to block out a good deal of my nightmares now so I barely remember anything at all when my dreams are so vivid usually. I wish the protective order wasn’t there but I know it won’t last forever. It’s extremely hard for me to let go of him. Idk why he has such a mental hold on me. This trauma bond and soul tie is beyond anything I’ve ever experienced and I’ve had them before.

"Orders of protection don’t just prohibit him contacting you directly but also contacting you indirectly though a third party. Using his brother to reach out to you is almost certainly a violation of your OOP and you should report him.

He abused you severely enough that you require an OOP and severely enough that he ended up behind bars. After abusing you like that he ought to know that he isn’t the person you need in your life to be healthy. If he truly was reformed he would understand and respect that. Love means wanting you to be happy and whole and safe and that can’t happen as long as you’re still in a relationship with your abuser.

"Oh man, oh man. This post really hits home with me and it sounds almost exactly how I feel/think too. Is he locked up bc of dv or any kind of abuse towards u? I'm just curious. My husband is locked up right now too and it's bc of dv on me. We've been together 15 years so I can totally understand how u feel hopeful and still constantly have him on your mind. How long has he been locked up now? Was he abusive towards u in multiple ways or was it more specific? I'm not gonna sit here and tell u to leave him bc u know what u need to do, but I also get how doing so is virtually impossible it seems. I feel the same as u do with our souls being together as one rather than separate. I know that I love my husband and I'm even in love with him still. It's not just the ""trauma bond"" that makes me feel that way, but bc I know that in the deepest parts of my soul, I love him and feel a sense of completion with him that I don't without. It's extremely challenging and no one can ever possibly understand if they've never been thru it themselves. It's been 6 months that he's been in jail, and this is the first time ever he's went for dv and first time ever staying more than a night. I have been in my feelings something fierce many nights and have seriously debated whether I want to continue to stay or whether it's time for me to go and only have myself to worry abt. I have many feelings but one of the ones that I prob exp the most is anger. So much anger built up from so many years bc I'd always forgive him and push all those bad feelings away. Well come to find out, I wasn't pushing them away so these feelings weren't just disappearing. No, they were tucked away in a corner and not worried abt anymore until it was too much. There was just too much that was never dealt with and that I'd ""forgave"" so now I was faced with this load of emotions and idk how to handle them at times. It was days of crying, yelling, not talking like normal, and me telling him how I really and truly felt now and also back then. I was really undecided if we were gonna be together or not bc there were several times I thought of just walking away and not answering the phone again when he called. Bc if I didn't speak to him daily and as much as we do then I could move on. I'd get over feeling like I couldn't do it or staying bc the fear of the unknown. I could just think of all the bs I went thru when I'd have any moments of weakness or thoughts of getting back with him. It would've taken some time but I could've done that if I chose to but I didn't. Instead, we stayed together after some serious talking and discussions abt the future. Plus, I feel that the way I love and care abt him that I'd prob move on while he's locked up and us not talking anymore. But once he gets released then it'd be a diff story bc I don't think I could continue being apart bc at that first sight of him it'd immediately take out any current feelings I had and the only thing in the world I'd care abt would be him. So, it feels pointless plus I don't think I could do it now, mainly bc my life circumstances have changed since then (last week) when I was in my feelings and seriously considering leaving. And it would've been much easier to do so then compared to now, where I feel like it would literally be impossible. So, I really get how u feel like u do. And sorry for such the long post. I was just sharing my feelings with u so that u really know u aren't alone nor are u crazy for any of it. Love makes u do the craziest and insane things that otherwise, u would never do for anything in the world lol. My mom told me when I was a teenager ""love will make u do some crazy things"" and I didn't understand what she meant. Then, a few years later, when we were 18, I got with my husband and that's when I understood the meaning behind those words and I agree 100% that it does make u. But if u ever want someone to chat with then you're more than welcome to msg me. I always enjoy talking to others bc I've met many that I've had some good conversations with. But either way, I wish u the best going forward and hope u can find happiness and peace with your decision. U deserve it just like everyone else.

He’s locked up because of what he did to me and my security cameras caught it and had to report him because he could’ve killed me. He was convicted of felony DV and sentenced to 364 days in jail and 3 years probation. This is his first time being locked up. He’s been in since March. Thank you for your feedback. Makes me feel less crazy. I’ve done some crazy things because of him that I’m not proud of but I’ve learned. Idk how I’m gonna react or feel when he gets out. I’ve been having dreams about it but it’s so confusing. I’m opening to messaging too. The rational thing to do for me is to not be intimately involved with him again but lately, because of this, I keep thinking about kissing and hugging him again. But I’m also feeling rather affection deprived and missing physical touch as it is one of my love languages and I can’t bring myself to touch any other man. You’ve been with your husband far longer than I have with my former bf so I can see how it’s extremely difficult. I don’t even really feel single. I’m not emotionally available for anyone else. I still have anger but my forgiveness tends to overcome me and if he starts blaming me again for why he’s been locked up and having resentments towards that instead of owning his behavior, my anger will rise again. Sometimes I just wish I could shut that part of my brain off and not have feelings about him anymore but my head just isn’t working like that. And his request has only made it harder to let go. This is the longest we’ve not been able to talk to each other let alone see each other. I also blame my codependency.

So I’m new here, but I am so confused and I don’t know what to do. This morning he got upset with me because I made a comment that I was ready to move out. He put a blanket over my nose and mouth and began to strangle me. I was trying my best to scream for help to my kids. But he was squeezing so tight I could not even speak. My son walked out and saw what was happening and ran out the door to the neighbors and they called the police. He was arrested immediately and since it’s Sunday, he’ll be there until tomorrow at least. He called me tonight from jail so I answered I have no idea why 😞 just for him he really messed up and he loves me so much and that he’s going to fix all of this and go to counseling. This is the 3rd incident he put his hands on me, but the first incident where the police came and he was arrested. I’ve been too scared to speak up because it’s always strangulation when he does it. I walk in egg shells every day at home. While he’s been gone all day, I packed all of my stuff and moved to my moms for now. I’m just so lost. I feel like someone died in me today.

Leave him. It will never get better. My child fathers strangled me for 10 years. I finally left him recently and had him trespassed from my home. Every time he put his hands on me he promised it would never happen again, he was sorry, treated me like royalty for a week then he would do it all over again. 10 years. It never changes.

I grew up in an emotionally abusive household and then was in a long term emotionally abusive relationship. Even though I am no longer in that relationship, I’m still struggling. When I date now it’s hard for me to see “red flags” because I have a messed up version of what I consider “safe”. I am in desperate need of someone to talk to or any resource.

Hi, I got a notification that my comment had been deleted because the link I sent could harm reddit users- maybe it's just a general safety thing for websites they're not familiar with. What it was, was a website called bloom, which has free online courses for people wanting help recovering from trauma. If you do a search for bloom, it should come up. It's run by an organization called chayn, and is recommending by women's aid.	luckymurkymuck	reply	na	na	na	0.9979100823402405	weak	no	no	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.
"I’ve been seeing my boyfriend since 2021. We met when I was 18 and he was 20. I am now 20 and he is 22. We both lived in toxic households with our parents. My mom was an alcoholic, stepdad doesn’t care for me and made my life hell. My boyfriends parents were controlling and sometimes his dad was physically abusive. He told me stories of his father holding a weapon to his head threatening to kill him. We wanted to escape our lives. I wanted to get out so badly, I would do anything. He seemed like my saving grace. 

There were warning signs. He would take his dads gun and put it under the seat in the car. He once drove to the park and too it out, and asked me why he shouldn’t kill himself. I wanted to call the police then. I was shaking. But I didn’t because I loved him, and I wanted out of my situation at home. I hadn’t experienced a real relationship yet either. Just kiddy love. He would make all sorts of comments that I should have taken more seriously. Like telling me if I ever cheated on him, how he would torture me. But these behaviors “calmed down.” We moved in together. Not but a month later, I got pregnant. We are living out our second lease together right now. We moved in a month ago. Our child is 2 months old. He is going back to his old self. He isn’t threatening to kill himself, but he can’t control his anger. He doesn’t know how to act with the baby. 

When we are around other people he is gentle and caring. He shows concerns, he even criticizes others for not being gentle enough. But at home it’s a different story. He yells at her. He calls her names. When I’m not able to (shower or such) and he gets her a bottle, he get frustrated that she isn’t drinking fast enough. He antagonizes her with the bottle. He forces her to drink everything to the point she throws up. The worst part is I can’t stop him. He gets worse when I tell him it’s too rough. He physically blocks me from taking her from him. If I say I’m uncomfortable he will try to scare me on purpose. He has held her upside down trying to scare me. He “pats” her too hard and it makes her cry. I know it hurts her. When I tell him this he gets mad at me. He tells me I’m too gentle and I spoil her and if I don’t stop now I’ll always be too gentle. He is scaring me. 

I thought he would learn to manage the frustration of an infant, but the calmer and easier things get as she is getting older, he is not getting any better. I feel guilty for having my daughter in this environment. I am thinking about leaving. But I don’t know what to do. I am on maternity leave and he has all the savings. I have two cats that have nowhere to go if they don’t come with me. I just started to tell my mom about this this morning. Her reaction was, “what the fuck” and “this is not okay.” And she told me she would discuss more with me later as she was at work.

 I told my grandma who lives a few hours away that I couldn’t rely on my boyfriend to take care of baby because he can’t control his anger. She was asking if I could have him take care of her because I’m having postpartum complications. I didn’t go into details of his behaviors but she is begging me to leave and come stay with her. 

Her husband, my grandfather, was an abuser who tormented her and my father. She doesn’t want me to go through that. She is warning me to leave before it gets worse. I know something needs to give. This isn’t healthy. I want to tell my boyfriends mom about his behavior but I’m scared. I know she would help me somehow and that she loves her granddaughter. She knows he has temperament issues. Where do I start. I’m scared. I’m worried what I’m going through is not “enough.”

 I am scared. I’m worried for my future. I don’t want to be a failure of a mother. What do I do… "	barnwater_828	post	25.451831392393284	female	White	0.9980255365371704	na	na	na	3	domesticviolence	no prediction.
"You need to get out of it and make sure that the child is nowhere near him. My father and others tried to justify his abuse because he wasn't as bad as his father. If you want your child to grow up sane and healthy then I'm sorry but you'll have to leave.

I was in almost the same situation with my daughters father and I tried to make things work and time and time again he made empty promises so I left for her safety. I put a camera out and said it was a baby monitor and was able to record some of his behavior towards her and me. I planned everything over the course of 2 weeks and gathered as much evidence as I could and talked to multiple attorneys to make sure I wasn’t doing anything that could look bad in court if he came for custody of her. I didn’t allow him alone with her for months because I was scared for her safety and towards the end I just played along and acted like nothing was wrong. The day I left (he was at work) I went to the courthouse and filed for an order of protection that included our daughter. I came home and packed as much as I could with my parents and we left before he got off. He was served the OOP a few days later and tried to contest it, but because I had video evidence it stayed in place. They unfortunately removed our daughter from it saying her deserved parenting time, but we live in a different state now so he doesn’t really see her.

"A little context my father has been abusing me and my mother for years now. My mother at the front of verbal and physical violence, and me at the front of verbal violence. 
And yesterday my father was shouting at mother again, so I couldn't take it anymore and blew up at him. This is the first time I've ever done so. And now I don't know what he is going to do today, as he is unpredictable due to him being bipolar and it scares me so so much.

"I’ve just been floating around living in hiding, basically. And I am hiding from him. Also hid from an unwanted court case - only wanted the ex to made to fuck off from breaking into our old house, not be used to relive trauma for a system I don’t believe in could pat itself on the back for trying to slap him on the wrist. If that gives you a sense of closure, justice - cool. I’ll pass. I’m not sure how compounding the trauma hiding from a DA with a rep for threatening abused women with material witness warrants, or if I’d submitted to a system that’d intrude and nag me in ways eerily similar to his shit, did a damn thing but provoke him more and leave me more emotionally shredded and pissed off. 

So I’ve been in limbo for over half a year now. Moved out of our house bcs he found a way to terrorize me aided and abetted by the cops -with a goddam restraining order, but I was dying to get out of that stupid little town. I’ve been supposedly moving back to where I’d long wanted to, but really I’ve been house sitting/borrowing/subletting like I’m Harry and Meghan. Being such a PTSD case it’s all I’ve been able to do to keep my business afloat and become a privacy expert so my location isn’t made available to any asshole who can google, thanks to data brokers. I know I need therapy etc etc but I can’t stomach pity or judgement from anyone who only knows the cliches. And I don’t have money or know if I can still get it reimbursed by that states crime victim fund after not being a willing pawn. 

It is like I’m still on the same leash as when I lived with his malignant jealousy and twisting my mind into knots. I’ve been burnt or burnt the bridges that werent solid, which few were in the shitty little city. Somehow covid then him, and the aftermath took me from busy social life to shut in. People eventually stop reaching out if you’re crap at replying bcs the trauma response has shot your executive function to hell. I lost a lot of numbers changing to a new phone because he broke the old one, towards the end. Im tired of being the one judged and shit on for being abused, for saying so, for being with him in the first place. I’ve tried to find a support group but there’s been nothing in the remote area i landed, and I haven’t been able to find anything virtual looking online or calling hotlines. Idk what to do with myself. I feel like I gave him my future and he smashed it. I knew him for 20 years before (so I really should’ve known better, apparently, but I had no idea he was so fucked up til we were together) and now he incomprehensible, I’ll probably never know what crazy shit he’d say he actually believed, if he can see that’s he’s actually the one that broke us, if he gives a shit. I was devastated he wrecked us, but now more that he turned me into the walking dead. That sounds ripe for someone calling it healing but I don’t feel it at all. I wish I did. It’s amazing what a wreck they can make of our lives in so many ways. My cat I’ve had for 15 years is dying and I hate that he’s who I most wished I could call. I don’t respond but he regularly harrasses me. Or whatever you call Jekyll and Hyde messaged to my blocked messages vmail (why is that even a thing? Fuck you apple, I block a number for reasons.) At least it reminds me what I’m not missing? I’m too old to be falling apart like this but I’ve never been fucked with like he did. It’s infuriating that he still has this power over me.

I wish I knew what to do with myself. I’ve been saying im finally moving back to the huge city that has a lot of reasons to on paper, after my baby goes. I don’t want to be in an empty house that has memories of my lil ride or die. Moving back to a huge dog eat dog city and unfucking my life seems like saying I’m going to build a spaceship and move to the moon. Has anyone been this fucked up this long and pulled yourself out of it? How? I’m not bitching instead of trying, it’s because its been like banging my head against the wall of my PTSD dungeon .

"I wanted to be the person who could tell you everyone was wrong, that there is a chance they can change and things get better. I thought it was going to happen in my case, because the abuse was infrequent, my partner showed remorse and went to all the therapy and abuse programs, was even reading the book with me ""Why does he do that"".  
What I know now is that people do change a little when they put in work to, but not in the way you hope they will. So while they might not do every most extreme thing they used to, or they might do it a little less frequently, they will still not respect you and there isn't really a way to be happy in that situation.

"NO! But it’s so common for them to promise to get better and even go to therapy. I married to abusive men. The first lasted 13 years and he was age 22 to 35. The second one was 8 years
And he was between the ages of 49  to 55. I mention this because I have been with somebody from the onset to older

They always get worse. If they’ve had a taste of control and power, it’s not some thing that goes away no matter how much you both might want it. I coach Survivors and I see it every day. You might want to Google the abuse cycle. Basically it’s that they abuse and beg for forgiveness, they might be on their best behavior for a few weeks but they cannot sustain it. 

A lot of women feel that an abuser will get better when a child is brought into the picture but that is 100% untrue.

There’s a lot of great research out there. I recommend a book called  “ why does he do that” by Lundy bankroft

If you contact Domestic Violence hotline or the domestic violence shelter near you, they will also give you information and resources when you’re ready to leave. You don’t have to go through it alone!  I would definitely recommend trauma therapy and taking time off from relationships in order to heal. They are master manipulator’s and they brainwash us into believing that there’s a chance and that they love us.

From a child who experienced abuse between my parents, I promise even if it’s not in front of the kids they’re still affected- they know and hear so much. My dad is literally soooooo SO nice to every single person except his own family. Any time we tell people stories about him they’re flabbergasted that he would ever act this way and don’t believe us. I have 4 siblings and as we got older the abuse has only gotten worse towards my mom. It’s to the point where 3 of us kids don’t talk to my mom anymore because we “don’t want to” deal with my dad.

Sadly this is a low hope situation! Change is an interesting experience that doesn’t reach most people! I do believe in self awareness and THERAPY LOTS AND LOTS OF IT!!

"They do not change. No matter how many promises are made, more often than not, abusers are sociopaths and the statistics show that unless they are able to admit to wrongdoing (most cannot), and commit themselves to therapy, they’re hard wired to abuse. 
Have you seen the power and control wheel? Or read the book “Why Does He Do That” by Lundy Bancroft? Both are great insights into why people abuse and how they take power and control over their victims. Abuse does not discriminate, and I see that your abuser is female.

Even under the worst circumstances you can start over. It won’t be easy at first but in no time You’re going to be making pictures on your wall crooked on purpose just because you can.

Unfortunately it will not get better. Ever. And it's only going to get worse the longer you stay.  It's the cycle of abuse. First tensions build, then an incident happens, then they apologize and it's calm for a little bit. Then the tensions build again... It will repeat the same way over and over until you leave or they kill you.	EmbarrassedGuilt	reply	na	na	na	0.9994677901268005	weak	strong	no	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.

"I totally understand about the baby. I would definitely recommend taking them up on the offer to get counseling because that will buy you time and  they might be pleasant for a while. Do believe it though, it’s a means to an end. 

I want to tell you that along with being the survivor I am a coach for victims of domestic violence.  There is absolutely no difference in severity based on gender. If this person has made you feel afraid or threatened you that is abuse no matter who is doing it. DV shelters are normally full. They have a quick turnover though. My life was an eminent danger so I called 4 shelters every hour on the hour to ask if they had space until finally one said we have a woman leaving in 15 minutes.

Don’t give up and don’t let gender get in the way. Your abuse is valid. There are people who will listen"	EmbarrassedGuilt	reply	na	na	na	0.9994677901268005	weak	no	no	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.
That makes total sense. Statistically speaking, women are in general not as dangerous - but that is not to dismiss your experience whatsoever. Abusers (regardless of gender) tend to have a “charming” exterior and will only show their true colors to their intimate partners. It sounds like maybe she has you convinced that you are to blame for how she acts, but you are NOT. You are not to blame for triggering her, she is an adult woman who should be able to self regulate her emotions. If she’s unwilling to take accountability for her actions and how she’s making you feel, it may be best to take steps to leave and protect yourself. I am sorry that you’re going through this, but at least know you are far from alone.	EmbarrassedGuilt	reply	na	na	na	0.9994677901268005	weak	no	no	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.

Yeah there aren’t shelters for me. They have a limited amount of funding for “other placements” which they said includes things that might house me but not for right now and nothing that would allow me to take the kids so I wouldn’t go anyway. I also could probably afford a hotel again for a few days, I’ve done that to get a break from it so I could sleep before. I just can’t breastfeed the baby obviously so I have to wait until she weans him. She weaned the older two at about eighteen months so I have 15 months until that’s probably happening. I’m dreading marriage counseling tbh I was mad because she did something to me last night and I told her I was telling the counselor everything and she was displeased. So I’ll just get through the next year and reevaluate when I have a chance of not losing the kids. Still not super hopeful because she’s the primary caregiver but that’s how it is.

I tried to figure out an exit and it’s just gonna have to wait until the kids are much older. I can’t find a way out that doesn’t end up with me losing most of my relationship with my kids. When I tried to leave she told the kids I don’t love them and upset them. They’re already losing connection with me because I have to work so much, I can’t lose my entire relationship with them. I really do feel like I trigger these issues but I also thought that about my abusive parents when I was a kid (and still do if I let myself) so that might just be my perception issue.

Nobody thinks it's going to escalate to murder but it happens all the time. I read in another comment of yours that you have kids. You need to get them out of this situation. I understand how hard it is. I couldn't get into a shelter either because they were all full and I have no support system, but escape is possible. Just be careful.

Hopeless and morbid as my comment sounded.   All you can do is control what you have control over,  that is you and your relationship with your kids.  Get a court involved, be kind and courteous just not a doormat.  But at the end once she buries herself being a huge bitch, and its all over you get to let that negativity wash off your back.  Because fuck her.  Shes crazy, she needs to hurt someone and you were the punching bag.   Once my divorce is over I'll be willing to share just how this worked out.

I’m a man and women don’t murder their partners generally. It happens but it’s rare. I feel dumb posting here in this sub because the women in abusive relationships are in genuine danger and I just don’t like hitting and forced sex and everything, I’m not going to be seriously injured most likely. I don’t know what to do about the kids since the lawyer told me absolutely don’t take them unless I want to lose them all together, she promises we will keep any problems away from them so I guess as long as she stops being violent or running her mouth in front of them I can tolerate. Idk. I don’t really know what else there is to do. Hotline didn’t have much for me. I have no safe family and haven’t been allowed to have friends in years. No shelters for me.

I obviously can’t breastfeed the baby so I’ll lose him. So I came back after she promised it would be okay and things would be better. I just can’t see anyway out of this.

I have kept texts and pictures and stuff but my lawyer was super negative. Apparently family courts don’t care much about domestic violence unless there is violence to the kids.

My financial situation is ridiculous. You think because she’s a SAHM and I’m the income earner it would be easy for me to set aside money but it’s not. She knows how much my paycheck is and if there’s any money she can’t account for it’s a terrible thing. I don’t know how I let myself get in this position. I did divert my paycheck into a separate account and just put the household bills and spending money for her into the joint account and she said I was being financially abusive and made me give her access to the new account. But I asked the hotline and they said no, that she was the one being financially abusive and since I made sure she had access to plenty of money and don’t control her with money I’m not the one in the wrong here. She’s trying to make sure I can never save anything so I can’t leave. She tracks it all. And I did secretly get a credit card but she’s wrecked my credit so it has a very low limit.

"Man that sucks... yeah you're right they don't take it seriously most of the time. Do you have any family or friends who might help? Idk how much you make but you may be able to get help though legal aid- though that doesn't help the housing situation. If you were able to get a temporary protection order I wonder if they might just give you temporary custody of the kids. If there's domestic violence in the home that's a children services issue- I wonder if you calling csd yourself might be a good idea (but would talk to a lawyer first bc I wouldn't want the kids temporarily taken away from you both and I'm honestly not sure what they'd do in the situation). 
I was actually able to get a lot of help from law enforcement and the courts when I was going though it (but I'm a woman so I know they take it a little more seriously).

I’m alone in the world and don’t qualify for aid. It’s sucks because I make decent money and I know it’s sounds pathetic but I literally can’t save anything or hide any money. I’ll also have to pay the bills at her house and whatever place I can find to live according to my lawyer until we get divorce proceedings ongoing. So I’m just putting this all on the back burner and I’ll do my best to fix the relationship or not piss her off until then. But she does abusive things when I don’t even make her mad so idk, I’m triggering this stuff easily especially the sexual coercion stuff. I’m keeping all the documentation until I can either leave or fix the relationship. Idk whatever to do but it helps to talk about it.

"I’ve posted on here before about my situation. (I tried to put the link above if that works^) 
Now it’s happened again Friday, where I kept telling him (my now ex boyfriend M 24) I didn’t want to have sex and he forced me again. I decided to go to the police and file a rape charge and took a rape kit. (No charges have been pressed at this moment) 
I have so much guilt because he is somebody I love so dearly. I don’t want to ruin is life. 
I made a mistake by telling him I filed charges on him, and he pretty much threatened that he would win the case, sue me for defamation and take every bit of money I have left. He called me on No caller ID at least 20x, called off different phones, and sent me that text through google voice. 
I told him what he did to me was coercive rape, and I repeatedly said no but he continued and I went along with it. He keeps saying it was consensual, and that I’m trying to ruin his life because I found out he was cheating on me, but even before i’m my previous post - I didn’t even know he was cheating and it still felt wrong that we had sex. 
I don’t know if coercive rape is illegal and what case I would have against him, I feel confused because we were in a relationship, but I know that “no means no” , but would this be a “he said she said type of ordeal? It’s the weekend and I haven’t been able to get ahold of my detective. 
I feel so anxious and my heart races thinking about this. Deep down, I know everything he did to me was wrong- but I feel horrible if I continue to press charges and ruin his life. He also knows A LOt about the law as he wanted to be a police at one point…. I’m confused and I’m lost on every legal aspect of this.

"I am in a same sex relationship. Male and male. I am larger and muscular. He was shorter but athletic and what I would describe as very scrappy.

The first time this happened he stole a set of my keys and entered my apartment. He tried to leave with my keys, wallet, and phone (for control) and we ended up fighting over them. Still the fight escalated far beyond what it should have because he kept trying to do things like rip a hole in my testicles. I didn't talk to the cops because he had made it very clear we  wouldn't do that to eachother. 

This time all I tried to do was leave. We were in a hotel and I was on my way up north for a camping trip so I had bought a personal safe. I had the foresight to lock my stuff in the safe so and when I tried to leave he did everything physically possible to rip the safe from me, the key away, and slam any phone I could reach. This spilled out into the hallway and be seen by cameras twice. The officers just didn't feel like watching it.

So I spent 5 in days in jail when my actual abuser is on the loose. This was all because he owed me several thousand dollars and he refused to pay it back to me so I told him we could meditate or I'd take it up suth civil court and for the police to handle when trading property.

"7 months ago, I decided to live as digital nomad. I sold all of my belongings, ended my apartment lease and I travelled the country, working remotely. It was fun and I saw places that I’ve never seen before. Though, it definitely had more than a few sucky moments

I made it to PHX, AZ. While I was there, I got into a pretty bad car accident. My car flipped and was totaled. Thankfully I didn’t get hurt. However, I lost my only mode of transportation so my nomad journey was over. 

A guy I’ve been talking to knew of my situation and said I could stay with him until I can get on my feet, to which I was grateful. We entertained the idea of an relationship but I wasn’t certain if that’s truly what I wanted. I’ve been single since 2017 due to the fact that relationships drain me emotionally and mentally. I’m happier single. However, this guy came off VERY sweet and generous. He is a captain at Fire-station  and makes pretty good money. Lives in a beautiful home by himself. He even mentioned me not having to work and just going back to school (which I declined).

I caught a flight from AZ to his home state and moved in with him the next day. Since then, it’s been hell! He has sexual compulsive issues. He constantly jerking off. I’ll wake up in the middle of the night and he is jerking off right next me. When I asked him about it, he brushed it off, saying; “You’re a beautiful woman, I can’t help it” He says he has depression and anxiety…but I believe he has a lot more going on. Like, maybe some sort of personality disorder. 

He’ll get super drunk and when I don’t want to have sex (which is most of the time, his behavior is a turn off) he’ll throw a hissy fit and threaten to kick me out. He also has emotional irregularity issues. I’m in the process of enlisting into the Navy and every time I talk to my recruiter (who is a male) he’ll become extremely insecure and threaten to kick me out again. One night was especially awful. He drank too much again (a entire bottle of Whiskey) and kept giving me a hard time about texting my recruiter. He told me to pack all of my shit, which I did. He carried my bags out to the end of the driveway (it was raining) and he walked back into his house and locked me out. As I was calling for a lyft ride(I’m super broke so I don’t know where i would have went) he came back outside, grabbed my stuff and told me to come back inside. I wanted my shit back but also didn’t want to argue because I was tired and scared, so I came back in the house. He wanted to argue some more, and kept trying to kiss me but I didn’t say anything and I didn’t want him to touch me. which angered him more so he did the same thing, kicked me out and sat my things back on the curb. Rinse repeat. 

The next day, he pretended like nothing happened…no apology, nothing. He was just horny and wanted to have sex. I snapped and yelled at him…then guess what? He threatened to kick me out…again. 

I have no money, no family that can help. I’m waiting to finish processing into the Navy but it’s taking awhile due to me needing a waiver (I’m prior service) I have $100 to my name and no where to go. This man has wayy too much power over me. I’ve contacted DV shelters and other shelters in the area, but they’re all full. I’m scared and exhausted. I realize that my actions led me to being in this situation but I honestly don’t have a solution for this. I don’t think I can stay here any longer. He’s literally torturing me, mentally."

"My abuser and I work in the same industry- we are both in a union that dispatches us, and also freelance. We both tend to frequent the locations for work. In the Union we bid on jobs and then are dispatched based on seniority. He’s been doing this a month longer than me so he’s above me. I have a DVPO against him. 
The way the union’s handling this is by not putting us on the same calls, which he will always get over me. He sounds like even if I get the call first, I will be taken off. I had a job for today booked weeks ago and received news last night I was taken off bc of my protection order bc he has higher seniority, even though we were working different positions and they still need people- it sounds like he was added last minute. 
My understanding is that I’m not prohibited from going anywhere, so I should be getting preference getting calls.  The order also prohibits him from being within 1000 feet of my workplace, not just me, so I feel like he shouldn’t be allowed at venues I frequent at at all? 
I’ve talked to them about it but they say they have an obligation to protect both of our employment, even though I don’t feel protected. 
It took so much for me to come forward at all, in part bc he said he would destroy my career if I told anyone about the abuse.

"First of all, you will need to talk to a trusted union rep. You may have grounds for a grievance, but will need to know what the contract states in terms of how jobs are awarded. A domestic violence shelter has legal aid which can help you to understand the terms of the protected order in your state and how it would be applied in your case. Don't be surprised if you may have to educate the local officers on the order since they may not understand how it should work. They should want to consult with their own legal counsel if they are prudent. DOCUMENT DOCUMENT DOCUMENT all these efforts because finally if after all of this you feel like your union is being arbitrary, showing favoritism, or not taking measures to offer you workplace protections while keeping you as close to financially whole as possible (which can be seen as retaliatory), this should be reported as neglect to Duty of Fair Representation to the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB). You should also be prepared to let the court know any attempt on his part to retaliate by trying to outbid you for jobs, but you will need some proof he didn't do that before the protective order. The judge will probably allow that he has the right to earn a living, but if he is convicted then of course, the union will again have to enforce their harassment procedures including and ""zero tolerance"" policies they may have."	climber619	reply	na	na	na	0.9980892539024353	no	no	no	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.
From a personal standpoint I definitely think that you should be given priority in the situation and he shouldn’t be allowed to boot you off of the project. Who’s to say he’s not purposely joining the project to get you removed and control your work environment that way. Unfortunately your work may not care to change what they’re doing now unless there’s threat of legal action or something similar. Try seeing if there’s some sort of legal thing they’re breaking by favoring his work over yours or even forcing the short end of the stick on you rather than him.

"To clarify, I’m pretty aware already of how jobs are rewarded. It’s a number based system, im aware of his seniority number and also mine which dictates the order they add people to calls. We arent necessarily competing for the same position either, it’s a matter of us being on the same call at all. I can be put on a call weeks before, but if he’s added to the show later I will still be removed because it’s by seniority, which means I will literally always be taken off calls or not get on them if he gets a role in any capacity. Same goes for different calls entirely if they are at the same venue at the same time.  So I will always be at a disadvantage no matter what. 

I’ve spoken with the president, secretary, and dispatch but trying to get in contact w the union’s lawyer may be a good idea. They said they’ve dealt w this before and this is how they’ve always done it. My attorney said it doesn’t sound correct and I shouldn’t be prohibited from going anywhere, and shouldn’t have even told my employers because if we just showed up to a job together he would have to leave, but I don’t have the money to get a formal statement from her and she’s not an employment lawyer.

I don’t think outbidding me on jobs is relevant, all bidding means is he clicks a button saying he wants a position and we may or may not get it, he wouldn’t know I’m bidding on a job unless someone told him. We could both get the position, it’s rarely just one person for a position or we could both get different positions on the same call."	climber619	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9980892539024353	no	no	no	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.
If you choose to pursue this further, it's a start to say you've spoken to them, but you should go back and email them again to establish a written document that you present later to the NLRB. Each union has different procedures for how to file internal grievances so go through and follow the steps. Again consider having a steward/rep to help you. Seek out your workplace violence rep/committee chair if there is one. Even if you are a steward/rep when you go to any in person meetings regarding this matter have someone there to help you take notes of what is said will put you on level playing field. A DFR investigation is no light matter. The union should be putting their efforts to represent both of you and try to find a solution where you both have jobs and are getting fair and equitable treatment, again until there's a conviction in which case they should stand behind a workplace safety policy on violence. If not you can go the NLRB. You are not alone, there are people who can help you if you reach out.	climber619	reply	na	na	na	0.9980892539024353	no	no	no	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.

"She wanted me to write a letter saying I would like not to press charges.

Those are private. Then no letter. She finally kind of opened the chat and barely scrolled up. I scrolled up to last nights text which started bad and the phone was quickly turned off. 
You see she tells me one thing and her daughter another.

That voice in your head is his conditioning. It's not true. It's not your fault. You don't deserve to be abused. No one does. 

Reporting the abuse is only worthwhile if you have sufficient evidence. If you don't, then having your case thrown out of court and having to read his lies can be very, very damaging to your mental health. Having a therapist or counsellor to discuss options re. reporting it is a good place to start from though I understand it can be unaffordable in some places. There are charities that can help in some places. Calling the national domestic violence hotline for the country you live in could help.

I have watched a lot of Netflix, and done my best to build a new social group from nothing, but the days are really starting to drag on. I'm a tough chick, but this is so much. I need to come up with more ideas to stay afloat while this continues.

"I'm floating around myself right now... staying away from home a little for security's sake after I testified at my abuser's trial.

It is very hard to have the home I was locked away in ripped away, even if it was never a home after all, and even if I ripped myself away. Rebuilding is such a long process, or at least has been for me. I understand you are extremely limited right now, being mid-flight, so it's not really feasible for you to take up knitting or some other hobby while you're couch-surfing. Here are my random suggestions (trying to put myself in your shoes):

• **Help others online!** Honestly, commenting on posts in these subreddits has been immensely helpful for me. I may not have good advice or information for every situation and every victim, but usually, there is at least a couple posts I relate to enough to offer some kind of insight, validation, support, ideas, etc. (like I'm doing with you here! Now! This helps me as much as it might help you!) I have found chiming in on other posts here to be a better form of group therapy than the in-person support groups I've been to thus far. I'm sure you have perspective to offer someone who is deep in the Fog right now, like you once were.

• **Dream!** You are still on the road to freedom right now, and it is especially hard when you are living on other people's charity and have no space or little privacy during transition. That doesn't mean you can't imagine the life you are going to build! Start a Pinterest board or a journal or start collecting ideas about how you will decorate your new bedroom, what you want your new life to be like, etc. The more you spend time thinking about yourself, your needs and preferences, the more you will feel like a whole person again and see there is a future for you past all this mess.

• **Move your body!** This advice is purely hypocritical because I'm still struggling a bit depression, but physical activity is so beneficial for trauma recovery. Yoga? Tai chi? Isometric? Have any space you can use to learn some new moves?

• **Practice meditating!!** I know. I hated it when I first started, but nothing has made a bigger difference in my life than daily meditation practice. Only 10 minutes per day is all you need to do for it to make a difference in your brain over time. It will help with the anxiety. It will help with your reactivity. It helps. There are 10,000 YouTube videos to teach you how to ""do"" it.

Those are my ideas. I'm just thinking of things you can do in a small space, so you aren't bothering your hosts and require very little or no money. Hope this helps! <3"	DirtyLittlePuppet	reply	na	na	na	0.005110986065119505	no	strong	no	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.
I wish I had written a journal when I was in a similar situation, so I could look back accurately at how far I'd come. Days merged into weeks and months and time became strange.

I'm in kind of a similar situation. I recently had to quit a job where my employer was severely emotionally and verbally abusive. Though I loved my job (editing) I found that for the first two years, I couldn't go near even my own writing without upsetting myself and feeling pangs of shame. It made me so angry that someone would have that kind of power over me, the power to take away the joy of the thing I loved the most. Long story short, my therapist just told me not to force myself to go back to it. What you might need to do right now is just to sit with your feelings and not blame yourself for feeling the way you do. Grieving is a process that can take years. Probably meditation might be the best choice if you're in a particularly emotionally fragile state (I was and still am). Just sit with your thoughts and feelings. Surprisingly, that can actually help give you the emotional space to heal. Hope this helps. ❤	DirtyLittlePuppet	reply	na	na	na	0.005110986065119505	no	strong	no	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.
"I’m going to offer a gentle suggestion that homogenizing the pain of fleeing for one’s life vs. a verbally/emotionally abusive employer doesn’t feel great. I’m happy you have a therapist, I’m happy your doing well, but these are apples and oranges.

It’s not that one is greater or less than to the other, but the advise rings hollow because of that.

One of the challenges of running for your life, as I am right now, is that things like a therapist isn’t accessible.

I think we're misunderstanding each other. I wasn't saying that my situation compares to the scale of what you're going through at all. I certainly consider fleeing for fear of losing your continued existence to be a far greater threat than losing a job might have been, to be absolutely clear. I wasn't even suggesting you should do anything more than try to hold body and soul together as best you can. I was simply trying to offer a modicum of perspective as per losing your love of things from the past. Of course, your life is yours to live and only you know best how to do that.

"The DA did not have enough evidence so they dropped some charges and he was arrested for domestic violence and harassment.  I now have a criminal protection order. 

I didn’t ask for charges but they did it anyway, police did not give me a choice. 

Feeling all the things. The cop was nice enough he said this could be the step he needs to get the help he needs and told me all about how I’m a victim of domestic violence.  

My partner is not the textbook narcissist or abuser though so it’s confusing to me. I have read all of the stories on the website, I read the book ‘why does he do that’ and he’s not like all of those classic abuser profiles.  The one red flag is sometimes jealousy but none of this happens when he is sober. 

He could and would apologize for anything.  He could talk and have a healthy two way conversation.  He listened to my wants and needs.  He made me cute lunches and snacks with notes. He took great care of my doggy and went trail running together. He would pick me up if the roads were too snowy.  He always picked up my favorite little things and paid attention to things I didn’t like. He is well loved by the community and often works with seniors and children as a coach or volunteer in his free time. His relationship with family is good including mother and sister very loving and talking almost daily and visiting every month and planning trips to stay connected. If there was something I mentioned, he would try to make it happen. He would always try to meet me before work to go for a walk or bring me a breakfast. He knew how I liked my coffee and almost always
Made me one in bed if I stayed over. 

When we argued, it wasn’t like yelling or throwing things or threats. We would normally take space at my request and make up later. (I tend to need space or outdoor walk to clear my mind).  

But when he drank heavily, he would hide it. And that’s where there became a problem.  But only sometimes. Usually we could drink together and it was fine and fun.  One time he changed his behavior and threw a plate of food and it broke. But then he apologized and cleaned it up right away. That was the first time he admitted to having a problem with alcohol and how much he hid the drinking. So then I was alarmed (first time) and wanted to leave but he didn’t want me to so he pushed me down into a chair and threw my shoes.  He had drank an entire bottle of liquor and doesn’t even remember doing it. 

He blacks out when he drinks and last time he texted lots of horrible things like ‘ I’m a whore’ ‘you never loved me’ etc and also didn’t remember until I told him to read his texts for last 48 hours.  He said he is horrified as what he wrote and that’s not how he feels at all.  

Is this a problem of abuse or a problem of alcohol or both?  

99% of the time it is actually really good and perfect. That’s why it’s hard to throw it away and give up. If he was an asshole the rest of the days it would be a no brainer. There’s a lot of love between us, we laugh so much every day. And he’s my favorite person to do things with.  We just have an easy chemistry in all areas. 
I think he struggles with depression after a kid died he was close with and a past girlfriend that was murdered. And obviously drinking. But he has gotten into AA on his own, anger management classes and abuse classes and told me he would never hurt me intentionally, he scares himself and is so broken he thought of killing himself when he saw how much he hurt me with his words and actions those two occasions.  He also got a counselor and psychiatrist and they prescribed him meds for depression and anxiety and he was going to aa meeting every day.  This was before the legal stuff happened. 

Anyway now due to an incident with my vehicle - he was arrested for harassment when I told
Police he damaged car (I was not here but he said he was drunk and hit it by accident while playing sports outside).  My insurance said they needed a police report so I called but then the officer said he will have a warrant for arrest and I don’t have a choice. 

He’s never been arrested before he’s never even had a speeding ticket.  I paid to do a full background check to be sure he didn’t lie about that.  

Apparently we 
Cannot speak to each other for a year so
Not sure how that goes but it seems we have no choice. 

Has anyone here gotten around the protection order Atleast for some communication even if by phone.  

The consequences are severe to breach it but is there a legal way to speak. I haven’t reached out and won’t put that risk on him. 

I do have some of his belongings and him some of mine.  

I was asked by da if I find him dangerous or fear for my safety and I said no, but I fear for his own safety due to suicide risk and clinical depression (He’s mentioned it 4 times in the past year)"	TrainingSubstantial	post	31.599363751495773	female	White	0.001441059517674148	na	na	na	10	domesticviolence	no prediction.
"This is the “sensitive guy” type; you are in abject denial. You don’t think other people’s abusers haven’t done nice, thoughtful things for them too? Love bombing is universal or abusers wouldn’t have relationships. 

Apologies without permanent changes in behavior are manipulation whether they act super sorry all the time or not. Alcohol is not why he pushed you and threatens suicide. 

Do not circumvent the protective order. You need the space to get over him and let him be someone else’s problem. It will also help with getting legal intervention when he continues to down spiral. 

Otherwise what will happen is you’ll continue to think you’re not like the other DV relationships. He’ll continue to abuse you worse and worse until you finally think police/court intervention is a good idea. When you go back they’ll ask if things were so bad why did you get back with him. You will feel stupid and shameful for protecting him. 

Him threatening suicide and the both of you thinking you have an otherworldly romance means you’re at risk of him killing you and killing himself. I know of a homicide where the guy was a “””sensitive””” tortured soul that allegedly never argued with his girlfriend ever. One day on vacation he woke up from a nap and strangled his girlfriend to death while she was still asleep. Tried to slash his neck with a knife but survived. 

You can have easy chemistry with someone else that doesn’t need court cases and unsuccessful psychiatric intervention."	TrainingSubstantial	reply	na	na	na	0.001441059517674148	weak	no	no	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.
"Please count the protection order as a lucky escape. It sounds to me like you are at the beginning stages of what will, inevitably, end up very similar to many other stories of DV, if you don't go zero contact with this guy. 

I used to make up so many excuses for my violent ex. ""He had mental health problems; he had childhood trauma. He had problems with alcohol. He lost control!"" Until I'd wished I'd never met him and I was trapped in a living nightmare.

My social worker explained to me that alcohol might make his behaviour worse, but that it wasn't the reason, or the excuse for his violence, that those traits were already under the surface. Do you get violent and abusive when drunk? I don't! My ex ended up beating me whether or not he was drunk. Stopping drinking did NOT end the violence, or the manipulation, or the control, etc.

You are a victim of DV. You have the chance to be a survivor now. Take it. Going back to this guy is sending him the message that you are fine with the abuse. It can only get worse from here. 

Sure, you still care about him, but what about you? Put yourself first. Being empathetic towards our abusers is exactly what hooks us in in the first place. They use our empathy to destroy us.

But if you want to think of it in terms of what's best for him, then having zero contact with you, the person he violently and emotionally abused, is the only way he's going to learn that his bullshit is not acceptable. Look up Dr Ramani's videos too. I bet he has plenty of narcissistic traits. Not all narcissists are grandiose.

I'm so sorry you are going through this. I remember feeling exactly the same after the first time my ex was violent towards me. Unfortunately, at the time, there were no laws to allow the police to act independently of the victim. I think the fact they slapped a restraining order on your ex is amazing. Read ""My Name is Sky"" which someone posted the other day. She lost her life because the police in Canada don't have the powers to do what they did for you. I advise getting some therapy from someone who specialises in DV. Talking it through will help you figure things out. You must be feeling so torn. But all abusers are that caring, amazing person for a while. Otherwise we wouldn't stay long enough for it to get really scary.

Wishing you the best of luck."	TrainingSubstantial	reply	na	na	na	0.001441059517674148	weak	strong	no	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.

"The perfect boyfriend, close with his mum and female relatives, doting… that is the honeymoon stage. It’s just a mask and can stay on for years. But it’s not who he is. The plate, the name calling, etc while drinking is the escalation to him showing his true self. Sounds like he love bombs afterwards to reel you back in. 

My ex was the same as you describe, lovely when sober and alcohol was the fuel, only occasional outbursts, until one day I realised he was like that all the time and drinking just made it harder to hide, over time the outbursts were more often/worse and less tied to alcohol. One day he became physical and I spoke to police, who urged me to leave, but privacy laws prevented them from sharing that he has had multiple prior victims known to them and what I had seen was just the precipice of what had been reported before. They told me they had more information about the situation than I did and my life was at risk, but I didn’t believe them because it didn’t match my experience of him. Until he got worse and I spoke to a DV advocate who educated me with some hard truth about the lies I was telling myself. 

I’m sorry but what you are describing does sound like textbook abuse to me. Sounds like you are in denial. Most of us are at first, that’s how the brain reacts to make sense of what is happening. It is hard to see the situation for what it is while you’re in the middle of it. The lovely mask is not who he really is. Throwing objects is physical abuse. Next time it might be your face. If police are intervening without your consent, perhaps there is something you’re not seeing that they are, like something in his criminal record, that indicates the risk is higher than you realise. 

Besides, even if you don’t want to put the label DV on it, his behaviour is not respectful and you deserve more out of life than someone who treats you that way. There is way better out there. ❤️"	TrainingSubstantial	reply	na	na	na	0.001441059517674148	no	strong	no	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.
Every previous person who has replied has done so with so much honesty and eloquence, and so much raw experience, OP, that all I want to do is add my voice to theirs and say “RUN!” Abuse isnt a ‘one size fits all’ situation, every abusive relationship will look slightly different from the inside. Thats because the abuser is making sure that they are doing enough things ‘right’ so that you dont leave. And the abuse NEVER starts out in the beginning of the relationship! Heaven Forfend! There are few people willing to enter into a romantic situation after being called a ‘fucking whore’, or having a plate of food thrown into their face, or being smacked around for an hour or two! Nope, its more subtle, like constantly having your limits tested at first. They want to see how much you can take, and then when things go too far there is always going to be an excuse ready to trot out, and an abject apology. With flowers, and even jewelry if anything got really out of hand. Thats because its extremely important that you, the victim, dont leave. You see, your abuser NEEDS you! They have put so much time and energy into getting you to the point where you are appropriately gaslighted, and dependent, and actually believe a goodly amount of the lies and deceit and excuses they have worked damn hard on! And the longer you stay in this tangled web, the more impossible it seems to get away. Thats why most of us call it an escape. Thank your lucky stars that you are getting this help now, OP.

"You're both going to need a year anyways. His alcohol problems aren't going to get better by being with you, and I know that hurts to hear but it's the truth. He needs a year or two to get sober and work on himself before he even thinks about dating again because any slight issue that might arise in a relationship could topple him off the wagon again and cause him to fall back into old ways.

He may not be a monster when he's sober but those texts he sends are very telling. Drunk words are sober thoughts and all that. You deserve someone who's amazing 100% of the time, not just the generous 99% you're claiming. You need better, you deserve better, and if you want to wait for him do, but make sure he's at least 2 years sober and regularly going to counselling.

"It's over. Let him go. You can't immediately stop loving him, but you can get over him.

When you stub your toe you can cope with the pain because you know it's only temporary pain. You might swear and sit down, taking time to recover while you get over it, but you know it will pass. 

The pain from the trauma you're going through is scarcely comparable to that of a stubbed toe, but the principle is the same. Vent your feelings and take time to care for yourself, and keep reassuring yourself you will get over it. Life will get better and you will see that relationship more clearly in hindsight.

She’s SA’d me multiple times. The second to last time, I went and had an SA kit done afterwards.

I know she doesn’t love or value me.

I know she will not be gentle, even going so far as to make me bleed and disregard my “no”.

I know whatever physical pleasure I might get from it is temporary and not worth the pain.

I know that she thinks I am disgusting, that she is a selfish lover, and that my body is nothing more than an object for her to use.

I know that the intimacy I dream of—tender, slow, and loving—doesn’t happen with her anymore.

I know that I will cry inside during, and outside afterwards.

Yet I can’t stop throwing myself at her and begging for sex. I feel awful about it. I don’t want to crave sex with her. She scares me and makes me feel like nothing.

What’s wrong with me that I can’t stop harming myself and putting myself in danger?"	jaymek8015	post	19.39115781539878	male	White	0.998013973236084	na	na	na	1	domesticviolence	failed
"there is nothing wrong with you. you're in pain. your wife is somebody you got to know, who you fell in love with. it shouldn't be a bad thing to want validation, affection, comfort, softness, from a loved one. you're craving it badly because you are desperate to be seen by her, to be understood by her - you want to not be scared of her and you want her to make you feel something, and like a person. 

abusers often use sex to intensify trauma bonds. it isn't going to get better which you know, it got worse over time - she knows what she is doing to you, and she thinks that you won't leave her because you stay. is there any way that you can leave the marriage? or live with other people to stay away from her where she won't be able to get to you or know where you are? 

i'd suggest seeking outside intervention and community, like family or friends and therapy. considering you have evidence of having used an SA test, you could get the police involved also, but i can understand why you would not want to."	jaymek8015	reply	na	na	na	0.998013973236084	weak	no	no	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.

It's been a week since it happened and since then it's been a weird transition period where we are still contacting each other and it's been weird. Although I know logically I can not be with someone who puts their hands on me. That emotional aspect of me I feel hasn't quite let go. I've been in a really weird state of mind regarding this.

"TW: Domestic Abuse, Animal Abuse, Suicidal Ideation.

My mother (S) is currently in an abusive relationship with her husband (B) of 25 years.

When they had their first child, he attempted to divorce her. He didn't have the money to live on his own, so he stayed. When I was born, he threatened to leave again. He would constantly berate her for one thing or another, but in her mind as long her kids are okay, she's okay.

2-3 years after I was born, he revealed he was having an affair with a co-worker. Soon after, he integrated the woman (A) into the family. They were physically and emotionally abusive to each other, and would break up constantly. B and A had a child, and they then broke up for a year. During this, their child was the subject of a custody battle. 5 years after that, they had another child. Soon after that, B pulled out a gun and fired during an argument with A.

At that point, I contacted social services and had myself placed in custody of my grandmother. My mother followed. For the time we've been away, S has been away during the day helping B, as she feels she's abandoned her other son. She acknowledges that she would not be happy moving back, as it is a toxic relationship in which she cares for 4 children while B and A book expensive trips while she sleeps alone in a laundry room.

I do not know how to make her feel better, as she is stuck in a terrible situation and feels it is all her fault. I would say the blame falls to the father, as he has been physically, verbally, and emotionally abusive to the people around him, and his pets.

I also do not want to move back, as he is controlling and violent. During their worse times, the only reason I did not commit suicide is that the guns I had access to were not of a high enough caliber that I would be confident it would kill me."

So, is this father person still with A? And is your mother living with your grandmother, or is she in the same home as these two people acting as the nanny to 4 children, one of which is her son? Im sorry, OP, however this is a bit confusing. However as to how do you help your mother? Unfortunately, the sad truth is there is very little you can do other than be supportive, let her know that she is loved and that you will always be there for her when she needs you. She must feel the desire to leave this clearly toxic and abusive situation in order for any change to come about. From what you have said it would seem that she has more than enough grounds to obtain full custody of your brother, and to kick both him and A out of the house, since he was supposed to leave decades ago, but didnt. And he discharged a firearm at a person during an argument?!? He is clearly unstable. That your mother has decided that allowing your brother to live in a dangerous and abusive household is preferable to living separate from this man is confusing, however no doubt there is more to her side of the story than you may be aware. What is clear is that you need to do what is best for you, and maintain a safe living distance from this volatile situation. I hope that your brother is well, as are your mother and the other children. If you feel that there is continued danger for the children n the home, it might be time to call CPS on their behalf. Take good care, OP.	Emotional_Cookie5335	reply	na	na	na	0.9975811243057251	weak	no	strong	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.
"hey, OP. I have been thinking about you and the impossibly hard situation your mom is faced with…and I apologize for not getting back sooner. I want to give you a bit of my background, so you know that I have a little bit of understanding of your moms situation, ok? 

So, my background is that I was married, and in an abusive relationship for 19 years. We had one child, and once I realized how bad things actually were it took many years before I was able to leave. Abusive relationships can be confusing, because they aren’t bad 100% of the time, and once they DO get to that point there has been so much emotional and financial abuse that the victim doesn’t feel that they have any self worth or ability to do anything that could help them get a job. Any money they may have had is gone, and the abuser is now manipulating every penny that comes into the home, so the idea of leaving, especially with children seems impossible. That’s how it was for me, and maybe how things are for your mom? I mean, after being told negative things about yourself for years and years, it’s difficult to not believe them. Does this make sense? Please feel free to ask me questions about anything I write, ok? 

So the kind of messages most victims of domestic abuse sound like this: “I don’t know why I put up with you. Nobody else will ever love you! You are lucky to have me, because no one else would put up with your ( insert complaint here- stupidity, cooking, being overweight, blah blah blah). You couldn’t get a job! You can’t even clean a house right!! “.  In essence what is happening is the victim feels like they are being eroded. All of their strengths and goodness are just being sanded away by words. They will try to be ‘better’, but that is impossible, because there isn’t anything wrong to begin with. The abusive person simply needs to tear someone down. 

When there are children, all that nurturing parent, like your mom and me, can think about is how do I shield these children from being attacked? How can I stop him from destroying their souls? Because we KNOW, as adults, that this abuser is a pure and out monster. He is wrong. Wrong to say these things, to treat us this way, to be the flaming arsehole that he is. We KNOW that, while we are scared and weak now, at one time we were strong and smart and capable and were able to do things that were cool af. But abuse within a relationship is sneaky and insidious, like a serpent that crawls into your boot at night and silently coils within, deadly and invisible, ready to strike the unwary. 

The other thing that we KNOW, completely and inside our bones, is that if this abuser begins to target our children, they will be destroyed. That bastard will crush everything within them that gives them joy, makes them excited about life and learning, brings a spark to their eye and a bounce to their step! So we, as nurturing parents, make sure that we stand as a wall, deflecting as much as we can. We can’t take the children and leave, we don’t believe we have the skill set needed to get a job that pays enough to support a family. So we do what we feel we have to do, because children cannot protect themselves. OP, does any of this resonate with you?

You made the choice to escape, and live with your grandparents. That was the best choice possible, and I have a feeling that when you did your mom was relieved. Not because you weren’t with her, but because you were safe! That is all I have ever wanted, is for my child to be safe. I gave up everything my ex husband  and I had worked for together in the divorce , house, savings, retirement, literally every single thing, just so I could take my son and move to another state before his dad destroyed him. It didn’t matter that I had nothing of monetary value. I had our son, and that was everything that had meaning. So with you safe, your mom still has your brother to be concerned for, and other unprotected children. Your mom sounds like an incredibly loving, caring and empathetic woman with an enormous heart. She can see beyond the parents, and only looks at the fact that there are children who are terribly neglected, at risk and are unloved by the people who created them. Not all women are created with boundless compassion and empathy. She is really admirable! 

As to how you can help her? I know that my son had a hard time with seeing how his dad treated me. I tried very hard to keep his awareness of the abuse as little as possible, as I felt it would be traumatizing. What helped me the most was knowing that he loved me, and that he wasn’t judging me like his dad, or reflecting any of the negative beliefs held by others about me and my choices. My family really criticized me for, well just about everything. That made my life much harder. It would have been helpful if they would have just LISTENED to me, and why I made this choice, or that choice before they passed judgement, you know? My son didn’t always understand, but he always let me know he had my back! As he got older we were able to talk about things, and he understands my choices. I don’t know that I always made the best decisions, OP. I can say that I really tried to do the best I could. 

I was wrong to ask the questions about your Mom, and all of the circumstances surrounding the situation, because bottom line? None of that means a darn thing. Abusive relationships are complicated af, and irregardless of how they are constructed, it is NEVER a simple thing to leave just because you want to, or even if you could. They are Byzantine and terrifying and hard as hell to navigate. My apologies for making it seem anything less. I hope that this has given you some insight or answers. Feel free to contact me and ask any questions you need. You’re mom would be so incredibly proud if she knew how concerned you were, and I’m really proud of you also ! Not too many fam members reach out asking how to help a parent. Be well. ❤️"	Emotional_Cookie5335	reply	na	na	na	0.9975811243057251	strong	no	no	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.
OP, you both have such warm and loving hearts for each other, and there seems to be a real honesty between you. Tell your mom you love her, because that can never be said enough! Tell her your truth, that you worry about her, because you know that this situation is very hard. That you are concerned for her safety, because of his capacity for violence. Your mom has most definitely thought about these things, and will be able to ease you mind with whatever precautions she has in place. As long as you are able to communicate your care and your love, your mom will know that she has the support she needs to be strong enough to do whatever she needs. Honestly, I believe this is true for everyone, no matter what endeavor we face! There comes a time in all of our lives where we will have to face our fears, or push ourselves beyond our endurance. Knowing that we have the absolute support and unconditional love of someone seems to give us the strength and courage necessary to finish our goals. Sending love.

What do you do when you're made to believe they need help because their husband beats them, but then they back peddle and call themselves crazy, and that they're doing it for their child?
Are you just supposed to let it happen because you can't force them to do anything and they have to want to help themselves?
How do you break the silence when they don't want to break their silence themselves? Then they turn on you, change their story, gas light you and treat you like a stalker for trying to help them and breaking the silence for them?

"I don't know where to put this but I need to vent it somewhere.

I sang soprano, and I was *good.* I had a couple years of classical training, near perfect pitch, and a lifelong interest in vocal art.

I was also an idiot in my early life and took up smoking. I lost my top octave to stupid cigarettes for a good while, just kicking myself the whole time. Then I *quit* smoking and started to practice singing again for real. 

Without the irritation of cigarettes my entire top octave came right on back with the kind of flutelike purity I hadn't heard myself create since my adolescence.

*I took such joy in it.* I sang like an angel for awhile. My favorite vocalist to sing along to was Aurora.

And now you probably suspect what I'm going to say.

Due some unfortunate injuries, I can't sing like that anymore. I don't know if I ever will again.

My heart hurts.

"Thank you so much for this hopeful reply!

Things are improving. This injury affected even my speaking voice for a short while. After a week or two, my neck did some interesting pop/crackle shit and the crack in my speaking voice disappeared. Singing is fatiguing, and I had to have a couple teeth out too, so my face is sore, but I practice gently often. Every practice session, I feel I get a little back :)

What kills me is the person who did this is a very talented singer themselves who sustained a serious neck/throat injury years back in a street fight (they got jumped--we were not yet dating then and this incident is entirely unrelated to their issues with me). It took them more than a year for a full recovery, so they KNOW this heartbreak--and they damn well did the same to me, plus bashed in my forehead sinuses for good measure.

"Tl, dr: a message long as a fraight train.

I red your original message, your answer to mine and wandered around your profile for a moment.

Music and domestic violence...

I don't sing or play if I am feeling strong feelings. I just cannot. And my instruments are high end or custom made, so, I do not touch them during meltdowns.

But... butbutbut.

What's left of the wounds caused by domestic violence after years is maybe some scars and sadness, guilt and anger. We carry them for the rest of our lives, though our pain can get relieved. But memories remain.

Music, and especially singing, has a direct connection with our feelings. Even as a musicologist, I don't know how it works, but it clearly is there. That's why we sing to babies. That's why soldiers sing. That's why religious and political movements sing their songs. A good song is far more effective, and affective, than the wisest speech or sermon.

Destroying one's ability to sing is as bad as stealing her/his native language. So, even a lesser damage to singing ability is nothing but terror.

I really don't know what to think about my mother. I think she tried her best when I was a kid and a teenager. That best, however, included her beating me, not only during her meltdowns, but deliberately, too. And she let others beat me while she was just calmly watching. Or she said, like, don't make that kid scream again, I am too tired to hear it. Just... English language does not have swear words rough enough to describe my feelings even now, decades later.

I was ordered not to sing, because I cannot. Well, yeah, I am not exceptionally gifted. Usually singing well requires training. I was never let to have any instrument of my own, let alone learn to play anything. My mother just told me that I am not musical. For some reason I developed a musical taste of my own at around 11 or 12, while the other kids listened to what was fashionable. If I in some rare occassions got an instrument in my hands, I was like charmed. I could lose my sense of time and environment. But, according to her, I was not musical because I could not play any compositions right away. I guess she is herself such a perfectionist that she cannot accept learning, experimenting and definitely not making mistakes, like playing wrong notes.

When I moved out at 18, I bought a cheap electric guitar and a lousy amp. During the following years, I got some 10 or 15 lessons. Five (!) years later I applied for study musicology at a university and was accepted. When I told my mother about getting accepted, she did not say a single word. She was just quiet, until she began to speak about something else. Why? I don't know, but my interpretations are that because she cannot accept me being musical or because she expected me to become an engineer or a military officer, or something that suits her perfectionism. I guess, becoming the president would just barely satisfy her. Thank God, I am over fifty and finally aware of some consequences of the atmosphere of my childhood home.

The atmosphere... The fear triggered by some minor things, like a nervous sigh or banging tableware while working in the kitchen. The fear caused by distant memories connected to minimal stimuli. The intuition of inevitably oncoming rage and violence. If not now, surely today or tomorrow. Don't say anything. Don't make a sound. Close the door.

Otherwise, I wish the other people can see that violence can be much more than beating, pushing, yelling and stealing money. Singing or playing is not as important to all as it is to us.

Thank you so much! All very interesting information. We have not defined the relationship yet as she has understandably been wanting to take things slow. We've been on a good number of dates and have been talking for a couple months. My pea brain though has a hard time with distance and separation especially when it's sudden.

I'm familiar with the Catholic annulment process. The idea is that the Catholics examine the circumstances of the marriage from the beginning and determine that it was never a real marriage to start out with. It gets weird at times...but for those who think they were never really married at all, it can be very  affirming for some to have an official statement that they were   frauded. For others, it can be traumatic. It varies person by person.	snakeP007	reply	na	na	na	0.002553959609940648	no	strong	no	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.
While it's not ideal, it may be that she confessed to dating while married and the priest told her to knock it off until the annulment is finalized.  It happened to a friend of mine and was told that if anyone was worth their salt, they would have no problem waiting for her.	snakeP007	reply	na	na	na	0.002553959609940648	no	strong	no	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.
She stopped talking to me and when I checked in she said she had started this process and it was harder than she thought. I hear documents have to be given, papers need to be served, things about your life have to be written...I can't imagine it's easy for her at all. I'm assuming she needs the space, and as hard as that is for me it's nothing compared to what she's going through.

If th b x was arrested and prosecuted successfully that will be better for her.  Unfortunately there are a lot of people who falsely claim it just to get better standing in divorce proceedings and to help usher their annulments.

"My heart aches for you both! 

Your girlfriend may have CPTSD, PTSD or betrayal trauma. If so, this process can be all consuming and you can hardly function as it means having a lot of physiological triggers and trauma responses. It's hard enough even without that. Stopping talking to you I wouldn't necessarily take as lack of interest. 

You may want to post on the PTSD and CPTSD subreddits for more insight on how to best support. 

My mom had a similar reaction to the paperwork although her marriage was not abusive. I do wish she was able to work through it all before getting remarried, for the sake of working through it, but the issues  really should go through a therapist who can then give a recommendation to the tribunal rather than a tribunal. Then, if the a declaration of nullity isn't granted it can be soul crushing. 

This is one reason I prefer Eastern Orthodoxy (although I despite the fringe elements going on), such as the Orthodox Church of America, they interpret the same Bible verse differently to allow divorce and remarriage (due to interpreting a certain Greek word differently) and if you become Orthodox they'll just accept whatever legal  state you were at when you joined. Ironically the Catholic stance that divorce isn't real and you can only do annulment isn't actually dogma of the Church and pope Francis says we are willing to consider the Orthodox approach.  The Catholic church in Vatican II ironically considers Orthodox literally the  same  Church (it isn't usually a mutual recognition), Rome officially thinks they have the same priesthood, sacraments etc.  so if your girlfriend ends up being denied or is too intimidated to complete  the process, suggesting looking at the OCA or something like that might be something to consider. I was literally told by a Catholic top  scholar and priest  go ahead and  become Eastern Orthodox , Rome believes it's the same Church. Confusing but just thought you might like to be aware just in case it happens to come up. 

The average Catholic though is terrified to appear to break communion with the pope as they are afraid it's a grave sin (ironically, theologically this is not considered true by Rome today but most people think it is ) so tread very carefully if you think you want to bring the subject up. I just mentioned it in case it's denied or something. 

(Rome considers any valid baptism from most Christian groups to also be part of the same Church but not complete due to not having all the sacraments...but Eastern Orthodoxy they consider fully in the Church.)

All that being said I think the option for a declaration of nullity is a nice option  for those who never saw their marriage as real to begin with and prefer to go through that process.

"So, I created yet another account because I'm still struggling... My ex finally left our shared home last July, but continued to retaliate for months afterwards... We are currently in the midst of 3 legal cases— one for a PFA (or RO, depending on where you live) and 2 criminal cases that may or may not be consolidated.  The abuse was severe and I still am dealing with medical issues that may never resolve…

I'm still struggling with the aftermath, so to speak.... After repeated continuances, so many issues with navigating a flawed legal system that's flooded with these cases, etc., I finally was able to get his brother to pick up some more of his belongings a couple of days ago and although I expected it to be no contact, it ended up being with contact although there weren’t any issues…

I also noticed that my ex viewed my social media story from a new account (which I only made public for less than a day despite it being private for YEARS prior)... I've tried to sever all almost all connections between us so I'm still unsure how he even knew to look when he did, but I digress...

I've been starting to improved with PTSD (or C-PTSD), but last night/this morning, the dreams came back full force… I barely sleep as it is, but my doc said that even getting 3-5 hours now (with meds) is way better than the original 30 mins-2 hours I was getting before…. But my dreams still haunt me.

Last night, my dream culminated in me being at the beach (we used to go to a beach house together irl, but this wasn’t the same house) and his brother, family and him being there… there were so many things happening, but at one point, his brother told me to video chat my ex and when I did, my ex was at a different area and with a gun and I couldn’t see the actual gunshot, but he shot himself in the head after telling me he was sorry, but he couldn’t live what he had done or face the consequences of his actions anymore. He had said similar things to me in real life before, but also threatened and also almost killed me. He also said at one point that if I ended things with him and got police/court involved that he would shoot me in the back of the head so quickly and then shoot himself….

I obviously woke up and was frantic to reach out to anyone to speak to even to distract myself from that dream because it felt way too real and haunting…. I finally went back to sleep and my dream was still about my ex, but us working at a different place than we used to work, but still ended with there being something very wrong, but too difficult to articulate what I mean. 

I know they are just dreams, but I’m struggling to cope with them…. I’m also struggling on how to tackle these feelings because a part of me wants to make sure that he is ok, but I can’t do that and I went forward with charges to prevent “blood being on my hands” because I don’t want anyone to die— not me, his future or past partners or him, but I don’t know how to TRULY prevent that and I try to just do the things I can to push through, but I’m struggling at this moment…

Sorry for the long post…. For clarification: I’m speaking to a DV/IPV counselor and on a waitlist for another (but they stated during intake that my goals of trying to truly resolve and recover from the trauma may not be realistic for their organization, but they could try to help me setup steps to achieve these goals), have a psychiatrist who has been prescribing me medication for all of this, working with my local agency for abuse victims and survivors, etc….

Tl; dr: I’m struggling with my dreams and emotions during this legal battle and I’m unsure how to reconcile and TRULY recover emotionally, mentally, etc….I don’t know what to do outside of what I’m doing…."	needtoSpeakfreely	post	24.172381526798855	male	White	0.9554972052574158	na	na	na	7	domesticviolence	no prediction.

"Hello, I'm trained in various trauma recovery modalities, and I work privately with clients but also work as a consultant directly with lawyers handling dv cases maximizing what they use in court and how they use it, witness prep, etc.

Prior to that, I went through my own dv legal case and won unprecedently. 

Showing up in court while also recovering the parts of you stuck in trauma is not always easy but essential to winning, you need as many parts of you as you can recover to get through, so good for you for working towards healing.

I find when your 'self' starts using your dreamscape to view and enact various outcomes it actually means you are on a good track. Personally I had many times where we had 'meetings' in my dreams and if you view this as additional exposing of beliefs,  therapy, perspective taking, outcome examining, emotions revealing you can really use this to move onward & upward.

"I use a combination of inner child healing and somatic experiencing therapy, this seems to work well for most people I work with (including myself).

The bond, conditions, or protection order are great in theory, but it is just a piece of paper and abusers aren't exactly known for following the law. These orders are a step in the process. When he breaches the conditions (usually has to be multiple times) then it proves he does not see himself subject to authority and eventually might produce further action (or be useful in other ways, like proving he won't likely follow co-parenting agreements if you have kids). 

An order is great and all, but if he decides to breach it, it can become very dangerous (possibly deadly) very quickly. Abusers are often angrier about the attempt to restrict them and there is an initial period where the victim is definitely more at risk than before (though again, this is necessary in our current system and there are things one can do to support their sense of safety).

There are many authorities who do not understand how the mind of a dv abuser works. And do see it as how a non-abusive person would handle & abide by an order.

To enhance safety you could consider giving a copy of the order & conditions as well as a picture & vehicle description to your neighbors and ask them to call the police if needed. Some finding sleeping by their car keys helpful, that they can set off an alarm if needed.

I would love to build a system that could move globally, I definitely agree there is a huge need for resources and I effort to provide services that encompass a wide range of what's needed but at affordable prices.

"So when I left my husband, I had called 911 the night I left him because he had choked me, while we have twin 4 month old boys sleeping in the next room. Long story short, I did a lot of reading about domestic abuse when I left to wrap my head around what had been happening to me. I live in the US, and most domestic violence websites here state that an abuser is 750% more likely to kill a spouse or family member with a gun (specifically) if they have choked that person before. My ex held a gun to his head a few months prior in front of our babies and I should have left then. Luckily they took his weapons the night he was arrested and he is no longer allowed to possess firearms if he is convicted in his DV trial or at least if the restraining order is still in place.

And as far as justice for Doerman, he will most likely be killed in prison if they ever let him out of protective custody. Prisoners nor guards take kindly to anyone who hurts or kills children.

"My husband and I have been together for over ten years and have a young son who is 4 years old.

In our years together, we have had very few arguments — most of the time we are able to navigate differences of opinion without much drama. In the last three years, we have had three arguments which have escalated to verbal abuse and very aggressive body language very, very quickly. His mom does last year of rather horrible circumstances and the three incidents have happened since she got sick in January. He struggles with anxiety and depression and is medicated for both as well as seeing a therapist. His father died when he was the same age as our son is now, and his mother was a narcissistic abuser. His childhood was very unsafe and filled with verbal abuse.

The three arguments have all begun because I shared with him something about his behavior that was bothering me. Twice it was about balance of house hood and child care tasks, and tonight it was about being immersed in his own world and unresponsive to my calls and texts when I had come down with severe food poisoning and needed his help.

In all of these arguments, as soon as I mention that his behavior is the cause of my problem, his body gets rigid, he squares his shoulders and he begins to pick apart my complaint. He will pick apart my word choice, take a statement out of context and blow it out into an extreme (“oh so I guess now I should just never leave the house again because an accident might happen” in response to me saying it shouldn’t have take. Two tests and two phone calls to get his attention from the basement when I was too sick to get up from the bathroom floor) tell me that my word choice is triggering, or tell me that the reason he is behaving in this was I don’t like is ultimately my fault because I didn’t do or say something the right way. It’s almost like he goes into a fugue state and he isn’t himself anymore. His voice gets louder, he looms over me (he’s 6’5”) and he gestures wildly in a way that is frankly a bit frightening. 

Tonight, when our argument escalated, I got upset and angry quickly because I was being blamed for not contacting him correctly when I was just about passed out on the floor. I got out of bed and got very angry — I was yelling at him to stop gaslighting me and he got out of bed and grabbed my face in his hands. He held me there for a moment before letting me go, both of us shocked about what had happened. Then he tried to keep me from leaving the room by preventing me from closing the door.

We continued to argue for an hour or so with the same pattern of escalation. I certainly said things I shouldn’t have, but I also kept trying to bring the temperature down. He finally did calm down and then broke into crazy, intense tears (deep emotional pain, clearly trauma induced) and apologized for what he’d done.

We talked for a long time after about it calmly and about our childhoods and what had caused this one comment to blow up into a wildfire. We plan to seek counseling next week, and I believe that he is committed to working on himself and on the marriage but the truth is — something just broke in me tonight. 

I don’t think he was in control of himself when he held my head that way, and I can’t help but think “what if it was worse?”

He is not a violent or abusive man in literally any other context. He doesn’t demean me or control me or lord over me in the house. Our marriage on any random day is a good, healthy, loving partnership of two people who try to support one another as equals. We communicate well about almost everything.

And I know abuse never starts with someone you think will be an abuser. 

I’m a little scared of him now. We tried to sleep in the same room together but couldn’t, so he’s gone to the guest room on his own accord. At this moment I feel very differently towards him than I ever have. I am not sure if I will ever feel the same way again, and I am not sure how to think about his behavior. Can therapy help? How much? Will I always be worried about hitting a trip wire? Does he fit the profile of an abuser even though he doesn’t do 90% of the more common warning signs?

All help and em advice greatly appreciated."	CryptographerNew5020	post	28.673353768586246	male	White	0.998613715171814	na	na	na	5	domesticviolence	no prediction.
"This is a really tough situation. Nothing is 100% clear and you are very valid in feeling conflicted. 

Without knowing you personally or having been there as a fly on the wall, I can only say this: forcibly grabbing your head/looming over you and yelling is abuse, but in the sense that it’s very low-contact/cautious. Grabbing your head seems like a sudden contemplation of violence, but the fact that he stopped himself is good and bad. He could be working up to it. He could suddenly be understanding he’s acting monstrous.

The tough part about saying anything helpful on these threads is that everyone has something nice to say about their abusers. Your partner in some ways sounds great. I take issue and see a red flag in how the abusive behavior is starting from you trying to get him to deviate from the gross trad male role of just doing whatever he wants and not helping around the house or with childcare. He’s putting on a show, being intimidating and squaring up not for you physically threatening him, but because you’re asking him to do the fucking dishes or something.

And your description of how he picks apart your argument is a pretty classic tactic of anyone who just wants their own way, and doesn’t want to listen or consider your perspective. A real argument or discussion is about engaging with and seeing the other person’s point, not immediately finding a way to dismiss it.

What I really don’t like is the blocking the door. My abuser would chase us around the house, yelling, throwing things that wouldn’t break. Slam all the doors. Maybe go into the garage and break things in a tantrum. Blocking doors, looming in doorways. He worked his way up to physically hurting me over years, and he did it to me because out of everyone: he knew I could take it, and he probably knew if he tried hurting someone else (especially at that later point) I would have clawed his eyes out or stoved his head in.

In some ways your partner sounds like they’re genuinely trying. And in others it sounds like they’re working up to something and sucking up the drama. I know they’ve been through a lot but they sound very emotionally immature and privileged in their perspective of your relationship. 

Try to feel things out, but stay wary. More than anything stay safe and keep yourself as safe as possible. If you feel unsafe go somewhere in the house or into the car away from them and lock the door. I can’t stress enough how much you need to communicate to them that if they try to physically control your body/position/movement without your permission that is something that cannot be allowed to pass.

Good luck, stay strong, stay safe. You’re not doing anything wrong, and you don’t deserve to have a partner disrespecting you like this at the very least."	CryptographerNew5020	reply	na	na	na	0.998613715171814	weak	no	no	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.
"Thanks so much for this thoughtful response — it's comforting to feel like my confusion itself is normal. 

This morning, I think he is both genuinely trying and genuinely traumatized, meaning that there is the possibility of his emotional problems getting the better of him despite his efforts. 

I also appreciate the affirmation that his approach to arguing about something is to avoid actually addressing the issue and instead deflect and try to wind me up until we are no longer talking about the problem but just screaming at each other. From there, he will often try and make me feel bad for him so that I will stop returning to the problem that started the argument. I don't think he is a narcissist, but given how he was raised, I think he reflexively uses narcissistic tactics when he is triggered. I don't think he has any other ways to meet conflict, but it can't continue.

I told him last night that if it doesn't change his tactics for arguing, there are two paths — either we will continue to have fights like this, and there is a natural consequence to that, or I will stop telling him how I feel, and there is a natural consequence to that. Neither are good. He agreed and said he understood why immediately greeting my complaint with how I personally could change things invalidates my experience, and how worrying that someone will blow up every time you need to tell them something is a terrible way to live.

When we talked, he told me that whenever I bring something up, his experience of the issue (no matter how small) is to become overwhelmed with feelings of rejection. I've been there, so I know what he's talking about. My folks are both narcissistic too. He is flooded with this looming fear that ""Oh now I get to see how \[My Wife\] truly feels, I know she must think I'm worthless and hates me."" He knows it's not rational — it's a trauma response and wants very much to stop catastrophizing (his word) for his own sake because it feels awful to live like that, and of course to stop having these reactions with me.

I reached out to my therapist this morning and we are going to talk with her on Monday as a couple before she recommends a marital counselor.

The hardest thing for me today is that my trust has been broken in a way I can't just 'get over' and to your point, no matter what was going on, using his body to control mine is abuse, whether or not he is ""an abuser."" It will be a while before I feel truly comfortable and safe with him again, even if we are able to make some progress. I'm sad about that — feels like something good was taken from me.

This sounds like my husband too. For me it's  hard to find the right  help after something like this happens, because there seems like there is room for change so you don't quite fit in with a typical domestic violence situation; yet at the same time, neither is it a normal marriage conflict, either, because it's more insidious,  dangerous, and entitled.

"I think you are handling this in a very healthy and understandable way. It goes to show that even with the support of therapists and the solid articulation of events through the vocabulary of therapy, abuse or abusive behavior is still possible even in the best of us.

I genuinely think you’ve got this covered! I hope you feel good about how you’ve handled this. If he’s genuine about change and growth, your trust can be rebuilt. I think of it this way, every really great solid relationship has disappointments and let downs, even scary situations and loss of trust like this. Whether it’s cheating or something financial, or what you’re experiencing, its how your partner approaches the future and whether they commit to your partnership that will stand the test of time and effort ahead."

"Tw: disability abuse

I have escaped domestic violence 6 months ago. I have been in DV emergency and transitional housing since, but I can't stay in the transitional shelter I am in now because they have been engaging in disability abuse and targeting me.

They have been inducing medical reactions and left me starving now on multiple occasions. They have taken away accomodations, including my ability to work remotely, as well as other really imperative needs to my quality of life and ability to get out of here into permanent stability. They are now undoing accomodations around my inability to do chores, and holding me to the standard of someone able bodied to use as justification to kick me out. I can imagine that will be very soon as they've literally tried weaponizing this against me before, wrote me up and made light of my disability saying I could ""move now.""

I have lifted every stone trying to find a way out. I am just so hopeless at this point. I don't drive (or I'd sleep in a vehicle) and I don't have a real solution for myself. I have spoken to the department of disabilities, I field a grievance, talked to everyone I am supposed to but all it had lead to is dead ends, retaliation, and affirmation that the shelter system isn't really designed to support victims of abuse - and people with disabilities need not apply. 

My ex told me I would never be able to leave him and that he would guarantee I just die on the streets. His words haunt me every day."	nevradullday	post	31.355826861352654	male	White	0.9992641806602478	na	na	na	6	domesticviolence	no prediction.
"They all say you will never be able to leave them. They have to make you believe we can’t live without them. They feed off of the adrenaline and power and control they gain by holding us down. We CAN make it! The most unfortunate issue is the current system and the community officials that don’t protect us the way that they are supposed to, we need them too, and how we deserve! I have been fighting this battle for 12 years. Leaving and losing everything 2 times. Today I go homeless with my daughter so I can fight for my 2 sons that the system gave back to the abuser as they stand by and watch my sons get further abused. It’s heart breaking. But homeless or not the freedom we have without the abuse cannot be beat with money. It’s priceless! There are special protections for victims with disabilities. We all have to keep fighting together. Hold hands through this together  be resourceful and when that doesn’t work start at the beginning and revisit every resource again. In that you might fight you might get one more resource or fet one more person to actually listen. They can’t turn their cheek forever. You get applied 6 times over 6 months to an organization that only allows applicants every 30 days. At the end of each conversation where they deny services to me again, I smile and 
say “well I’ll see you next month” so they know I’m not giving up. I finally got another resource. I’ve started a log of all of done so if nothing else I can write the governor and express to him how hard it is to get help in our community. I’m making a list of resources for others that walk behind me so they don’t have to search as hard as I have. Keep calling! Every resource in town. After those call every town in your state, every county, then if you still cannot get help start calling other states. Keep trying! Your freedom is worth it. You are worth it. I’m not sure what state you are in but I’m happy to share the resources I have for victims with disabilities. Just message Me. Keep your head up. You are worthy.

If you are using regular homeless shelters, stop. There are shelters for those fleeing domestic violence and abusers. They all have their rules, and those rules vary. As for chores, even if you can do something as small as dusting, doing dishes, making dinner for everyone, it helps.

"TLDR; I would love to help show my mom that there are other DV survivors like her who’ve gotten out. That she is strong, beautiful, and capable. Can you share your story, advice, and just general encouragement?

I created this account in 2017 when I was in high school, trying to seek help for my mother, but never got around to posting anything and just lurked. I’m now 24yo, been away from home for 6 years, graduated from college, in a stable job/financial state, experiencing world travel, and in a healthy loving relationship. I’m really fortunate that my life is overall balanced, healthy, and enjoyable. 

I am home for a few weeks this summer in between moving, and it’s excruciating seeing my mom’s wellbeing is so much worse. My dad (54M) is an alcoholic with anger issues. He abuses my mom (54F) emotionally, financially, sexually, and physically. They have been married over 30 years. The abuse has been around for at least 10 years, which is when I first remember noticing it as a freshman in high school and my mom started confiding in me. My mom always said she would get divorced and leave once my brother and I were out of the house… but we’ve both been gone for 2 years now. Whenever I talk to her about leaving my dad, she is completely hopeless. She has been made to believe she wouldn’t be able to survive in a post-divorce life financially, that she would be lonely, that she is undesirable for anyone else, that he would stalk her and threaten her, that he would find a way to make sure she doesn’t get any alimony, that he would kill her, that she isn’t strong enough to make it on her own... She feels completely helpless (understandably). 

As her daughter, it’s really difficult seeing my mom suffer through life like this. I care for her so much, and I totally see and understand how my dad has completely destroyed her self confidence and ability to feel like she can leave. I’ve always wanted to call the police, but my mom’s concern is that my dad losing his job would ultimately hurt my mom too much financially for her to be able to leave/get alimony. She has brought up going to counseling on her own for issues unrelated to their marriage, but has yet to find something affordable. 

Anyways, that was a much longer post than anticipated. I’m really sad and feel guilty I left my mom to fend for herself. I’ve definitely coped with my mom’s situation by moving away/not thinking about it, but I just can’t bear to see her live the rest of her life like this. I know my mom and her relationship are ultimately not my responsibility, but she has been made to feel so helpless that I know she needs someone in her corner fighting for her. 

QUESTIONS: How did you find the courage to leave? How did you gain your self confidence back? How has life been since you left? Were your concerns about leaving actually true/as difficult as you thought? I’d love words of encouragement for my mom. Even for her to just know she isn’t alone."

"I found courage to leave in that I will be killed if I stay so might as well put the danger to good use getting away and not needing to experience this crap. 

Certain parts of my upbringing contributed to being an ideal victim in some ways but easier to escape in others. 

Good victim - is unhappy but takes monogamy way too seriously to give up even when the other person clearly doesn’t care that they make you deeply unhappy chronically with no change after the billionth i’m sorry-but-not-really. 

Escape happy victim - I work and despite concentrated escalations and whining to get me to quit my job and move further away from my family I stayed working full time and refused to move. My mother raised me to never depend on a man for money ever. All the high/decent earners in my family are women not the men. Despite staying when I was unhappy (from what I now know was emotional abuse), once he tried to kill me I don’t have a lack of self esteem that says a relationship is worth my life. I don’t have a belief that says I deserved how he treated me even though he tried his hardest to claim I was mentally ill (says Mr. Involuntary Commitment before we met) and to claim me asking for better treatment was equivalent to me abusing him. 

The worst happened while I was pregnant with our child (he tried to kill us a little after the 20 week gender scan. Wanted to be a dad yet his child relying on my blood supply didn’t stop him). I knew prior to having a child that I refuse to raise a child in a home where they’re yelled at and micromanaged much less overt domestic abuse. So if I didn’t care about myself I would have escaped just for the sake of my child. Everyday I’d go home expecting him to kill me day or night. A child should never experience that or threat of becoming an orphan because dad kills mom then himself or goes to jail. 

So all that plus I have my own money where leaving him was a matter of safety but no real  financial or emotional hurdles. I wasn’t expecting custody to be so not sure but I’ve had good success so far. My lawyer had told me that DV is taken seriously in the letter of the law but she still had a client of hers that was assaulted by the father and the judge ruled for shared custody. I have sole custody anyways. I’m struggling being a single parent financially but I found a higher paying job and will stop being paycheck to paycheck this fall. My child is a happy soon to be toddler without complications from the rough pregnancy. He doesn’t have to walk on eggshells like I did. He doesn’t know his dad but my family, myself, and his daycare teachers more than make up for the absence. 

My grandmother’s story may be of more interest. My grandmother was abused by grandfather for decades. Culture excused it. My aunts and uncles ignored it or couldn’t do much about it growing up. She was a SAHM that my grandfather had groomed and when she’d try to work or start a business he’d sabotage it. The only reason she’s at peace now is because my mother and aunts always financially supported her despite grandfather’s shenanigans. She got out finally by living with my mother away from grandfather. My mother was persistent in offering them asking that grandmother move in with her. My mother took care of everything so for once grandmother could relax then participate in running the household by choice and not by force. Now that my mother died she lives with an aunt of mine with the same benefits. She doesn’t have to worry about money and she’s happy to be surrounded by her adult children that care about her and most of her grandchildren. Grandfather is busy ruling the former roost until his second wife is ready to poison him (kinda jk but kinda not). 

Maybe she could live with you or your sibling temporarily or permanently while she reworks her life? There’s already so much emotional stress just escaping the abuser. The day to day precariousness of having a place to live and paying for expenses makes everything harder and for some impossible. Safe people and not having to worry as much about bills helps a ton.

"It was my son's courage and quick thinking that got us out. I'd been desperate to leave for years. My son had also, unknown to me, been planning for us all to escape for a long time. He was just a kid, around 7 or 8 years old. Not stupidly long before we escaped he'd told me, ""Let's go on holiday without daddy, and never come back. Then he can't hurt us any more"". We'd tried: I'd actually booked holiday accommodation, had it all planned, to just leave with the kids, without my violent, abusive, rapist ex. But somehow, he found out (he had a keystroke stalker program installed on my laptop and probably found out that way) and he just got in the car, uninvited, as we were leaving. I'd actually finished the relationship with him over a year beforehand, but he refused to accept it, refused to move out, refused to allow me any freedom, and it had got to the point where he was regularly threatening to kill me and the kids ""if he didn't leave"". But he refused to leave. It was absolutely terrifying. I felt so powerless, so hopeless. I had nowhere to go. All the refuges were full and he'd isolated me from all my friendships. I certainly didn't want to ever have another relationship, ever again! But I'll get to that later.

The day we left, my ex had, as usual, started shouting abuse and unfounded accusations at me and calling me all the names under the sun. I don't even remember if he hit me on that occasion: all I can remember is that he hit my son, hard, across the face. That crossed a boundary I would never accept. My son eye signalled me not to do or say anything, not to react, if that makes sense. We went to my son's room. My son waited until his ""father"" had gone out the back for a cigarette and he ran to the back door and locked him out. He grabbed his little brother's hand and a bag with a couple of things and we ran to the car, locked the door and drove away. We only just made it in time. My ex had heard the car door slam awas shouting and chasing us on foot, but we got away. Just few days previously, I'd run into an old friend who had also been through DV. I confided in her and she told me I could bring the kids to stay with her, any time, day or night. So that's where we went. 

My son is the bravest person I have ever met.

My ex had beaten me down to the point that I was a shell of my former self. I had zero self confidence, thought what happened had been my fault, thought it was what I deserved. I thought I was ugly, stupid, a bad mother, a useless human being. I'd contemplated suicide but I couldn't leave my kids to cope on their own and besides, I was too cowardly (thank goodness!) All of this was due to his abuse, and the reason I ended up with an abusive husband was because I had an abusive mother. It took me a lot of therapy to figure this out. 

I left with nothing. Just the clothes on my back and my beautiful children. I never claimed child maintenance from my ex because I didn't want him to be able to trace me. He could have killed me with his violence, he had threatened to kill me and the kids many times. The time I met up with him after I left because he said he wanted to see the kids was horrible. He just spent the whole time trying to coerce me to go back to him, sexually harassed me and ignored them. They didn't want to see him again after that. I told him if he wanted to see them he could apply for supervised contact, but he never did. He just hassled my friends and family to try to make them feel sorry for him with lies about how he couldn't live without me.

Over a decade later, he has abused at least one other woman who has several children to him. My friend told me she was writing some very strange posts on fb which made it clear she was suffering DV. Abusers never change. 

Me and the kids had some amazing times in our new found freedom. Finally they were able to just be children without having to live with hearing the constant abuse from their so called ""father"". He used to shout at them ""You're not my children. Your mother is a slag. Your mother is a prostitute. I never want to see you again. You are fucking nothing to do with me!"" No child deserves to hear that from the person who is supposed to protect them, care for them, provide for them and love them unconditionally. He never did any of those things, only harmed them. His toxic love bombing of them the day after he'd beaten me badly and raped me afterwards used to make them so uncomfortable. My youngest son used to tell him, every day, from the day he could talk ""I hate you, daddy.""

Therapy really helped. It was through having therapy, for free, through a charity organisation, that I built up the courage to start to plan my escape. It was through therapy that I realised it wasn't my fault, that I didn't deserve any of it, and that I could have a life of my own without him.

Your mum is scared by the things your dad has been beating her down with for years. He brainwashed her into having these fears just like my ex did me. He used to say things like ""The reason I married you is because you're so ugly no other man will ever want you"" (but he would constantly accuse me of cheating and told me neither of my kids were his). I never cheated, because I'm monogamous: I've never had any interest in cheating. I was incredibly (stupidly) loyal to him. At least I was until he broke me. Loyalty has to be deserved, I learned through my therapist! If loyalty means not telling others you're being abused by an intimate partner, break that loyalty!

After many years of no relationships, I thought I would never have another relationship again, ever. I took a long time out. I had lots of therapy. I learnt to listen to my gut, and to trust it completely. 

Today, I am with the most wonderful, kind, compassionate partner. I still have to pinch myself sometimes to check I'm not dreaming! Love after DV is possible. You just have to be patient, learn to love yourself and trust yourself first, and that takes time. But it's worth it. You have to learn the signs of abuse like gaslighting and love bombing, 

My ex was diagnosed with Narcissistic Personality Disorder verging on Psychopathy. I recommend your mum watches Dr Ramani's channel. She specialises in helping people who are trapped in and who have left relationships with people who have narcissistic personality traits. She helped me a lot.

I don't know what to suggest if your mum won't come to stay with you as the first step to finding somewhere of her own. I take it your dad knows where you live? Maybe that's what's stopping her? Just let her know your door is always open I guess. You can't fix her problems, you're right, and it must be awful for you to feel powerless to help, but make sure you look after yourself too. Make sure you get therapy for yourself if you feel you need it, and don't let your mum use you as her only source of therapy. I know that sounds mean, but she shouldn't have been doing that to you when you were a kid, she should have sought therapy for herself and not overburdened you. Your childhood was abusive due to your dad and your mum's inability to leave him. Not her fault, but she needs more help than you can give and it's incredibly damaging to your mental health to have to be your mum's counsellor in a situation like this. 

She doesn't need to worry about all the things she's worrying about though. They're worries your dad instilled in her to keep her prisoner. I hope she finds some affordable therapy asap. Check out charities that offer free/donation sessions in her local area.

It's possible she has Stockholm Syndrome. I was diagnosed with that at one point and it was quite embarrassing to find that out! 

Wishing you and your mum well. I hope she finds the courage to leave your dad sooner than she or you think. 

I had to survive on disability money from the government for years and believe me, I didn't WANT any top up from my disgusting excuse for an ex husband! I didn't ask and I survived quite adequately on what little I had. It wasn't easy, but DAMN, it was worth missing out on eating take outs to be able to relax for the first time in a decade!"

I found the courage to leave when he put his hands on me. I knew I had to leave but I was scared. I was ashamed embarrassed and fearful for what would happen. He had relapsed and was passed out. It was a good chance for me to pack up and leave. It was scary for the first few months. I had a lot of ptsd and intrusive thoughts. I tried therapy but I was so numb at the time that it was hard to communicate how I felt. It took months for my emotions to come out. But let them come.

"I found the courage and power to leave when I told some people about the abuse that I knew in person about the abuse. They helped encourage me and made me realize that I did not deserve the abuse. They also didn’t just tell me I needed to leave (which is very easy and obvious for someone to say) they helped me plan and find a way out and reassured me they would not let me fall if I left. 
The final piece was my parents getting involved in my life again when I needed back surgery. My friends helped me tell my parents about the abuse and the secret was out. There was no turning back at that point as the horse was out if the barn. 
She had lost her power over me but I kept letting her think she had control while I packed and plotted my escape right under her nose. 
A week after I told my parents, she had a dentist appointment and my parents and I swooped in when she left for the dentist and thought I was at work. She came home to my stuff gone and a note telling her I was filing for divorce. That day was full of mixed feelings but overall was exhilarating as I had beaten the odds and escaped. She had lost and she could never hurt it abuse me again.

"I knew that at some point, it was going to be either him or me, and I refused to die at his hands. I was sleeping with a knife on me next to him, and knew that the next time he decided to unleash on me, could be the last time. Something flipped, and I realized I had to leave. 

Getting law enforcement involved was the only thing that I could do. 6 months of pre trial hearings and he pled out. 

I was terrified for my safety, but driven by the need to do this not only for me - but for every single woman who has experienced the terror and abuse I endured. It was daunting and overwhelming, but it was more than necessary.

What I noticed when I participated in a course for victims and survivors of Domestic abuse, was that every single one of us who shared our stories in the group therapy sessions nodded as each woman spoke and said things like ""Me too"", or ""My ex did exactly the same"", or ""You could be telling my story - it's almost identical"".

Please don’t give up hope in her and know that leaving is much harder than it seems when you are on the outside looking in.  It sounds like she knows she needs to leave but after years of being beat down and abused and threatened and told you are no good and that you deserve the abuse it is really hard to overcome. 
I know I never thought I would have the strength or courage to leave even with my friends encouraging. I remember begging them to give up on me and walk away for their own good because I would never be strong enough to leave and I didn’t want them to waste their time in a lost cause.

"I’m looking for advice if anyone has pressed DV charges or rape charges. Please let me know if this post is not allowed. 
My ex bf (M 24) and I are now broken up due to him being a cheater and liar. He’s emotionally abused me for about a year with his manipulation. He’s on steroids and has gotten more moody and angry. 

Two weeks ago, we have been fighting over my feelings, I came over to break up and it was clear he didn’t- and the only thing he wanted to do was say a quick i’m sorry and have sex. I stated multiple times I didn’t want to have sex, and was upset thats what he thinks I want. We laid down in bed to talk about everything going on, he started touching me and making a move and I told him again and again I didn’t want to have sex. He of course got annoyed, and we had sex. When things started heating up, I never agreed to have sex but I also didn’t say no. The whole time he could tell I was not enjoying it and kept asking me what was wrong. I didn’t say anything, but I felt horrible after. 

Last week, we got into a “play wrestle” about a picture he wouldn’t show me. He is 6’4 ~200-220lbs solid muscle. I’m about 5’2 130lbs. He is extremely strong. When wrestling he was restraining my hands, arms, pretty much my whole body in order for me to not get the picture. I told him he was hurting me. I left after the fight, the next day I saw my hand was a bit red, not extremely bruised. Later that day when I took a shower, there was a medium bruise on my arm, where he was restraining me, exactly where his thumb would be gripping my arm. This was our only physical altercation. 
I sent him a picture of my hand via text and he dismissed it saying I was out of pocket for sending him the picture because we were only play wrestling.
My friends are saying I should press charges, but I don’t know much about the law, how to go about doing so or if this is even sufficient enough to press them."	planktonsothereye	post	24.13370617843124	female	White	0.998568058013916	na	na	na	2	domesticviolence	no prediction.
Idk if this is cause for pressing charges but it is a major indication to leave him and get as far away as you can. End things and block him. I don’t want to say these instances were mild by any means but they most likely will get much worse to where you will absolutely need to press charges.

"I second that. 

The fact that you told him you didn't want sex multiple times WAS you refusing your consent. It was rape by coercion. If he chose to coerce you into sex, kept asking you what was wrong when he already KNEW you weren't up for sex, he's got some serious issues. I strongly advise you to go zero contact. What a creep. If you've not seen it already, there's a post on here called My name is Sky, about a women who lost her life due to being abused by a man who used coercive control to manipulate and abuse her. Coercive control is very real. Being raped in that way was NOT YOUR FAULT. You said no REPEATEDLY. I am so sorry you went through that. Do not beat yourself up about it. He knew exactly what he was doing. 

My experience of pressing charges are from childhood sexual abuse, and the court wouldn't take my case because of insufficient evidence. It felt absolutely horrendous and hurt me way more than it would have done had I not bothered. My violent, abusive, rapist ex husband pressured me into pressing charges against the paedophile who abused me as a child in order to appear to my dad like he was a supportive, kind, protective husband. I'd been advised by a charity to have a few counselling sessions before making a decision on whether to press charges and I advise you to do the same if possible. Don't let anyone pressure you into pressing charges. It feels devastating to read the lies on the police report from the abuser and being powerless to do anything about it because of insufficient evidence.

"Hello,

I belive as a child I was physically abused at times. I was raises by two aggressive parents who had troubling past.

Today is my birthday and my parents both wished me happy birthday and sent me a present. I belive it is to maintain connect with me as I have been working to separate from them.

As a child about 10 years ago, my dad found out I had put a hole into a wall on the house and covered it up. When he found out, he drug me up two flights of stairs by my ears and hair. Threw me on the ground then when I got up open hand hit me and knock me back onto the ground
* he was a bigger guy. He was playing minor league football at the time and previously was in the infantry.
He proceeded to hit me until I gave up. There was about 5 to 6 good hits he got on my face. Then he held my face down and shaved my head against my will screaming at me the whole time.
My mother watched the whole time. Didn't even stop him.
My dad tells this story to this day but dismisses the parts where he hurt me. He just says he shaved my head because I lied.

Thats not the only time but it was the most memorable. I would tell my friends but I was too scared to call child services. My dad would probably lose his job then things would've been worse. 

My mother would grab me by the throat and slam me against the wall. It was only a few times though. A lot of the abuse was emotional i.e. screaming at me, calling me a pussy, bitch, faggot at early of 7 years old. A lot of screaming and a lot of other threats were made.

I belive this was normal my whole life. I have had a few people attempt to kill me so i thought the world was naturally like this and maybe I had it good but not having a machete or knife aimed to kill me.

Can I hear some thoughts? My parents helped me out with college and other financial stuff here and there. Whenever I bring this dtuff up now, they act like it never happened or just say sorry. I still get emotionally abused. I get told my life isn't good enough, I get put down constantly because I am not someone else's kid. 

I have a supportive girlfriend now. Again, I still would like thoughts and opinions. Maybe a scale? I understand some have worse and some have never experienced this.

Yes, you were abused. I am so sorry that happened to you. Although they did help you in some regards (like paying for college), that in no way justifies they physical and psychological harm they caused. The blatant denial is a way for them to cope with it; it does not mean that you are not a victim of real abuse.

He was really aggressive like his eyes would turn black back then when he got aggressive. Anyways … we got into contact again. He was so quick to see me. He paid for everything. He is a lot different from when I met him before. A whole different person But at the same time I feel like he is putting up a front. He apologized like this is the first time he has ever said sorry. And he wants to try again. Take things slow. He is a a few states away. So it’s a lot of talking on the phone. He is a lot more calm now and just different but I don’t know if I should give him another chance. I forgave him kinda but I still hold resentment. I have so many problems because of him.

"I want to apologies if my post comes in any way triggering. Please let me know and I will delete it ASAP!  TW: Sexual Assault, Physical Abuse, Revenge Porn

I have a friend who dated this guy for about 6 months. From what she has told me, her relationship was incredibly toxic but he also physically assaulted her numerous times. I've even seen pictures of her bruising. She at one stage in her relationship, broke up with him and called the police. But before it got to court, she dropped the charges and went back to him. A couple of months ago, she called it quits and broke up with him for what I thought was the final time after he threatened to rape her.  She's had a rough day yesterday which was unrelated to him and I found out today that she spent the night with him last night. I found out because he learnt that she had been seen someone while they were broken up and he in revenge, sent nudes of her from her phone to me and some of her other friends and immediate family. I spoke to her and consoled her and she told me she was also raped last night. Her family managed to convince her to go to the police and the police are aware of what happened. 

I've been gentle with my friend  and very supportive through all what has happened. I just want to try and understand why someone would keep going back to their abuser who's absolutely evil in everyway possible. I could understand if they were married, or they had kids or financially dependent on him but she's not in anyway.  She has been in a few emotionally abusive relationships but they have never gotten violent or like this before. I also feel like I should show some ""tough love"" but I don't want to come out judgmental and rude. I thought maybe this community would be the best to understand what she's going through instead of making my own assumptions and how I should approach her.

Love is a powerful drug.

Yes I agree.  If there has been an assault it is the DA’s choice to prosecute not hers so anyone can report a crime and if the police already have prior then they might lock him up long enough for someone to talk some sense into her. Your local DV group usually always have someone that can talk to you all and help you thru legal and if she will leave and get some distance and time they know the in’s and outs - it so much they can find you with today.

My advice would be to stay as judgement free as possible and just be there for them. Most people in domestic abuse situations will go back 6 or 7 times before leaving.

In my experience, he was like drugs. I couldn’t find joy without him. When we were together I would go no contact with everyone the whole time we were together. He was my sun, stars, and moon. I looked for him in everyone and in so many ways still do. I’m forcing myself to stay away from him and hold myself accountable because I have a child that I want to be alive for. I’m slowly learning to find those highs in ways that will never involve him, but it would be a lie to say I wish there wasn’t an ending where he’s the man I made him out to be in my head.	solos169	reply	na	na	na	0.035505522042512894	no	strong	no	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.
"I’m hoping in addition to contacting the police she had a rape kit done as well. Please document all bruises, screencap convos where she talked about the abuse, hell, screen cap with dates if she took pics of the bruises in a convo. Time stamps are great. 

Also, screencap the nudes(with time stamps), and get copies of everyone they were sent to. While it’s tough as it was from her phone, they may be able to slap revenge porn charges on there too, especially if he admits to doing it and you have proof.

Also please try r/legaladvice, as well as reaching out to DV shelters in your area. They can help her find services for recovery and therapy.

The best way to support a DV survivor is to empower them to make their own choices and take back control.

"Hello world,

So, my (F, gen X) teenage daughter (F, early teens) has been subject to severe parental alienation by her father (we're divorced for most of her life.) And her father and I don't get along. 

He is a covert narcissist and can be very charming and manipulative. He's been neglectful towards my daughter for most of her life, and recently began giving her love and attention, and turned the charm full force on her. 

In addition, although he's always badmouthed me in front of our  daughter, he has doubled down on the badmouthing, and escalated his criticism. 

My daughter has distanced herself from me as a result, refusing to have any contact with me. 

My question is, should I back off, risk losing the closeness that we had until recently, and allow her to mature and hopefully come around on her own, or, should I keep reaching out, keep fighting for her and for us as mother and daughter, and risk going against her consent, risk her feeling that I'm forcing a relationship on her? 

What do you wish that the parent you were alienated from, would have done? Do you wish that they had accepted the situation, backed off, and left you alone? 

Or do you wish that they stuck around, even if it hurt them, and had done everything possible to be there for you, even while you were telling them to go away? 

I want to do what's best for my daughter, both now and in the long run, but I don't know what that is. If you've been through this, please let me know what you think. If you're going through this, please let me know how you feel. Thank you.

(By the way, I (F29) am posting this this for my technologically challenged mom. Am not troll!

Make sure they know you’re there if they ever change their mind.

"I was an alienated child. Alienated from my loving father by my covert narcissistic mother. She used me as her counsellor to turn me against my dad. She lies so much that I stopped being able to believe a word she ever said. I chose to go zero contact with her because I could no longer cope with her emotional abuse. I still have PTSD that involves flashbacks to her abuse.

I have a relationship with my dad, but it's awkward. I think he feels a lot of guilt for not standing up for me and fighting for me, but at the time, I was so angry with him because of the lies my mother told me about him. She painted a picture of a cruel abuser, but the only abuse I witnessed growing up was from her. I've always been frightened of her and have never been scared of my dad.

Just keep in touch with your daughter, regardless of what she says. Don't say anything mean about her dad, but if she says horrible things to you that are her dad's lies, say ""Those things are not true"". You don't need to elaborate. 

There's a channel on YouTube called Surviving Narcissism with Dr Les Carter, and he has some excellent videos on PA. Parental Alienation is child abuse. It absolutely destroys a child's mental health. It's affected me so, so badly and it still affects me to this day. I'm in my 40s. There's also a channel called ""One Mom's Battle"" with Tina Swithin, with lots of legal resources. I think she has a website too.

Fight for her. Don't let go. There are ways to prove PA in court. 

I wish my dad would have told me ""I'm sorry you don't want to see me, but you're coming to live with me anyway!"" I didn't want to spend a minute with my mum..I was emotionally abused and coerced into choosing her to hurt him. I would happily have lived 50/50 between them had she been a normal, good enough, average mum! But she coerced me into ending my relationship with my dad and his entire family. Today, I feel very alone in the family aspect as my mother's family have shunned me (long story).

I so badly needed to know my dad loved me and I was terrified of my mum, but I felt I had to look after her. I basically became her carer. She even somehow convinced me to be her live-in chef. She treated me so badly, but in retrospect, at the time, I didn't understand what was happening. She threatened to commit suicide if I went to live with my dad, but in a very subtle way, saying:

""The only reason I didn't commit suicide was because of you. Your bastard father destroyed my life! He doesn't love you! He abandoned you too! He abandoned both of us, left us with no money, left us to rot!""

On the other hand she was telling me that I destroyed her life, that she wished I'd never been born. Telling me I was a slag just like my father after I was raped.

Your daughter is being severely emotionally abused by her father and I honestly don't have an answer. PA is such a horrible type of child abuse because it alienates the child from the one parent who actually loves them as an individual, rather than uses them as a weapon to hurt their ex. 

If you can afford a lawyer I highly recommend getting some advice from a specialist in PA cases."	Teleporting-Cat	reply	na	na	na	0.011807171627879143	no	strong	no	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.
"Dont give up. You know him. You know exactly what he is about. This is just a game to him, another way to play mind-fuck while he is bored. Your daughter, however, believes that he is a genuine, loving real human being! When he turns on her as you know he will, she is going to be heartbroken and confused, and will need you desperately. So you just hang in there Mom! She is still your daughter, she still loves you, she is just drinking a bit of Kool Ade right now and is slightly addled. Its important that you continue to be present in her life like normal. She has ‘found ‘ a new parent, but you have always been Mom. This cannot and will not ever change. If she ever asks why you are acting this way, or are still around when she is being snotty just tell her that This is what unconditional love means, sweetheart. I will always love you, no mater what is happening in your life. Respect her privacy, resist any temptation to scope out her phone, computer or journal for info about your ex. That is unforgivable. Otherwise its business as usual.

This is exactly what happened with my son after i left his dad and we moved across the country. His dad was and still is an abusive, alcoholic narcissist who was terrifying to live with, however our son was too young to fully comprehend the danger he faced, and the wildly dysfunctional home he lived in. His father wanted no part of custody other than enough to let me know he had the ability to make sure that I might never see our son again, so I was terrified every time visitation rolled around. The worst thing was how than man manipulated our child. ‘You abandoned me!” As if an elementary age child had any choice where Mom decided to live? His father continually blamed me for everything since the death of Christ, and my son absolutely believed every word. I understood. It wasnt easy living with a defiant adolescent, but i knew it had to be even worse to live inside my sons head and heart. I knew that he actually didnt hate me like an adult hates, he was being used like a tool, repeatedly, ruthlessly and relentlessly. It was painful to watch. So I continued being his Mom. Volunteered for school functions, said ok when he wanted friends over for bonfires, made cookies. Said I love you every chance I could, and never said a damn negative thing about his rat fink of a father. He finally figured everything out when he was about 18, after endless abuse, disappointments, oh, simply more than a heart should endure. We have had a close relationship since then. 

You have got this OP. You already have the essentials down pat. Its all about the love."	Teleporting-Cat	reply	na	na	na	0.011807171627879143	weak	no	no	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.

"Hi. I am Mom's oldest daughter and I posted this on her behalf. I think your words are really impactful, real and relevant and I (finally managed to talk her through making her own reddit account) hope you might consider reaching out to her at u/mineflower, because support from other moms who have been through the same thing, means so much to her right now.

I also have a question for you. Mom has learned, grown, and changed for the better since I was a child. But she had me very very young, and when I was little, our life was chaotic, leading me to leave home in my teens (with her blessing). I was estranged from her for many years. She respected my boundaries. She didn't try to find me, she didn't insist I be a part of her life. She waited til I reached out.

We reconnected and talked real, and today, she is my best friend. But I don't think I would have come to her, if she'd been chasing me. If she'd pushed. It was only once I realized that she was respecting my privacy and my life, and that any relationship we might have going forward would be on my terms, that I sought her out. I was not a victim of parental alienation, that was just how my life went.

And I am so glad that Mom is in my life now. And so impressed with how much she's learned and grown, how much better she's done by my little sister. And honestly my sister's dad is awful, I know him my ownself, and I was close with his other ex wife, not just what I've heard from Mom.

So I struggle to advise Mom here. Because I wouldn't have come back around if she'd chased me. But on the other hand, i also don't want my little sister to think that her mother has given up on her. But on the other hand (wait, how many hands do humans have?) I think my sister, and her needs and wants, are the most important thing here.

It's confusing. I found your words very wise. I know this is heavy shit, but if you're willing to reach out to mom directly, I think you could help.

Also, thank you so much for taking the time to write such a deep, insightful and real response. I am grateful, Internet Stranger. I appreciate you ❤️"	Teleporting-Cat	follow-up	na	na	na	0.011807171627879143	weak	strong	no	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.
"It can be interpreted that way, especially if you’re trying to insert yourself into situations where you’re not welcome, or if you have an angsty teen etc. That’s why I say respect their boundaries above all else.

E.g. if the kid has an assembly or something for school. Don’t show up and force them to interact with you. Just show up and sit quietly at the back. Ball is in their court if they wish to acknowledge you. Unless they’ve asked you not to come to school events, in which case definitely don’t show up. 

Or for a birthday - don’t show up at their house/birthday party and create tension. But do send a text, or drop a present & card at the door for them so they know you’re thinking of them. Unless they have asked you not to text or send things. 

Basically absolute first priority is to respect any boundaries the child sets. Second priority is to show up in the background while giving them space - make it their choice whether to interact with you.

I think if you assume you’re not wanted in places they haven’t asked you not to be, it may be seen by the child as proof you don’t care etc and back up what the other parent is telling them. You know your child and how comfortable they would be speaking up to you if they were unhappy with your actions and can cut back your presence accordingly to their feedback. If you don’t think they would speak up, depending on their age you could maybe text them “I want to watch your school awards night. I will sit at the back and not approach you so you don’t feel pressured to talk to me unless you decide to. Is that ok? Love you whatever you decide.”"	Teleporting-Cat	reply	na	na	na	0.011807171627879143	no	no	no	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.

"Thank you so much for the kind words. I'm doing well, been busy because I just went back to school. 

Mom is heartbroken, but she's a survivor and one of the strongest women I know. Shes alright. I haven't heard from my little sister, because her dad is against us talking, and she may be angry at me for being supportive to Mom. But my stepdaughter is good friends with my little sis and she checks in for me. 

Honestly I find this whole thing confusing because I love them both. Does my sister have reasons to be upset? Yes of course! Mom isnt perfect, noone is? Does Mom love her more than worlds, and do her best despite her flaws. YES. My sisters anger is vaild. And mom doesnt deserve to be hurt. Family is complicated.

Hi everyone, I’m new to this chat…but I’m hoping I can share my current situation on here. Right now I’ve been dating my partner for five years. We have been high school sweethearts up until this point. However, our relationship is very toxic. My partner, at first, seemed like a good guy, he was sweet, wise, charming, funny, and he appeared so gentle and caring. I fell in love with his heart, and the way he treated me so kindly, never berating me, never judging me or my life, or my past (which includes child abuse). In fact, he had told me that we would go through it together, that we would heal together. But now, I am afraid to admit that he is abusive. He hits the wall, the dashboard, the steering wheel, objects next to me. He will kick things when he is angry when they are close to me. He’s recently escalated to grabbing an object and telling me he will throw it at me. We just had a fight a moment ago, and he held a hard golf ball in his hand and said, “I wonder if I threw this at you, if you’d die just right there. Or if you’d bleed and get a concussion, or if you’d simply just get a bruise that I explain as you hurting yourself to my family.” When we fight, he will says things like this, about how the object in his hand could just hit me and be explained as an accident. He will pretend like he is getting ready to hurt me, just to the point where I flinch. But the thing that kills me inside the most is that, when I’m crying, because I just cry like a baby when he is like this—he will grit his teeth and make this murderous expression and tell me “I told you to stop crying. Did I tell you to cry? No I didn’t, so stop crying.” And when I do cry he just looks at me with this blank expression on his face. I can’t even tell if he’s human at this point. And then he will shake his head and berate me, tell me that I’m worthless, that I should kill myself. He will call me a bitch, or a piece of trash. Then he will say, “Why am I even with you? Being with you is a waste of time and energy. You are a waste of space.” Another thing I’ve noticed in this relationship is that, and this is personal, but due to my past history of sexual childhood abuse, I have a very hard time being intimate. I especially have a hard time with oral sex, and he does not understand that. He will tell me when I say no, or I hesitate or I don’t do it right, that I’m living in the past, that I’m choosing not to be in present with him, and that if I truly loved him I’d just get over it. That I should be able to handle something like that by now since it’s been five years—and that by still struggling with it I’m not letting go of the past. He thinks because he is not the same person who hurt me that I should have no problem doing it. But, I just don’t know how much longer I can handle this. He gets triggered by the smallest of things, especially when something out of control happens— literally the fight we had tonight was because a tray of food fell out of the fridge and onto the floor, and he lost it. He completely turned into a monster over that little thing. Then he told me that that was just the tip of the iceberg, that there was more that he was upset about. He will scream at me that I’m not listening to him, and I just don’t understand what that means. Like, I am listening I’m listening to him scream at me. My ears are open, I’m using active listening. So why does he always say that? Why doesn’t he seem to care when I cry, or why does his face go blank when I show emotion— like sadness or fear. The thing is is that his abuse is like waves. Hours before our fight tonight he was being sweet, loving, and then that tray fell out of the fridge and he just blew up. Can someone please help me make sense of this? Because I’m so confused, and hurt, and sad, and I feel so hopeless…	Poet22d	post	21.15044807590256	female	White	0.9993140697479248	na	na	na	5	domesticviolence	no prediction.
"You partner is abusive and you should leave him at a minimum. That’s it there’s nothing deeper there. It’s confusing while you’re in the relationship because abusers know they won’t attract you if they’re overly abusive from the beginning. You can find a better relationship where you won’t feel afraid, confused, and having to google/post about your relationship to get a sanity check.

Edit: abusers will not become sweet, faithful, kind, fair, etc for longer than it takes to offset the violence. The good times are fake and it’s on purpose."	Poet22d	reply	na	na	na	0.9993140697479248	weak	no	no	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.
"This is abuse. He will not change for the better. Him being kind/sweet to you is all an act - he is only acting that way or give you hope, but ultimately to manipulate, control, and confuse you. If you stay in this relationship, he may kill you. You need to get out ASAP, and do so quietly and secretly. You have so much more life to live, and you deserve so much better.

"The saddest thing about all life OP, is that those who have suffered abuse are like a magnet for abusers.  And the bummer is always that our entire being is conditioned to believe that being abused is acceptable.

There is a part of you that knows that your partner is abusive and that he is a monster who will one day escalate to even worse abuse.  That part of you that had you come on to reddit and post, that part of you that wants out, that wants to run and protect your life.
Unfortunately this part of you is only by a tiny flame in a dark abyss, it is overwhelmed by the rest of you that is trapped in a cycle of abuse.

Even though you are aware that he is an evil monster that will most likely commit the unimaginable upon you at some point, you hold on to the false narrative that he is a good loving partner really.

OP I pray you find a way to get yourself out of this rut of a relationship, you do not at and ever deserve to be in an abusive relationship.  Your current man is a monster and you know it, save yourself, please.

I'm very happy for you.

I'm trying to go through the same process, but in a different way. I never got my ex's name on me, but he learned how to tattoo on me. I've spent quite a bit of money, so far, getting everything fixed up and improved. There are 2 that I really just want removed. One is a tattoo that matches his. It was an anniversary thing, that he later tainted, by doing our thing with his mistress.
The other, is of a (badly done) celebrity, that resembles his dead mother.

Back in April I(27f) recently got into a domestic violence situation with my child father. We was arguing and he started to beat me and in the process he kicked me in my eye and I ended up with a fractured eye. Although my eye has heal I still have a scar on my face and everytime I look at it I get so angry. I just feel so angry everytime I think about how he did me. It’s like I want revenge I hate feeling like some weak woman. I pressed charges on him and I have no contact with him and even though I’m focusing on moving on and taking care of my child I can’t help but to feel so much rage when I think about it. It’s like I want revenge I want him to get hurt like he has hurt me. I want him to get a bruise on his face so he knows what it feels like. I feel like a weak woman and I feel ashamed that I even stayed with a man like that. Everytime my child sees my face she always ask why did daddy do that? And I don’t know what to say. I am so angry and I want revenge but I know that is not right and I’m not even strong to fight a man. How do you let that anger go? Like how do I get over this because I know In the future I’ll have to coparent with this person eventually and I don’t want to block my child from her dad but I hate him and what he did to my face. I feel so angry and bitter after that experience and I just want to learn to let it go and move on.

"It has been my experience that before you can stop being angry, you have to get your own permission to *be hella angry.* Get vicious about it into a journal or vent to a support group. Own the fact that you have been *wronged* and you are damn well PISSED OFF about it. Anger only ever dissipates when the pressure to hold it in is relieved.

Anger is often a shield for grief, and once the anger is owned, acknowledged, and respected, then you can grieve the wrong done to you, and then there is a little peace."	Head-Government9551	reply	na	na	na	0.9857073426246643	no	strong	no	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.
"Hatred and resentment are the appropriate and expected response to being kicked in the face and seriously injured.

There is nothing wrong with resenting someone who committed a violent crime against you, and wanting revenge. This is the same feeling that prompts us to demand punishment for a crime, and the reason why we are outraged when a horrible criminal goes free. 

Anger is a nasty emotion to feel. But it is an important emotion. It is the emotion that prompts us to protect ourselves, rather than submit to abuse. I would be shocked, and a bit concerned, if you told us you weren't angry.

I don't know how you stop feeling angry. But I hope you realise that you're not doing anything wrong by being angry. You are allowed not to forgive someone, no matter what."	Head-Government9551	reply	na	na	na	0.9857073426246643	no	no	no	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.

Chasing down Hordies and killing them in Warcraft has done wonders to ease that pain.

"Things that haven’t worked for me:

-Nonsensical societal expectations of forgiveness 

-Just forcing it to stop because it’s not “acceptable”

Things that have worked for me:

-Being angry when I’m angry because i’m not going to hurt other people or do crimes. 

-Smugness that he’ll always be financially worse off and is absent from our child’s life. He’s missing out on all the baby milestones and when our child is old enough to ask me what happened the “who’s that” may turn into “what a loser.” “Who’s that” already hurts my abuser’s ego. 

-Legal validation of my situation: his charges are now convictions and family court has not given him visitation. Police, lawyers, judges think my life and my child’s life matter even if he doesn’t 

-After I move with my son, the anger from fear of him knowing where we live will reduce because I don’t have an internet presence to make stalking me easy. 

-Turning fear of him getting revenge into amusement that if he tries that I can kill him in self defense or send him back to jail. If the re-assault is that bad, self defense will be extra funny because he’s always threatened suicide but never followed through. Ruin/end their life potential is empowering even though not doing so out of turn to be law abiding is uncomfortable

"About two weeks ago my ex bf of 4 years physically assaulted me (slapped me, shoved me onto a table leaving bruises on my back, grabbed me by the throat) while extremely drunk. It wasn’t the first time he has done this but this time I was afraid he might seriously hurt me so I called the police. They arrested him and he went to jail for one night but the DA decided to not press charges. Days after the fight I filed for a restraining order and was granted a temporary one. 

On Monday his attorney called me asking if I would consider an out-of-court settlement instead of going through with the restraining order hearing which is set for three weeks from now. I talked to my attorney and the two of them talked. My attorney came back and said that my ex’s attorney is claiming that I was equally violent, which is absolutely not true (though I think I scratched him in self defense and he may be lying to his attorney saying this is what caused him to hurt me). I’m not sure what I should do. On one hand I can move forward with the hearing and court-ordered protection order but now am scared my ex will lie and say it was a mutual fight or I can get the agreement out of court where he agrees to not contact me and stay away and “guarantee” that I have some legal recourse if he ever does contact me again.

My lawyer says he has seen restraining order cases go in so many ways that it’s hard to guarantee whether the judge will grant it if my abuser will lie and say I attacked him first and has photos of scratches. He says it could be seen as mutual combat and that this judge can sometimes be tough to get restraining orders from.

Here’s what happen to me in a similar situation. My ex strangled me in front of my then 17 year old daughter. I got a temporary order of protection, and had to go to court to make the temporary order go longer than 30 days. My ex told the judge that I had attacked him first, and when he was choking me, it was only to keep me from injuring him. Judge asked him which way I was facing, towards him or away from him. Asked my daughter the same thing. They both said I was facing away from him. The judge told the ex the fact I was facing away from him indicated I was not attacking him, but I was fleeing from him, and he extended the OP for a year. Don’t worry too much about what your stbx is going to claim, the judge will have heard 1,000’s of cases just like yours, he won’t be fooled by his bullshit.

"I'm in Iowa and currently have what is called a stipulation/Protective Order by Consent.  It works exactly as a civil protective order except that a judge did not hear the case and make a finding of abuse, but rather my abuser agreed to abide the terms of a no contact order. 

If you have shared children, going through the hearing might prove more beneficial or less (if the mutual fight narrative wins the day), but if children are not at issue and the out of court settlement option gives you enforceable protection, I'm not sure what you gain from the hearing process. 

I did a hearing in 2021 (same abuser, I took him back), and he lied about physical abuse and his attorney was vicious. I did get a finding of abuse and protective order. I don't feel like the hearing was therapeutic or anything.

100% agree with you! OP, this won’t be the first or the last time the judge will have a lying abuser in his court room. If it were me I’d press for the protection order bc even if your ex claims you were also violent wouldn’t the best thing still be not allowing either of you within so close of the other?

I don’t want to use too much personal info here but my ex husband tortured me for years in every way possible until he was finally put in prison. Well I received a letter from the DOC saying he’s being released into my community in October. I still live in the same house that the traumas occurred in. I suffer from ptsd and agoraphobia because of it all and have been on disability. I’m terrified of him and I think the best option for my mental and physical wellbeing and safety would be to move out of town. The AG office approved me for moving assistance but it is reimbursement only. Does anyone know other ways to get help with moving? Thanks in advance.

"Has anyone asked for spousal support when divorcing from their abuser? I feel weird about it. My ex makes considerably more than I do and I’ve been struggling since we separated. We had investments that she made while we were married. She’s keeping them because it’s crypto and I can’t make heads or tails of it. My money was also used to make those investments, but I wouldn’t know how to manage it. I don’t know if it would just seem cash grabby to ask for spousal support? It also kind of makes my stomach turn to take her money. I also worry that then she’ll want to see the dogs (I kept the dogs, she kept the cat).

"I’m currently dating a (28M) who as of last year had his first manic episode. He used to smoke a lot of weed and ended up having a marijuana psychosis after I told him I wanted to break up. At that time, we were only dating for 2 months and I started noticing a lot of red flags so I wanted to end the relationship even though I was in love with him. He didn’t take it well and ended up disappearing for a week and had a manic episode. He got in trouble and was in jail for a week so I felt bad and contacted him again and since then we have been together for a year and 6 months now. I still get worried that he might have another episode if I break up with him and I think our relationship is so toxic. 

My therapist told me that dating a bipolar partner is always really hard but ignored her and everyone because I really love him. I’m starting to feel like I’m reaching my breaking point after all the physical and mental abuse and talking so poorly about my parents and my deceased brother. I also found out after 7 months of dating him of his pornography addiction and found some pictures on his phone asking a woman for nudes. He has never cheated physically but he caused me so much damage now. 

I tried to say I wanted to break up but he never takes it serious anymore because I keep forgiving him. I’m also attached to him so l’m not able to fully leave the relationship yet. Trauma bonding is REAL. Please share your experience and advise. Does it really better with them especially if they don’t want to  stay on their meds and still continue to smoke weed?

"Bipolar disorder is in no way an excuse to be an abusive person. I actually have bipolar disorder and while it has made my life very difficult, I do not abuse other people. I take my meds, I got to therapy and even if I do get depressed or manic, I don’t suddenly become abusive. 

Having any mental illness sucks but it’s still the responsibility of the person suffering (not anyone else) to do everything in their power to manage their illness. I also think that if someone is abusive while depressed or manic they are probably also abusive outside of that. Bipolar disorder can make someone more abusive but in all likelihood it means they already have a problem with being abusive to begin with if that makes sense. 

His bipolar disorder and him abusing you are two separate things. For things to get better he’ll need to tackle both of those things and from what you’ve described it sounds like he’s not interested in doing either of those things. 

I completely relate to how strong the trauma bond is and I’m really struggling with that myself too. I think something that helps me is to stop making excuses for the abusive behaviour. Despite having a mental illness myself, I blamed my partner’s abuse on his mental illness and kept making excuses for why he treated me so badly and hoped that things would change. 

But at some point, you’ve got to decide what’s more important, waiting and hoping for someone to change (which takes years of serious hard work) or taking the steps you need to in order to keep yourself safe and build a healthier life for yourself. That’s a very difficult decision and one I’m still struggling with too but no matter how hard we want to, we can’t make other people change if they’re not willing to put in the work."

Bipolar disorder does NOT make you an abuser or criminal. I am diagnosed with that and I wouldn’t dream of hurting or emotionally abusing a woman. He is using it as an excuse so he can manipulate you. You deserve so much better than this. Mental illness can be rough yes but you don’t need to subject yourself to abuse because he is struggling.

Also just wanted to add that even if he did somehow change (which again would take years of hard work and dedication), this relationship has caused you so much trauma. Would you really be able to live with someone who physically and mentally abused you and caused you so much pain? No amount of him changing will erase all the damage his abuse has already caused you, if that makes sense. The way he’s treated you will set the context for the rest of your relationship, even if it would get better in the future. No matter how much he changes, he’ll always be the man that hurt and abused you and I’m starting to realise for myself that that is something very difficult for me to live with, no matter how much I want things to get better.

 know I’m stupid so feel free to criticize me, but things aren’t physically dangerous for me with her for the most part. Physical violence from her escalated recently but it’s not that bad and I’m bigger and don’t usually get hurt. Sexual violence is different but I can sleep in the basement and lock the door. She says she’ll work on how she talks to me and treats me too. I just can’t handle my kids thinking I abandoned them and don’t love them anymore (they are seven and five and a little three month old baby and my wife told them this but I think they believe it) and I hate that she won’t let me have the baby AT ALL because he’s breastfed and she refuses to give me any milk. She said if I want my kids I shouldn’t have left her. But I didn’t leave them! Once I got an apartment and wasn’t essential homeless I was planning on getting joint custody if I could. But not anymore I guess because I had to come back. There was nowhere to go and I have to figure out finances because I have nowhere to live and more importantly can’t see my kids much if I don’t stay with her and i would do anything to have a relationship with them and make sure they are safe (she’s a good mom but i know DV is bad for kids to be around and is connected to child abuse so I’m worried). I have no family (no contact with parents due to severe abuse) my kids (and her) are completely it. I have no idea why I’m even posting because I’m being a loser and making my own stupid choices and don’t really deserve support for my stupid decisions.

Hey, regardless of what has happened you are a victim of abuse & still deserve support! Like the above commenter said, you did what you had to do for the time being. You’re in survival mode & are putting the wellbeing of your children above your own. Just please, if she gets violent or sexually assaults you PLEASE call the police! Start keeping a diary, write down every instance of abuse, even if it’s just verbal. Note the time, date & exactly what happened so in the future if you go to court you have proof of what’s been happening in your marriage. Good luck with everything but please don’t ever think you don’t deserve support just bc you’ve not managed to get away yet! Your time will come, you’ll escape eventually WITH your kids!!!!

"Hi OP, I'm proud of you for reflecting what is going on and making the best out of this situation for yourself and your kids.

If I have understood correctly, that you, OP, are male, make sure to record evidence when she becomes abusive again. Try to record sound, take pictures, perhaps even find a way to record video, have your bruises documented by your doctor.

As a male, you can apply for protection for yourself and your kids, but things will be a lot easier and clearer if you have evidence.

"I’ve often felt this way. As if speaking up is an invitation because it lets potentially the wrong people around me know that I’ve been blind to abuse in the past. Make no mistake, I think a lot of the worst people in the abuse mindset see the world as only 3 kinds of people: 

People who take what they want regardless (other abusers), people who do what they want with principles (saps/bleeding hearts to abusers), and people who get taken (victims for abusers).

Sometimes I feel like a lot of people who get abused are still doing all they can to never betray any amount of vulnerability. This may be why you’re getting scoffs and smug looks or noises (which really sucks btw I’m sorry). It could also be they don’t appreciate that abuse is relative to experience and they feel they have experienced more abuse than you, and so what you’re sharing pales in comparison to what they could. It does seem like the people who are dead silent are uncomfortable and they may either be intimidated by what you’re talking about or have no frame of reference for it.

Your story is yours, it has meaning and significance to you alone, but the reason why you’re in group therapy is to help support yourself and others in how you have this in common and you’re not alone in this respect.

"I wouldn't necessarily feel safe sharing my experiences in a group therapy setting. If it was a group specifically set up for survivors of domestic violence, then yes, but otherwise, absolutely not. 

Yes, abusers do seek out victims. Being abused in the past makes people vulnerable to being abused again. I was sexually abused when I was a child. I know for sure the paedo chose me to abuse because he knew my mother was abusive towards me. It's just kind of obvious to abusers when someone is vulnerable. I went on to marry a violent DV perpetrator/rapist. I didn't realise I was marrying almost a carbon copy of my mother in so many ways. My abusive ex even used the same derogatory terms to name-call me. 

Is there a charity organisation in your area that specialises in helping DV survivors that offers therapy? If so, I would reach out to them. It doesn't sound comfortable in the current therapy setting you are in. If there's a chance DV perpetrators etc could be in your group I would imagine you would not be able to share anything at all.

The only group therapy I felt truly helped, where I was completely comfortable and able to share freely and relax was The Freedom Programme. It was an incredibly healing experience realising that all our stories are so similar, that the behaviour of our exs is almost identical, their tactics textbook.

"Thank you so much for your response. I feel you are right on point with your first paragraph. 
And I believe you that it can be dangerous, talking to random people about abuse, even in a support group. Because I went through a lot of abuse first, starting with family and now I am grown-up, I feel like I have a lot to say and a lot of questions to ask and I bite my tongue sometimes so that I don’t over share unless I know the persons better. But even then it’s not full proof because my family abused me but they build that trust with me first and then they abuse me afterwards, so it’s very tricky and I feel anyone I build trust with could abuse me because of my experiences. But then, when I speak with other people, they say well anyone can turn against us and I feel like they’re coming from a place of general life thinking, whereas I experienced it deeper. So yes, again I agree with you that some people may not be safe to speak about abuse with.

I haven’t felt why do people judge without even knowing. Like for example obviously I’m not crazy, so why do people assume things about me when they haven’t even heard what I had to say? Previously, I could not stand up for myself because I was a child, and now people are holding it against me that if I was abuse, why didn’t I stand up for myself but I was scared and now that I’m an adult I’m in fear because I don’t want to be lured back in to abuse. And because I don’t give into the abuse, which is how I normally am, but because I was stressed as a kid, I had to be submissive in order to survive. Anyways, now my abusive family says they fear I may hurt myself, which is ridiculous. I feel that is a way to control me.
So now, when I see people and one person quickly tells me, the other person is crazy or negative things about the other person I think to myself I would this person tell me this so quickly and why does the other person act the way they do and not just believe the person who is telling me that this other person is crazy. Often times I find that people who quickly meet new people and says bad things about other people that they are actually the abusive one because they are trying to put the other person down quickly."

"Thank you. And I am sorry what you went through. I feel like I can relate to a portion of what you went through as well.

And also, I feel like all the other adult members of my family abuse, me too was because my mom also abuse me so they must’ve sensed that vulnerability. Now, my cousin is trying to reach out to hang out with me because we did not hang out much growing up because I was isolated and was seen as the weird one and their parents did not want my cousins to associate with me. My cousin said that people shouldn’t abuse me just because my mom was abusive towards me, but my cousins parents were also abusive towards and yell at me if I was abused, why weren’t my cousins abused then?

"They never give up. Even when they find a new supply. My ex is still doing it now with a new supply. He told my kids that he has a new girlfriend but he likes me better. He’s offered to help me with things but I will never allow him to help me because he would use that against me. 

From my own personal experience my ex  completed a perpetrator course and he minimised the abuse when I saw the report. He said he could see some coercion and emotional abuse but never admitted to the sexual, financial and physical abuse and blamed me. 

Gaslighting is when a person does or says something to question the victims sanity, memories, or perception of reality. So if you did talk to him first and he said you didn’t, then yes it would be gaslighting. 

Personally with an abuser I would keep my feelings to myself and work on my own self esteem and boundaries so I don’t put up with other peoples’ abuse and have the ability to walk away from toxic people."

He basically just said what everyone else is saying here, that if someone chooses to abuse me that’s their choice and the only thing that I’m responsible for is setting boundaries and holding firm to those boundaries.

"Hey, 
The Freedom programme does seem to have an online course available, though it's UK based, so maybe you might be able to access it. The mods seem to delete things I post with a link, so if you just do a search using the uk web address ending you should be able to find it. It's just thefreedomprogramme one word in a standard uk web address format.

My mother's family have shunned me for many years. Sometimes I think the same about my cousins but I have the same hesitation as you do. Would I end up with her family being flying monkeys and pollyanna enablers again? Probably. I don't know if it would be a bad mistake as none of them know where I live at the moment and that means my mother can't send her toxic psychotic letters. 
I'm sorry for what you went through too. Family is supposed to be a solid foundation of love and support. Not a nightmare you have to run from."	Newlywed2021	reply	na	na	na	0.9987190961837769	weak	no	no	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.
Thank you. I feel you are right on point and I can relate to you when your abuser offer you help. My abuser mom offered me help and abuser family yelled at me that I don’t received help or that I’m not help-able. Now they’re trying to say I might hurt myself or that they’ll send people out to me and drag me away and lock me up, which makes me feel more scared. I do therapy from shelter and apparently I’m ok, meaning I’m not going to hurt myself. My family just makes me feel scared because I feel they are trying to silence me saying or exposing them that they are abusive. But they chose to abuse me growing up, why adult blame child that has now grown (which is me), that’s so silly. I can’t seem to shake off fear of my family, they have isolated me in the past and my friends yelled at them and then my family yelled at me that my friends are bad (because they were standing up for me at a time I wasn’t ready to leave yet). Now I have no friends, because I didn’t leave as a kid and couldn’t explain to them exactly why. Now I left.

They do that to manipulate and control. They are flying monkies. Best way is to cut those people out of your life who support the abuser. I did this with all my exs family and friends, even one of my sisters because she travelled down south and saw my abuser and not me. She’s called me selfish, I agreed as being selfish is not that bad when we are protecting our own wellbeing. Sounds like you have some good friends. Sick up for what you believe, work on yourself, find out what you like and don’t like, do things that make you happy, learn to deal with your triggers, learn to cope with traumatic experiences, learn to love yourself, learn to trust your own mind. Being alone is a great skill to have because we are at peace with ourselves and silence is the best response to those who do not respect personal boundaries.

"I received my first abuse order two years ago and he has managed to push the divorce back a few times and it has been delayed and just…a long process.

"September 11, 1995- December 12, 2022

For those of us close to Sky, the pain has been immense and complex. Though these words and this post are to honour her life and not our loss.

She had a story to share, and as her friends we want to fulfill Sky’s legacy. We would first like to memorialize who she was as a human.

Her heart was as big and bright as her smile. She went through so much healing and growth in her lifetime, gifting her with deep compassion and empathy for others. She was wise and incredibly intelligent.

After graduating high school a year early with a double dogwood, she attended Camosun College and completed the Education Assistant and Community Support program. She went on to work for several years as an Educational Assistant in a life skills classroom. She was a supportive advocate for those in her care.

She returned to Camosun College, completing first year studies in Electrical, Mechanics, Heavy Duty Mechanics and Carpentry. She received an award for the highest overall combined theory and practical marks. In these male-dominated trades, she used her voice to speak up against sexism, misogyny, racism and homophobia, that harmfully occurred everyday.

During the last year of her life, she took on a community support role at the Cool-Aid Society. She wholeheartedly engaged within her community; She held so much space for those she connected with and made folks feel truly heard and seen.

Beyond work and education, she loved to go for drives, be in nature, forage for mushrooms, camp, have fires, go out to dance and see live music, as well as regularly playing tabletop RPG’s with friends. She did a lot of self learning and knew so much. She was creative and expressive. She valued time in her own company and time spent with friends.

Those of us who were close to her, have memories of who she was as a friend. She was kind, funny, genuine, generous, fun, loving, supportive, caring, understanding, as well as everything else mentioned above. We have memories of fun adventures and shenanigans, laughter, love, hugs, time together in nature, sharing in happiness and successes, and supporting each other during the darkness. She meant a lot to many people. She was an incredible and inspiring woman who impacted the hearts of all those she connected with. We’re missing her here with us so much and words aren’t enough. 

Sky also endured abuse and trauma in her life by the hands of family members, who were supposed to be her care-givers as a child and keep her safe. In the last 10 months of her life she was trapped in an abusive relationship. She did not deserve the pain and suffering she experienced. No one deserves any abuse. Yet this is an awful reality for so many people, an experience that is far too common.

She attempted to reach out to police for support and protection, but because there was no concrete evidence, she was left vulnerable and in fear. She ended her life to escape an abusive relationship.

Sky was a passionate advocate for the Moose Hide Campaign, an indigenous led organization in support of ending violence against women and children.

During the last week of her life, she typed a document titled “My Name is Sky”, that she wanted to be shared. Her hope was to bring awareness to Bill C-202 ‘An Act to Amend the Criminal Code (controlling or coercive conduct).

So much hate, harm and hurt in the world. It feels hopeless, though for the love and life of Sky and the many who can relate to her story, we have to stay strong. Be an ally and a voice, stand up and speak out. It can’t be done alone, we need to connect and be in community to have any hope for change.

Our hearts are heavy with grief and sorrow with the loss of Sky. We love and miss you endlessly, sweet soul.

Sky's Story: My Name is Sky

My name is Sky, I am a 27 year old female in Victoria BC. My childhood wasn't exactly white picket fences and I was placed into foster care at the age of 12. I went on to graduate high school a year early and then took the Community Support and Education Assistant program that eventually lead me to working with youth with diverse abilities for several years in a life skills program. I then went back to college and took four separate first year trades programs, Automotive, Electrical, Carpentry, and Heavy Duty Mechanics. Next I became employed as a Mental Health Worker which is what I have been doing for the past year. However, that is not what this story is about, this story begins 10 months ago. This is not the story but rather my story and I say that because I recognize that everyone has their own personal truths based on their own perceptions. That being said my story is based entirely on facts and truth and I will try my best to refrain from injecting my emotions into this recount of events. 

On the evening of January 5th 2022 I began talking to a man on a popular dating app. In the early hours of January 6th he suggested we go on our first date to Mount Washington to go snowboarding. He picked me up about an hour later and we went and spent the day together then returned to Victoria. Over the next few weeks we would meet up frequently, usually with me going over to the place he was staying at. During that time, we were both attending the same college for different trades programs. 

On February 11th he had his last day of class and two days later he would be returning to a town a few hours away where he resided. On the evening of February 11th while we were in his truck he told me that he wanted to be with me, that he was going to quit his job and move to Victoria in a few months to be with me and asked me if I would be his girlfriend. At this point I was completely smitten with him and was more than excited to be his partner, he promised to call me every day and that he would move to Victoria as soon as he could. 

Two days later on February 13th he left to return to his home town and when he arrived he sent a text saying 'I did some thinking on my drive the only thing I would change about you is your last name'. I was elated, I had met a wonderful man and I couldn’t stop telling all of my friends and coworkers how happy and hopeful I was. Over the next several months I would take a bus to his home town for a night every couple of weeks to see him. On either March 21st or 22nd we had posted our relationship on a social media platform. On March 23rd I received a Facebook message from a woman telling me her friend had slept with him that previous week, I sent my partner the message and he told me that it was not true but rather it was a friend of his ex girlfriend and that his ex girlfriend was upset to find out he was with someone new and had asked her friends to send me messages saying he was cheating. On March 25th I received a message from his ex girlfriend saying 'Just so you know I was in (insert my partners name) bed when you were on the phone with him the other day so hopefully you have the open relationship he's always wanted and good luck he cheated on me the whole relationship'. I showed this message to my partner as well, which he again denied the accusations. March 26th I got another message from a different female claiming to have slept with him, and again another from another person on March 27th. He denied all the allegations stating that it was just a ploy from his ex partner to have me leave him. 

At this stage I had no reason to not believe him and I replied to all the women saying that I trusted my partner and that I believed he did not do the things they were claiming. Finally, he had finished his time at his place of employment and was ready to move to Victoria and move into my apartment until we found a new one together. I wanted to start our cohabitation off in a fun way and booked two cabins for us to stay at from May 3rd to May 6th. After our little retreat we came back to Victoria and began living together on the afternoon of May 6th. At the time I was living in a 900$ all inclusive studio apartment that was directly across the street from my place of employment and very close to my friends. We decided to apply for an apartment that was older but was only a 7-minute walk from my work since I don’t drive, it was close to my friends, and it was a decent price. 

On June 20th we left for a road trip to the interior of BC to visit his family. While on this trip I received an email from my work with a job posting. My partner encouraged me to take the job because at the time I was working 6 days a week, 12 hour shifts and he told me he didn’t move to Victoria to not be able to spend time with me. He told me that although I would be taking a more than 50% pay cut to my income that it would be what was best for our relationship and that because he made 'good money' I wouldn’t have to worry financially and that we would pay for our new apartment equitably based on our income. I applied for the job and ended up getting it. 

During that trip my partner ended up doing cocaine for three days straight from June 23rd until June 26th. I began to see a side of my partner that I had not yet seen, he began making belittling comments and had a few angry verbal outbursts directed at me. On the morning of June 26th he was in tears and began profusely apologizing to me. At first I thought he was apologizing because we had an agreement that he was only going to do cocaine one day of the trip, but as the morning went on he continued to apologize without saying what for. Eventually I asked him if something had happened after I had gone to bed the night before, that was when he told me that he had an addiction to cocaine and that just prior to moving to Victoria he was spending approximately 600$ a week on this habit. I asked how I could support him and he said he didn’t want to get any support at that time but that he was going to stop doing it and that he wanted me to just ask him every day how he was feeling about his sobriety.

On June 27th we were headed back to Victoria, he told me he was going to drop me off at home then head to his old home out of town to help a family member and he would be back in Victoria the following day. That was when I told him that since he was not going to be home that evening I was going to see some friends at a pub to watch a live band. He then told me that I had misunderstood him and that he was actually going to be home with me that night and that if I wanted to go to a pub that I wasn’t the type of girl he wanted to be with and that we 'wanted different things in life'. He then told me we were broken up. 

A few hours later we got to the ferry terminal and as we waited for our ferry he went into the terminal and I sat in the truck separating our belongings into our respective bags. A few moments later he came running out of the ferry terminal, opened my door and apologized saying the he loved me and wanted to be with me and that he would do better and that he had only broken up with me because of the multiple days of cocaine use. 

On June 30th we received an offer for an apartment at the building that we had applied for, and that same day I received an email from my landlord at that time saying that he received a call as a reference for another apartment and stated that he didn’t want to lose me as a tenant and offered my self and my partner an apartment in a different building. This apartment was brand new and therefore more expensive and it was a one hour walk from my work and my friends. However, it was right next to the place my partner wanted to eventually get a job at. He told me that if we accepted this apartment instead that he would drive me to work every night and since we were going to be paying equitably I would still only be paying around as much as I had at my current apartment at that time. That same day we accepted the offer for the newer, more expensive apartment. 

On July 14th we moved into our new apartment, we split the first months rent and deposits evenly, including a pet deposit as we wanted to get a dog, and we did this because at that time he had yet to start his job in Victoria so it would be the following month that we would begin to pay equitably. 

About week into living in our new apartment he came home from work one afternoon and asked me for a hug and began crying, I asked him what was wrong and he began to say the he had ruined his life and ruined our life and that he was terribly sorry. When I asked what he meant that was when he told me that he was approximately 40 thousand dollars in debt and that he wouldn’t be able to pay for more than half the bills. I told him that we were a team and together we would look at his finances and figure everything out and get his debt paid off. 

August 19th he took me to his family's annual family campout, I met many of his family members, and he made small mentions to me about marriage and kids, the well respected patriarch of his family made a lovely speech welcoming into the family. When we left to return home on August 21st he took my hand in the truck and told me that his heart felt so full, that he had a beautiful girlfriend, an amazing apartment and that he couldn’t ask for anything more. 

The evening of August 21st I was sent a message from a woman that I didn’t see until August 23rd that said 'Hey pretty lady! (insert partners name) told me he was in an open relationship and I'm not sure that its true? I really don’t want to encourage cheating..'. I told this woman that we were not in an open relationship and she proceeded to tell me that they had been talking for months and showed me some of their text messages where he said things such as; 'And she isn’t into knowing about my business I can explain better in person but she had some bad stuff happen in her past and we have a good connection just not in the bedroom', 'She had a few horrible things happen to her she has some bad PTSD some times its good some times its bad but sex is hard her (for) her sometimes', 'She is a really smart person and who's (who knows) what she can and cannot offer in a relationship'. I sent my partner screen shots of my conversation with this woman that day while he was at work and he did not respond. When he came home he asked me what I wanted to do, I asked to see the messages and he told me he had already deleted them on his way home. I then told him that I was going to the liquor store and we were going to drink and not talk about it until tomorrow because I needed time. I went and got alcohol, within an hour he was drunk and throwing up in the bathroom and went to bed.

Later that evening when he woke up he was apologizing profusely, crying and hitting him self in the head, screaming into a pillow saying he was so disappointed in him self and that his mother would be too. The following day when I asked him why he did it he told me that he had been thinking about it and he thought he did it because a year after his mother passed away when he was now 18 he began sleeping with two of his mother's best friends, and that the woman he had been talking to was the same age as his mother and that older women were a 'safety blanket' for him. He also said that he was never going to actually sleep with her but that he just liked the idea of it. Having trauma of my own I sympathized with what he went through after his mothers passing. I agreed to try and make things work with the condition that he would get counselling to which he agreed. He never got counselling. 

Two weeks later on September 3rd we went to his hometown to visit his family, that evening he told me that when he was talking to his friend who now knew about his infidelity, that he told his friend that I was the woman he would spend the rest of his life with because instead of just condemning him for his actions I was instead asking why it had happened and trying to help him. The following day he was in an unpleasant mood, to the point where he walked out on breakfast in a restaurant and ignored me for most of the day. Part way through the day I decided to take a walk down by the ocean, he tried to call me a couple of times but I did not answer. When I returned to the property he began yelling at me asking me where I went and saying 'this shouldn’t be this hard!' he then through the tape measure he was holding and walked off saying 'take a fucking bus back to Victoria!'. A few minutes later I went down to the house where he was seated in the kitchen, I told him that I didn’t know what was going on with him but that he needed to stop pushing away the people that love him. He apologized for his behaviour and gave me a hug saying he would do better. 

That evening as we were laying in bed I told him that I wanted to spend my birthday that was coming up in a few days alone doing some self care. He began yelling at me saying that I wasn’t considering his feelings and he broke up with me. I decided I needed to get out of there at that moment and was ready to walk through the country for hours to the nearest highway to hitchhike home. I went and sat in the truck to charge my phone so I would have a flashlight and eventually realised I was too afraid to make that walk at that time of night alone. I returned to the home where he apologized and told me that I was the love of his life and that he knew it from our very first date when I wrapped my arms around his as he drove me home. 

We had intercourse that night, I was not on birth control and he was aware of it, we had many conversations about it and that neither of us had intentions of having a child at that point. Without my consent and without letting me know, he ejaculated inside of me. When he pulled out I asked him if he had, to which he said yes and when I asked why he said 'Because I don’t want to lose you'. 

On September 21st I was preparing all our camping gear because later that afternoon I would be leaving to go for a weekend camping trip at a beach near my partner's family property with two of my girlfriends and my partner to celebrate my birthday and my friend's birthday. It was planned weeks in advance that I would be driving up with my two girlfriends and that he would be driving up alone. He arrived home from work an hour before I needed to leave to meet my girlfriends and he told me that he wanted me to drive with him instead of with my friends, I told him I couldn’t because we had already made arrangements and I was supposed to help my girlfriend pack up her vehicle. He began screaming and crying saying that if I couldn’t do this for him it meant that I did not love him. Once again he broke up with me. We loaded my stuff into his truck and as he was taking me to my friends place he asked me to send him all of the photos from our relationship. I told him I would do it when I had time but I wasn't in the space to do it right then. He then asked that I send him a photo I had taken of him so he could change his Facebook picture from one of us to the one he was asking for. Again I told him I would do it later and that if he wanted the photo sooner that it was on my Facebook and he could get it there. He pulled the truck over and began pulling all of my stuff out onto the street yelling at me that if I didn’t send him the picture he would leave me and my stuff there. I sent him the picture and he put my stuff back in the truck and took me to my girlfriends. 

While on the camping trip he told me that he was moving out. He rented a room in someone's house and would be gone when I returned. When I got home I asked him to come back which he did and gave up the room he had rented by telling the landlord that his 'ex girlfriend' (me) was in the psychiatric ward and that he needed to take care of my apartment for me. The man he rented the room from did not return his damage deposit saying that he didn’t have the money but that he would return the deposit when he rented the room to someone else. Over the next two and half months my partner sent this man several texts with veiled threats and went to his house three separate times threatening to smash out all of his windows if he didn’t pay him. The last time he went to threaten him he returned home and told me what had happened, I told him I was disappointed because we had talked about getting his money back in a civil and legal way. Later that afternoon while I was with him he received a call from someone asking about the incident, my partner denied everything and was told he wouldn’t be contacted again about the incident. When he got off the phone he told me he was still going to do it, I told him he shouldn’t especially since the man had texts to prove that my partner had been threatening him. My partner said that he knew people and ways to do it without the police finding out. 

On September 23rd he texted me saying 'I want to get tattoos today if your (you're) in' 'I love you and I'm going to spend the rest of my life with you your (you're) my sole (soul) mate'. That day we got matching 'I love you' tattoos in each others writing. Later that same day I went to take some money out of my savings tin I kept in my closet and found 600 dollars missing, he confessed that he took the money to rent the room during my birthday weekend but that it wasn’t stealing since I had told him previously that if he ever needed to borrow money that I would help him.  

Between then and October 5th I would end up catching him having several other conversations with women that were less than appropriate. Each time he would apologize saying it would never happen again and I would believe him. During those weeks anytime I would ask to talk about our relationship he would immediately begin screaming and break up with me for reasons such as not cooking enough, or cleaning enough, or not having a routine which he said I was 'incapable of' and tell me that I am a 'monster' but also that I am 'perfect' and that I was like 'heroin' to him to then only tell me that he still wanted to be with me. He would always cut me off mid sentence but force me to listen to him by yelling which he told me in a text that 'I have been conditioned my entire life to be yelled at you're the first person I have ever met that communicates like you in my life and I can't be it or be around it with out feeling a little bit casted away'. 

On October 5th I wanted to try and change the mood a bit so I woke up early and told him I would have a surprise for him when he got home. I went and got all his favourite snacks and drinks and built a blanket fort in the bedroom and made him dinner. Half an hour before he was due to get home I went to do the dishes and found a cup with pink lipstick on it, I looked in the garbage and found a used condom. When he got home I showed him his surprise then handed him the cup with the used condom in it and asked him to leave. He left and while he was gone I posted on my Facebook that he had been cheating on me, I deleted the post five minutes after posting it however it was up long enough that someone saw it and sent it to an ex partner of his. His ex partner then sent me a message saying that for several years she dealt with the exact same type of behaviour. An hour or so later he returned to our home and he yelled 'you really want to know what happened? It was a tranny! I've never told anyone that!'. That evening then became about how he was bisexual and that he was 'disgusted' with himself for not being straight rather than it being about the fact that he had cheated on me with someone in our bed while I was at work. Again he kept apologizing and saying that it would never happen again and that he was going to make it up to me and earn my trust back. 

On October 10th before taking me to work he told me how much he loved me and that he was glad we were still trying to work things out. After getting to work I called him a couple of times as I usually would on smoke breaks but he never answered. Around an hour later he called me saying that he had fallen asleep. Within the next hour I would get a message from a woman asking if I was dating my partner. I asked her why she was asking and she told me that she had just been at 'his' place and had just had sex with him and that he had told her that his ex girlfriend just hadn’t come to collect her things yet but she found it odd that all of my stuff was in the apartment and so she tracked me down on Facebook. I told her he was my boyfriend and that it was in fact our apartment. I immediately sent the messages to my partner and he began denying all of it. I asked the woman for details that he wouldn’t be able to deny. She was able to describe everything in my apartment and bedroom, the type of condom he used, and how he was during intercourse. He still not only denied all of it but texted me 'I'm just fucking mad that she lied I want to beat this bitch with a fucking pipe' 'do your self a favour and stop fucking messaging her' 'I'm so fucking mad' I don’t know what to say I just want to make this better and I can't' 'I want to heart (hurt) this girl for doing this'. He never admitted to sleeping with her. 

The next day he texted me 'I know I deserve what I'm feeling I just feel sick with my self' 'and I don’t like the man I em (am) I know I can do better I just don’t know where this is coming from, I know I'm stressed out but why is it coming out this way I'm so sorry sky I hurt you now and I'm (in) the past'. Again I stayed with him except this time on the condition I could look at his phone. When I looked at his phone I found out that on February 17th, seven days after asking me to be his girlfriend, when he was on an out of town job he had another woman living with him that also thought she was his girlfriend, he had slept with several other women, slept with two paid escorts, had sent one of my full nude photos to a friend of his, and while I was on my birthday camping trip he had one of his ex girlfriends staying in my apartment with him and he had taken a video of them having sex in our bed which he sent to a friend. Over the next while I would continually catch him messaging more women, often saying he was messaging his boss and changing the women's names to men's names in his phone. 

On November 4th I had plans to go to a concert with my best friend, just prior to leaving my partner begged me to cancel with my friend and to take him instead. I told him I didn’t feel right doing that. He began screaming and crying saying that if I loved him I wouldn’t go without him. I tried to get him a ticket as well but they were sold out at this point. While I was at the concert he sent me messages saying things like 'I really need to talk to you when you get home I feel like absolute garbage right now and I'm really tired of feeling like this'. I left the concert early and told him I was coming home; he was waiting for me outside when I arrived which was unusual. When we got into the apartment he broke up with me again saying I was a monster and a terrible girlfriend among other things. As I went to go leave the apartment at approximately 12:20am on November 5th, I told him in spite that I wouldn’t be keeping his secret about his sexuality. I got to the elevator on our floor and he came out of the apartment completely naked running down the hall, he ripped my rain jacket open, grabbed the top of my coat with both hands, I then reached for the door to the stairwell. He pulled me into the stairwell and held me over the stairs screaming in my face 'who are you going to tell?!' each time I responded saying 'let me go'. After asking 4 or 5 times who I was going to tell he let me go and I ran down the stairs. A few days later he admitted to me that for a moment he considered throwing me down those stairs. 

Fast forward to the end of November, when I first starting dating this man he asked me 'how can I win you over' and I told him that it wasn’t really about winning me over but that it was about winning over my best friend. Since I haven’t had contact with any family members in nearly a decade my best friend is my only family. For weeks he would talk excitedly about getting to meet my best friend and eventually after a few months I introduced the two. After the introduction my partner told me that he now understood our relationship and that my best friend really was like my brother. They would even hang out some times with out me which I thought was really nice. However, as time went on my partner began hating my best friend saying he hated the value my friend held in my life. Slowly over time I would talk to and see my friend less and less. On several occasions my partner asked that I stopped being friends with him entirely and at one point it became a condition of our relationship that I were to have no contact with my friend. And any time I went to see any of my other friends he would scream and cry saying that I was making him feel lonely if I went and would beg me to stay or threaten to end the relationship. 

Every year for the last 7 years I have gone to my friends Christmas work party, my partner was very upset by this. My partner told me that I could go to my friends' birthday party but not the Christmas party. The week leading up to my friends' birthday party I asked my partner several times if he wanted to come to which he declined but said he wanted to pick me up from the event. On November 26th I went to the party, at midnight I messaged my partner that I was soon to be ready for a ride, he didn’t reply. I sent another message a half hour later with again no reply and I took a taxi home. When I got home I was afraid he had ignored my messages because he was mad at me. So I sat on the couch for an hour then eventually went to bed. When I got into the bed my partner woke up abruptly saying 'Sky?! Sky?! Why didn’t you message me?!' I told him that I had but he didn’t answer so I took a taxi. He immediately began screaming and accusing me of being with other men sexually at the party. He continued coming in and out of the bedroom screaming. He then grabbed my friends' guitar that was next to the bed and took it to the living room and began smashing it then went to bed on the couch. 

The next morning, I woke up to a note apologizing and my friend woke up to a text from my partner apologizing for breaking his guitar and saying he would replace it. I didn’t speak to him for the entirety of that day, in the past he had done things to harm me but this was the first time he had done something to a friend of mine. 

The following day I asked him if he wanted to talk, he again apologized and said that he wanted to be with me, that night we had sex and he again ejaculated inside of me without warning and without consent and when I asked him why he replied 'its my birthday gift to my self'. The next night, November 29th, he came home from work and we had sex again, once again he did not pull out and when I asked him why he was doing that he said it was because he figured I would just get an abortion if I got pregnant. I went and had a shower and when I returned to the bedroom he was on his phone and quickly changed the screen. I asked who he was texting and he said his boss, I asked to see his phone which he agreed but I could see him deleting things before handing it over. As I held his phone a text came through saying something along the lines of 'ill head over after 7, what's your addy?'. When I asked who it was he said it was probably a wrong number. I told him I wasn’t an idiot and knew that wasn’t true to which he admitted he was going to have someone over but he was going to cancel however he just hadn’t gotten the chance to do it yet. I messaged the number back saying it was his girlfriend and that she would not be receiving our address. At this time, I had to leave for work. He began apologizing and I told him it was not the time to talk because I didn’t have anything nice to say, we went to his car in silence. As he drove me to work I asked to see his phone. He gave me his phone and again I found countless messages with other women about meeting up for sex. I also found several messages where he was telling women that I was a monster of a human being and that he hated me. As I began to read out his messages to him he began screaming at me that it was my fault, he rammed his car into a curb and yelled at me to get out. He drove up the street then came back apologizing and asked me to get in, I ignored him. He then drove up the street then parked as he realized I still had his phone, he came towards me telling me to give him his phone. I threw it up the street and then ran to my work. When he got home he sent me a video apologizing and sent me screen shots of messages he had sent the other women saying that he wasn’t going to talk to them anymore and wanted to be with me and loved me. 

That night, November 29th, at work I typed up a letter telling him that I was leaving him, I got home in the morning on November 30th, after he had gone to work and went to bed hiding the letter in my purse. I woke up before he got home placed the letter out for him to see and went to my work 5 hours early to be safe. 

The following night he told me he was moving out and I said thank you. The next day he took most of his belongings and when I asked him why he had done everything he did, he began blaming it on me, that I wasn’t a good partner for various reasons, he said that he never loved me, that he didn’t care about the cheating, and that it didn’t bother him that he cheated. I asked him if he had any compassion to which he replied 'for you? None'. I then called a friend to stay with me as he was refusing to give me his keys. 

The next day, December 3rd, he came and took the rest of his belongings. After he finally had nothing left in the apartment I looked around and found that he had thrown all my family photos around in our storage, bent my vibrator in half, and had smashed my iPad which he knew was the only item I had to sell to be able to afford rent on my own the next month. 

The following day, December 4th, I called the non emergency police line and filled a report for the physical abuse. That night I received a call from an officer who asked me what had happened, he told me he would contact my partner then he would do a formal interview with me. He called me back later that evening saying that my partner had a very different version of events, that my partner expressed that he was very much done with me and therefor he would not be looking any further into charges nor would I be getting a peace bond. He was however going to have my partner return the keys for the apartment to the police station the following day. December 6th I spoke with someone who was aware of my on going situation. December 7th that person gave me a number of a police officer who they thought may be able to provide me with more support, I called that officer that day, he looked into the file and told me he couldn’t do anything for me because my partners record was one of the cleanest he had ever seen without so much as a traffic violation. Both officers expressed that my ex partner had said that he was so done with me that I didn’t have anything to be concerned about. However, I've watched my partner hold onto anger towards people for months on end, I listened to him tell me all the ways he wanted to injure other people or cause damage to their property.

In summary, my income has been cut in half, my bills have more than doubled, I was moved further away from my friends and community, I was emotionally abused and manipulated, I was physically abused. I have missed 96 hours and 45 minutes of work due to stress since the first time I found out he was cheating on August 23rd up until the time he moved out of our apartment. My internet has been cut off and my power is soon to be cut off. My personal property has been damaged beyond repair. I live in constant fear, I've changed my phone number, I've the routes I walk to and from work, I have people stay at my apartment while I work to make sure he doesn’t show up and harm my animals, I duck tape my door lock when ever I'm home alone, I have night terrors that he is breaking in, I look out my peep hole every time I hear the elevator ding, I'm immediately anxious when I see a vehicle that looks like his. I know that many people will question why I am making my experience public and question my motives for doing this. I would like to note that I have not used his name, or named his home town, nor have I named anyone else involved. This is not about him. Am I angry? Yes, in fact I am livid. And the reason for my anger is that so many people, women in particular are going through or have gone through what I am going through. It took me months before I even realized I was being abused and by then I was too scared to leave, because I felt like all I had was him regardless of how I was being treated and even if I had the courage to leave I was financially stuck. Many people will ask why I didn’t leave earlier or why I didn’t report the physical violence on the night of the attack, emotional abuse in nature makes the victim feel like these are not safe or viable options. 

I am making my story public; I am opening my self up to the scrutiny of other people because this needs to change. Abusers will often not change their behaviour and they will continue to abuse more and more people as time goes on. I don’t want vengeance, I want change, I want reform, I want better protection and legal options for victims of this type of abuse. Apart from the actual moment of physical abuse on November 5th, I have text messages, bank statements, emails, work time logs, and other pieces of proof that every statement I have made that is associated with a date in this recount has happened. What I do not have, what other victims of abuse do not have is the law on their side to help them rebuild their lives but I need help, I am hoping that someone somewhere who reads this will be able to help me. I am aware of Bill C-202 is ‘An Act to amend the Criminal Code (controlling or coercive conduct)’ however I have only become aware of it after hours of online searches for anything to help me, there needs to be a bigger awareness and discussion about this. 

8This is all of our problem, I believe every person knows someone who has been emotionally abused in a partnership whether they are aware of it or not. And I am not saying that I am a perfect person, I have moments that I am not proud of from our relationship but there is a difference between regrettable behaviour and behaviour that has a long lasting and damaging financial, physical, emotional and psychological impact on a person."	flyskyhyy	post	28.34785537283286	male	White	0.002117329044267535	na	na	na	58	domesticviolence	failed

"Hey flyskyhyy,

I am so sorry you lost your dear friend. I felt so many complex emotions reading Sky's story. I wish it could have been different and that she'd had the support she needed to climb out of the hopelessness her ex inflicted on her. I'm so sorry. 

Her compassion and kindness shines through: I can see it in her eyes that she was such a warm hearted person. Her compassion shines through in her words and it's all the more heartbreaking that the bastard who abused her used that compassion to manipulate, coerce, control, abuse and ultimately destroy her. 

So much of her story is familiar to me as a DV survivor. She would have made an amazing support worker for DV survivors. I hope the words she left bring much needed change to make laws which protect people who are going through what she went through. I hope her words save lives. 

When I open this sub and read the stories of people going through DV, I sometimes question why I do it. Because it sometimes opens up old wounds I thought I'd buried. Sky's story was more distressing than anything I've seen here before, because she's not here to offer hope to, that things can get better. But also because there are so many similarities in our stories. But there always are. Always.

I am so fucking angry on her behalf. First, that an intimate partner could put so little value on her existence. But also because the police COULD have helped. And didn't. 

Nobody asks for a restraining/protection order without needing one. It's not a big ask. It's just a bit of paperwork to the police but for someone going through domestic abuse, it's sometimes the difference between life and death.

I'd completely forgotten. Then I read Sky's words: 

Just like Sky told her violent, abusive ex, I remember telling my violent, abusive ex, so many times, ""Please don't push the people who love you away"". Trying to understand his outbursts of horrendously abusive words. I just wanted him to be okay. I understand that. I know most of us on here do. But it's almost impossible for someone who hasn't been through DV to understand. My ex also tried to make me pregnant through similar means (he somehow managed to take the condom off so I didn't notice. He then ejaculated in me. He held the empty condom up afterwards and laughed). I was horrified and upset, but didn't understand at the time that it was a typical tactic used by abusers. He used very similar tactics to those used by Sky's abuser, to convince me not to leave after this had happened.

I think Sky's story should be made into a small booklet and given to school students as part of educating them to know the red flags of DV. 

If I had known to recognise the red flags of an abuser, if Sky had known...

Wishing you the best of luck in getting this expanded protection bill passed. I don't live in Canada, but I'll have a think about anything I can do to help."	flyskyhyy	reply	na	na	na	0.002117329044267535	strong	strong	no	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.

"First of all, thank you very much for posting Sky's story.  As I read it, I had plenty of questions to ask but I was able to narrow them down to two.

&#x200B;

1. For any ladies that have dated guys like Sky's boyfriend, have you two ever made it happily ever after?  I mean, years later with your kids running around you, does your husband tell your friends that none of this would have been possible if you hadn't been so patient and understanding through all the abuse and that beating his drug addiction, sex addiction, etc. to become the man of your dreams was just a matter of smiling through the tears, blood, and bruises?
2. Could the best friend have done more?  If so, what?"	flyskyhyy	reply	na	na	na	0.002117329044267535	weak	no	no	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.

"Thank you very much for sharing your story as well.  I would like to ask you some questions, if you don't mind.  

While you were in your relationship, if I had shown you Sky's story would you have been able to realize the situation you were in or would you think I was insulting your ex by making you think he's as bad as Sky's boyfriend?  

When you looked at Sky's story and the best friend was mentioned, did you think he did enough?  If so, why?  If not, what could he have done?  

One last point, and I MEAN NO OFFENSE AND I APOLOGIZE IN ADVANCE IF YOU ARE OFFENDED.  Using Sky's story as an example, you said that you didn't recognize the red flags.  You also mentioned,  ""... it's almost impossible for someone who hasn't been through DV to understand.""  Let's say you're going through an abusive relationship, and I'm a friend that hasn't been through DV.  Now, I'm not saying it's a license to sit on the sidelines.

In the US I was able to get my protection order on the basis of coercive control and harassment and had never been physically abused by my partner. In other states the bar is so much harder to clear before they take you seriously. But coercion limits a person's freedom and liberty before they may ever feel fear and is an important element in helping victims out of their situations. Thank you for bringing attention to this very important element of abuse and for sharing Sky's story.

I knew Sky personally. There was never a chance for happily ever after with her ex. This guy is not capable of “happily ever after” and it’s more likely there will be more women like Sky who are victimized by him. It’s a pattern and his behaviour after her death was ghastly as well. For the record, her best friend genuinely did the best he could. All her friends did.

"Thank you so much for your kind words; very very much appreciated.

Education about DV is so important.If only everyone had school education about how to recognise signs of abuse, and how to extricate themselves from an abuser early on in the relationship. One of the things I notice so often is a survivor saying""I didn't realise for a long time that I was being abused."" It's especially hard for people to admit to themselves that they're being abused by the person they fell in love with, because, of course, they don't want it to be true: they remember who the person initially showed themselves to be, and it doesn't tally with how they're being treated now. Then the abuser realises they might lose their victim and puts on the same persona that the victim first fell in love with. Relief sweeps though the victim: thank goodness: everything's going to be okay, they think. Their partner was just ""having a bad day/suffering mental health problems"". Then the abuser starts again. It's a psychological nightmare, but there is a very distinct pattern to it, with common (almost universal) tactics and techniques to control, dominate and brainwash the victim into believing that it's the victim's fault. The victim starts walking on eggshells around the abuser. It's a nightmare to live through, and because the victim loves the abuser, it's incredibly difficult to cope with emotionally.

I went on something called The Freedom Programme. I don't know if it's available in Canada, but it was absolutely brilliant. The book that goes with that course is called ""Living with the Dominator"". It's a very helpful resource. The book and course were created by Pat Craven.

Thank you."	flyskyhyy	reply	na	na	na	0.002117329044267535	strong	strong	no	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.
"Hey, 
I think if I had read Sky's story in the beginning stages of my relationship, it would have rung massive alarm bells for me. I understand what you mean about thinking others who are trying to help are insulting their partners and acting defensive towards their partners. It's very hard to say. I always felt very grateful when people tried to intervene (and they did), but I had to show my ex partner COMPLETE loyalty, so I wasn't able to let him know that I believed the person trying to help. In other words, I had to ""take his side"" against myself, so that I didn't trigger another violent outburst. In retrospect, anything and everything was a ""trigger"". If he'd have seen me reading Sky's story, he wouldn't have liked it and that in itself would have caused problems.

When I said it's almost impossible for someone who's not experienced DV to understand, I mean to understand why people stay, why they empathize with their abusers, the trauma bond. It can be very frustrating even as someone who has experienced DV to see people staying in abusive relationships, because it's so obvious from the outside why they desperately need to leave (but definitely easier said than done). 

It's absolutely your place to try to help if you can see that there's domestic abuse going on. I had friends who were completely unaware of the extent of situation I was in. They knew there was something ""off"" about it, they didn't like how he talked to me, but they couldn't put a finger on it, weren't aware there was control, violence and emotional abuse etc going on. 

I don't think Sky's best friend can be blamed for any of it, for ""not doing enough"". The entire blame falls on Sky's ex. There's not really enough information about her best friend to make an informed opinion about if there was anything more he could have done, as I don't know if she confided in him in her most desperate time towards the end. Abuse makes the victim feel like they are going completely insane. It makes them feel so utterly trapped and powerless and lost and alone and confused. It's incredibly hard on close friends who are trying to support someone going through domestic abuse, especially during the times when the victim is trying to rationalize why the abuse is happening, often because they think their abuser has mental health issues. 

I defended my ex when I really didn't want to. I'd say I was okay when I was silently screaming inside. I ended friendships I valued because my ex manipulated and coerced me to. I was scared of the consequences if I didn't. I was terrified of him, I didn't have anywhere to go, the refuges were all full and I tried to tell them in some kind of ""code"" so they understood I still actually wanted to be friends, but of course, no one is a mind-reader. It's really, really hard to explain. When you are in the thick of it, you can't think straight, you feel like you are going insane. 

The part where Sky says she felt that all she had was her ex, this feeling was due to him isolating her. All friends can realistically do is to let their abused friend know that they are there for them, offer somewhere to stay where the abuser can't find them, if they're able to. 

How I escaped was that a friend who had also been through DV saw me one day in the supermarket car park and I told her what had been happening in my relationship. She told me to come to stay with her, right now. I didn't have the courage to do so, but she let me know I could show up with the kids any time of day or night. So we did. She basically saved my life. 

I hope my answers helped. Feel free to ask anything else.

">It can be very frustrating even as someone who has experienced DV to see people staying in abusive relationships, because it's so obvious from the outside why they desperately need to leave (but definitely easier said than done).

So, when one sees a friend getting abused and the frustration hits, should I be banging on the alarm bell as quickly and loudly as possible.  Or should I put myself in check because the victim can't be told she's in a DV situation.  She can only realize it.

&#x200B;

>I had friends who were completely unaware of the extent of situation I was in.

Would you have told them had they asked?

What was the code?

Was Supermarket Car Park friend the only one who was there for you?

&#x200B;

>offer somewhere to stay where the abuser can't find them, if they're able to.

Could you give me an example?  It's obviously more complicated than staying at the friend's place.

&#x200B;

>How I escaped was that a friend who had also been through DV saw me one day in the supermarket car park

Did she notice anything that the untrained eye wouldn't see?

&#x200B;

>and I told her what had been happening in my relationship.

Was it as simple has her asking, ""How have you been?""

&#x200B;

>but she let me know I could show up with the kids any time of day or night.

How long was it from that day until you actually showed up her place?

&#x200B;

>She basically saved my life.

So after showing up, what happened next?

&#x200B;

Do you think that if Supermarket Car Park Friend had run into you earlier?  You and your family could have been free of your ex a lot sooner?

This is a question I asked that got voted down, BUT I MEAN THIS WITH ZERO OFFENSE!!!

Do you look back and think that if you hung around just long enough that you and your ex could have made it to happily ever after?   I mean, years later with your grandkids running around you, your husband would tell your friends that none of this would have been possible if you hadn't been so patient and understanding through all the abuse and that overcoming his drug addiction, sex addiction, etc. to become the man of your dreams was just a matter of struggling through the tears and pain.

"Hey! I am going to pop in here with an excellent resource. Its a website called Love Is Respect, and it addresses the kind of questions you are asking, among many other things. What do you do if you notice a friend is in an abusive relationship? How do you handle a friend who is an abuser? What does a healthy relationship look like? What are boundaries, why are they needed, how do we create them and, critically, how do we enforce them? They also have a 24 hour hotline, and the volunteers are stellar. I have called to ask questions and have always been thankful for their knowledge, empathy and ability to understand.

I know that I have not been a participant in this discussion, however I want to say that from my perspective it is good when people are interested in finding out how to support a person who is experiencing DV. Many times victims find that their friends simply walk away, either in sadness or disgust at seeing their friend ‘putting up’ with abuse. What many dont quite comprehend is that while that abuse is crystal clear to everyone else, while you are entangled it isnt always so cut and dried. For me, I was raised in a highly dysfunctional family, and every relationship I was in was abusive and harmful to some degree. When I met my (now ex) husband he presented well, however he was actually the perfect blend of both of my parents, narcissistic, cruel, generous when required, sporadically romantic, verbally abusive beyond belief and financially crippling. He felt just like home."	flyskyhyy	reply	na	na	na	0.002117329044267535	weak	no	strong	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.
"Sorry it's taken me time to get back to you. I had some problems with my internet connection.

I'll try to answer your questions to the best of my ability. When I was in the thick of it, I was in a permanent fight or flight response. It felt as though it was happening to someone else. Like I was watching a film with me in it, only it was happening to someone else. In psych terms, that's called disassociation. I also had constant ""if I leave, he will kill me"" thoughts, so that didn't help, although the most common DV related murders happen after the victim leaves, so it wasn't a worry without rationality.

Only she can realise it, or would you say something? I'd be prepared to hear her trying to justify his behaviour, to herself- but she will probably feel in her gut that's something is not quite right. Hmm. I think in the early days, it's difficult for the victim to understand what's happening, especially if this is her first encounter with an abuser. They will generally be in the love bombing stage. If you think you recognise abuse because your friend's partner seems slimy and ""too good to be true"", that would ring alarm bells for me. If you are close, I think it's important to be honest about your concerns.

Yes, I would absolutely have told them, if they had asked. The problem was that I was very rarely able to see anyone without him being there. 

The ""code"" was just me looking worried and trying to speak in as much of a sarcastic voice as possible without my ex realising, if he was in earshot (and he usually was). Eyebrows raised, ""help me!"" look in my eyes. My ex used to always criticise the ""look on your face"" eg) 

""You're looking at him like you want sex with him"" 

or 

""Why are you looking at her 'like that'?""

I wasn't walking on eggshells so much as on broken glass.

Supermarket car park friend was someone he'd deliberately fallen out with the partner of in a big drama and banned both of them from our house. I don't even remember the ""reasons"" now. He'd do that with a lot of people. I hadn't seen her for a while and didn't know that in the meantime, her partner (now ex) had put her in hospital by beating her badly. I had had absolutely no idea that she was going through DV, and I'd known her for a while. Absolutely no idea, even though I was going through the same. She hadn't known about me either. We just didn't like each other's partners much because they drank too much and were aggressive. We'd not had the chance before to see each other alone, so we could talk. It wasn't that she noticed anything, we just got taking and she told me what was going on in her life and I her in mine. I couldn't believe I'd not noticed her ex was beating her. She wasn't surprised about mine but I was more surprised about hers.

It was only a couple of days if not the next day I honestly can't remember. In retrospect I should have just gone with her then, but I thought I could gather my passport etc. In the end I left with nothing anyway.

After I stayed with her for a bit, I managed to get temporary accommodation and later, housing. I moved far away in the end which helped immensely. 

I think if supermarket car park friend had known sooner, she wouldn't have been able to do much because she was suffering DV herself. It was only after she got a restraining order on her ex that she was able to help. He used to come round throwing things at her window and threatening her. Thank goodness he wasn't friends with my ex any more.

No, I don't look back wondering if my initial dreams of happy ever after would have worked out in the end. He was incurable. He went on to abuse at least one other woman. I don't recommend anyone holding on for change. If it ever does happen, it's rare. Domestic violence doesn't happen because of drug addiction, alcoholism, mental health issues: it happens because the perpetrator sees his partner as less than human. It happens because the abuser is violent and abusive in nature. Alcoholic does not mean violent and abusive. Drug addict does not equal violent and abusive Mental health issues do not equal violent and abusive. All these things can contribute to DV and make them worse, but they are NOT the reason for DV.

I plan to slowly add resources to my blog over time. Yeah, we all have such similar experiences, don't we? I was amazed when I participated in The Freedom Programme, how similar all the stories of the women in my group therapy were.

"""He just felt like home"". Ouch. Yes, me too. I didn't understand til later that I had married a carbon copy male version of my mother. He even came out with identical phrases like ""You destroyed my life"", ""Your brain is between your legs"" and ""You're just like your mother"" (""you're just like your father""). It's disturbing how used to abuse we get, so that it feels normal. I thought for way too long that I had to put up with it because it was what I deserved, and that I could solve it by being the perfect wife he wanted me to be. Perfect wives, of course, don't exist for abusers. They just want a robot with no emotions to have sex on whenever they want, to take out their anger against the world on, to cook and clean for them, to wash them like their mothers did... honestly, my ex had me wash him like a baby and help him out of the bath, wrap the towel around him and dry him, dress him...he WASN'T DISABLED.

"> Sorry it's taken me time to get back to you. I had some problems with my internet connection. 

No worries!  We definitely wouldn't be talking if you didn't fix that first!

&#x200B;

> I also had constant ""if I leave, he will kill me"" thoughts, so that didn't help, although the most common DV related murders happen after the victim leaves, so it wasn't a worry without rationality. 

How can a friend that wants to help do his part to overcome those fears, especially if he doesn't have a DV experience like Supermarket Car Park Friend?  

&#x200B;

> Only she can realise it, or would you say something?  

That's what I'm asking.  When it comes to things you have to figure out for yourself, you know that all the 'screaming' in the world will get you over the line.  It doesn't matter who's doing the screaming either, only you can get yourself over the line.  For example, it's like believing in yourself.  Until you do the thing you're sacred of doing, encouragement sounds sweet but doesn't feel true.  But once you do the thing, you're like, ""I did it!  I did it!""  Meanwhile, all the people who said you could do it are rolling their eyes at such a foregone conclusion.  OR Do I say my piece like an afterschool special, ""This is not what love is supposed to look and feel like!"" ""You are in danger!"" in the hopes of smashing through that wall of fear.  

&#x200B;

>I'd be prepared to hear her trying to justify his behaviour, to herself- but she will probably feel in her gut that's something is not quite right. Hmm. I think in the early days, it's difficult for the victim to understand what's happening, especially if this is her first encounter with an abuser. 

If I had said something like, ""What kind of boyfriend does (initial red flag)?""  Would you have responded with something like, ""You just don't know him like I do""?  

&#x200B;

> If you think you recognise abuse because your friend's partner seems slimy and ""too good to be true"", that would ring alarm bells for me. 

Alarm bells because your ex was too good to be true at this point or you once recognized an abuser from afar because he was slimy and all that?

&#x200B;

> If you are close, I think it's important to be honest about your concerns. 

I'm not saying it's an excuse to do nothing and it's kind of related to the question of 'Do I say anything?', but if I'm not close to the victim, my words won't be heard, regardless of all the truth in it?

&#x200B;

> Eyebrows raised, ""help me!"" look in my eyes. 

If your friends had been able to decipher the code, what would have wanted them to do?  Or was it just to convey the message of, ""Don't worry, I still want to be your friend.""  

&#x200B;

> No, I don't look back wondering if my initial dreams of happy ever after would have worked out in the end. 

I didn't ask that question because I was rooting for your ex.  I asked because I wanted to hear your side of it.  When I talk to a DV victim and she says, ""He's going to change.  He promised me!""  I can respond with what you said.  

&#x200B;

> Domestic violence doesn't happen because of drug addiction, alcoholism, mental health issues: it happens because the perpetrator sees his partner as less than human. 

I only mentioned that stuff because it looked like Sky's ex had those problems.

My mother would tell me ‘I HAVE to love you because you are my daughter, but I dont like you.” What the Actual??? What kind of a thing is that to say to a child? Wretched person…anyway, My ex said almost the same thing to me when I was holding out baby…and while I was..idk, gutted? Devastated? Hurt because I had hoped our marriage would be better than that, right? I didnt react in a way that a person who had any concept of what respect/unconditional love/self respect/self worth or value would have. I sobbed, trying to explain thru my tears and running nose that he couldnt say ‘He didnt love ME! He could say he didnt like something I did, or said, or an opinion..but he couldnt just not like me as an entire person!” He simply stared and said ‘I’m just telling you what is true. You Are A Disappointment.” Which was taken from my fam playbook of verbal abuse. All statements are justified if they are ‘true.’  Sweet Mary.	flyskyhyy	reply	na	na	na	0.002117329044267535	no	strong	no	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.
"Dear God!!! “Its disturbing how used to abuse we get, so that it feels normal.” That! That right there is so profound. When verbal abuse is dismissed because its ‘just teasing’ or ‘your are too sensitive and its time you toughen up’ or whatever profound absurdity is offered up as an excuse to torture some poor child incapable of escaping or defending themselves, how do they cope? How did I cope? I stopped actually hearing, pretending that those words; stupid, fat, idiot, lazy, moron, slut didnt hurt or that they were meaningless, because i knew that to react was to invite an even louder onslaught of hatefulness, and a greater need to either hurt or embarrass me. This was nothing but pretense, however, because Each and Every Word found a place buried deep in my soul.

Jump forward, and now Im finally divorced, have been in. therapy and ‘done the work’, and think that I’m in a place where I can (crap, this is now so beyond my ability to envision I cant figure out the phrasing. ) Yeah, so I think that possibly there is a, relationship, or person…anyway..awkward. It was a phenomena. Every guy would be a less potent version of my ex wearing different skin! Asshats all. I felt like i was some kind of Jerk Magnet, or emitted a pheromone that attracted ONLY covert narcissists. Only one thing to do at that point, right? Become A Nun. Sigh. Not ideal, but hey! its a marriage of sorts,  right?  

I had met a really talented young woman in an art class, and we became friends after a point. One day while we were walking her dog I began telling her about a conversation I just had with my uncle and dad the night before where I explained that at the ripe and venerable age of 55 I had decided that dating just wasnt working out, was exhausting and I had accepted that I would be single going forward. Dad laughed and said “Well, you are too fat for anyone to love anyways.’ while Uncle smirked “You never COULD figure out how to get along with anyone, could you?’ My friend stopped dead in her tracks and said “WELL! Its no wonder that you have dated nothing but abusive assholes! They talk to like THIS? FFS, they are horrible!!” Honestly, to me that hadnt registered as abusive, just as when a person I dated talked to me in a bad way, it never registered as a red flag. 

We become numb when we hear ourselves called names. That whole ‘sticks and stones’ business is no more than a child’s rhyme making bullying permissible. Children continue to bully and harass because the adults in their lives model this behavior and minimize the damage it causes. They refuse to own their behavior, and the consequences of how deeply what they say will scar others. Its easy to be callous and blind to the fallout of verbal abuse when you are the one who can decide who will be abused, but you are never forced to endure that abuse."	flyskyhyy	reply	na	na	na	0.002117329044267535	weak	strong	no	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.
"Hey, I know you're not rooting for my ex. I do know that in the beginning of DV relationships, the victim often gives the abuser excuses, still focusing on the way the abuser treated them at the beginning, love bombing stage. In my experience, it took me a long time to stop making excuses for him and to understand it was never going to go back to how it was, because the love bombing at the beginning was fake. My ex was incapable of having a healthy relationship, because he had narcissistic personality disorder verging on psychopathy: that's almost impossible to treat, especially if the patient is in denial, which he was. All his problems were my fault in his mind. He held the belief that if I was the perfect wife, he wouldn't ""have to"" beat me. 

I mean, what healthy minded person tells a social worker ""I had to punch her in the face because she was going blah blah blah"" then in the same conversation, says, ""no, I never punched her, don't put words in my mouth: I only tapped her gently on the cheek""? Then claims to me, in private, that he never hit me, never shouted at me, that I made it all up. A seriously messed up person who I was wrong to think would ever change. He was incapable of change. He systematically and deliberately abused me. Victims often ask themselves ""is he doing it on purpose"", as if it makes a difference somehow. Maybe it does, psychologically, to the victim, and they often stay because they think their partners aren't hurting them on purpose. I believe they are ALL, and ALWAYS hurting their victims on purpose, to gain control over them. 

I have experienced trying to help victims escape who were not ready yet, for whatever reason. It was incredibly frustrating because they knew they were being abused yet were still hoping their ex would change. They were making excuses for their abusers, like ""If he gives up drinking"", ""If he gets help for his mental health"". The thing is that a lot of DV victims see themselves as incredibly strong for staying, for supporting their partners through what the victims see as a very troubled person who won't be able to cope, and may even commit suicide if they don't continue to support them. It's getting through to them that their lives are in physical danger if they stay that's important. I hope the resource that MaeQueenofFae posted will have some answers.

"That's so familiar. I couldn't stand the way my ex would make these horrendous statements, then say ""I'm just telling you because it's true"" or ""You can't handle the truth"". Their black and white thinking is impossible to reason with. In retrospect, I don't know why I tried. It all comes back to what we were brought up to be accustomed to. My mother would say similar. I remember watching a movie with her, and being heartbroken by her reaction to the mother in the film telling her kids she loved them.
""It's disgusting how these Hollywood mothers keep saying ""I love you"" like that. It makes me cringe"", she said. I never heard my mother spontaneously telling me she loved me. The only times were when she was telling me off. eg) You are not to hang around with that disgusting girl. She's damaged goods and I don't want her influencing you. I'm telling you this because I love you and I don't want you getting into a bad crowd"". But every friend I ever made was a ""bad crowd"", a ""bad lot"", ""damaged goods "", ""a bad influence "". I grew up leaving how to sneak around and not get caught if I wanted to socialise at all. My ex did exactly the same with regards my friends. He'd tell me they were just using me, didn't care about me, were bad for me, were a bad influence. He isolated me just like my mother did, but he supervised me much more heavily than my mother did. I was barely ever alone. 

""I have to love you because you are my daughter, but I don't like you"" is horrible. That's not love. Love between parent and child should be innately unconditional. Damn, I'm sorry. It's so upsetting (to say the least) to realise that the exact people who were supposed to love us unconditionally, were incapable of doing so.

"I don't speak to any of my mother's family any more. She turned them all against me after my grandmother (her mother) died. My grandmother had been the only one to relentlessly defend and protect me. With her died reason. Not one of them bothered to call me to ask about what my mother was saying about me. I remember calling my aunt, the aunt who I'd lived with as a toddler because my mother couldn't cope with me. She'd domineeringly swept me up and said to my mother, ""I'm taking her to live with me until you have sorted yourself out"". My mother hadn't wanted me.. She'd left me outside in the snow to die. She'd left me wandering around the house alone whilst she hid in a cupboard. She'd hit me and whipped me. My dad was oblivious, because he worked long hours and nobody thought to tell him. 
I'd have thought my auntie of all people would understand when I called her up and begged her to let me and my small children come to stay with her to escape domestic violence.

""You don't deserve to lick your grandmother's shoes."" was my aunt's response. ""You are a lazy, idle scrounging layabout. You can't come to visit until you have a job. You have destroyed your mother's life.""

I was absolutely gobsmacked! I tried to ask her what she was taking about, but she just kept insulting me until she, or I (I don't remember) hung up.

My mother's family seem to be a nest of narcissists. There's no point in pretending. I used to try to fit in, to be who they wanted me to be, but they were never close, protective or kind in any way. So I realised I was doing the same with my ex. Begging for crumbs of love. 

Never again.

Your friend was so right. It beggars belief that your dad and uncle would say those things in front of him! Too sensitive! Yeah, right. Always the line of bullies and abusers. There's nothing wrong with being sensitive. There is something wrong with verbal abuse. 

I became ""a nun"" for years. I chose to be single, celibate and to work on myself until I learnt to listen to and follow my gut instinct, and therefore to trust myself. I never wanted to have another relationship again if it meant making the same mistakes and ending up with another abuser. Yes, we do have a magnet, I think: I think all compassionate, sensitive people do, more so if we have a history of being abused. It's being able to tell the difference between a predator and a healthy minded human being that's important. Knowing how to set boundaries in our relationships, and knowing how to stick to them. Being prepared to be completely alone rather than putting up with abusive people. I used to be a people pleaser. In the end I realised that a friend who is abusive isn't a friend.

Yes. That my son and I were able to get away, and that he is still alive and has become such a strong, caring and overall remarkable human being warms my soul. We were actually talking about these things last night, how the verbal abuse from his dad affected him, how having to endure even more verbal abuse from my parents, and hear how my parents treated me after the divorce was so confusing…and made him angry at me for a long time. However he better understands these chains of familial patterns, and we are creating greater understanding for each others past. He said that what has kept him able to handle the traumas in his life is that he never doubted that I loved him, absolutely and without question or condition. At times he said he knew he had been a jerk, and would be embarrassed by his behavior, but even then he knew I loved him, so he was always able to come home, because I never changed. That part never changed. I was so thankful, because i would worry that maybe I was continuing the family abuse and just wasnt aware? I did a lot of crying last night.

I get the feeling you know that mediation, unfortunately, will be a fruitless endeavor. If actually leaving him wasn’t enough to cause him to  alter his mindset and behavior, nothing will do so. Dear OP, please try and develop a working escape plan, which will enable you and your children to live in an environment that is calm, peaceful and non-threatening as soon as you possibly can.

I cannot stress the importance of this enough! You see, I stayed far too long, because I thought that since the abuse was directed at myself, I was able to protect my son and keep him safe, free from harm. I so wish that would have been true! He has suffered greatly because of my delay, and my lack of awareness.

Even though the abuse wasn’t directed towards him, he lived in a home filled with tension, pain and fear. It’s immaterial that he never witnessed what went on between his father and me, or that I never complained. There is absolutely no way to hide it when your heart is breaking, or you are reeling from pain, be it physical or emotional. Or you are struggling with the depression and frustration and fear that stems from your relationship with this abuser, while you pretend to be happy for your children! What are the ACTUALLY SEEING? What are they learning while watching us fake smile and walk on eggshells? Welp, my child learned how to become very adept at enduring abuse. He is masterful at pretending that everything is ‘just fine’ when it is screachingly obvious that not a single thing in his life is close to fine. Every Single Relationship he has been in has been horrific, every woman he has been involved with has been incredibly manipulative and abusive. I have watched him strive and struggle to ‘fix’ and ‘save’ a person who he thinks is essentially good but just needs help. These broken women who have had a lifetime of abuse… that are smart enough to present like…his mom, but who are in reality his father, with tits and a vagina. So much trauma for such a kind, young man. By staying with his father I gave him too long to study how to endure abuse wrapped up as loving care. It tears my soul.

OP, as parents we need to take care of ourselves. It’s like putting our oxygen mask on first, before we put one on our child. WE must be here for our children, so our children can thrive!! We absolutely have to model living life in the healthiest most loving manner we know! Because if we don’t, they will be left to muddle thru on their own, and that is a long and painful way at times. Sending you so much strength and care! Be well!!!"	flyskyhyy	reply	na	na	na	0.002117329044267535	weak	no	no	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.
"It's so good to hear your son has grown up to be a wonderful human being and that you guys have overcome those difficulties. My son had a hard time with a friend of mine who I was finding it hard to let go of, in spite of her having been incredibly unsupportive and even passing on messages from my violent abusive ex, knowing full well what he did to us. It's heartbreaking to accept that someone who I thought was a replacement for the family I never had, really wasn't. She is a ""helper"". Always has to have someone to ""help"", but spreads herself so thin that she's not really there for anyone. I had to just cut my losses and distance myself because she recently made contact with my ex, the person who beat me, raped me, harrassed me, stalked me, made my life a living hell as a domestic slave and prisoner in my own home and threatened to kill me and my kids. After watching Dr Ramani's channel, I understood she's the classic ""Pollyanna Enabler"". However good her intentions were when she contacted him and passed on his messages to me, it doesn't change the fact that her actions retraumatised me and could put me and my kids in danger. Some friend. 

I worried that I denied my kids a grandmother by going zero contact with my mother and her family. My son laughed about that, told me he was glad I did that, said I did the right thing. 

It's good to cry. I've been doing a lot of that lately too. The years I held it all in because it was dangerous to cry openly... until I couldn't cry even after I left. It was so hard to cry! It's so healing, isn't it?

Our being consistent is so important to our kids because their abusive family members were inconsistent. There's probably a better way to put that!"	flyskyhyy	reply	na	na	na	0.002117329044267535	strong	strong	no	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.
"Wow. What a brilliant response. I hope the OP finds the strength to leave. 
I remember the social workers explaining to my ex about how he could have killed me, explaining the long term psychological damage living in a DV household causes children. I remember his feigned innocence, his victim blaming, his sinister laugh when telling me he wasn't going on the 6 month away from home perpetrators course that the judge had suggested. Was the judge so naive he forgot to write an order for my ex to attend, or did he actually believe my ex's lies?
You know, I never thought I'd find a kind partner. It took me YEARS to even consider ""dating"", but my current partner is an old friend, which made all the difference. I knew he was safe. I listened to my gut instinct. I made the right choice. But I know I'm capable of being alone, I made damn sure of it.

"I left my boyfriend of three years after dealing with his binge drinking consistently. I don’t know if it’s abuse because he was generally lovely while sober. However, I still experienced horrible treatment while he was drunk. 
He would get so drunk he would have delusions, and it was always something “I did”. I could not calm him down, and he would say horrible, horrible things to me. He would get violent towards himself. He never directly threatened me but it is intimidating nonetheless to see a man be violent and out of control. I’ve had to call the police on him before. If I would physically leave wherever he is, I would receive hundreds of text messages saying terrible things like I sabotaged him, I hate him, I made him the way he is etc…
He does not react appropriately to bad situations even when he is sober. He has meltdowns over small problems and will punch himself, pull his hair out, break his phone etc. then he always feels “so guilty” and will apologize and love bomb me until things are okay again.
There’s been one situation with violence a year ago when he was driving. He was so angry and was hitting me and almost swerved the car off the road.
I think I’ve become addicted to the fights and the come down. He is deeply troubled and needs help. He needs sobriety. So I left him, even though I love him. Right now I’ve told him I need time to think about what I want because I’m so confused. But I don’t even trust my own judgement. I suppose if you have to wonder if you’ve been abused, something is very wrong. 
He says he will work on himself, he is in therapy. He needs to go to AA and probably medication from a doctor. Most of his issues are because of binge drinking, and was abused as a child. Right now I’m considering taking space for a long time and seeing if he gets better. But maybe this is stupid, I don’t know.

Relationships should be relatively easy and cohesive. It sounds like he has a ton of work to do, and he needs to do it alone. If he heals, changes and all this was meant to be then nothing will stop you two. But your idea of taking space is brilliant! Because if you intervene he'll use you as a crutch, never heal, blame you for it, and the abuse will continue, worsen and erode you. You'll have space and boundaries in place if he isn't serious about doing his inner work and save yourself some trauma.

"My divorce is underway and as expected by ex is lashing out at me. He has cult leader qualities and has an uncanny ability to convince others to do his dirty work for him because he's extremely passive aggressive.

I opened my PO Box yesterday to find it stuffed full of about 100 envelopes from a company called PharMerica, addressed to different people at my PO Box. Today, I checked, there were 100 more, same company. I called the company, they gave me their corporate number which was actually a number for Direct TV. So obviously it's like, a prank company maybe or their mailing lists were hacked (article said 5.8 million people's data was stolen from this company via a recent hack but no major news sources reported it that I saw just tech blogs).

Anyway, I don't really use my PO Box for much. I mainly receive court paperwork and just a couple minor things. But my ex probably thinks I use the PO Box for everything. My ex is not a computer savvy guy, so he has help on this. But proving it, other than the PO Box coincidence, is impossible. I live in the middle of nowhere, don't use PharMerica for anything, so it's unlikely just a random error.

I have a restraining order against my ex for domestic violence, so he is not allowed to harass me directly or indirectly. He has been harassing me though in other ways I just haven't reported it because I honestly don't know how. I've tried calling the police before about his petty, passive aggressive behavior and I could audibly hear them roll their eyes and ask what I expected them to do. I didn't know what to say so I dropped it.

So how do I report this? To the police? Do I just file a contempt motion? Would the police even help on a mail scam?  Would doing this even be worth it or would it likely go nowhere?"	ariesgeminipisces	post	32.80943415278332	male	White	0.9985635876655579	na	na	na	10	domesticviolence	no prediction.

Mine convinced a door dash delivery person to bang on my door and try to force my door open the other day.

I’ve noticed that when I file reports in other towns they are more supportive, if any abuse occurs in other towns it’s worth a try as well.  Also just because it doesn’t hold up with the police for a violation, it may be helpful In court for the abuse or divorce.

I can tell that he’s really in your head and still tormenting you even when he’s not here.  It will take some time to replace his accusing thoughts and get your own thoughts and opinions back.  Try to always reinforce in your mind - what is reality, what is positive, that you’re strong, you can hear him in your head and just say nope I’m not going to entertain those thoughts!  It will take time away from him with no contact to stop hearing him accuse you, and it will be hard each time you’re in court.  But you can set a boundary emotionally and mentally to snap back into yourself again. I’m not an expert with this but there is help out there and I usually pray and remember who I am in Christ and that I am smart, logical, strong, and he is acting out of sin, and I try to shake it off and think about the truth that I believe.

"Throwaway account because I never told anyone how it really was and because of that I really wanted to just share this… after 10 years of being with that drunk asshole I finally left…I would threaten to leave and he would stop drinking or a week or 2 days but when he was drunk he would threaten to kick me out in the middle of the night. He would violently wake me up around 1:45 and would want more and the only way I would be able to go back to sleep was if I went and got it other wise we would be in a yelling match til about 6 am (when I usually worked doubles at a restaurant) it would seem like such a waste to throw away so much time especially how nice he was when sober and he would always tell me he would stop drinking. There was a couple times he didn’t drink for a couple years but he would always start again. I was and still am embarrassed to tell anyone how it really was.. I feel like people would look down or think less of me. It’s been a couple months now and I would record how he treated me and now I’ll watch it randomly thinking what in the actual fuck was I doing and didn’t leave sooner… im back at home with my mom for now but I’ve started my own little business and I’ve NEVER felt better mentally and physically. I’m just so happy to be back in my home town with my family. I really hope someone will read this and get the courage they need to do the same..

"Well done OP!

I remember that weight falling off my shoulders when I finally ended it and went to live with my Dad again for a while. I remember feeling like a failure because I was back in my teenage bedroom, and my ex and I had a house to sell so I had to remain in touch for a while and he would say stuff like that to me as well in those months. He went from begging me, to threatening to come get me and beat up my Dad, to trying to buy me things, to begging again, to pretending to kill himself, etc. 

But despite that initial feeling of failure, it soon dissipated when I threw myself into my social life again. I regularly went out and saw friends that my ex hated, spent time with my family, booked a holiday with my sister, had fun spending my income on new consoles and games, got a tattoo (my ex wouldn't let me) etc and just having freedom again.

"Your time isn’t wasted. Sometimes, as much as it sucks to admit (from my experience), I stepped into abuse over and over because I didn’t believe I was worth it. I needed to learn that way and break the cycle because with the way I was raised, I was never given the tools or confidence to avoid that kind of relationship.

All we have is now anyway. The past is gone, the future hasn’t happened yet. Grow your business, love your real family who loves you and treats you well, and don’t look back unless you feel like you need a reminder for perspective when something even better comes into your life.

Nip it in the butt and tell them that your husband has made false suicidal claims on you and that he may try to again, but that it’s no where near true.

Contact local family lawyers that have free consultations or see about getting one through a DV shelter, I’ve done both. I would confirm with a lawyer, but based on things that I’ve seen (you can also ask in the legaladvise Reddit page) you are legally allowed to move away and whatever state you give birth in becomes the babies home state and he can’t force you to move back. Since you’re married he does have a right to be involved in the babies life, but the distance could complicate it a lot.

Document as much as you can and only communicate through text so you can save anything he may say.

"I was in the situation where my husband kept telling people I was trying to take my life. What it came down to was telling him to prove it. If the police came I would would ask them (CALMLY) to show me his proof. The key is to control your reaction, I know it’s hard but when we get defensive or angry those people assume. 
One day my husband called an ambulance and then then I took a bunch of pills. Of course I had the pills because they are prescribed to me. They did not want to listen to me when I said I didn’t take more than I was supposed to and so I had to give in and agree to go to the hospital. While I was there they did bloodwork and I finally had proof. It was in writing that I had not tried to take my life, I was calm and I had plans for the future.. From that moment they didn’t believe him anymore and I won. 
Believe in yourself. 

Definitely contact your local domestic violence shelter. They can help you with a plan to get out, put you in contact with divorce lawyer who understands domestic violence and often works for free or a low fee. They can help with childcare setting you up with any services you might need to take care of yourself and your baby.

Be careful with the law. In a lot of states if you take a baby /child a certain distance away from the other parent who is interested in being active, which a lot of abusive men will lie and say that they are interested just to keep a hold of you, they could accuse you of kidnapping or parent and alienation. There are a lot of resources online about divorcing a narcissist/abuser. So do your work and react from your brain from your heart. It is a very good idea if you can prove that he is abusive, you ask for supervised visitation. You might not get it but it’s a good idea to ask.

"A friend needs a witness statement. I’m not sure what to write or how it’s supposed to be worded? Can anyone please give advice?

My friend is pregnant w/ his second baby, literally due TODAY. she’s scared to say anything at the hospital bc she is scared they will take the kids to foster care. If she puts in a restraining order etc, his family is going to fight it. He, his mom, his sisters will adamantly deny it and probably write letters for him. Maybe even his employers.

She has no family in CA, and per his abuse she’s not allowed to have a job or a phone. No car. Like, nothing.

I have seen bruises on her arms and legs, a change in her personality, seen them having to walk off for a “talk” with her crying for an hour when they were at my Halloween party, I have heard him on the phone verbally abusing her and telling her she’s not allowed to go out for coffee with me she has to make dinner and wash dishes, which I have recordings of. I did have screenshots of his texting abuse, which I can’t find but he does that too. Blowing up her phone a million times. And neighbors at her apartment have gone out of their way to find her on Facebook to see if she’s ok and needs something (I’m guessing bc they heard him yelling or hurting her).

Also with the birth of their first child, he was abusive to her in the hospital and the hospital made a social worker talk to them and basically said “go to therapy” but he flipped out and they never went. So maybe it’s on record there?

Is this enough?

Any help or advice appreciated, thank you!!"	Busy_Succotash_1536	post	39.840800830537674	female	White	0.9947434663772583	na	na	na	9	domesticviolence	no prediction.
"Here is a witness statement that my friend submitted on my behalf, if it helps. 

The key is to be very specific with dates, timeframes? Any documentation, etc. 

“(Victim)  stayed the night at my house and woke up to messages from (Abuser) admitting he broke into her house. He shared pics of him going through her computer and sending them to mutual contacts and accusing (Victim) of cheating and being unstable. One of the recipients just so happened to be the President of the board at Xxxxxx, which was (Victim’s) employer at the time. 

(Abuser) is a pathological liar, and I wholeheartedly feel he is incapable of telling the truth. He rewrites history.

(Abuser) showed up at a work event to help us set up an activation. He quickly became argumentative and jealous over another male volunteer that was (Victim’s) former co-worker, who is happily married and was about to have a baby. I witnessed no flirtation on (Victim’s) part, however, I did witness (Abuser’s) erratic and unsavory behavior towards (Victim). He was eventually asked to leave so (Victim) could focus on her job and not be pulled off to participate in his heated discussions. 

(Victim’s child) would often cry and call me and/or my daughter when (Abuser) would show up unannounced, this happened frequently from 2020- 2022. (Victim’s child) is like my second daughter. 

She expressed multiple times that she feared for her mother’s life and didn’t know what to do. All I could offer was a safe place and to be supportive of her mom whenever she would open up and talk to me about it. 

My own daughter was uncomfortable around him. He would sit outside of (Victim’s) house for hours during slumber parties. At the beginning of the relationship, if (Victim) wouldn’t answer her phone he would show up at her house with our daughters present and just walk into the house uninvited. 

(Abuser) has a proclivity towards harassing and threatening service providers, friends, and (Victim’s) employers. 

(Victim)  expressed concern about the safety and mental health of (Abuser’s) daughters often. Whenever abusive situations would escalate her primary concern and the main reason behind not pressing charges was his daughters. She didn’t want to take their dad away from them. 

I told (Victim) last year that I wasn’t comfortable with (Abuser) being around my daughter. I’m aware two of our mutual mom friends asked the same. (Victim) obliged by explicitly sharing my concern and our friends however (Abuser) wouldn’t listen and would show up despite the requests. 

(Victim’s) demeanor quickly began changing after seeing (Abuser). She became reclusive which was the opposite of her nature. He would harass her and set trap scenarios by impersonating anonymous people sending inappropriate content to (Victim’s) phone only later to act surprised when he would forcefully take her phone and go through without permission only to find the planted content. 

(Abuser) somehow knows where (Victim) is most of the time. (Victim) does not do a lot of live, pinned posts to social media so the frequency of the surprise visits is alarming. He would also take his children with him in pursuit of (Victim) despite the time of day or night.”

My suggestion is to read the legal definitions of the domestic abuse Crimes that apply to your friend - physical abuse, harassment, stalking, intimidation, etc. - a specifically construct your statement around incident that you witnessed that concisely meet the legal definitions for crimes related to domestic violence in your state. This will make investigators and prosecutors jobs much easier and they will be much more compelled to intervene and arrest, if necessary. 

33% of all law enforcement calls are related to intimate partner and family abuse, so the more specific examples of actual crimes you witnessed that meet the legal definitions, the easier it makes it for your friend’s abuser to face criminal and/or civil consequences. 

I made a spreadsheet and categorized every incident by which crime was committed - stalking, harassment, physical abuse, sexual abuse, etc. and then I referenced the documentation that I had related to that incident and coded it, and provided it to the detective in a thumbdrive.  Every single incident had a link on the spreadsheet to the appropriate document in the thumbdrive. 

I literally did all of the leg work and made it as concise and straightforward as possible to increase the chances that my abuser would be held accountable.

He was charged with Felony domestic violence charges 5/5/23. I first met with the detective 4/26. Understanding what incidents actually met the legal criteria for prosecution and having all of my documentation organized and easy to read in a spreadsheet really expedited the criminal case against my abuser"	Busy_Succotash_1536	reply	na	na	na	0.9947434663772583	no	strong	no	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.
As a witness to her abuse you can file a police report yourself, but it will be very helpful if she’s also willing to testify. If his family is going to deny it proof will be very important and really all you need is 1 piece of evidence to be granted an order of protection. I got one against my ex who denied everything, but I had 1 video of his abuse and it was enough for the order of protection to stay in place. Keep record of her neighbors reaching out and see if they will attest to the verbal abuse since they are more strangers and have no ties to either party in the altercations. She should definitely reach out to a DV shelter and take advantage of their advice as well. Are they married?

I am happy to share my spreadsheet that I provided to the detective in my case if that would be helpful to your friend. Just send me a message if so, and I’ll try to figure out how to upload a copy.	Busy_Succotash_1536	reply	na	na	na	0.9947434663772583	weak	no	no	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.
Wow thank you so much!!! This is super helpful and now I can know how to legally craft the statement. I will look up my laws in my state.	Busy_Succotash_1536	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9947434663772583	weak	no	no	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.
It does actually. If they are not married she can leave with the children at any time. If she leaves the state he can petition for them to move back, but she can go anywhere within the state. I would also recommend she not name anyone as the father on the new babies birth certificate so paternity isn’t established. If he knows what hospital she plans to give birth in she should go to a different one and ask for her name to be put on a nondisclosure list so they won’t tell anyone she’s there if they call. If paternity hasn’t been established for the first child either she has every right to deny visitation/contact until he petitions for it to be established. Certain issues including abuse are also grounds for refusal, but you need proof to not get chewed out by the judge. I don’t know Californias rules exactly, but in AZ signing the birth certificate doesn’t establish paternity either. In Texas signing the birth certificate does count so it’s a state by state basis. At the end of the day because there’s no custody order in place and they are not married either one of them is free to run with the kids and make sure she knows that. He could take her children and refuse to allow her to see them until someone files for custody and it’s legal. She needs to be very careful about that, but can also do that same thing and refuse him and his family visits if she’s in hiding.

"I have a very close friend who I love a lot and
Hold dear to my heart who’s been talking about running away from her abusive partner for over a year now. Every time it comes down to it something always happens and she stays. Ive been so patient and tell her I love her and support her no matter what but I’m honestly getting scared. She told me recently he threatened to kill her if he couldn’t have her. She told me on Saturday that she would leave today to go back home several states away. And of course now she’s staying. I just don’t know what to say anymore. I even sent her gas money so she could make it and she sent it back. I really feel like she’s in serious danger but she won’t leave. What can I say to her?"

Just stay supportive. Please. If it wasn't for my very best friend who NEVER gave up on me and even came to take me away from my abuser, over 500 miles she traveled by car and she wasted the trip.... But she held fast to me and always supported me despite my attempts to leave. Her lifelong friendship gave me hope and empowerment that NO MATTER WHAT she was going to be there when no one else was. It has made all difference in my life. On average it takes 7 attempts by the abused to leave their abused. She knew that, she educated herself and she never wavered from making sure I knew she was there for when the day came.... It came for me two months ago and she has been my biggest cheer leader, my biggest confidant, my biggest supporter and without her.... Idk where I would be. Just hang in there OP; if you can without sacrificing your own mental health and I promise you, she will be forever grateful for the one soul who gave her light at the end of a very very dark tunnel. 🙏🏻😘❤️	GroundbreakingCake26	reply	na	na	na	0.9960929751396179	weak	strong	no	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.

So I(18f) left my abusive ex(21m) about 2 weeks ago. He was mentally physically emotionally and financially abusive and him and his family lived off my vehicle none of them has cars or jobs. But since March I've been working with a man (20m) that is incredibly attractive has a job, car, saving. Works so hard all the time. I have truly fallen for him and I vented to him about the abuse and he was one of the people who gave me the confidence to leave my ex but I'm not sure how he feels about me but he's single I just don't know if it'd be wrong to try and seek a relationship with him. Is it too soon even tho I was emotionally checked out months before I ended it with my ex?	ambydeer	post	25.71120248490054	male	White	0.0023729740642011166	na	na	na	7	domesticviolence	no prediction.
I was in an abusive marriage for 11 years, it was dead years before we started divorce proceedings.  I tried to wait but after she was being particularily C&%#y one day i said fuck it.  Id been alone for years.  Everyone moves on in their own way,  but make sure it's not just because you're afraid of being alone.   You're young,  if you're not sure take time to live yourself.   Personally I am already in such a great place being away even the drag of constant false allegations and court couldnt shake me and I wanted a partner.

Sweet heart. As someone who's a little older and literallywent through the same situation. You aren't really attracted to this man. You are craving the care and love your ex didn't give you. Give it more time before you try anything. Sometimes after not getting love and attention after so long. You fall for the first person who gives it to you. If after so long of you are still attracted to this man. Then go for it. But you don't want to fake fall for someone. Get them to like you. And then you realize you weren't actually attracted.

I would say take it slow, as healing takes time.  Plus since he's a co-worker, that comes with risks, too.  Some companies has policies on employees dating each other, so you might wanna make sure neither of you would lose your job if you were to pursue this guy.	ambydeer	reply	na	na	na	0.0023729740642011166	weak	no	no	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.
"I very much second this. I was around your age when my abusive relationship came to an end. I didn't take time to heal and went on a warpath of self-destructive behaviors in the brief relationships that I had after.

Remember, this is still very fresh to you. You also are carrying a lot on your shoulders that have yet to manifest in your day-to-day life. If you really are falling for him, I suggest you make a friend out of him until you both are fully prepared for a relationship. This would help whenever you have manifestations from any possible trauma + see how he would assist you in those instances. It is easy enough to say that he is available with good attributes, however, if he cannot deal or help with that - then the relationship itself would be fruitless. If he wants to be in a relationship with you, he would/should understand that. I also would recommend speaking to a therapist about this so they can guide you better."	ambydeer	reply	na	na	na	0.0023729740642011166	weak	strong	no	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.

"I fully left my ex in December 2021. There is still a no contact order until September while he finishes probation. I don't have to tell anyone here that there were a lot of different types of abuse and that they were all awful.

I find myself hanging on to something that, while awful, is probably on the lower spectrum of the things that happened in the 2 years we were together and the long while before he left me alone afterwards. I am working on counselling and have worked with several services (domestic violence social workers, support groups, individual therapy) since leaving.

My ex liked to ""test"" my bellybutton to ensure I was clean. It seemed like no matter what I did, he always told me I was dirty and had to wash again. He would make disgusted faces and tell me how awful it was. No one else has ever made comments about my hygiene and I know smelling bellybuttons is not.. normal, for a lack of better words. But still, every time I shower, I scrub my bellybutton and it brings this all back up and sometimes I just don't even want to shower.

There are so many things I have gotten over or improved on or worked to decrease the triggers... Why is this particular thing sticking? Does anyone else have weird stuck moments?"	questionnormal	post	29.336915691512374	female	White	0.9959560036659241	na	na	na	1	domesticviolence	no prediction.
"Definitely still do. I left my ex in feb 21 and still have these stuck points still. I’ve only recently moved on to EMDR therapy after a lot of other styles of therapy including an IOP for trauma. And survivor support groups. 

I think I’m going good and then I have a trauma activating dream and I’m knocked on my ass for two days.  


Also gaining a close friend who I see regularly who is also a survivor (actively still dealing with coparenting with their ex) it helps in ways that are just so tremendous 💜💜

"I ended things with him yesterday in the gentlest way I could. 

The reason for the breakup is almost boring; we lived together in a different apartment last year and the landlord targeted me because of my identity. My partner thought I was being paranoid and this led to me not documenting issues with the apartment the way I should have, which now has the potential of costing me a lot of money. I explained that I can’t be with someone who doesn’t trust my perception of the world even when it’s cynical, and I want a partner who supports me instead of gaslighting or minimizing me. It’s a pattern with him so I said we had to end it. 

After I had the talk, he spent the next 12 hours going through 15+ shots of bourbon and saying extremely hurtful things. I had to do sex work to get out of a violent past relationship and he knows this; last night he said “have fun sucking dick again now that I won’t pay your rent anymore” along with tons of other hurtful shit and I just lost it. I was furious and hurt. I yelled and am ashamed of that. I videoed some of what he said. He was literally so drunk his eyes are visibly crossed in the video and he’s smiling and laughing at me while I’m in tears. 

I now have no work laptop and am supposed to be starting to teach a course today that my students paid thousands of dollars for. I have no paycheck because I gave it to him Friday, as is our system, for him to take necessary bills out then pay me back, but now he won’t pay me back. 

We live in a dangerous neighborhood and this stupid fucking online workshop was supposed to be my ticket into a down payment on a rental in a safer town. I feel beyond hopeless, because—speaking of safer town—our town literally has a motorcycle gang that runs every aspect of it. They do not like women who don’t fit a certain mold and I’m not liked here. I also had a terrible experience with my first violent relationship where the cop initially arrested *me* instead of him, and he only got arrested months later after trying to kill me, so I don’t call the cops unless, like…idek when I would. 

I’m scared as hell because he just left, with our only car and gun, leaving me stranded in a place where violence happens on a regular basis. There was a fucking arson on our block last week. 

If anything I’m writing this in the hopes that if I either end up dead by bikers/tweakers or if I get taken in by the police here run by bikers someone has a record of this happening. I’m at a loss."

"Is the check made out to you? If it is you could try contacting the person/employer that wrote it and ask them to cancel it if it hasn’t been deposited. Their bank may be able to handle it because it’s fraudulent if he’s depositing your check.

"My mom (59f) has been harassing and tormenting my aunt (62f) and my grandfather (86m) for the past two months by waking up screaming everyday from sunrise to sundown unrelentingly and starting fights with my aunt. We learned to just live with it but then three weeks ago the fights between my aunt had gotten violent where I had to pull them apart. Then three weeks ago while my aunt was out of town I noticed my mom started to clean up her own room, noticing her throw some of her old things away and things seemed fine. 

I was thinking there’s finally gonna be some peace and normalcy around here and I can finally go home and start getting ready to stay there so I left to go to my house for a day and came back and saw that the outside garbages were full and that the hallway coat rack looked like it was missing jackets which I thought was odd. Then that night I caught her throwing my aunt’s medication out of the refrigerator, I jumped up and asked her what was she doing and she suddenly became hostile towards me and started screaming that I better leave her alone and let her do what she wants to do. 

She threw $800 worth of medication outside in the garbage. I tried to go get it but she blocked me and acted like she wanted to fight me so I waited for her to calm down and go back into the house and called my aunt and told her what was going on then when I was sure my mom was in her room I went back out but all the entry doors have alarms on them which sounds off. I tried to hide my aunts meds in the garage refrigerator but she went back out and got them and this time she destroyed them so I called the police. They said they didn’t want to do anything and said they just came from a shootout and didn’t even want to come into the house to talk to my mom so my aunt rushed home from out of town. 

I tried to see what else she had thrown away but she made sure everything was soiled and covered in pure garbage including her dirty adult diapers and her dogs potty/poop pads. My aunt gets here and starts screaming and crying because all of her coats and shoes were missing from her closet in the hallway as well as her hygiene products kept in drawers in the bathroom which i respect her enough not to even touch so I didn’t check therefore I didn’t know they were gone. We call the cops again and they said they couldn’t do anything and still refused to talk to my mom. 

Fed up my aunt decided to stay with her daughter although i offered my place (but it’s in a bad area). With my aunt gone I thought my mom would settle down but her screaming and yelling escalated. One night I went into her room to tell her to calm down and she was standing in front of her window and the neighbors were just standing in front of theirs directly across from her watching her scream nonsense. 

Then she turned her hatred towards my grandpa, she went from making up stories about my aunt and cousin poisoning her dog and spying on her to making up stories about how my grandpa is evil and killed my grandma and how this is her house (when it’s his and was my late grandma’s too) and I started taking pictures of what she was doing and recording her she honestly sounds like a demon and then she started saying really mean things that I don’t even want to repeat on here about him that are simply not true. 

She started blocking the entry ways to the house with vacuum cleaners, walkers, ladders, chairs etc. and blocked the garage door with her car so that it wouldn’t even close to and to stop my grandpa from getting into his own house and she would scream at me whenever I’d move them. 

Then she came into the sunroom where I’m temporarily staying with my dog, grabbed a bunch of glass frames of family pictures that my grandma put up of him and started smashing them on the floor, I was so mad I pushed her to stop, but as a survivor of domestic violence myself I somehow refrained from wanting to hurt her as she is tinier and I’m alot stronger and managed to regain control of myself. I then called the cops and begged them in tears this time, and they finally agreed to come inside of the house to talk to her but because she barricaded herself in her room and refused to talk to them, they came right back out and asked me not to call them anymore saying my 86 year old grandpa needed a restraining order and has to legally evict her which takes 30 days where I live, but this is also a woman who was on the news for stealing and driving a city truck into a public library where luckily no one was hurt and she started making threats towards my grandpa. I was seriously afraid that she was going to burn the house down. 

The next morning I contacted adult protective services for my grandpa and was able to squeeze my aunt as a victim into the report too but they told me they wouldn’t let me know whether or not if they’d pick the case up. 

We finally got a hold of my male older cousin who came all the way from the middle of our state to help us. He talked to my mom who was being sweet and nice to him at first because he was her favorite cousin and he brought the real her out of her finally this time when the cops came I confirmed what he had told them about the threats against my grandpa and they finally took her to the mental hospital but only for 72 hours. 

During that time my sister quickly got power of attorney over my grandpa and is actively seeking an emergency protection order against my mom for him, and me and my cousin are urging my aunt to get one too. Over the weekend my grandpa changed the locks on the doors to the house as well. 

My mom was released mental hospital last night despite me warning her she’s not welcomed here anymore and that we’re not letting her back in and that she needs to have the hospital find her a shelter or a place for aftercare however she’s been knocking on the door, ringing the door bell, and blowing her car horn frantically trying to get back in at 10pm, 3am, 5am, 8am and 10am but I’m told to not to open the door no matter what. 

She had a neighbor call me to tell me she wants her dog but when I got her dog her dog was skinny and nervous and I couldn’t find any food in my moms room so we had to buy her some kibble and she was pretty hungry and her dog seems relaxed and happy and not barking all the time. 

My sister called the police on my mom and they picked her up yet just let her out on $2000 bail (all she had to do was pay the bail bondsman $200. I’m afraid my mom will be back again to harass us tonight and wondering if there’s anything else we can do to protect my grandpa.

Update: She already came banging on the door and honking her door and screaming on the porch but left as soon as dispatch was getting the cops out here but I canceled because I know they’re not going to anything once they’ve come all the way here again.

So my partner and I have been dating for 2 1/2 years and we had a rocky start, had some intense fights where they put their hands around my throat but nothing more than that. I forgave them and they weren’t physically abusive until recently. I live with them but we realized we weren’t a good match because r they want kids and I don’t. So we were amicably separating … or so I thought. I went and looked at an apartment and submitted an application. I was happy, told my partner and they seemed distant. Later on that night they asked for a bite of my quesadilla and I said no sorry I want the whole thing I’m seriously starving. They flipped out over this, started punching me and then they were pushing me I grabbed on to their hair and they shoved me into their computer desk which collapsed. I threatened to call the cops because I seriously thought they were going to kill me. I left immediately and I had a gash on the side of my hip with blood coming out and then later on a huge bruise formed there and then another giant bruise on my leg. The sides of my rib hurt when I inhale I really feel beat up. My partner didn’t realize the extent of my injuries until I came back and they seemed to feel really bad and said they have never harmed a partner that bad before…. I’m seriously traumatized !! And hope my apartment application goes through because I would be moving out in July !! I’m hoping everyday something good happens so incan finally get away and start my own life. I’m anxious right now still living with them because I feel uncomfortable and I don’t want to be with them anymore. I never thought I would be in this situation…. On top of that , my partner guilt tripped me saying the only reason they flipped out on me is because they share their entire life with me and it was extremely offensive to them to deny them food. My partner is controlling and abusive and I hope I can leave soon. I’m taking every step to. Any advice would be appreciated. I’m so depressed."

I have finally made the decision to proceed with a no contact order from my physically and mentally abusive ex. He is the father of my child and I will allow them to have a relationship under the pretence he maintains sobriety. However I want to know if anyone has children and a no contact order between the parents… what can I expect? I’m choosing this because even after leaving I’m still being harassed and threatened daily and I just want it to be over so I can try and work through the abuse and what’s left of me to be a decent human being and maybe have some what of a normal life or normal relationships in the future.

"Expect abuse to continue. At best your children will grow up with mental health issues and be turned against you. At worst their dad will assault or kill them to spite you. Forcing children to have a relationship with an abuser is a moral failing and does not make you a better parent. 
Should you decide not to expose your children to their abusive dad, court will see your previous attempts to keep their relationship going as a reason to ignore future requests for supervised custody or reduced time. 

Some victims live in bad jurisdictions where they have to coparent with the abuser despite their best efforts. Their kids are either in therapy or follow the abuser in disparaging the victim-parent. Or there’s clear as day direct child abuse despite the “hE’s a gOoD faTHeR” excuse making. 

Given exposure to abuse is bad and can only get worse. My child’s father has zero visitation and I plan to keep it that way."	DescriptionHuman9686	reply	na	na	na	0.9986923336982727	no	no	no	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.
"Can I ask why sobriety is the lynchpin in allowing custody/visitation? Personally, my ex has falsely claimed to everyone including the mother of his kid that he assaulted me only when drunk meanwhile he was actually dead sober every time so it was a means for manipulation so he still had access to his kid and mother of his kid and he somehow seemed ""less bad"" when discussing his abusive tendencies and used a lack of sobriety as a scapegoat

his mom also helped push this narrative to her, his friends, and family- I guess repeatedly assaulting a woman when not sober makes it easier to accept for some people not saying that's you! i just feel like sobriety is kind of a copout a lot of abusers use when their abuse might be substance facilitated but seldom substance induced."

"I left my daughters abusive and alcoholic father and the first thing I did was free consultations with lawyers. This helped me gauge what would be seen as negative in court versus acceptable. For me specifically we were never married and paternity wasn’t established so legally he has no right to our daughter until paternity and a custody agreement is in place. I’ve allowed him to FaceTime with her (she’s less than a year old so it’s mostly him watching her do her thing) through my parents because of the order of protection. We tried to allow supervised visits with my parents watching and it failed miserably so I wouldn’t recommend it at all if I were you. I deeply regret even trying. Im in the process of filing for full custody with the hopes that he’ll get no or supervised visits with mandatory drug and alcohol testing.

The abuse will continue and tactics will change, they will show the good parts but don’t fall for it, because true colours with eventually show again. Remember all the bad things. Certain professionals will expect you to co-parent, one of the hardest things to do with an abuser and it can make you feel like you’re in an abusive relationship.

"Buy and read and use this book as your Roadmap. 

“How To Annihilate A Narcissist In Family Court”

They key is to carefully document everything he does. Assuming email is allowed in the no contact order, as long as it’s specifically about your child, follow the instructions in the book. 

Something that happens very often is that HE will breach the custody/ visitation order often enough that with your evidence, the custody/ visitation agreement may be severely restricted or even denied. 

You can do this; for the sake of you and your child’s long term wellbeing, you have to do everything right. Think of this as a test; you will pass and he will fail.

"Sorry for the weird title. I just read a lot of the posts here and wonder if I really belong here. I was bullied for a year, nothing absolutely terrible but he bullied and threatened and intimidated and abused me nonetheless, to the point where I knew I had to leave. When I finally told him I was leaving he shoved a pillow in my face and held it there and told me I'd have to watch my back for the rest of my life.

While he was being arrested and interrogated for the above, I fled, with our 8 month old baby. And honestly, since then (five years ago) I've never once felt like getting in touch with him. I blocked him and divorced him and had my solicitor warn him not to try to contact me. I hate him, so much. It's a very visceral feeling. Having said that, most days I feel sorry for him, because his life must have been pretty shit for a while. But that doesn't make me hate him any less, and I still feel utterly sick at the thought of ever seeing him again.

I see here so many posts of people missing their abuser or somehow wanting to reconnect. That must be or have been such a strong bond, it makes me question everything - was I even enough in love to begin with? It felt like I was but it faded so quickly when he started the nonsense and the intimidation. Now the thought of him makes me nauseous. I somehow just don't feel like I deserve to be here.

Hey guys i am a 16 year old boy from Los Angeles And i just got out of a serious argument with my mom, I have trouble sleeping due to a mental health condition called hypochondria which is basically another word for illness anxiety which is also known as the fear of getting a serious health condition or thinking u have it. Sometimes its very hard to sleep at night due to bad thoughts or being able to not sleep at all. I was also born with a blood disorder called hemophilia which just makes my illness anxiety worse. So my mom i dont think she understands me so she gets mad at me when im not sleeping, My mom has always been a nice person but these past years she has just been going mentally insane she gets super mad at when things dont go her way so my mom wakes up at 5 am everyday to go to work. so today was a day when i couldnt sleep at all due to my bad thoughts so when my mom left to work i decided it might be easier to fall asleep in her room so i get up and go sleep in her room she had forgotten something so she came back home and caught me awake and she got really mad i had dropped something on the floor in her room by accident so she told me to get up and clean it take in mind she was screaming so loud at 5 30 in the morning so i tell her to relax because the neighbors are gonna get mad and she said she doesn't  give a fuck what the neighbors things and thats when i told her to chill out (huge mistake) she got so mad she ended up picking up a vaccum cleaner hard plastic alongside steel and swung it at me and hit me right on my knee it instantly swole up and i felt major pain. I got very mad because why would she hit me that hard on my knee for no reason so in the heat of the moment i called her a bitch cause it was so messed up (second mistake) she screams at me so loud my ears were ringing GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY ROOM OR ILL HIT UR FUCKING HEAD NEXT followed by so many bad words and i was shook and scared because of my medical condition hemophilia which can cause bleeding inside arteries head exc which is super dangerous i couldnt even get up so i told her to give me a second she started counting down from 10 and i couldnt even move so i forcefully got up even with my knee hurting really bad im honestly shook she has hitten me before hard as well but today i felt over it and felt like calling the cops instantly im tired of her abusiveness but i dont want to put her in jail either so i want your guys opinion on what i should do because im tired of this and its not getting better anytime soon.

"I got into the habit of recording my phone calls with my ex because I was getting sick of him gaslighting me by claiming he or I did or didn't say something, and I'm listening to one from April 18th 2022 where he was calling me on his way to my home after he beat me the day before. At this point I had no idea he had cheated (unprotected) with his ex girlfriend a month before and what caused the recent assault was him finally admitting to ""chatting"" with a different girl online. He was talking about how his pos mom was telling him that the protective order is meant for both of us and it protects him too.... I asked him from what and he didn't elaborate. 

I also asked him what he told his mom happened and he said ""I told her I talked to a girl about nothing and you got mad and we argued and I hit you."" A complete minimization of what happened and a complete lack of accountability while painting me out to be insecure and ungroundedly ""jealous"" for no reason. 

Fast forward May 2022 and I messaged that same girl while he was remanded for the first time and she told me that she had no idea he had a girlfriend and that it was very shady and low of him to be talking to her the way they did if he had a girlfriend. In the phone call he said ""I still don't think it's a big deal that's the thing, I didn't talk to this girl about anything."" 

Meanwhile! A couple weeks before, he beat me up and destroyed my home because he saw me briefly talking to a guy at a bar while waiting for him but because I asked him to leave my home after he admitted (after months of me asking) to chatting with her and he decided to beat me, it's just framed as ""an argument because he talked to a girl about nothing"". 

When I called him out on downplaying it he hung up, called back, and said ""I told her my side of the story"" and when asking what his side was he claimed that I tried to prevent him from leaving my house and he pushed me out of the way..... The abuse was so severe that I still have hematoma's on my thighs over a year later and it all actually started due to me asking him to leave my home. 

This has been a nice reminder considering I've had a weird softness for him resurface while he's been in jail that there is absolutely not hope for him to be even a semi-decent human being and will not change.

"Please don’t feel ashamed for this. You are now in the process of healing and taking your power back. You don’t “need to learn the hard way”. You’re not stupid! I keep seeing so many people on r/domesticviolence call themselves stupid and it breaks my heart. 

Thinking of ourselves as stupid is one of the #1 ways we abuse ourselves, and in a way it enables abusers. It’s not your fault you’ve been hit and hurt so many times, but don’t commit the crimes others have done to you against yourself. You deserve better and you can actively choose to give that gift to yourself.

I’ve felt stupid too. But we all are not stupid for loving people who hurt us. Our hearts are beautiful and strong for loving violent people in spite of their flaws. As much as these hurts are cumulative and I can’t stress how much we all need to find ways to get our own spaces so we can begin to safely heal, process, and begin to thrive: we are not broken. We are not things.

You know what? You are a good and kind person who had faith that someone you loved could change. You’re starting to see now that you stayed because you thought there was something special there, or maybe you felt at the time that when he did give you love, it was better than any other love you’ve received prior. I’ve done both.

Sometimes we stay because, whether we want to admit it or not, we feel like things are as good as they’re going to get. 

Fight for yourself. We all deserve safety and love with family, friends, and hopefully when there is more healing and self-trust: partners.

You’re not weak for reminiscing. And you’re so smart for keeping those recordings. I wish I had kept some. I don’t really write daily diary entries but I’ve definitely found taking the time to write down what I experienced and how I felt in a hard moment (just keeping an intermittent journal diary) has been so damn helpful when it comes to looking back at my old thought patterns when I was trapped in certain thought cycles of self abuse.

Don't start dating someone new. That's my other advice. Not a good way to distract yourself. Therapy is where you need to process this.

"Make 2 lists.  One list of things in the relationship that are reasons you want to stay away.  One list of things you can do now (even if you don't actually do them yet) that you didn't or couldn't do while you were in the relationship.

Here is a start of my lists that may not be relevant to you:

Bad things from that relationship (big and small):  
He called me names.  
He accused me of cheating.  
I was afraid to miss a call, even for being on the toilet.  
He pointed a gun at me and my dog.  
He had sex with other women who didn't know about me.  
He asked me to shave his back.  
He didn't know how to cook.  
He always insisted that I stay at his place.  
...  

Good things after that he was gone:  
[Note, for me this was years ago, so I'm trying to capture things from that time.]  
I can make meals when I want to.  
I am so comfortable in my own apartment.  
My dog seems happier.  
I can wear what I want to wear, for me.  
I can visit my family whenever I want to.  
I can call my family whenever I want to.  
I can go out with my friends.

Yeah this happend to me. She messaged me saying basically we could keep a sexual relationship going. Before I knew it, I was moved back in. Then it went tits up again. I second this, don't think with your dick and don't think with your pussy when you're dealing with these people. Buying a hooker is literally a more viable option than going back and fucking your abuser. It's them trying to reboot the cycle.

Took the kids to see dad since his truck is still broken down yesterday and today. Yesterdays visit was okay. He thinks if we get a place of our own with just the kids and us no brother we’ll be just fine but todays visit was different. We were almost home since I gave him a ride to his moms and he insisted on me reversing because he claimed he saw a wallet on the road and when I didn’t want to reverse he snapped. Clenched his teeth and stated he wanted to hit me so when I finally reversed and he saw it was a piece of plastic he stated that I’m such a selfish person so I proceeded to drop him off and told him never to text me unless it was about the kids but he keeps calling me and texting me nice things. I don’t know how else to tell him I just want to be in strict contact for my kids and not to be with him. I put my 60 notice Friday at my apartment complex and my friend helped me get all of my stuff out but he’s being delusional thinking I’m applying at another apartment for us when I was just looking for one for the kids and i but at this point I’d rather just stay put at my parents till we can save for a house	duana03	post	30.554217766467946	female	White	0.9994601607322693	na	na	na	3	domesticviolence	no prediction.

"No thanks necessary but I appreciate it! You deserve to live in peace and contentment. Whether you’ve grown up with abuse, or begin to experience it for the first time, no one deserves to be abused. Abusers were probably abused themselves, as the saying goes, hurt people: [will] hurt people. As much as they need help, it’s not our job to fix them or help them, it’s up to us to love ourselves enough to remove ourselves from them. 

It’s their responsibility to take accountability and stop their cycle of abuse in them, until they do they are dangerous and best avoided at all costs

Good luck to you! I hope you can get lots of love and hugs from your mom and rebuild your feelings of safety and trust.

i’ve grown up in abuse my whole life. my father is a pedophile and abuser. sexually abused me for years and physically abused my mother. also emotionally/verbally abused all of us. we have been staying elsewhere at the moment but so far she’s made us stay up one night and now wants us to stay up again because she feels bad for him since it’s father’s day (boohoo poor abuser) and intends for us to fully move back despite the abuse. she has sex with him knowing he has hurt me as well and is a pedophile. what do i do? i hate him and i don’t want hum back in my life. she forces me to hug him and be around him and to stay with him. i do not want to go back but she doesn’t care. i’m still too young to work for a few months so i don’t know what to do	youredoingsowell	post	28.126360595355834	female	White	0.998306393623352	na	na	na	6	domesticviolence	no prediction.
You have been through so much! No one should be forced to be near, touch or hug their abuser, much less live with him! Your mom is the person who should protect you, but she isn’t for whatever reason. She is giving this pedophile access to you. Have you told anyone? CPS? A counselor at school? If you call a child advocacy center near you they can advise you and offer support. If you look up child abuse hotline or child abuse services in your area, resources should come up. It sounds like you have had enough and are ready to advocate for yourself!	youredoingsowell	reply	na	na	na	0.998306393623352	weak	no	strong	na	domesticviolence	failed

It must be really hard for you to feel close with your mom since all this is happening. It’s sad when adults don’t protect their kids and I’m so sorry this is happening to you! I’m glad you’re trying to get back into public school where you can potentially get some support. I hope you read online resources on child abuse, domestic violence and pedophilia so that when she pressures you, you can give strong answers as to why you aren’t going to be close with this man and she shouldn’t be either. Lots of kids go through some awful stuff growing up but still make a good life for themselves as they become independent. Would your mom be open to allowing you to see a therapist? Touching base with someone on a regular basis can be so helpful.	youredoingsowell	reply	na	na	na	0.998306393623352	strong	no	no	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.
"I’m sorry, but even though your mother sounds like a victim, she’s still instigating the situation—she illegally told you to lie to CPS. 

Here’s the thing. With CPS involved, she could lose custody if she doesn’t do her job properly and protect you and your siblings. By doing what she did she not only stopped you from getting the help you deserve, she’s giving your father more control over her (and, like I said, it’s illegal). It’s a vicious circle, but she doesn’t have the right to choose that for you. 

Will CPS come and put you and your siblings in a foster home? Possibly/probably. Will it be extremely difficult for you and your family? Yes. BUT, you are in a situation where you have to choose the lesser of two evils—how much worse will it get at home vs. what foster life will be like. 

The good news is that it could be temporary if your mom does the work of splitting from your dad, getting a job that she can support you, and gets therapy for her “demons”. That would all be on her, while you and your siblings try to find your way throughout this whole thing.

The bad news is that she doesn’t do anything, and you stay in foster care until you age out, or possibly get adopted. Or, you could go to a possible—trusted—family member, as long as they have no contact with your parents. CPS will have to do their job to ensure your safety.

It won’t be easy, it might even get harder at times, but hopefully it will be worth it in the end. Just remember—you deserve to feel safe at home. Period. 

I’m sorry for the things that you have been through. Please take them over time as harsh lessons learned that you hope to see gone in the world one day soon, and improve yourself in spite of them. It would be the best “revenge” you could ever hope for—and you will become a better person than they ever could be.

Good luck with whatever you choose to protect yourself and your siblings. I truly hope you have a wonderful life. 🙏🏼💗"	youredoingsowell	reply	na	na	na	0.998306393623352	strong	no	no	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.
possibly a few people know, coming to mind is two at least. i also accidentally got cps involved last year when i was reaching out for mental health support on a hotline but my mother told me to lie to get rid of them so they’re no longer involved. i am looking to get back into school but at the moment i don’t go to a public school so i don’t have any counsellors or anything unfortunately. i do have a family member who works with dhs though (they actually cut my mother off after finding out about this)	youredoingsowell	follow-up	na	na	na	0.998306393623352	no	strong	no	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.

I can't take another minute. I can't go through another night. 

I get beaten and verbally abused almost everyday, I am pregnant with my second and take care of my daughter all day.

He told me tonight I'm a heroin addict and a prostitute, while I don't do sex work of any kind and neither any drugs let alone heroin. I don't drink. 

I take care of my little daughter and my widowed father of 78yo, my mother committed suicide a year ago with a plastic bag and that was brutal. 

I just wish I could shoot myself dead. I am no more worth than organic waste. 

If there's a God, he created me to test how much pain someone could take. That's what I believed as a little girl growing up Christian and severely beaten and abused everyday by my drunk, junkie mother. 

That's what hurts even more about what he told me, maybe because I was recording him to avoid him kicking me again, I swore to myself no matter what I'll never be like my mother so I don't touch alcohol or drugs. He knows that of course he knows. 

She used to call me a slut and a dicksucker since I was too young to understand those words. Then she dies and he continues the tradition on me. 

I wish to have an aneurysm or an ictus, he doesn't check me ever anyway and is in the house for the baby, so I'd be able to die. 

Please, please, whatever is up there, let me die"	ttraumathrowaway	post	38.17105456033741	female	White	0.9988011121749878	na	na	na	4	domesticviolence	no prediction.
"Sorry to ask for more from you when you’re clearly going through a lot, but is it your 78 year old father that’s abusing you or your male partner/bf?

Either way, if they are physically assaulting you and there is evidence you should call the police and have your abuser arrested under charges. Then begin filing restraining orders or no contact orders. Either way you need to report this. 

I don’t believe in god. I was abused growing up while I believed in god. I don’t think you’re put here to suffer, you’re simply alive. You didn’t do anything to deserve the bad things that happened to you, you’re not being punished. The whole problem with christianity is that it kinda brainwashes you into thinking whatever misfortunes you suffer in life are due to God’s disfavor. It promotes hierarchical thinking, patriarchal dominance, and in many ways christian traditions enthrone and empower abusers. It’s not real, and you dont have to live under that spiritual tyranny.

In a strange, sad way it’s a miracle you exist at all in this time and absurd place, being alive seeing the world as it is. We may not have flying cars but there’s a lot to love about being alive today, even when it hurts so much you sometimes think you can’t possibly go on. 

If you can find a way out of abuse, and a way to your own health and empowerment, life is worth it. It’s not easy, it’s not going to ever make sense, but you can find joy and peace in quiet moments when you eventually have your own space, safe away from the people that hurt you. Eventually you can even find love and contentment as well as security, it takes time and patience and the terrible burden of learning to love yourself in spite of your flaws. Give yourself the gift of grace. You didn’t ask for this, but you can try to make something of it, that’s all anyone can ever really do.

My abusers didn’t sexually shame me in quite the same way you talk about, but I understand in part how it feels, and I’m sorry whoever is hurting you is accusing you of being someone you’re not.

Loss is very hard to process and live with. My condolences for the loss of your mother. One of my abusers is dead, it doesn’t necessarily help in a way you can instantly feel, but time and distance in years and space help a lot. The weight gets lighter as you go.

Everyone is doing the best they can with what they have, sadly this is even true for your abuser. They’re trapped in a cycle they can’t escape from, but you can choose to leave. I know with how little support there is (assuming you’re in America) it’s very hard to even contemplate leaving let alone finding the resources to do so. 

If you share some general details as to your location maybe some of us on this forum could point you to a shelter or other websites and resources you could use to contact people in your area who can help you and your children.

I’m so sorry this is happening to you, once again, you have done nothing to deserve it. I hope we can help if you want to provide some more details."	ttraumathrowaway	reply	na	na	na	0.9988011121749878	strong	no	strong	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.

"Why would I need a shelter if I pay the house, the bills, the baby and mine's expenses? 

His name is on the lease until July, then I can kick him out.

The problem if even if I bring it up, he loses it. If I just put his keys in a different room to sleep in that one safely, as I did yesterday, he literally beats me.

I would need police to assure he doesn't hurt me, and a judge to define custody (and with no official medical ER reports, there's no abuse for them in this system. Photos, videos, neither count as evidence in this shithole country).

It would be a long hard road. 

He'll get to see my daughter again, he'll get to tell everyone any horrible thing about me. 

Taking a nap, taking care of a toddler since she was a newborn all alone? 'I sleep all day'

Having low pressure issues? 'She doesn't do anything'

They (institutions) will say it's my word against his.

You'd think being in therapy weekly with a psychiatrist would look better than, you know, not going to therapy at all? Not here. 

That would ensure his twisted words for me being crazy. Why would I, an orphan of suicide and abuse, go to therapy? Obviously crazy.

"Internet Archive has an Open Library with free online access to rent books and it changed my life. I was never really reading books until I found, thanks to this and other communities, books about abusive relationships, healing, cptsd and many more. I have never encountered books that hit so close to home and that opened my eyes as these books did.  


When I was trapped in the same old psychological thinking patterns abusers installed into me, books like ""Why does he do that"" gave me a chance to restore my sanity for just one hour a day. It gave me the option to fight back by educating myself, mourning the losses and that desperately needed sanity break to see things as clear as they are. It was truly my little island of vacation I would go to when it was safe and I could afford it mentally. And when I see myself slipping into old routines I visit them and remind myself of how great life can be for myself.  


My fist book I started reading online was ""Why does he do that"", which was heartbreaking and rough to read. I came back over and over again to this book to read paragraphs. I then found other books, but could not afford them due to many reasons. Internet Archive was a the golden pot I was searching desperately for months. They don't have every book, but they have quite a lot of books. Here are some of the books that really helped me understand that I am worthy to be loved. Not all are about abuse, but helped me by introducing new ideas with which I could disentangle my mind even further from my old thinking patterns. I hope these resources can help other people to start fighting back in their own mind first.

Side note, ""Why Does He Do That? Inside The Minds of Angry and Controlling Men"" (*Lundy Bancroft*) is an AMAZING read... Hard, as in therapy-breakthrough hard, not difficult to read.

(he has also been very physically abusive to her) when she found out she kicked him out & then slept at the foot of my bed for a couple weeks/month(s?) on my birthday she made me see him and then he came back to the house after she invited him. years pass and she says a lot to invalidate what he’s put me through and continues when i tell her that it makes me feel that way. she also has sex with him (not so ironically we thought she was being raped once but apparently it is normal for her to say she doesn’t like it when they are having sex) we have moved out and now she wants to go back. everyone is calling me controlling for not wanting to go back despite me explaining how uncomfortable i am. he has beat her in both me and my siblings’ bedrooms and broke into my room to sexually abuse me (also my door is broken so i especially don’t feel safe). i am giving clear reasons i don’t want to be there and it is being treated like some dramatic stuff by everyone but it is my trauma, the stuff i’ve been through so much in my life. does she care? she continuously tells me she doesn’t care what i want about very serious things. she is making me do things with him that make me very uncomfortable. ahh i don’t know i just don’t know what to do	youredoingsowell	post	22.16276255562193	female	White	0.9989394545555115	na	na	na	1	domesticviolence	no prediction.

"I wanted to post as a sort of PSA because I couldn't find the answer to this when I needed it. 

My 3yr PFA was a 'default' ruling when my abuser was a no-show for the hearing. 

NOBODY could/would tell me how he'd be informed that it had been granted. Not even my lawyer, who supposedly specialized in Family Law. 

I am currently stuck in a neverending cycle of 3 monthly 'waiver trials' while my abuser ignores all the hoops he agreed to jump through for his plea bargain. 

He has 6 months left (of the year he was given), and 4 classes/evaluations to complete and comply with. All charges will be dropped if he jumps through said hoops. 

3 months ago, at the first waiver trial, he was given prior approval for 'non attendance' on the understanding that he was complying with all the terms of his plea. 

The only part he's complied with is the 1 yr no contact order that was tacked on to it. 

At this trial 3 months ago, I was expressing my frustration, to my ADA, at the 1yr no contact order, because I felt it was entirely pointless since there was already a 3yr PFA in place. 

She asked if I had Affidavit of Service for the Final. 

I said I had it for the Ex Parte, but not for the Final. I said I'd asked everyone how he would be served the Final and nobody had an answer for me. Even my lawyer had just said 'I think he might get a copy in the mail or something?'

I called the PD in his county so many times, they all acted stupid and like they didn't even know what I was asking. 

My ADA told me that technically my Final was not in effect unless I had Affidavit of service for it. 

That day, because he had done nothing RE his plea bargain, the judge revoked his right to non attendance. She told me to bring a copy of my Final to the next hearing so he could be served with it. That was 3 days ago, and he did show and he was served. 

So, I guess finally, 10months after it was granted, my Final PFA is fully enforceable. 

At the last hearing a few days ago, I asked my (different) ADA why in the fuck nobody had told me this PFA wasn't legally in effect without proof of service???

He said some stupid evasive shit about how 'it's not that it wasn't legally in effect, it's just that if he violates it now, then there's no way for him to argue he didn't know about it.'

Like...???

So what you're saying is, prior to this Affidavit of fucking Service, if he had violated it, he would've been able to argue that he 'didn't know about it.' So how in the FUCK is that any different from it 'not being in effect???'

So I guess I just wanted to post this here for others who may have this same question and have received a similar gaslighty lack of help. 

I swear, sometimes it's so hard to believe they didn't literally design this entire shitshow to specifically cause further trauma and gaslighting to survivors. 

There's been so many times through this entire process that I've felt there's NO WAY this is set up this way by accident. 

Anyone whose state has pressed charges will know what I mean, I'm sure. 

I know I can't post my state or location or anything, so I'll just give the disclaimer that this obviously may not be true for every state/county, but this has been my experience, and I wanted to put it out there in hopes that it may help others. 

Stay safe, everyone."	narc84throwaway	post	22.877249769965413	male	White	0.9991480112075806	na	na	na	2	domesticviolence	no prediction.
It's really annoying that nothing is posted about the legal process for charges, POs, etc. People just go through it and never speak about it like it is a taboo topic. It can be scary for people who want to pursue protection to have nothing to base anything off of, so more people sharing their experiences in detail like this are appreciated and necessary.

"It's ridiculous isn't it?

I could find no answers online, so I hired a lawyer, thinking, foolishly (apparently) that he would understand the legal processes involved in the area of law he's chosen to specialize his practice. 

NOPE. Didn't give a shit. 

Where I live, there's a statewide registry of PFAs and it's accessible to law enforcement, attorneys, firearms dealers, probation officers, and a handful of other people adjacent to those professions. 

So because my ex tore up one of my previous PFAs, I asked my lawyer to look it up in the system. 

He said there was no such system. I said yes there is, it's called the 'xxxx' system, and he said he wasn't aware of any such database, nor could he access it if it existed. 

I swear on my life, these people must have a monthly meeting about how they can make this process less accessible to survivors than it was the month before 😤"	narc84throwaway	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9991480112075806	no	strong	no	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.
"TLDR; with a ADVO in place, he unthinkingly pushed me against a wall, then later forced my phone out of my hands and deleted a recording I had of him, then lied to emergency services to make me out as the abusive person, so I've thrown him out of the house. 

For some background: my husband has a history of physical violence with me, infrequent but repeated over 7 years. The most serious incident was about 9 months ago he choked me, kind of scared himself at what he was capable of and left the house. This was the first incident I reported to police, just asking for a safe contact order and no charges; they put in a full no contact order temporarily, which I eventually got downgraded to a safe contact order, and they did press charges without even talking to me, but after eventually talking with me agreed to withdraw them. That last court case was resolved 5 days ago, I thought things would start to get less strained without the looming court case. I was wrong...  

I had been severely depressed all week and barely able to get out of bed, got upset (verbally) at him saying he wasn't supporting me or meeting my needs. Yesterday he became depressed and didn't get out of bed, but I wasn't aware of the reason because he doesn't communicate like I do, and this hadn't happened to him before while I've known him. I went to his room (we've been in separate rooms for a few months) to ask what was going on but got no response, started asking some more questions and still no response, at one point I think he said to stop but I had no idea what I was even doing so I was like stop what? He suddenly runs out of the room and in the process pushed me against a wall because I was standing in the doorway (it's a small room). I told him this is physical violence, he's broken his order; I try to talk through what I should do, should I report it, should he just turn himself in because it would look better. He agrees he's going to turn himself in, then at the last minute suddenly snaps and says he's not going to, and if I call I'm punishing him, and he's going to lie about it. His sudden flip in demeanour frightens me, so I start secretly recording (this is legal in my country). I go asking him questions to determine his thoughts, he keeps changing his story: he didn't remember what happened, he's going to tell police I'm lying to protect himself, it never actually happened, I coerced him into agreeing, then it did happen but he's still going to lie to police. We do a brief reinactment to demonstrate that his version of the story isn't possible, he had to have pushed me into the wall. Then he realises I'm recording, says i manipulated the whole conversation and goes berserk, yelling and chasing me, pins me on the bed until he can force my phone out of my hands, runs off and holds a door closed while he deletes the recording. Once I get my phone back, I immediately call emergency services and tell them what happened, he sees me and also calls them saying I've been yelling and trying to force my way into the room he's in (conveniently not mentioning he had stolen my phone and was deleting evidence). While waiting for the police, things calm a little and we talk, I agree I'm just not going to tell them anything because I don't want to ruin his life for breaching the order, so we end up not telling them what happened. After they leave, we talk a bit more and I start having flashbacks, and say he needs to find somewhere else to sleep at least for a couple of days while I work out what I should do. He says he's always been afraid of being kicked out. 

I'm not sure if throwing him out was an overreaction, since the violence was much more minimal than previously, and whether I've become too sensitive/afraid of it, or too desensitised. He's been working through an abuser program for months, and things had been improving, but then last night it not only snapped back but he seemed far more entitled and blaming me, and far more determined to protect himself at my expense. I had never heard him speak like that. But also speaking with him today, he seems to describe the feelings almost like an addiction where the pull got stronger the more he fought against it, and is really trying to change his internalised delusions and disrespect. 

I don't know what to do anymore: do I report it and maybe ruin his life (he would lose his career with criminal charges)? Do I go back and tell police I want to try pressing charges now for the choking incident? Do I not go to police but don't let him back in the house? Do I consider letting him back if he can make me feel safe again?"	one_more_statistic	post	22.162364907081173	female	White	0.9989948868751526	na	na	na	2	domesticviolence	no prediction.
He can’t make you feel safe nor can you appease him by refusing to enact consequences. How many more assaults is going to convince you that “not ruining his life” isn’t working? Press charges, report the breaches to the protective order, and stop wasting your life on a guy that isn’t going to meet your needs.

"My partner attacked me as I slept early Monday morning. It was 3am and I woke up to him biting me, I had to hit his arm multiple times to make him stop. When I tried to put distance between us he reached out and grabbed my necklace, pulling on it until the clasp broke. The dark anger on his face in that moment is stuck on replay in my head. I ran from the room and called 911. I could hear him banging things around in the room as I called for troopers to come help me. He then came out and tried to grab me and when he saw I had 911 on the phone he put his fist through the terrarium I kept in the living room. His arm was a bloody mess and he kept trying to grab me.

When the troopers came the reason he gave for the sudden attack was that he couldn't tell if I was asleep or not. They arrested him, his family paid his bail, he was out in 12 hours, and he has court next month. There is a temporary no contact order in place.

I cry every day, I think about him all the time when I'm not working. I miss him but I'm also still so traumatized by what happened. I replay it over and over in my head. The look on his face, the troopers walking through my home, taking pictures of my bedroom, pictures of me in my night clothes. 

I don't know what to do from here. He was my partner, I trusted him, he was my constant support and now it's all gone, everything came apart in an hour. Within an hour everything we had built up, all our plans, were thrown out with the broken glass. All that I had left was a scratch on my neck and a bruise on my arm."

"Not on this scale. It was more small things of control, not letting me walk away from him while shopping, always having to keep me near him. 

He would accuse me of cheating on him. One time I came home from work late and was too tired to take him into town so he slammed my car door shut and walked off (we live in a rural area) he then texted me saying I'm cheating on him with my best friend. He texted this to everyone he knew including my mother and my friend's then pregnant wife.

When he came back he held onto me too tightly and left me with a sore shoulder and ribs for a week. He apologized and said he would do better. He always apologized but never kept his promise.

Omg, I'm so sorry this happened. I can't imagine the fear and everything else u had to and still are experiencing with such a terrible event. I was asleep too this last time when I was attacked. That hurts me more than what he done which was pretty severe. I'm so sorry u had to go thru such horrors bc u def didn't deserve any of that. No one does. U shouldn't fear the one person who's supposed to be there to protect u. That should be your safe place and when it's not, where do u go then? I always got the apologies and it was gonna be better and many times the promise to get professional help which only once did we do a few counseling sessions but that didn't last. He says this time that he's fr and when he gets out he would do everything and anything he needed to as far as getting the help including counseling for himself and then once he's at a spot that he's comfortable and can manage it then he wants us to go together to tell all that's happened and what can we do to work thru everything. It seems like a perfect plan in a perfect world but idk that it would ever happen like it's supposed to. Only maybe for a couple months, or maybe a little longer since this is pretty serious, but then I think it would gradually decrease til he no longer received help and then things would go back bc a lot of his prob is not being able to tell the truth, esp accepting responsibility. That's the biggest one ; him owning up and admitting he was wrong. But idk if I can do that if I even wanna when he finally goes get out. There's so much damage and so much pain that idk if I can move past it all. I've lived my life for everyone else and have always put others first and never have worried abt putting myself first and doing things for me. I focus on my family, my kids and husband. I thought love would be enough and sometimes the sad truth is, it just isn't. My life and everything I'd ever known was destroyed too so I know how u feel. Within a few hours my whole life was changed so drastically. I'm so angry at him for all those things I forgave em for bc now all them feelings I packed away have come rushing in and taking over me and causing so many emotions. But I been doing stuff for me and it's made me feel a lot better putting myself first for once.

"Yeah, he did the same. Promised to do better, promised to work on himself, promised to see a therapist. But he would always fall back into the same behavior within a couple of weeks. Once he felt I wasn't *as angry* at him as before he would feel comfortable and confident that everything had been forgotten about and it would be the same things over again. And usually if I didn't feel like *doing it* for even a week, he'd start losing his composure.

 The week leading up to my monthly is always when I just don't feel ok in my own skin and so I don't want to be touched. But he'd take that as I was cheating on him, I must be sleeping with someone else if I'm not doing it with him for the past week. Nevermind that I work 6 days a week, up to 12 hours a day and I was always sleeping in the same bed as him every night.

The most he would do for seeing a therapist would be to call and get on the list for an appointment, make it but not say anything and never go.

I saw him today. Went to the gas station for snacks and didn't think he'd still be working there. He was. He still had that same dark look on his face. My heart jumped up into my throat and I immediately left.

Looking back this change in him started around the time I started my new job. He started to complain that we didn't have the same days off. He didn't like that I was too busy with work to spend time with him even though I tried to make time for him every night, even if it was just cuddling before bed. It was because I no longer could stay up with him til 4 in the morning when I had to be at work no later than 7:30. But I still want to hear directly from him his excuse for why he felt the need to attack me in my sleep."

"I bet that was scary running into him again tho after everything. From now on, avoid that place so u don't have to deal with him. Has he contacted u since this happened?

I dealt with the same cycles. It was always promises that were never followed thru with. And things would be ok for weeks until as u said, followed back into the same patterns. Then it would go off like that and stay that way until a year or two and I couldn't take anymore so I'd leave with the kids.

I always got on the phone with him and bc I loved him, he could always sweet talk me into coming back. I always did so I'd be gone no longer than a couple days, sometimes not even that night before I'd be back. 

He is very manipulative and thinks bc I don't say anything that idk when in reality I know usually everything that's going on but it wouldn't be worth the fight so I'd keep it to myself. Also, he has a difficult time accepting responsibility even if it's nobody else's fault but his own he will still twist it so that something happened and it wasn't his fault.

He never really accused me of cheating bc he knew I'm not the type and wouldn't do that. But it was always the worry and hurt from him doing it. He'd sweet talk other girls and get attention nmw I did so it's caused me to now feel like I'm not enough and that lying and not taking credit was more important to him then me and his ways of hurting me. 

I still wanna know what caused him to flip too and attack me while sleeping. I know some of what factored into it but can't wrap my head around how when I was at my most vulnerable state, sleeping, that he had something so evil in him that caused that. Bc I told him that u don't do anything like that to the person u love unless u have some deep seeded anger. I know life growing up was hard and he dealt with a lot he shouldn't have had to but that wasn't any fault of my own but yet he released all that hurt and anger onto me. 

Now all I can think about is everything he's done and things he's said that have made me feel so much less than a worthy person. He has created so much trauma and hurt that it's gonna take a long time to process it all and get it all untangled. Bc there's a lot of things I don't understand abt the why part.. I wanna know and I think it may help me to know. 

I think there's so many diff things I need to get out and discuss with a professional so I can work thru these. It has created many negative feelings in my life at this point and has made it harder to be positive. I feel like a lot of my years and my time that I was a doormat were wasted years and I could've done something with myself. I always put everyone else first so for once, I'm putting me first and it feels good. 

I hope he gets the help he needs just like mine bc u don't hurt ppl and cause that kind of ultimate betrayal to the ones u love most.

I’m not sure who to ask or where to put this but I’ve been free from my ex abuser for about 6 years. We are 100% no contact I don’t know where he lives and he doesn’t know where I live ext ext. However, periodically I will start getting phone calls or emails of people asking for him. Like I recently got an email for an insurance quote for him but to my email? To my knowledge he doesn’t have my log in plus he always had his own email. I’ve gotten bill collector calls for his bills and so on… is there anything I can do to stop this? Could this be considered a form of harassment? I really don’t know what to do short of just changing my number and changing my email which I don’t want to sense I’ve has this number for years and years but if it’s what I have to do I will. I do not remember his email or his phone number so it isn’t as if I can reach out and tell him to stop not that I would want to I do not want that door open again.

"When my ex was in the military I reported some of the things that happened to me and our children but only to the military. He was a high ranking NCO and his Commanding Officer decided not to prosecute him but the abuse was substantiated by an investigation from NCIS. Over time during visitations he has with our children they are incidents of neglect and threats towards me and further abuse, but the physical abuse stopped. I didn’t report any of the abuse to the civilian police. I already have physical custody but now that he is out of the military he has made it his personal vendetta to try to continue to financially harm me, and he is still having incidents with our children but they are teenagers now. I did not realize that I could report the previous abuse to civilian authorities that had already happened. Should I?

Edit: I am scared that if I don’t I won’t be able to protect myself and my kids from him because they do not take the military report seriously. He has filed many requests now and told me he intends to take the kids, not work, and make me pay him child support because “I am a lazy bitch that owes him” for being a SAHM"	hererowja	post	35.35543305885335	female	White	0.997931957244873	na	na	na	2	domesticviolence	no prediction.
"It may be worth contacting civilian police officers, but jurisdiction matters. Contact who you think would be the correct office and they’ll tell you who to contact instead if it’s wrong. They may also ask you why you waited to report the abuse to them (they asked me when I reported 3 months after) so be prepared with a response. You can simply say you had reported them to military officials and he faced no consequences even though they found evidence of it being true. 

Keep all communication to a minimum and in a documentable form. Only text, email, etc and phone calls go to voicemail. Everything can be used in court including the substantiated evidence and his hostility towards you for being a SAHM. When I text my daughters father/my abuser I imagine everything I say can be presented in court and make sure it’s nothing I wouldn’t want to appear. Others have recommended gray rock or yellow rock communication as well which is very helpful. 

You can also try reaching out to a DV shelter and see if you can find resources for legal aid. I was able to get a lawyer for free that answered every single question I had and said I could contact them any time with more questions I had. They weren’t able to represent me in court, but it helped me make sure every step I took was covered legally and wouldn’t backfire when we do finally go to court for custody."	hererowja	reply	na	na	na	0.997931957244873	no	no	no	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.
"I’ve just started a new relationship with a guy I’ve known for a decade. We lived in different states for much of our friendship so never dated. I feel he is genuine, trustworthy and wants to take care of me. He is aware of the abuse I endured from my ex in great detail and reacted appropriately, made me feel comfortable and supported. 

We live a few hours away from each other so we’ve entered a long distance relationship but he is planning to move to my city in a year. Everything seems FINE. My family and friends that have met him love him and all seem to think he is crazy about me. He is financially responsible, has pets he takes great care of, has solid relationships with his family and friends. 

I have this inexplicable feeling of sadness and dread now that I’ve entered this new and seemingly healthy relationship and I don’t know why. I don’t think it’s my correct gut feeling. I’m upset that I’m unable to allow myself to fall for him as deeply as he is falling for me and I know what happened with my ex has everything to do with it. I’m extremely scared of hurting him and of course the possibility he could be just like my ex.

So if things would go bad some day, you already know how to react and what to do.
Being aware of your support network and your strengths may give you a better feeling of safety.

Since he seems to like you a lot, I assume he will understand that you are careful, a bit scared and want to take slow babysteps."	Whyyyyytho666	reply	na	na	na	0.930293083190918	weak	no	no	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.
So I(18f) just left my ex (21m) a little over 2 weeks ago and he's been out of town for about a month and a half and I'm not sure when he's coming back. He was mentally physically and emotionally abusive and didn't have a car, job or savings. So I was supporting him, his mom and his brother with my car and just him with my income. ( His mother has no car and no job as well she lives off child support and the state) I had begged him for years to listen and change and to get a job. He didn't so I left but I can't seem to get over the fact that I will lose our dog his mother's dog and his family cat I love all these animals with my whole heart and our dog is pretty much my son but he had the dog before we got together and I have no legally rights. It s tearing me up inside knowing I will hurt them by never seeing them again I was part of the family for nearly four years. So does anyone have any advice? I've considered staying just for the animals but I'm just so torn.	ambydeer	post	43.60720389448611	female	White	0.9984968900680542	na	na	na	1	domesticviolence	no prediction.
Oh darling, I can relate. I am having to go through this right now as well. As this is happening right now and they were all mutual. I ended up rehoming them with the best people I could find that will give me updates. Everyday I have gut wrenching pains tho, that I should’ve just stayed for the animals but I remember that I also deserve peace to be what I need to be in this lifetime. I kno it’s not the same background as you, but just write and journal and understand you’re grieving loosing loving animals and what you feel is valid.

So it’s been a little under a year since my NEx strangled me, body slammed me, picked me up by my throat and threw me on the bed to continuously batter me. Afterwards, I didn’t seek medical attention because he hid my phone and tried to put me out without my phone (???) yeah I was confused in the moment. I just wanted my phone so I could go. When I found my phone he continuously played with my mind to see where I was going to take it. He pulled his gun out on me. Argued with me in a narcissistic rage the whole night. I begged and pleaded with him to stop. Woke up the next morning a completely different person. Jekyll/Hyde. Anyway fast forward to this year, Broken up and withdrawing from the trauma bond, I keep noticing a sound going off in my ear. I did some research. Tinnitus. It happens when an artery is damaged due to the stop of blood flow to the brain. I never thought I would be dealing with this but I haven’t gotten into any other physical altercations since my ex. Am I overreacting? I read that delayed effects of strangulation can last for years. Someone had this same scenario happen 3 years later. I hate to see him in this light. I want to tell him I hate Him for this.	InteractionWrong3330	post	25.38065417748652	male	White	0.9949378967285156	na	na	na	15	domesticviolence	no prediction.
"I still have PTSD and uncontrollable violent reactions to being touched unexpectedly from behind from being strangled 50 years ago. 

Tinnitus is unpredictable. With luck it will get better. For some people deep relaxation helps. But don't be surprised if psychological effects are long-lasting.

"Ok .. I honestly need to talk about something …

My boyfriend at the time , choked me & I couldn’t breathe. Wouldn’t give me my car keys. I grabbed my spare key & ran out of there all while having a panic attack. I couldn’t breathe I was panicking I had to pull over. Flash forward & I’m taking Xanax & really fucked up. I then proceed to drink alcohol. Which is then the last thing I remember til I’m waking up in the hospital with IVs & stickers all over me. Talking to some Rep about DV. I had to get a CT of my neck. I don’t remember much of anything. Apparently he called 911 & I went by ambulance. I guess I overdosed. Completely on accident. I didn’t want the cops involved or nothing. I stayed, did not leave him after that. Flash forward & we breakup a week later anyway. 
But what the point here is, is even though this was a traumatic event- it doesn’t feel like it. I literally just shrug it off. Like yep that happened. And I don’t think about it, I don’t talk about it. (Idk if it matters but I have had 3 prior bad relationships where there was DV. I was abused mentally, physically, emotionally- as a kid. Lots of other trauma.) But I don’t feel this one. 
So.. there’s something wrong isn’t there? I’m concerned. I just don’t know what’s wrong ..

"Your brain is dissociating from the reality of these situations as a way of protecting or ""preserving"" itself. Those types of situations trigger a lot of things in your body, specifically a rush of adrenaline & cortisol (stress hormones) .. Your body & brain are going through these ""traumatic"" situations over & over again, to a point where you are subconsciously ""checking out"" any time a high anxiety/high stress situation occurs. 

Massive amounts of cortisol over a long period of time can actually change your brain & the way you think & interpret situations... your brain is saying, ""hey.. I think I've been in this situation before & I got really hurt. I need to prevent this from happening."" Your brain & body go into fight or flight mode & then defaults to dissociation.

"Here’s something that’s really good you can take away from this experience: you’re present and aware right now enough to say “I should be feeling something right now, and I’m not, and that’s not okay with me.”

Assuming we’re mostly American here, but correct me if I’m wrong. There’s something wrong with our culture and how we’re all growing up and being raised when these kind of bad things happen to so many of us. Not only that, but we are then taught to shut up and shut down our feelings just to survive and grin and bear this life. 

I’ve been choked before too. It’s a horrible experience, and part of why I’m here is trying to process those events and “feel my feelings” about them because it’s almost 20 years later and there’s still something in me that’s cold and numb. I think that event had a domino effect on me emotionally/mentally and caused a lot of problems for me over the next 10 years.

"Hello all, 

TW (Mentions of abuse and dv): I am hoping to get some advice and support as I am sincerely torn on pursuing 3rd degree domestic battery charges against my ex or dropping them and moving on with my life. I'm 22 and just graduated college. I dated a guy for the past 7/8 months on and off. My ex was very troubled, he cheated and lied many times. He had a short temper, especially when he drank, but he was able to maintain a normal, outgoing personality of a 23 year old guy to friends, co-workers, and the public (Although I sensed that some of his friends, family, and/co-workers knew something was off about his behavior sometimes). If I ever tried to confront him about the cheating or lies, or we got in a fight when we were drinking he would get really angry. Started with him yelling, punching walls (he said he would never lay a hand on me), threatening to off himself, and then it escalated more. The first time it happened he pushed me, he hit my leg, and then he promised he would get help and change. Then the next time it happened he threw me to the floor, crushed my hands with his hands (he's a big 6'4 dude and I'm a very tiny and weak 5'3 girl), and slapped me across the face. Again he promised to get help and change. Two weeks before I was set to graduate college, I was at the bars with friends (my sorority senior night), and he had gone to my apartment to go to sleep for the night already, I was super drunk and being flirty with some guy, this guy leaned in and kissed me in the middle of the bar, I was not interested, but it happened and I told my boyfriend at the time, I wanted to be honest (its not like he hadn't cheated many times on me). He then destroyed my room, left, and took my keys with him, leaving me drunk and locked out of my apartment. I called him and he came back, he refused to give me my keys, and we argued. I stood outside his car on the passenger side with the window rolled down, as he was in the car in the drivers seat. We argued and at some point he said he was gonna leave (with my keys) and I was like uhm no, and then he ran over my foot. I don't know if it was intentional but it was definitely reckless and negligent. Somehow he coaxed me into getting into his car instead of screaming and crying on the parking garage ground. I begged him to take me to the ER or an urgent care, he refused, I screamed, he was driving drunk, it was a disaster, and at some point he hit me in the back of the head and my face causing a black eye. He drove to his house, I refused to go inside but he picked me up and took me inside, I tried to fight back, he pinned me down and hit me, I hit him back. At some point I tried to call the dv help hotline but they were on a 15 minute hold. Eventually I passed out in his bed. In the morning he took me back to my apartment. I texted my boss, who I am close to, she took me to the hospital. There I filed a police report. Nothing was broken just sprained, but I was in a boot for a little, and very bruised up. My parents came to my college town and immediately took me home once I graduated, home is in a different state, hours away. My ex of course tells a different story, and it changes frequently. He apologizes but not specifically for hurting me. The city prosecutor said if I want (because there is no case without me) they are going to charge him with 3rd degree domestic battery. I am torn because despite all this I do care about my ex, and he says he will ""give up"" if he is charged with anything. I also was drunk and don't want to testify. I am scared of all the lies he will tell, he is a master manipulator and gaslighter. I don't want to be cross-examined and ridiculed, victim-blamed, questioned, etc. I know the truth, I know what happened, I know what he did was wrong, I know I didn't deserve that, but people, in the Deep South especially, will victim blame and shame, I don't want to be traumatized again in a court room. A part of me just wants to not pursue charges, and begin healing and moving on. But I also want him to face consequences for his actions, I want people to know the truth, I don't think it's fair he gets to spread lies about what happened, and get off scot free. I also don't want him to be able to do this to another girl ever ever ever again. Any advice, has anyone gone through something similar, and can help me?"	jbaau2	post	23.872145991769333	female	White	0.9970952272415161	na	na	na	2	domesticviolence	ethnicity: no prediction, age: 22, gender: female, explanation: the author self-identifies as a 22-year-old female, however, no clear information is given about her ethnicity.

Moved back in to my parents but not feeling accomplished. My children don’t feel comfortable here and I also don’t. My parents have a 3 little cottage house and we barely even fit.

My parents constantly also have guests over and my children really dislike people here so I think I will take a drive to clear my head.	duana03	post	34.18549230440693	female	White	0.9993901252746582	na	na	na	2	domesticviolence	no prediction.

"Are there any fun things you and the kids could go do to clear your head & get out of the house? I know when the wallet was tight, partner and I separated and I needed to get out...id look for free stuff, id pull my hair out otherwise with 2 toddlers @ the time. We'd adventure the woods, pick flowers, walk to to the park, volunteer. Idk how old they are but even when they were little, they were happy to run around outside with me and we'd make up songs, sit outside and draw what we see...etc. hell, I had a tiny mental break and just cut down a trail in the small amount of woods we had for a whole day and sat the kids out. Ofc We'd come in for food and potty but I got the best sleep that night and so did they.

I had to live in my abusive parents house for a few months with little to nothing. I kept them outside as much as I could because I couldn't stand to be stuck in there and was so worried about their influence. Not sure where you live but a lot of places offer free stuff online like FB & freecycle, free local events, look into ride sharing if transportation is an issue as well. Id get stuff dropped off like free sidewalk chalk, other art supplies, gardening supplies,  and toys that way until we could move on - from folks on freecycle and nextdoor. One of my very favorites was taping a slab of paper down and letting them stomp and roll around in finger paints and hose them off.

But at the end of the day I still felt trapped. I still felt trapped when I got out of that environment. Sometimes I think that maybe I dont thrive in long-term relationships in general. The kids, now teens, still do really cool things and I love doing stuff with them but I struggle very much so with my parents and grandparents and even my partner (we ended up staying together). Sometimes I just need some space to breathe. Life is good, & better now but sometimes I still have that feeling of loss and no direction or place.

"This is a question I have had for a while, and idk if this is really the best sub to ask this on, but its the closest I could find so here goes nothing.

When I was about five, I was at my cousin's house. I was rlly close with both of them, but the youngest boy (8/9 years old at the time maybe?) was the one I usually played with. I remember at school the week before they had been teaching us about consent with family members and friends, and how if you felt uncomfortable, to say something, but in this situation I felt like ""oh it's my cousin he's nice it's okay if I don't feel comfortable, my parents are here too"". First mistake.

Anyway, we had been running around the house and playing, and he dragged me into an upstairs room that we weren't supposed to be in, and then pulled me into a dark closet. He then proceeded to hug me for a very long time and repeatedly say ""I love you"". This wasn't the bad part. The only strange part about this was at this point in time, in the dark, I actually felt uncomfortable, but as a five-year-old girl who loved her older cousin and had never really heard him express that much emotion or say, ""I love you"", I wasn't about to be mean and tell him to stop. Looking back, things could have gotten a lot worse in that closet.

Fast forward a few minutes, and we were called downstairs to watch a movie. Right before we went in, he asked the question, ""do you want to feel each other's private parts? We can take turns. I will touch yours then you can touch mine.""

Now being a young curious girl who had never even seen a penis before, of course I said yes. So there we were under the covers in a room full of our siblings/cousins who were watching a movie while we were doing.. that. I remember I was interested to know what a penis was like, so I was okay with touching that, but I didn't really feel very comfortable when he touched me. Though I just let him because I was too curious. I also remember he was very much hard and he kept apologising for it, though I didn't know what it meant and didn't really care.

After this whole ordeal, my mother and aunt actually came and asked if we had been doing that, but I have always been a very good liar, so of course they just believed me when I said no and nothing else happened.

It has never been mentioned between us since, and sometimes I wonder if he forgot. But considering he was much older than me at the time and I still remember it, I'm sure he does too.

Now here comes my question, was I SA'd by my cousin? We were both very young at the time, nowhere near the age of consent, but I really just felt kind of pressured to agree because it was my older cousin and I loved him, and he was being openly affectionate towards me for the first time and I didn't want to ruin it. He was also definitely old enough to understand that he was manipulating me in some way, as I was so young.

I still have so many questions and no answers, because until I post this, as far as I know, he and I are the only ones who know this happened."	-throwaway-alt-	post	26.461834849829007	female	White	0.9952797889709473	na	na	na	3	domesticviolence	ethnicity: no prediction, age: 20-30s, gender: female, explanation: the author self-identifies as a female, along with the detailed recall of a childhood memory implies an age group of early 20s-mid 30s. there is no specific indication of ethnicity.

"I experienced something similar when I was little and it left some deep scars. The worst thing about it was that when it happened it was really upsetting and scary but I didn’t understand what happened to me, at all, but as I grew up and as I learned more about sex and also violence I just kept being retraumatized over and over again as my memories were recontextualized.

It was awful.

I learned later, as an adult, that the child who hurt me his father was accused of being a child molester. I don’t blame the child, at all. I also learned that it’s incredibly common for children with PTSD to act out their trauma in play. It’s just that their trauma ended up hurting me and they were too young to understand the consequences of their actions.

It’s called “child on child sexual assault” or CoCSA in the literature, by the way, if you’re looking to learn more about what happened to you."	-throwaway-alt-	reply	na	na	na	0.9952797889709473	no	strong	no	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.
"I don't think one is able to make an assessment of an  8/9 year old as having the ability to harbour methodical malicious intent or the ability to understand manipulation- he was likely guided by instinct and motivation created from his own trauma. 

You were a victim of SA yes but it was not by an adult, nor even a teenager. I'm sure you feel anger which may lead to villification of your cousin and though your feelings are valid (as all feelings are valid just not necessarily grounded) the reality is he was also a young child and the people to blame are your aunt and mother as no 5 year old is capable of being a good liar to a good parent- they were either deliberately negligent due to a lack of any concern for their children's welfare in general or they knew what was happening and didn't care to intervene because they thought it was harmless. 

Also you need to reflect on why you didn't feel safe sharing what happened to you with your parent REGARDLESS of your cousin, even if you were motivated by protecting him why was there no trust in your ability to tell your mom when something felt wrong. A mother opens a door to a closed closet where her child and cousin are very close in the dark, asks what's going in, you say ""nothing"" and it's dropped? Truly seems like she didn't care in that moment, not that you were a good liar resting on your laurels of ""lying well"" to grown adults as a 5 year old, a good parent that cares feels their children's emotions and is concerned about them. 

I agree with the other commenter that both of you need therapy as it is clear he must've been exposed to some type of sexual abuse and/or grooming behaviour as well and perpetuating the cycle of abuse as it was clearly normalized to him at a very early age."	-throwaway-alt-	reply	na	na	na	0.9952797889709473	weak	no	no	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.
"So I'm a 23 female and I just need someone that doesn't know me or my life tto talk to about all of this. I need help piecing everything together to see how bad the relationship really was.

For the sake of privecy, I'll refer to my ex throughout this as Vic.

I met Vic six months ago through a mutual ex friend, I was new to the city and literally just got out of the mental hospital myself. We talked on the phone at first and after a while, I asked if he wanted to hang out. Really it wasn't like I had anything else to do and I was pretty much homeless at that point.

This is how the probllem starts

literally after talking in person after like four or five hours, he asks me to marry him. I had colmly explained how I was married before and she tuurned out to be very abusive, so marrriage wasn't something I wasn't just going to jump into right away again. He understood, then asked me again a few days later in front of people.

"I’m not judging you at all so please know that. 
I wasn’t far off from your position after leaving and abusive ex. 
Most research will tell you that a man proposing after 5 hours of talking is a big red flag.  Most people who do are abusers looking for a “weak” target, someone getting back on their feet. 

I’ve also Learned the hard way that once you marry an abuser, you can’t date like regular relationships. You have to be very picky, slow and date after you’ve healed and settle. 
My abuse was so bad that it took me 5yrs of healing just to begin dating. Then, I married another one who was worse. Now it’s been 7 yrs. We have to do the trauma work. 

It sounds like what best is to focus on you! I’m sorry you’re struggling, it’s a hard road but I can tell you there is another side. I can tell you that if you have zero doubt that you can save yourself, provide for yourself and be content living by yourself, then nobody will ever be able to trap you into anything or convince you that you can’t leave. 

How bad was it? It sounds like you two aren’t on the same page. He wants what you don’t.  So that’s even enough. Every form of abuse is unacceptable. You deserve the most respect. 

Please don’t follow in my steps. It’s so much worse the second time and divorce is traumatic anyway. Keep healing. Keep protecting your peace. You’ll find happiness"	notatyourservice	reply	na	na	na	0.9846993088722229	weak	strong	no	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.

"Looking at how bad it was can sometimes make trauma worse. Can you switch your lens to where are your gaps? What do you need or want so badly that you might be willing to compromise your needs? Where do you feel the lines start crossing? Are there ways you can meet those needs without a partner?

Sometimes if we see ourselves as 'good people' we want to see others that way too, even when there's no evidence. Anyone can say they understand, or they accept your position, but where's the evidence?

Did you grow up in a strict or religious home? Looking at this & your general belief systems can help with unraveling past circumstances.

Sometimes wanting to go over the relationship keeps one occupied and distracted from looking at why we ever went into it at all, or why we didn't leave in the first place.

How do you feel about conflict, what are your perceptions and past experiences there.

In looking at where you stayed when you knew you didn't like something, knew you didn't want something it can be empowering to take a new angle instead of how bad they were, but how much better your future can be and what relationship skills might help for future experiences. It's pretty normal to doubt and question things after relationships like this, developing a stronger relationship with yourself and what you do know deep inside can help a lot."	notatyourservice	reply	na	na	na	0.9846993088722229	no	no	strong	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.

"hi all, i posted this on another sub but i’ll just copy and paste. im making this post because i don’t really know what else to do or who will just hear me out. my partner and i do not have a healthy relationship. my partner is very controlling, he insults & curses at me all the time. today was the second time we have ever gotten physical with each other; the first time was a few months ago, we were in a hearing argument & i went after him first pushing him telling him to stop saying what he was saying. after this, he pushed me back and was trying to take my phone from me. he tackled me to the ground so i started kicking to get him off of me, we went back & forth until we stopped… then he slapped me. i can’t remember the exact initial cause of the argument, but just know it was over something as stupid as what i’m about to say. 

my boyfriend was upset because i wouldn’t let him take the entire comforter to himself last night when we went to bed. he slept on the couch for a little bit but eventually came back in, i agreed to give him the sheet but still wanted to share the comforter. he got all mad & got up to leave the room, this is where it gets hard to remember what exactly happened. from what i remember, he got up & was saying mean things, so i started leaning up in the bed & he pushed me down. i know i should probably just have left it at that, but it made me so angry so i pushed him back into the door. that’s when it kind of just became a pushing match, but he pushed me so hard i lost my balance & ended up on the other side of the room having knocked over a clothing basket. i went back after him & eventually ended up pushing him back into the mirror with my foot & it broke. he hit me on the head, slapped me again, put me in a chokehold etc… i bit his arm really hard that i broke skin on my lip. then we were just arguing and arguing, him saying he is going to get a restraining order on me.

i don’t know why i find it so impossible to end this relationship. there have been so many times where i have had the chance to leave - including right now - but i still don’t want to. he is sleeping but said he is going to take all his stuff when he wakes up, and i just really don’t want that to happen. we are supposed to"	takemefromhere	post	13.474911672175228	female	White	0.9982274174690247	na	na	na	5	domesticviolence	no prediction.

"Hi - new to the sub but wanted to intro with some hope for anyone who's still in a bad place. I was married to a violent narcissist for 18 years. He beat me, he raped me, he cheated on me, he gaslighted me into thinking everything he did was my fault and finally in the summer of 2016 he tried to kill me. Our then eleven year old daughter called the police and saved my life. That was my rock bottom. The police gave me an emergency protective order, I got a temporary one and then a 3 year one that I renew. He went to jail. I have sole custody in what my attorney says is ""the most restrictive custody order she's ever seen."" I haven't seen him in person since I won custody in early 2017. He took a plea at his bench trial for time served on the condition he left the state. He didn't attend the divorce hearing - I went straight from the courthouse to the DMV and took my maiden name back. 

Starting over was the most difficult and most rewarding thing I've ever done. I got out. So can you.

"I don’t know if this is allowed , if not that’s okay! I left a comment in an askreddit thread about something like “what’s the worst thing you’ve put your body through?” And I just felt like I needed to put it here. Where people understand more maybe. The grip that my child’s father had on me was crazy, and only now can I see it for what it was. I finally realized how much of a scumbag he was , and the lies he would tell and the times he would try to gaslight me were laughable. Im just gonna leave it here. 

I’ve battled a lot but I think what messed my body up the most was the abuse from my child’s father. It wasn’t even so much physical abuse. I mean it was , at times. Maybe only 4 physical incidents within the 3 years we were together. I was dragged by my necklaces and choked and head butted and such. I had bruises and black eyes, but compared to the psychological impact this man had on me that was light work. When I did leave and took our child multiple times , I felt like I needed him. Like he was a drug. I physically could not function without him. If he was not there and I was not getting his attention , I did not know how to breathe. It sounds insane if you haven’t gone through it. How could you ever NEED someone like that? He knew what got to me. He knew I was vulnerable. He knew what to say that would really get to me when he was angry. My body has never taken as much shit as it did when I was with him. The constant anxiety , the rushes I’d get from when we were okay and he would love on me and the sex and him begging for me to come home. Eventually I realized it was all a game and I did not need him and neither did my son. It’s insane to think about but when you go through it you know , i had struggled with alcohol before I got pregnant and I thought that was bad enough , I never craved anything in my life as bad as the “love” from my child’s father. Looking back it seems stupid , but in the moment it was the most intense feeling I’ve ever felt. Even now my anxiety is constant , I crave the rush I got when we were “okay” and I came home and he was this amazing person, but none of that is worth putting my son through any of it. It was a constant battle between my mind telling me I need to get out and my body physically aching for his presence. I don’t wish it on my worst enemy."

"1. What advice do you have?
2. Does anyone know what happens when a shared mortgage is involved?

Please read everything to understand the context, I know it's long but the details are important.

Background:

My mom has been with an abusive partner for nearly 18 years. As I was growing up during my teens (my actual dad and my mom got separated for unrelated issues) he was very nasty to her verbally, would boss her around and would randomly pop up at the stores or restaurants or places we would be which I always thought was bizarre. I couldn't stand him and let that be known very early on, but my mom always seemed so happy go lucky and nonchalant about his behavior chalking it up to just him having a bad attitude. I didn't see it that way.

I always had an inkling that he was potentially physically abusive on top of the nastiness and over possessiveness, but I never witnessed physical abuse. I've been living a regular adult life and my mom and I have a good relationship, but I never really engaged with my mom's partner because something was always off about him to me. 

Recently:(this past December),

My mom finally started talking about some things that broke open a dam of truths. This man has been involved with many other women over the course of their relationship. My mom wants to separate from him after learning this, but she also still cares about him, feels bad for him etc.... Well he recently strangled another woman (one of his side chicks) to unconsciousness. He was convicted of the charge and only got 3 years probation with a gps monitor. After this conviction my mom started finally admitting that he would get physical with her, has told me he has forced her to stay in her room, taken her phone away from her, put a tracking device on her car, calls her over 150 times if she doesn't answer within 10 minutes, shows up at her work etc... I'm not surprised with the information, just upset. My mom hasn't called the cops once during this 18 years when he would do any of those physical/false imprisonment type things. I understand that being the victim is complex because she states she feels bad, misses him, still cares about him etc...

Now, my little sister lives with my mom (she's an adult (26) and the other day my mom was working from home due to her work losing power. My sister had to go to her job and randomly couldn't find her car keys right before she was leaving for work. My mom told my sister to to take her car since she was working from home, so my sister did. Well apparently my mom's partner was tracking my mom's car because he came into the house and immediately attacked my mom saying my sister and her were pulling one on him. He grabbed my mom, pulled her hair, slammed her against the wall etc... there are text messages from him saying he was going to kill her because she wasn't where she was supposed to be. My sister was actually on her way home when the attack started and when she got home she heard the commotion. This man tried to tell my sister to stay out of it and that they were just having a conversation, my mom actually called 911 and he was trying to get her to call back and say it was a false alarm. My mom didn't call back and now he's in jail. He cannot contact my mom due to an injunction automatically filed. His son just came to their shared house while my mom was gone to get his father's clothes and other personal belongings and my mom happened to come home to him in the house. He told my mom that his dad's in jail because of her and for her to just leave his dad alone. (Like, excuse me, but his dad is the one that did this to himself?!)

My mom is saying she is actually going to press the charges now and he is in violation of his probation of the previous charge only a month into his 3 year probation. They have assessed his bond at only $5,000 for my mom's charge, but no bond assessed for the violation of probation.

My mom and him also share a mortgage. After his strangulation charge, my mom wanted to sell the house and try and move on, but they share the house/mortgage. He did sign to have it listed and agreed with her at an earlier timeframe.

Now with all of this background I have a couple of questions and would love any advice to help my mom (and me) through this as I'm terrified he's going to be released and actually kill my mom or sister for putting him back in jail due to statistics. It's really anxiety inducing for me as I lost my father suddenly 3 years ago due to an accident (he was only 54) and my only immediate family is now my mom and my sister who lives with her.

"I had a TRO. My ex had called a wellness check on me in the middle of the night. However, little did he know I was actively on the phone with a friend when he called the wellness check on me. My ex claimed to have a voicemail of me being suicidal. The police came to my residence, tried to forcibly hospitalize me, I refused to go, I passed the wellness check (my friend was on the phone for all of this), and my ex never sent the police the voicemail he claimed to have. 

The next morning I got a TRO. My ex then kept delaying court. Two months laters, we finally get to court. I have my phone records and the phone record of my friend. I also have the police report from the wellness check. I had asked my lawyer that we have the responding officers as a witness, my lawyer felt that was unnecessary. 

Thirty minutes before court, my ex's lawyer discloses a recording to my attorney of a recording my ex is claiming to be me, during that time I was on the phone with my friend, of me being suicidal. My ex's lawyer claims I have a second phone and that's how I left the voicemail. 

I do not have a second phone. My lawyer believes this recording is me, and instead of going for a FRO, tells me I have to settle so I have some protections. I am hysterical. I know the recording is not me, I explain that over and over. My lawyer will not believe me. The judge will not allow court to be delayed again because my ex delayed court for 2 months. So I had to settle. 

In the 2 weeks since the settlement, my ex has violated 3 aspects of the settlement. I bring these issues up to my attorney. My attorney ignores me. 

What am I supposed to do? It seems like every since this recording was played, my lawyer does not believe or respect me. Even though I have proof I could not have left that voicemail.

Lawyers can be untrained and ill-equipped in handling domestic violence cases, especially when clients have a lot of trauma.

If you think the relationship is at all salvageable (because starting over with a new attorney is expensive) I would suggest consulting with a different lawyer - paying cash for an hour or two of their time, and then possibly bringing that information or those ideas back to yours. This also might give you a feel for what the change could be like and where to go next.

get a new layer cause that fucker needs to be on your side. might need to find a way to disprove the recording. find out what date that was taken, where did he acquire the recording, gonna have to call the friend as a witness in court, and you'll need an alibi. i've had to call on my ex before for self harm and the cops and first responders take it super seriously. However, depening on the state you live in, they can't do anything if you pass that initial wellness check. So, something weird is going on if your ex is still insistent on weaponizing the law like that.

"I've been having some seriously messed up nightmares about my ex. I wake up in a cold sweat and I am shaking. I am thinking that the recent divorce hearing that didn't happen has been triggering them. 

I know a lot of people will frown at this admission, but I've been seeing someone new for a couple of months. He is kind and so genuine. He is survivor of domestic abuse as well. We have formed a close friendship before anything romantic ever came into play. He is a good friend of my extended family. He is older than me and shows genuine concern for my well-being. I can use my phone to take a phone call, look at social media, etc without fear of being yelled at, having my phone taken from me, or hit for using it. I have always been vague with anyone who has asked about the violence I endured... I want to type some of it out here, in a safe space, so I can finally put them at rest.

1. My ex would lock me in our home when I didn't have to work so I couldn't leave and nobody could enter except him. He used drywall screws to screw the 1st story windows shut from the outside. He used wood putty to conceal the screw heads and painted over the putty so they would blend.

2. He replaced the dead bolts on both doors to the type that required a key to unlock them and refused to allow me a key for them. When he came home I was locked inside. When he left, I was also locked inside.

3. I was instructed to never wear makeup, paint my fingernails or toenails, never to cut or color my hair and dress very modestly at all times.

4. If I ""got out of hand"", ie: stood up for myself, he would lock me in our basement. A basement that snakes were frequently found to have gotten into. He knows I'm terrified of snakes. I made sure to seal that basement up as much as possible while he was at work, one day, to prepare for the future. I even kept a sleeping bag and extra pillow hidden in an old Coleman cooler. I put an old garden hoe close by so if I had to kill a snake I could. Once while locked in there, he was upstairs and was screaming about what he was going to do to me when he finally decided to let me out. I used that time to as quietly as possible, remove the staircase from the doorway so he couldn't get to me. When he opened the door and realized what I had done he said he was impressed but I'd really pay for it, and I did eventually. 

5. He wouldn't allow me to have my own vehicle. I wasn't allowed to go anywhere alone unless given specific instructions, and I would have to remain on the phone with him via Facebook Messenger video the entire time. 

6. He knew prior to our marriage that I had dated outside of my race and have 1 multiracial child. He said he had no issues with it. However when he was drunk, he wanted to hang confederate flags everywhere. He enjoyed saying racial slurs to me and said that all black and brown people should be hung until dead including my child.

7. He wanted me to have my tubal ligation reversed to produce him a child. I had the tubal ligation due to severe health issue and could die if pregnant again. Not to mention I already was in my 40s by this point and a grandmother. 

8. Every relationship he was previously in was never his fault. Everyone was either a thief, a cheater, or plain dumb.

9. I would endure hours of him recalling past sexual conquests, nitty gritty relationship details, and slandering those poor women. If I mentioned an ex it was because I wanted to sleep with them again and according to him, probably was.

10. He went to our shared doctor and stated he wanted tested for every STD possible, due to me supposedly cheating, because he had a rash around his genitals.

This topic is something that I am always trying to learn more about because growing up my mom was heavily abused by my father and even though I help at safe homes and shelters every week I still feel like I should know more, and I never want to sell someone’s experience short. So if you have a story I’d love to listen.	JustJuju__	post	10.265626623910334	male	White	0.0019258838146924973	na	na	na	3	domesticviolence	no prediction.
yes. in my experience  a little violence went a long way.  so it was mostly emotional and financial.  it has taken many years to heal and it still hurts.  we become the people we are around, and I didn;t want that to be me.

"My father abused me physically, and abused my family mentally/emotionally from when I was about age 4 on. 

He owned two safes full of guns, and was one of those original “Proud Boy” types back during the Clinton administration when gun control was just a conversation topic and not anywhere near legislation. 

He constantly talked about killing people he didn’t like, abused animals, alcoholic, probably did meth but I never found any in the house. He worked a blue collar job surrounded by some of the most disgusting misogynistic perverted men you could think of. He frequently practiced parental alienation trying to turn me against my mother and told me things about their private life no parent should ever tell a child. I was constantly emotionally monitoring and traumatized to hyper-vigilance from an early age. He was also tremendously racist and homophobic and would threaten and chase off any black person that came near our house. 

I’m weirdly resilient to all of this. In a fucked up way I seem so calm and normal but my trauma manifests in constant physical anxiety I am now medicated for. I only started meds a few years ago and I can’t believe I went so long living in continuous dread. 

My dad died of an alcoholism induced heart attack over a decade ago. I still have dreams about him glaring at me. He had the darkest brown eyes, almost black and they would bore into you and you could just feel he was mentally killing you when he set his gaze like that. 

The hardest thing for me is while I look more like an even mix of him and my mom, I still look like him. My eyes are dark too, sometimes when I look down at my hands I see the same hands that tried to choke the life from me years ago. 

I wish I knew how I could help more people like me and make a decent living doing it. All the social programs in America are so fucked I feel like if I tried I would age 10 years in 3 from being constantly exposed to things that are probably worse than what I experienced. One of my friends worked with a few different foster programs and parental supervision programs years ago and they gave up because it was too much, and they had a pretty ok childhood."

"I lost both my parents within a few months of each other and didn’t realize how heavily it impacted me. I met my husband shortly after my mother passed. He’s 26 years older than me and I didn’t realize the control dynamic at first. I think I just wanted to be loved, and at first I felt that. We got married and moved away and now I’m stuck. He’s abusive in every way, and I’m pregnant with nowhere to go and absolutely nobody to turn to. Everyone thinks it’s so easy to just get up and leave. It’s not. It’s not easy to just report it, especially when they put on such a front for everyone else and are in a position of power at their work. I have no friends and my only family member is a brother who is an addict and lives several states away. 

I’ve been doing online surveys for a week trying to earn cash to escape. I’ve made $6. I live in a super rural town in the middle of nowhere with no good resources. If I left and started walking it would take me at least a full day to get of anywhere that MIGHT be able to help. 

I feel lost and alone and so wish I had a parent I could call to say hey can you please sent me a couple hundred dollars to get out of here.

"I asked advice a couple days ago as my daughters father flew in town for the first time since I’ve left and it’s safe to say that it did not work out at all. We tried to do them a favor to let them see our daughter supervised by my parents (I have an order of protection) because there’s no custody agreement in place. They bought the plane tickets and picked dates without checking with us and didn’t tell us until 2 weeks before. 

His parents don’t believe that he abused our daughter or me and insist that I’m making it up. We had the supervised visit in their hotel lobby as they requested and the first thing his mom did was berate my mom for instigating me to leave and how I never planned to raise our daughter with her son. It got bad enough the hotel staff had to intervene and check to make sure my mom was okay. They want to keep her overnight which is when the abuse towards our daughter mostly happened so I of course don’t feel comfortable with it. Finally yesterday he told me they were going to buy a car seat and would take her and give her back when they’re ready and that I needed to stop expecting my parents to supervise. 

So now I feel like my only option is to not give her to them because I don’t know if they’d actually give her back. I’m scared that my parents would go to supervise and they would still refuse to give her at the end of the day. I think I’ve done a pretty solid job at yellow rock communication and have done everything I can with the situation we’re in, but it has really taken a toll. Our daughter used to wake up screaming inconsolably and stopped doing it a few weeks after moving out and she’s started again since seeing them. I’m starting to have dreams about the whole ordeal and I haven’t felt this stressed since I left. 

The worst part is that I still feel bad that they flew all the way out here and will only get to see our daughter for 2 of the 7 days because of everything that happened."	Fragrant-Ingenuity49	post	58.79832491557026	female	White	0.9994719624519348	na	na	na	7	domesticviolence	no prediction.

"Hello all, 
I’m writing from a throw away account to protect my family member who is in the midst of a scary situation. My close family member is  divorcing her partner after 40+ years of marriage (abusive the entire duration). She already has a P.O. on her ex and thankfully is working with a justice center/advocate very closely. I’m so proud of her I feel like she has taken many brave and safe guarding steps to protect her life. 

Naturally, as the divorce process ramps up and her noncompliant ex starts to feel the burn so to speak, the  flame has only (predictably) enraged him. He has now recently stormed the courthouse demanding to speak to a judge to get the P.O. dropped (what an idiot), aside from barely escaping being arrested, communication from him through her lawyer is that he wants the order dropped and to just “talk to her”. Um no. I’m terrified for her. She has a plan in place. When words like “escalation” is involved how safe does a P.O. really commit? He already has multiple violations he is being pursued for but it seems so futile. Many family members who don’t understand seem to think all of this is relatively harmless. I’m just scared for her."

"I don’t exactly know how the system works in the US, but I would first go to the child protection services and from there on they would be able to assist you. 

I would also tell them your other parent is also being abused and in danger so they don’t do anything which might make the abusive parents hurt the other one. Then the police would have grounds to act in a more secretive way as to not endanger your abused parent. 

I would also ask if I can stay somewhere else for the meantime since you don’t feel safe at home. As for your abused parent, it’s normal they don’t see directly what trash your other parent is, but you won’t change anything by enabling this situation. Do what is beter for you and the abused parent will most likely eventually realise that they need to give up on this person. Be easy on yourself, be kind and remember you did everything you could. You cannot change anyone and especially not an adult with authority over you. They need to come out of it themselves. So don’t let the abused parent hold you back. 

Eventually contact some time of pet care which could house your pets for the meantime, if you’re worried about them. 
I really hope your abusive parent will be evicted.  See if you can ask for a restraining order. I don’t know of which age you are, but if you’re showing that you’re not safe with this person and are scared for your safety I think they will do this.

"I think my intention of sharing my most recent dating experience is to help validate others who have had bad experienced dating after DV, as well as maybe to hear some validation myself. 

&#x200B;

Content warning: SA. 

&#x200B;

I am a DV and SA survivor. Last November I met someone who I was excited to get to know more. He was very focused on his mental health, a huge advocate for therapy (and was in therapy himself) and had good long lasting friendships. These were all green flags to me (eventually I found out that he only had female friends). We began dating and things got pretty intense pretty quickly, but it was still a slower pace than the love bombing I had experienced before and we both communicated about wanting to go at a good pace. He specifically said he didn't want to ""love bomb"" me. He knew all the key terms. Again, I thought this showed awareness on his part and was encouraged. 

&#x200B;

I don't know how to explain it. But about 2 months into dating, something in my gut just felt off. I pushed through it thinking that maybe this is my trauma rearing its ugly head, as things with us seemed solid so far. We had met each others friends, we enjoyed doing things out and about but also just spending time together talking. I felt adored, safe, and respected. But something just was off. 

&#x200B;

Eventually minor boundary pushing behavior started to show up, then some subtle lies. He also became very weirdly invested in my life and started to pick up on all my mannerisms and ideas and activities and adopt them as his own. I noted these as red flags, but he has his own trauma and to be honest after trauma we all of stuff we could work on, and he was actively working on his stuff (therapy). And when I called him out on pushy behavior sometimes (not every time) he would thank me for it rather than getting mad. 

&#x200B;

The feeling in my gut never went away though, and eventually I called things off with us. I wanted to practice listening to my gut, even if my mind wasn't on board. 

&#x200B;

Time went by and I really doubted if I had done the right thing. We felt so good together in so many ways, laughed so much, and we both just adored spending time together. I was going through something difficult one day, and he offered to spend the evening with me to process things. It felt sweet and I didn't feel unsafe with him, so I said yes.  That evening he forced himself on me. I was so confused. I confronted him about it a week later and he cried and owned up to it. Said he wanted to do and be better for me and tried dating me. His behavior became very intense and intimidating and I had to go no contact.

&#x200B;

It was all very confusing. Out of all of this, I think what I keep going back to is that gut feeling I had, and the anxiety that I had when I didn't know if I could believe that gut feeling. I hate that it turned out to be right. "	94fireyfoxy	post	32.24207115744744	female	White	0.013775241561233997	na	na	na	2	domesticviolence	no prediction.

What? Of course it will hurt your case. How could it not, OP. They aren’t going to help BOTH of you with housing, is she aware of this? When she called the DV shelter, she had to have claimed that she was trying to escape from a domestic abuse situation, where she was being abused by her significant other, meaning you. So they are only interested in helping her, my friend. Once she drops the charges they are going to move on to a person who legitimately needs to leave their abuser, who might actually be killed otherwise. Your wife…totally took advantage of and actually abused the system that is supposed to protect people who are truly in danger of loosing their life! When people screw around like this, it makes it so much harder for others who are in real jeopardy to be taken seriously, and to get the help they desperately need. She should be ashamed of herself. I hope you can get all of the charges erased from your record, not just dropped. Sorry for the lecture, OP, but this kind of shenanigan frosts my butt for real.

Has anyone else had issues with their abuser getting away with breaking the restraining order any which way they can? The local police scoff at me and pretty much victim shame me whenever I call them on an issue. It's so disheartening. I feel like they think I'm a joke because I no longer have the bruises visible and they don't see the rest of the emotional, financial, psychological and verbal abuse as real.	live2run86	post	32.08903115707041	female	White	0.9993748068809509	na	na	na	13	domesticviolence	no prediction.

Document document document. Restraining orders can only do so much but keep at enforcing your boundaries. DO NOT GIVE THE ABSUER CHANCES. They already had it. Tell them what they can not do in terms of your physical space. I tell mine, do NOT come near me (we have children together). Do not come to my home. You I will not tolerate it. When he does, I file a restraining order. I got blamed for the abuse when he injured me so bad, I had to go to the hospital. CPS said, I KNEW he was violent, cause it happened before. They are right. I did. Never thought I be blamed for trying therapy, trying church, trying trying trying. CPS is morally and ethically terrible in my case-but I did know. I just thought he wouldn’t do it with help. I was wrong. But I don’t blame myself. I just had to actually ENFORCE any boundaries.I go about everything now differently because of my negative interaction with CPS. I put in my divorce decree, if there was another incident of domestic violence I can leave without the courts permission and maintain my parenting time-I get 70%. That means kids are coming with me. I am excercising that order this summer. I have had to have 2 restraining orders. One from him running up to me and yelled in my face. Another him coming to my neighbors house to pick up the children although the restraining order said he can’t come to my house. He sat behind me at church. He withdrew money from my bank account without telling me. He cut off my car insurance and never told me although it was settled in our divorce that it was my insurance and I had till Jan 2022 to renew. He cut it off in October—didn’t tell me, someone side swiped me-their fault, in Dec. but it’s a no fault state so you have to go through your insurance company. I found out when I filed, I had no insurance, my car still isn’t fixed until this day. Abusers don’t understand boundaries. They want to control you and are willing to violate your boundaries regardless if there’s an order or not. A judge told me. She wouldn’t allow another one if I filed-Great, now I get permission to leave the state.

I know don’t your state/county laws so I can’t say for sure, but in NYS you’re a granted an order of protection. Mine expires when my son is 18. I ex spend two years violating this order from prison; every violation is up to 7 years in prison for contempt.

Thank you!  It’s been 2 years so far.  I haven’t been reporting the violations because I learned that the police wouldn’t help me and I’ve learned that it’s gotten worse, he’s gotten more crazy, and I’ve become more isolated.  I can’t have any friends or family, and I think he will go after my work soon.  I just reported it all to the police and demanded that someone help me and I’m going to call steps (my local DV) to ask for a victim advocate.  Ive been going through the family court process but it seems like they will try to give him visitation if possible and it’s hard for me to even get a word in in court, to explain what’s going on.  I’m going to read then “how to annihilate a narcissist in family court” book that I read about here.

"Yesterday, my (25M) lady friend (22F) decided to break off what was on track to be an official relationship. To give a little backstory on the situation, it was made very clear to me within our first couple dates that her most recent relationship was physically and emotionally abusive. We had been set up by mutual friends, and one of these friends had only recently re-entered her life after she managed to break out of the abuse cycle with her ex. She explained to me that she had lost a lot of the meaningful connections in her life because they were unable to watch her remain with him after repeated episodes of abuse. I was touched to hear that her initial impression of me was very positive; she told me I was the most respectful and put-together guy she had ever been interested in. I struggle with anxiety myself, so it’s always hard to accept compliments but it meant a lot to hear that. 

As the next month passed, I continued to learn about the difficult circumstances she had overcome, including being left by her dad as a child, and watching her stepfather struggle with substance abuse. She has also had her own battles with alcoholism and rehab. I developed an immense respect for her good heart, and was genuinely impressed with her outlook on life despite having multiple excuses to not be that kind of warm person. 

At some point, her abusive ex began emailing her, and I was told she was ignoring these messages. I could tell they were making her uncomfortable. What I didn’t know until today was that she had been actively texting him for the past couple weeks, a time frame that included me bringing her to a family wedding and introducing her to my mom. 

I want to make it clear that in no way to I think I’m entitled to any sort of relationship with her. I’m sad that she didn’t want to continue seeing me, but I’m more heartbroken that she’s going to return to this abuse cycle. And being in the position I’m in now, upset that I was lied to but still feeling some level of responsibility for caring about her given the serious nature of our last few dates, I’m stumped. I don’t know if it’s my responsibility to try and help her keep this guy out of her life, or if it’s none of my business. I’ve never dealt this intimately with an instance of domestic abuse, and I don’t know what the right course of action is. I appreciate any comments or opinions from the community, as I care about this girl, and care infinitely more about her safety than I do about whether she’s still into me. 

TL;DR - Girl I was getting serious with has ended things and been in contact with her physically/emotionally abusive ex, and I’m lost on what my responsibility is in the situation to help her understand she doesn’t deserve to go through this again."	pow3k	post	27.822051181763797	female	White	0.995371401309967	na	na	na	1	domesticviolence	no prediction.

"I am 35 and divorced. My ex husband was emotionally, verbally and occasionally physically abusive. It took me 3 years to gather the courage and finally leave him. I am happy and single now. Recently i met a guy at a party who is also divorced. Our initial talk was enjoyable. On our first meeting the topic of exes came up and he told me his ex-wife was manipulative and he was ‘played by her’. He said she called cops on him for domestic violence after hurting herself to implicate him. He plead guilty in court and he said he only did it because his lawyer suggested it is the better path to take. He almost pleaded with me to give him a chance and get to know him before saying no. 
I am skeptical and don’t want to take the risk of an abusive relationship again. But i also felt kind of sad for him if what he is saying is true. 
I want to see what you guys think. Please tell me if I would be an idiot to start anything with this guy.

"""He plead guilty in court and he said he only did it because his lawyer suggested it is the better path to take."" 

If his lawyer suggested this it means that there was NO shot he would have gotten a not guilty conviction, and I promise this, if there is a remote chance for them to be found not guilty they would try it. It's either try for not guilty if there's enough reasonable doubt and get it or be found guilty and you look worse and even more guilty for wasting a judge and/or juries time and potentially get a more severe sentence. So the fact his lawyer wanted to streamline it meant that there was a plea deal which would result in fewer charges and a lesser sentence on the condition he plead guilty before time, energy, and resources are ""wasted"" dragging it to court. 

""But i also felt kind of sad for him"" 

This is the bread and butter of abusers/predators- they prey on the empathy, generosity, kindness, etc. of their victims so they are able to continue to abuse. 

He is 100% lying and his new manipulation tactic is the wounded dog schtick, he's hoping that by being ""upfront"" then he'll seem more believable when if you do a Clare's Law report (if that's available to you) I could guarantee he's lying about 99.9% of what he's told you."

"I voted that he is lying. It seems odd to me that an ""innocent"" person would decide to plead guilty and take domestic violence charges for something that he *allegedly* did not do. Along with making his ex seem crazy which is typical with abusers. Maybe she is - maybe she isn't, however, we don't know the nature of their relationship.

Regardless, it is better to be cautious and move on. At the end of the day, those charges will follow him for as long as can be. Which could impact future jobs (for him) and relationships around you.

"Abusive personality is so deeply engrained in many people, 99% won't change and if they do it takes many many years. They will like and manipulate you into thinking they've changed when they don't have you and once they do the controlling behaviors will come back.

At the end of the day the problem is that abusers never think they're in the wrong. Even when they fake-admit fault, either they're manipulating you or they end up putting part of the blame on you for ""making them do it"". When the root of the problem is an inability to recognize they themselves are at fault, they can never change because in order to change the FIRST step is admitting they are in the wrong.

"I voted no. 

I had a similar situation. I met a guy who told me his ex-girlfriend was physically abusive to him, and when he threatened to report her to the police, she told him she would accuse him of DV and ruin his life. He said he walked away from his own house, his dog, and his whole life and just let her ""have everything"" out of fear of being falsely accused.   She apparently still told his friends, his employer, and his family that he was abusive, and they believed her over him...

In hindsight, this really doesn't add up... but I gave him a chance because I'm empathetic, as most of us are.  We were taking things slow.  I wasn't ready to commit to a relationship after ending my 22-year relationship with my abuser.  I realized quickly that he was extremely controlling. He lived 2 hours away, so we could only see each other on weekends.  He insisted on talking to me on the phone all night every night (from 5pm until around 2am) and if I was busy, he would call me anyway. He was making sure I had no time to see or spend time with anyone else.  I told him I'd be visiting my family and wouldn't be able to talk, and he'd call anyway,  I guess to make sure I was really with my parents. He'd be grumpy when I told him I was too busy to talk.  

Then, one night, I had plans with a male friend, and he was obviously jealous. He kept saying I could do whatever I wanted because it wasn't official between us, and kept  implying that I would sleep with him.  I told him it wasn't like that, but he didn't believe me. He texted me at 2am that night saying I guess you're having a lot of fun with your ""friend"", and I found out later he'd driven down and surveiled my house to see if we were doing anything. Then he broke up with me telling me I knew what I'd done... I assured him I hadn't done anything, and begged him to reconsider and keep seeing me...

He called and said he was willing to give me one more chance... and that's when I realized it would always be like this if I stayed with him. We weren't even officially dating, just casually seeing each other, and he was stalking me, accusing me of cheating and controlling me. I cut it off. He was pissed. I dodged a bullet."

I cannot reiterate the previous comments enough. DO NOT TRUST HIM. In fact never trust anyone who openly admits to past violence or has been implicated in violence by courts, no matter how they spin it. Honestly wish someone had told that to me before I started dating. Also for future dating reference don't date anyone who does illicit substances, has done illicit substances (unless they're clean and can prove it), deals illicit substances or is involved in anything slightly dodgy.

"Putting it in perspective: 
I once knew an older guy that became part of my friend group after college. I got a little close to him, got to know his girlfriend, we all got along good and he was smart and funny. At one point during this time some friends got into an argument with him and looked him up, and found him on a sex offender registry.

He assured me, his gf and other friends that this was because a vengeful puritanical relative had reported him as having child porn on his computer, when he in fact had not. Later, I found out from the girlfriend that he liked Daddy dom/little girl roleplay. They split up after a while, and he eventually started dating an even younger woman.

Years later he was caught outside an elementary school playground watching kids from his car (probably doing what you think, the report was unclear),and it turned out he specifically had distance restrictions due to the previous sex offense registry. He was arrested etc.

"Yes, false accusations do happen (and are actually  quite frequent in cases of Domestic Vioelnce from women against men).

BUT THAT DOES NOT MEAN THAT IS THE CASE WITH YOUR GUY.

To put it into perspective,  here are two real cases where a guy was falsely accused by a ""crazy ex"":

**Case 1**
Guy in his 30s briefly dated a girl that turned out to be ""crazy"" ( in the sense of very serious diagnosed psychological issues, frequent alcohol and drug abuse, friends with various dealers, proven to lie frequently, frequently changing sexual partners even while dating).

She acused him of violence and rape (without evidence or documentation).  She had also accused various other men of raping her in the days before. On the day and time where she alleged the violence took place, friends where with them who say that they didn't notice any violence. The guy lost his job, reputation and some friends. He was not able to find a similarly wellpaying job afterwards. But he has claimed to be innocent in court and *he was found not guilty by the court*.

**Case 2**
A guy in his 50s was accused by his short term girlfriend of very serios violence and rape the night before. She actually undertook medical examinations for documentation and submitted a knife that he allegedly used into evidence. He was therefore put into detention while awaiting trial for a few months. However, doctors found that the bruises and scratches she had did not fit at all to her story and where likely self-inflicted. She gave multiple different explanations of what happened and contradicted herself. Also, the knife did not contain his DNA or fingerprints. However, it was found that she had tampered evidence and stalked the guy using fake social media profiles previously lver many months.He has lost his job, reputation and his carreer was over.  But he always insisted to be innocent and *he was found not guilty by the court*.

These are true cases of ""crazy exes""

Both guys had ***no documented history of abusive or controlling behavior before or after these accusations***. Both guys always insisted on their innocence, even if it meant that they had long and costly court proceedings. Other ex partners confirmed that they didn't experience violence. And *the courts didn't find them guilty*.

To be honest, your guy does not sound like a true case of ""crazy ex"" to me. It's nice that you feel sorry for him. But since you already had a bad experience with DV, **maybe you should not take the risk and leave it up to someone else to give him a chance**. If he is honest and that nice, you don't need to worry for him, he will get along fine in life. And if he is a DV victim himself, he will understand your situation.

Most guys are nice and the vast majority does not have a prior conviction for domestic violence. You will find one of those, too."	Ok_Traffic4609	reply	na	na	na	0.9952024221420288	no	no	no	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.

I apologize if that sounded harsh like I'm attacking you in any way, I promise that isn't the intent but I apologize if that's the impact- I'm sorry you're going through this OP, you are statistically exponentially more vulnerable to more potential abuse from a new partner due to your past DV relationship if you aren't extra cautious of red flags. Many DV victims leave only to become immediately trapped again but because the abuse isn't as overt (yet familiar so they find comfort in it) and they are still trying to heal from their trauma they are likely to remain with the new partner even longer.

That helps to read. I started to think I was going crazy because trust me, she was nothing special. Truth is, I'm the best she'll ever get. My entire family took her on and she completely ruined all of it. My entire family hate her. I don't like using the word hate. I wish her good fortune and I hope she resolves her issues but there is a part of me that wishes she'll have a heart attack or something after what she's done to my heart and the hearts of my family. All I know is that it's really eroded my trust in relationships. If someone else comes along (another thing that I'm ruined mentally in, I feel like I'll never find someone again intimately and romantically) they'll need to literally prove to me they're not a narc and abuser.

Which is another reason I can’t speak on it much so as not to upset others. Some ppl have verbal abuse, some physical some both. Mine was insanely scary for years. Guns to my head pulling the trigger for roulette to get me scared, raping me when I was disgusted and said no, his family watching him beat me and kick my insides in on the floor while doing nothing, endless makeup to cover my bruises, lost jobs and opportunities, the list goes on forever. Nobody cared enough to step in. I tried to leave for the night and he kicked my windows in on my car and beat me on the driveway so bad I should have gone to the hospital. I’ve had everything that mattered to me shattered or thrown in the street and left w/nothing. Multiple cars, every phone/electronic anything, my clothes all were destroyed. I’ve slept in an abandoned church over at least 20x and slept behind a bldg praying I wouldn’t get killed. There were no beds when I’d call for safety at the shelter.

"I absolutely, 100% understand a lot of what you're going through. During a relationship like this, your body gets addicted to the rollercoaster of emotion and hormones/cortisol. It becomes like a drug. If it's easier, you can even think of it like recovering from a substance addiction.

Please, please take really good care of yourself right now. Exercise, take bubble baths, get a haircut... Anything that you can show yourself some love. Hell, take yourself out to dates and rediscover yourself. Definitely unfollow everything of hers and ""cut yourself off"".

"The first year I still had an OOP. We did step down on communication for coparenting and that helped a lot.

I had to enforce my boundaries. I disconnected communication that was hostile. I went to text only for quite awhile. I kept conversations to only the kids for a long time as well and kept anything personal out of the communication.

Slowly it has evolved over time. After my bf went off on him for not respecting my boundaries, he stepped back a lot. When him and his new wife got serious I had a lot less drama from him as well. She and I get along great for coparenting and have a friendship. About a month in to them dating I told her “I will only say this once, and not say it again, but it always stands, if he ever lays a hand on you and nobody else can come get you; call me and I will come pick you up. I don’t care what time it is, or anything. I won’t say a word unless you want me to, but I will make sure you are safe” and I’ve never spoke a word of it again after that. 

I keep a coparenting app only for the calendar. It keeps questions to a minimum. 

Sometimes if your abuser is low conflict in coparenting you can get to a relatively calm. You now get the “face” that they always showed in public. Just know, that does not mean they’ve “changed” in a relationship aspect with you.

"im working on this too. ive seen some people say grey rock communication is the way to go, but i prefer yellow rock. its the same as grey rock but much more polite and it makes you look better should things go to court. essentially speak to them like you’re emailing a coworker that you hate, but your boss is cc’d so you have to be professional and polite. it is hard at first but you will get the hang of it. 

i understand being afraid that they could be violent and harsh with your baby. im in that boat. it terrifies me. but, the best thing you can do is to focus on what you can control. you can support your baby and give them a safe place with you. its normal for babies to “act out” after returning home from being with the other parent. they do this because they are finally in their safe place, where they know they wont get hurt for acting out. just breathe. 

if you can do supervised visitation that is best. and if you know the supervisor, maybe they could film any negative interactions that happen with the child. keep everything documented. screenshot everything. it will all be useful in court. if your baby is old enough to speak, and they say anything bad about what the other parent did, record that too. it is all evidence.

He’s actually already done the same to our baby in front of me which is ultimately what gave me the courage to leave. My parents are supervising today so I know she’s in safe hands, but he was very argumentative about being supervised to begin with. We don’t have a custody plan in place as I had to move back in with my parents in another state and I can’t file here until it’s been 6 months. Im also trying to “keep the peace” enough for him to not file for custody and request we move back because I can’t afford to live alone there and also have no support system. This is the first time him and his parents who victim blamed me after I left have come to visit and it’s only day one and I’m overly stressed about it for sure.

I actually feel that I’d be able to do pretty well with yellow rock communication. So far everything has been fairly cordial with him and only related to our daughter. His parents on the other hand have been causing a lot of issues so I’ve chosen to go no contact with them to alleviate some of the conflict. I’m hoping for supervised visitations to be given when we go to court for custody because he has a DV charge from 2018 that I just recently found out about, a DUI from 2020, and now hopefully he’ll be held accountable for the domestic violence to our daughter and I leading to another charge.

Yes I have an order of protection that he failed to contest, but they removed our daughter saying he still deserved parenting time and gave him permission to contact me in regard to her. I’ve filed a police report and have video evidence showing assault and disorderly conduct according to the judge at the order of protection hearing. No charges have been pressed officially yet. I had consultations with a few lawyers and they all told me that he could petition for us to come back to her home state until she’s at the 6 month mark of being in the new state. There’s a chance they would allow us to move back to my home state, but I was told we would have to stay there until the court orders a custody agreement if he petitions to have her returned. We also make the same amount of money almost exactly, but he has family he’s living with and I would have no one there.

"I'm in Ohio and I hope it's not true but I've heard custody and separation are difficult to obtain in Texas. Although, to be honest it's probably hard everywhere. It sounds like you have a pretty solid plan. The only thing I recommend is trying to keep everything to text or email if possible. That way it isn't he said/she said/they said/we said. Let calls go to voicemail- especially if there is verbal abuse because it will help you as evidence in court. Definitely grey rock. It gets easier and your mental health will improve. 

I was out over a year (in weekly & group therapy) and preparing for the custody trial when I finally realized it actually wasn't me. All the abuse was actually directed at our child- I just inserted myself in the way and that's why I was the one being abused.

It’s so rare that they will actually fully change. Atleast in my case, I gave my abuser many chances. He would promise me he would never do anything again and he would go to therapy and fix himself but it never worked. He even did go to therapy but then admitted to me every session he would zone out and not pay attention. You’ve probably heard before the saying that they never change and many people told me that before but I always ignored them and thought he would change this time, he never did. I guess I’ll say it depends on the person but don’t put too much hope into expecting a huge turn around with how he treats you.

"I've known since childhood that I've been emotionally abused. The abuse came from a certain family member. Since then I've worked hard to push my life forward and avoid them. 

I recently became disabled. The enabler of the abuse claims I've never been abused but my high school recognized it and now my doctors do too. I didn't move back near my abuser on my own free will. The enabler abducted me when I was really sick and couldn't fight back. 

I ran away for the sake of my mental health. Now I have a new challenge. The first night in my new place I woke up to my roommate in my bed with me. His family has a lengthy criminal history and they've stolen things from me. The police have gotten involved. I really want to leave my lease and move far away and lay low but I can't do it all alone. I don't know what to call it or who to reach out to. 

When I first ran away the enabler went to the police and had me 5150d claiming I was gravely ill. It was a lie. I don't use any substances and had no plans to harm myself or others so I was released quickly. Part of my care team is psychiatry. When I told him he screamed ""WHAT! AsleepBiscotti, that's abuse. You're being abused."" I feel like I've been reaching out for help for years but nobody has helped outside of therapists and my school letting me talk about it. I'm afraid I'll never receive justice.

I, (30M) have 3 brothers, we'll call them B (oldest) A (first younger than me) and G (Youngest). We grew up with both parents, but a very complex past, I'll need to share for context.

My mum was abused and neglected as a child. Locked in a room by her stepdad and treated inhumanely. she only got free of her abusive situation when she met my father, or so she thought. My father simply took over the abuse, choosing violence, false hope and manipulation. Us 4 boys grew up witnessing this and my mother suffered 31yrs of marriage to this monster, including spousal rape.

The reason I bring this up is so you can understand when I say my mother can be manipulative, you see it less as because she is evil, and more as a survival mechanism of someone who suffered 51 years of sustained abuse. 

My 3 brothers and I don't see eye to eye, and because of our childhood we've had complex relationships. Our mother is a contentious point that has caused us to fall out. 

I've always had a need to 'save' people, I like to see it more as helping, but probably stems from being unable to help my mum for so many years, whereas my brothers have different view points:

B & A:  thinks mum is as bad as dad for manipulating him and 'playing the victim'

G: wanted to help mum, but was too young and was pushed aside by dad when things got violent.

I ultimately escalated the violence with my dad at 15 to the point he was arrested and removed by social services, something I didn't consult my brother's on and has often served as an argument point that I shouldn't have done it. It has always been the 3 of them with me on the outside. Two of them our now married, and I wasn't invited to either wedding as an example.

 my mums health has taken a turn for the worse over the years and she is unable to do a lot of normal activities. Couple this with a number of mental challenges (short term memory problems, dyslexia, dyscalclia) and she needs support. 

My brother's don't want to do anything to help her, despite the fact they still want to use her for money, and just see every ask for help as a manipulation, and  they believe our mum manipulates me by playing 'helpless' to coax on my need to 'save' people.I can see how it looks that way and sometimes feels a little like that, but I write it off as a victim of abuse leaning on the only survival mechanism they know as a means to communicate

So am I the asshole for resenting my brothers, thinking I'm unfairly outcast and they're ungrateful to a mother that provides them a roof when they needed it, money when they ask for it and did all that whilst being abused? Or do you think I am being manipulated, and my pathological hero complex failing to cover the guilt of not stopping my dad sooner is the perfect tool? Or am I just screwed?

I'm fortunate to have an incredible wife and son and the family on her side are loving and wonderful and kind, but I'm sad I don't have that on my side, and can't help but to look inward to see how that's my fault."	coldsenseofhumour	post	31.00513442651635	female	White	0.9741524457931519	na	na	na	4	domesticviolence	no prediction.
"You’re not the asshole, so far as what I’m seeing described here. I was almost in the same situation as you and your father, when I was the same age (14-15). So personally I feel like they’re weirdly siding with your dad if they somehow blame you for defending your mom and your dad getting arrested as a consequence. 

I think your brothers have their own problems to figure out, but there’s really not enough detail here for me to say whether their perspective on your mom is valid. I question how much parental alienation (your dad trying to turn them against your mum or vice versa) was going on for B & A to go as far as saying she was “playing the victim” when it’s clear she was being repeatedly abused and assaulted. It also makes me wonder how much she has attempted to manipulate them simply for contact/affection, or whether they see her inherently as “weak” because of some toxic masculinity from growing up hard trying to be better men than your dad.

Either way, being patient with all of them and yourself seems like a good track for the future. You’re all healing from a bad situation."	coldsenseofhumour	reply	na	na	na	0.9741524457931519	no	strong	no	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.
"Definitely not the AH, also possibly getting manipulated but hard to say. Survival mechanism or not, it is still her responsibility for her actions and words. She is still choosing to act the way she is. One of the many reactions to trauma and abuse is ""fawning"". Look it up and see if this may apply to you.

Seems like you are kind and empathetic. Keep doing what you're doing if you feel genuinely free and fulfilled, but you might want to step back a little bit if you are feeling resentful or it's a burden. (Don't recommend completely cutting her off, but just assess the situation and do what's healthiest.)	coldsenseofhumour	reply	na	na	na	0.9741524457931519	weak	no	no	na	domesticviolence	no prediction.
