"Without getting too much into my past: I'm a 26yoM with a LONG history of family trauma/abuse/CPTSD/etc. I've gotten somewhat better over the years but I'm still feeling really bad in some areas.
I'm not sure what to say now though. I'm feeling and thinking so many things at once it's hard to really convey in words what's bothering me. Today wasn't even so bad if a day, just kind of stressful and tiring, but I feel like killing myself. I'm not sure why. Maybe I'm just really, really dysregulated, or maybe it's old traumas coming up making it harder for me to exist. 
I currently don't have a therapist, but I know I DEFINETLY NEED ONE. The idea of going back to therapy has been really scary for me. I feel a little too old for it tbh (even though people a lot older than me do it). I guess I'm just afraid of feeling terrible again, having old traumas come up and not knowing how to deal with them. 
I've had some pretty bad therapy experiences in the past too.
I guess Im just tired of being tired. I've struggled with these issues all my life basically, to no fualt of my own. But I worry that everyone basically blames me for them. Like, you struggle with something for maybe 1-2 years and people pity you, but any longer than that and people think you're the problem. Idk, my family has never been very empathetic, and even though I consider myself very compassionate it's hard to show the same kind to myself. I just want to feel mentally healthy for once. I believe I try really hard to feel and think differently, but it doesn't always work. And it makes me feel really bad, like I'm stuck this way forever. 

I just had a little ""fight"" with my mom, but it was really one sided. She was just asking me for money again, which isn't the problem but I made it a bigger one because of how I was feeling. I said to her ""Are you fucking serious?!"" Because she was, once again, asking me for money when I JUST gave her some yesterday ($100). Normally it's the fact that she says ""you know I do so much for you I'd never let you go without"" or some other example that pisses me off. But this time it was honestly just my thoughts. It got so bad that I told her ""mom, if you didn't get out of my face right now I'm going to kill myself."" 
Which made her shutup. 
Normally I don't really give a shit what I say to my mom when upset, because of what life was like growing up with her in the past, and all the other problems I have because of interacting with my family. But, I didn't feel great about how I talked to her today. I don't want to feel like this. I just want to be normal. To be able to shower everyday, do my hobbies, not think about dying. 
Sorry this is A LOT to read from a stranger but I have no one else to talk to right now and I just really needed to get this off my chest before I do something regretful."	throwawayconfez	post	20.07919843635285	male	White	0.9967149496078491	na	na	na	1	mmfb	age: 26, gender: male, explanation: the author specifically mentions their age as 26 and identifies themselves as a male. ethnicity cannot be discerned from the given post.
"Your struggles are your own but know you're not alone. Personally the more I open up to people about struggles like depression/suicide I realize so many people out there have similar relatable issues as well. Life can be hard sometimes. 

It's also hard to expect much of our friends who haven't gone through something similar. Professional help/therapy is good but it's not easy to find the 'right one' either. 

Sounds like you're close enough with your mom for her to ask you for money on the regular. Perhaps putting up stricter boundaries about when she can ask/how much you can contribute? You need money to live your life too. Better communication can improve this. 

Putting an ultimatum like killing yourself likely won't help things but you can only get pushed to the edge so many times before you snap. Seek help friend and take care of yourself. Maybe treat yourself to something yummy? Watch a movie to take your mind off of things? Reach out to someone whom you know will listen. Be well.

"I just had to leave r/lonely for the sake of my mental health.

Sure, everyone there is sad about being lonely. I was too, when I went there, because I thought it'd be more constructive and mutually-supportive.

But...

You post good advice, it gets downvoted, derided, or ridiculed.

You see post after post of people wanting to take their own lives-- endless melodrama for situations that could be improved with effort.

You see much else that perpetuates the ""misery circlejerk"", as I call it.

Oh, and it has a small subset of i\*\*els, too. One guy answered a post of mine-- which was supposed to be a fun discussion about movies-- with ""Have fun dying alone"" because of some ""study"" he'd read in tandem with my height.

Nobody wants help, lots of people want to die and refuse any advice they're given, and the mods seem very ""laissez-faire"".

So I had to leave this community because I can't take the weight of the world anymore. It plays on my empathy and my saviour complex, and I can't help everyone.

Good for you, OP! Reddit is a very tricky place because sometimes I enjoy spending time here but it’s mostly echo-chamber interactions. There are redditors who are mature, level-headed, stay away from inflammatory language, and can engage in mature discussions about differing opinions, I like this kind of interactions but these are rare.

"I didn’t know where else to post this so I guess it’s ending up here.  I just want to let people that need to know it know that they’re not alone.  I wrote this very high but it’s the only way I can’t actually get I touch w my emotions (sounds healthy Ik). 

I wish I could fall in love.

I don’t know why when I’m sober all I want to do is screw people then screw them over.  I don’t want that.  I just want love.  So then why do I just continue to use people and only go after sex.  I wasted my highschool.  I wasted my opportunities.  All just to get some because I thought that’s what would make me happy.  But I wanted all these thugs and I’ll never have the chance to have a kind of relationship I could have in highschool.  Yeah it’s fun to do what I do but it makes me feel so empty.  I want more but I don’t know why I keep treating myself and others like shit.  I robbed myself or being a good person or having these amazing things like love.  I want to be able to fall in love.  I want to go from brushing past someone at school to being lovers so intertwined with each other that I could finish their sentences like they were my own.  But god forbid I listen to what my heart wants.  I only listen to what my dopamine receptors want.  That’s why I hate being sober so much.  Being high or shitfaced makes the pain and guilt disappear for a while and I can finally feel these emotions that I just want to have in my normal life.  I don’t want to have to get shitfaced or couch logged just be able to feel good.  Even then I still choose to rob myself of what I really want just for he thrill of fucking someone.  I’m not disgusted with my body, I’m disgusted with the soul that’s inside it.  I hate myself.  I hate the way I have no discipline.  I hate they way I don’t care about others.  I hate that I lack empathy.  I hate that I can’t be bothered to do anything.  I hate myself.  So then why do I keep doing this to myself.  I can’t even answer that.  I want to be a good person.  I want to care for others.  I want to go out and do things.  So why do I not listen to myself.  I’m so addicted to dopamine that I’ve ruined myself to the point I can’t function without these short releases of dopamine from sex and entertainment.  I can’t enjoy something right infront of me if it takes too long.  I wish I could disconnect with my phone and be who I want to be but it’s so necessary in our daily life now that I can’t be without it not just for entertainment but to literally live.  And then there’s the fact that everyone else is just like me.  We’re all slaves to dopamine and these thrills of being young and invincible.  It makes me want to disappear because I’ll never get that time I had back.  It makes me want to peel off my skin so I can stop hiding what’s inside of me.  I just want to feel human.  I want to feel genuinely happy for once instead of this bullshit dopamine high that modern life supplies me with.  But at the same time I can’t stand myself without the rushes I get from being a piece of shit.  I don’t know why I ever thought I would want this life.  I miss being happy with who I was.  Why was I ever jealous of these creatures that call themselves people that solely exist for cheap thrills.  I feel like I should be grateful for these things but I can’t stand them.  I feel like a puppet.  I don’t feel like me.   I don’t know what I’m even supposed to feel like.  I feel like I’m just a spectator while my brain and testicles control my body while my heart sits back and watches these horrors unfold begging it to stop so that I can actually be happy.  But then my brain gets so sick of itself when it tries to listen to my heart that it ends up going back to following my testicles because it can’t stand feeling the way I feel.  It wants to forget.  It wants to be somewhere different.  Somewhere better.  Somewhere where it doesn’t have to rely on sex and drugs to be happy with who it is.  It’s addicted.  It wants to be free and follow my heart but modern life makes it so hard to do that.  It’s every where.  In the music it thinks it likes it all talks about how wonderful sex and drugs are.  The other people around it tell it how wonderful sex and drugs are.  But they’re lying too because their brains are in the same place. They’ve all convinced themselves that this is what they wanted.  I hope that if there is a hell I end up there.  I hope I can realize how idiotic I was.  I deserve to just wallow in pain and suffering for eternity.  But physical pain isn’t even the thing that hurts worse.  It’s the pain I get every-time my brain sobers up can see what a monster of a man it inhabits.  That pain is worse than any hell.  I’ll be used to hell if I go because I live in a worse one everyday.  I’m my own worst hell.  I want to change that but I don’t know how and then I feel like I’m being a fraud because I feel guilty for trying to make myself feel better.  I keep going in circles with this pain but each time around it’s even more painful than the last because the pain stacks on top of itself.  On top of me.  I’m suffocating.  I want to breathe freely again and feel good when I get out of bed.  I want to have the motivation to go out and be with people.  The motivation to love somebody genuinely and not just for sex.  But I can’t do that.  I’m a bad person.  I don’t deserve to feel that way.  After everything I’ve done to myself and others I don’t know that even if I got the love and freedom I yearn for I don’t know if I’d ever be able to truly enjoy it because I’d feel so guilty.  Then I’d relapse back into my old way.  Then I’d look back and think of what I’ve done.  Oh wait I have done that.  And then I’d be back here.  I want to feel good without cheap thrills but I can’t feel good because I feel to guilt about the monster that I am.  I’m trapped.  I wish I could wake up in a different place.  A place where I could have a fresh start.  But even if I did the memories of how horrible I am would make me feel guilty no matter what.  I wish I could forget everything.  I don’t care if I forgot important people or what’s important to them because I won’t remember and the pain of not remembering something for someone doesn’t even compare to the constant acheing and tugging on my emotions that this pain does to me.  Ok I have to stop I’m crying too much and I need to get some sleep.

There is a way out.  The problem I see is that you are trying to tackle too much at once.  Change happens slowly, and with lots of awareness.  You have to break these things down in to smaller circles.  Make a list of what you want to change, and take on one thing at a time.  Even if it seems like a small change, they will add up over time.  Don’t try to take on too much change all at once.  You will burn out, and drop all of it before your new habits take hold.  Look in to things like setting boundary’s, breaking down large tasks in to smaller goals, and forming new habits.  Change is worth the effort.	imtrappped	reply	na	na	na	0.9879366755485535	weak	no	no	na	mmfb	no prediction.

"I was backstabbed at work, someone said something false about me, causing me to get a bad performance review which led to me missing out on bonus and salary increment this year. I have discussed this with a lot of people including my therapist and the sad reality is, it would just be easier to take this one on the chin and move on. I can’t help but feel like I’m being targeted for whatever reason. I do my work as asked, am polite, a team player, and I make small talks when required. And somehow, this still happened.

The month this happened was very rough. I cried every day, I hated going to the office and put on a facade as if everything was OK. I had trouble sleeping, I missed my last two periods (it’s come back now), but really I’m just dying inside. I’m losing my faith in humanity. I truly thought adults would be…well, adults, and that backstabbings happened only in movies. I’m struggling to understand the motivation of the person who lied about me.

Put Simply I've been basically kicked out of the house. Nobody did anything wrong, my parents just feel that it's necessary for me to spread my wings and move on. I haven't really been home since I was 17 1/2 anyways (I'm 20 now), living in mental health programs instead and I'm just now leaving the final and last program. But now it's really hitting me how much I miss my dogs and the fact I may never be welcome home again due to the fact my mental health makes it really difficult for me to be home and function (Even more so than usual). My dogs are both getting up there in years (10 & 13) and I'm absolutely scared that by the time I pull my life together enough to visit home (if I'm even allowed) one or both will be gone. Added to that I grew up with these dogs, the fact that I'll only see them occasionally from here on out is scary. I miss them and want to be able to wake up each morning and give them hugs again.

"I'm really sorry to hear what you're going through. It's very real. And it's an unfortunate part of your situation. I often find myself anxious at the idea that whenever i see a person I love, it may be the last time I see that person (it's an irrational fear of course, but it's still stuck in my brain pretty deep.)

One thing that helps me when I get that fear is to see that person for whatever length of time, in whatever situation, I can. Maybe something like that could help you as well? Like, maybe if you can't live full-time at home, maybe you could drop by twice a week for doggy dates.

"Hey, I'm sorry that you are going through this. I don't think anyone can fully tell if he has lost interest, but the behavior you describe really says he might be very depressed. And that can really confuse or blind someone from how they truly feel. 

I really don't want to scare you or make you feel bad. I would just recommend you to do what your hearth want the most. You can try to wait this period out and support / be there for him, but doing so may also not work out, and I would hate myself to give you hope just for It to shatter. 

They way he describes it is that he seems really unsure, and because of that, I would only want you to not expect something either and choose wether you wish to move on in life, or give this guy a chance. Because giving him the chance may result in true love found, but it may also not. 

So please be careful with your own feelings, and please treat them as you should too because no matter what, in the end, it is your own happiness that is most important. And you should never put that aside if you don't truly believe good will come out of it.

"So I (17m) have been really struggling taking care of myself. I’m pretty hygienic so I’m not struggling in that department but I’ve been having a lot of health problems and just can’t bring myself to address them. The biggest one is about a month ago now one of my tonsils became swollen to the size of a golf ball, I could barely breathe, I had on and off fevers and was incredibly weak. It took me over a week to go to the ER and I was prescribed antibiotics, I kept missing doses because I couldn’t bring myself to take them. I still finished them but they only helped somewhat. My throat is still swollen (about half the size now so no breathing issues or fever but I still feel like shit) I had a normal doctors appointment and I never showed up because I just didn’t wanna deal with it. I’ve lied to everyone saying everything is fine and back to normal, but it’s not. 

I know it’s really dangerous to leave stuff like this untreated, but I just can’t bring myself to get help. I just wanna keep ignoring it, especially because I am doing better mental health wise than ever before and have a lot of future planning to do. I can’t afford to be sick. 
It’s nothing contagious (ruled out by tests) so I made sure I’m not hurting anyone else but god I can’t bring myself to deal with it. 

Also I was never one to bruise and now I keep seeing random nasty bruises all over my body from seemingly nothing and I just still feel weak. 
I know I need to go to the doctor but I really just wanna keep waiting and praying it goes away. 

My parents are really hands off and always have been so it isn’t hard to lie to them, but it’s a big blocker to me getting help in the first place. I can’t bring myself to take care of it, so I need someone to step in and make me, but they won’t. Asking is really hard for me because I have done pretty much everything myself for years now and I’m almost an adult anyway and should be able to man up and go to the damn doctor, but instead I’m just ignoring it. I know it’s super immature but I just don’t wanna deal with it. 

The worst part is, they’d help if I asked. But I won’t because I don’t wanna have to deal with the judgement, the lectures, and the added stress of getting them involved. 

This isn’t the first time something like this has happened. I really struggle with making myself take my weekly shots and once went a month without taking one. I just couldn’t bring myself to.

I don’t know what I’m gonna do. I know what I should do, but I don’t know if I have it in me. 

Also it’s a big point of pride for me because in all ways that aren’t related to taking care of myself I’m super responsible and can function fine as an adult. 

Idk why I can’t just be normal and functional. I’ve always struggled with this kinda stuff, since I was like 7-8 I’ve always neglected myself and like never had clean clothes, wouldn’t eat lunch cuz I couldn’t bring myself to pack it, would get sick and just pop some meds and keep going until I could hardly stand. 

It’s hard because mentally and socially I’m super advanced but it’s just like I suck at having a body."

"I have so many things to say about this, but first I want to say that I completely relate to every single word you typed. 

&#x200B;

The first thing that I hope you can take in is COMPASSION for yourself. Please don’t judge yourself for these things. We all have different strengths, and I’m sure for every one of these ‘weaknesses’ there is another side of the coin that shows major strength and resourcefulness that will become more and more clear as you get older.

These things are all very difficult and complicated in our current society— everything is so busy and overwhelming (just making a doctor appointment and filling a prescription while being in school and worrying about the future and navigating hands off parenting, and feeling like you have to be tough and independent and not ask for help and put on a good show of having it all together, etc etc etc. It’s all overwhelming! Add in some trauma from not feeling like your parents are paying attention and caring for you the way they might otherwise, etc, and you have a perfect storm. Add in some potential ADHD which your post suggests (which I have, plus being on the spectrum) and you have some different ways of thinking and approaching problems (plus the intensified stress that neurodivergence can bring to normal life things.) I’m not saying you have these issues necessarily, but my experience with ADHD was like dingdingding!!! 

All of this is to say that not everyone is good at this stuff, and since everybody is trying to put on a good show, it isnt obvious how much many other people struggle in these exact same ways. But almost everyone would try to hide their struggles, and this makes for a lonely struggle for everybody. 

&#x200B;

Trust me, you aren’t alone, and just the fact that you are able to verbalize all this, esp at your you g age, suggests you have a bright future. There are surely reasons why these issues are tough for you, but with the spirit and clarity of your question, I feel so confident that you are on the right track.

With time you will learn practical steps to work WITH your own unique tendencies (like setting alarms on your phone for taking pills, and small things like that which can make a world of difference.)

But step one is being nice to yourself. You can simultaneously appreciate yourself and work on ways to make things easier for yourself. Some of that requires time, and some might be helped with a good therapist down the line, for instance to look more at your parental relationships and your hesitancy to ask for help and admit needing more support and care from those around you.

As for the medical stuff, you may just need to get your tonsils out, and the younger you do that the easier the recovery will be. I don‘t say that to add to your overwhelm but to say you yourself may not even have been able to fix this even if you were the perfect pill-taker, etc.

You should be really proud of yourself for this question and for being able to explain what’s going on with you, because the vast majority of people wouldn’t even be able to see these dynamics in themselves, and maybe when they were 60 years old they’d be able to see these patterns and be like ‘oops I messed up my whole life squashing down these thoughts and feeling too much misplaced shame to do anything about it.’

Wishing you luck, and the continued vulnerability to think about these things and share about them, and get caring people in your corner who you don’t have to feel perfect and strong in front of! Good luck, and you are seriously  doing great!"	AlexandertheMeh_	reply	na	na	na	0.9985454082489014	weak	no	no	na	mmfb	no prediction.
"I don't know if this is the right subreddit, I need to talk about this tho. I tried posting in several subreddits but I am not getting many answers so I tried posting here too. I don't know how to deal with this situation. 

English is not my native language so I apologize for any grammar mistakes. Using a throwaway for obvious reasons. I hope this is a right place to post this. If you know any better subreddit, please let me know. I need to talk to someone about this. I guess feel free to dm me if you want to. Nothing creepy please. 

Today I went to talk to my therapist and brought up there's a topic I haven't spoken with him about yet.
I have been going to a therapist since I was 12 (self harm, depression, social anxiety, ocd). Changed like 5 different therapists and have been going to my current one for the past 3 years or so. I am 21 now. It's extremely hard for me to talk about this and admit I did something like this..

When I was around 13 a man texted me asking to meet in real life. He was around 40-45. He straight up said he wants to do sexual stuff, he knew how old I was. I said yes, he came to pick me up and drove me somewhere, we did some sexual stuff in a car and he drove me back. I don't even know why I said yes. I wasn't thinking straight, I was stupid. I had extremely low self esteem. Maybe I just craved attention/affection? I don't know. 

More guys texted me over time. It's easy to get hit on being a young girl, at least where I am from. They all knew my age, they all wanted to do sexual stuff and I always said yes. Every time it was a different man. I met up with up to 10 men I think, all 20 years older than me at the minimum. Usually between the ages 35-45. I was 13-16 while this was happening. Some guys even paid me for it. Some met me at night or after midnight. I didn't once think ""I shouldn't be doing this"". I felt numb, didn't feel anything while it was happening. It was as if I wasn't even there, but I was. Some wanted to do bdsm. Some liked to hurt me physically or emotionally, or both. Some met up with me more than once.

I hate myself for it. I shouldn't have done that. Obviously. I don't know how to deal with the fact I did it. I feel like no man I have met treated me right. Or even just normally. My dad doesn't have a very good relationship with me, neither does my brother. I have no male friends. I have never talked to a guy. I was bullied in elementary/high school, mostly by guys. At one point they took pictures of me while I had my clothes off in a gym changing room (I didn't know they were there) and printed them out and put them on the boards in the school hallways.

Every man I meet now makes me feel uneasy. I always expect them to want to do something sexual with me. I have never had an actual boyfriend because of that. I don't trust men and it's my own fault. I do realize that. But I don't know how to fix it or if it's even possible. I don't feel good when a man compliments me, I get uneasy and feel very uncomfortable. I don't even think I am worth having a relationship with at this point. 


I think I am bisexual, probably  I am very very confused when it comes to my sexuality, I can imagine hooking up with a girl, dating her. I find girls attractive too. But can't imagine living my whole life with a girl. I think I am more attracted to men. But at the same time I feel uneasy around them because of my own past actions. 

I have a bad relationship with my dad (he is a narcissist, likes to put people down, cheated at mom while she was pregnant, blocked our bank accounts when we tried to leave him, etc).
I have an older brother who might have done something sexual with me when I was very little. I remember it very vaguely so it might have been a dream... But I do have that memory ever since I can remember. 
I don't know how to fix my relationship with men. I don't even know if it's possible at this point."

"Hi I am so so so sorry this has happened to you!!! I just want to remind you that those men were the ones preying on and grooming a young teenager. They were the adults in the situation with brains developed enough to understand the gravity of what they were doing. 

It’s easy to think we aren’t that young as teenagers but we really are. We are still trying to figure out how the world actually functions and develop our own identity and set of values. The part of the brain that actually makes rational decisions based off a learned and accumulated value system develops last and doesn’t finish until 25 y/o. You were the vulnerable one who was manipulated in that sinareo. I know it’s so easy to blame yourself but I promise you that it’s not your fault. You were at a very young age when this started. Young and impressionable and men all around you took advantage of that. It is in no way your fault that these disgusting horrid older men abused you. 
I’m so sorry this happened again. I am sending as much love peace and healing energy I can, nobody deserves to go through this. 

I didn’t grow up a woman so I’m sorry that I don’t have more to say to help you along your journey of healing from the fucked up patriarchy we live in. I’m really sorry your since of safety is so thrown off by these terrible people. I am however, really really proud of you for talking about this. That cannot be easy in the slightest so that’s so huge!!! That’s such a big step in the healing process and I am so proud of your for taking such a courageous step forward from all of this trauma. I am here for you as much as a random redditor can be and I hope you get all the help you deserve while healing from this.

"I'm really, really sorry you've been through all this. 

>I hate myself for it. I shouldn't have done that. Obviously. I don't know how to deal with the fact I did it.

I hear a lot of self-judgment there. It sounds like you're putting blame for this on you. And I think that's unfair. It's the job of young people to make mistakes. If an adolescent never makes a mistake, that means they never took a risk, which means they probably never learned much in a critical period of their life. If you had done something that hurt an innocent person, like had a reckless driving car accident, that would be one thing. But it doesn't sound like you've hurt anyone else. 

There is a reason that statutory rape is a crime in many countries. The idea is that if someone is too young, they don't have the experience yet to know what they're consenting to when they agree to sex. Kids should be out there making bad haircut mistakes or listening to pop music that makes them cringe in their 20s, and they should have space around them that they can make those kinds of mistakes in peace. Adults who commit statutory rape prey on the inexperienced young. It's not the victims' fault, even if they say ""yes"". It's the predators' fault. You aren't guilty. People exploited you. I think you deserve to forgive yourself. 

As for feeling uneasy around men, you have good reason to be! It sounds like a lot of men in your life who should have been watching out for you have really dropped the ball. Your therapist probably has some exercises and techniques for learning how to give trust to men who are worthy of it (when you meet them), and I think it will be definitely possible for you to fix your relationship with men in time. Maybe it's not something you need to rush though?

When people have been hurt, especially when there are other issues like depression that make the reflex to deal with pain by turning inward, I think sometimes those people feel strong pressure to try and ""fix"" the pain by imagining they can fix themselves. ""If only I made better decisions..."" ""If only I had more inner strength..."" ""If only I was a better person..."" I think maybe this impulse is a kind of illusion of control. I know that sometimes when I am struggling with someone who has hurt me, I feel the impulse to ""fix"" the part of me that feels the hurt so it won't be a problem for anyone else. And I don't know if that's what you're going through, but I kind of wonder if it is. In any case, it's not the answer. 

I think you're going to have worthy men in your life at some point. When you are ready, you'll trust them. If they end up being friends, loves, new family, mentors, subordinates, whatever, I think you are inwardly aware enough to know when you can trust them. If you're a little on your guard at first, you have good reason to be! And even if they are trustworthy men, that doesn't mean you owe them anything. Your time, your attention, your kindness, these are all gifts you get to give at the time and situation you choose. Nobody deserves them and you don't owe anyone anything. And if you decide to change your mind and explore relationships with women, that's fine too. You deserve the chance to learn what you want without being exploited.

"> I am just impatient haha.

I think it makes sense to be impatient. If a person has been through a bad experience, it's natural to want the recovery from it to be as fast as possible. But the brain learns through experiences and emotion. It's going to take a lot of time for you to accumulate both to a weight that will balance out what came before, especially if you've been carrying it around for a while. Please forgive yourself for not growing according to the optimum schedule.

>I am worried about how reryone is using these big words like ""rape"", ""abuse"", ""PTSD"", it just... Doesn't feel like it was that bad to me. I mean it probably was, I did not like it and I know it hurt me but it's just hard to accept those serious words could be describing something that happened to me. If that makes sense.

It does make sense, totally! When we put a word to an experience, it can affect how we perceive the experience. Also, context matters. Like how in some countries, where married couples just accept that at some point one of them will probably cheat, people tend to report less trauma from cheating than people in countries where couples tend to demand absolute fidelity in a marriage. 

I am not a psychologist or a therapist, so maybe my opinion doesn't mean anything. But I think you should hold onto the memory that at the time, it didn't feel that bad with you. I think that's a useful data point for you for building a nuanced and complex view of your experience, even as you grow and change how you contextualize it in the story of your life.

As you say, words like ""rape"", ""abuse"", ""PTSD"" and I would add ""trauma"" feel quite heavy, but they are useful words nonetheless. If you judge that your experience wasn't actually that serious, you are totally valid for that! But I know that a lot of people, even people who have been through far less than you have, try to avoid fully processing their experiences in order to not have to grapple with deeper emotional struggles that come from them. ""I don't have time for this now,"" they say, and then they cram those feelings down deep inside. Then they keep doing it, until one day they're stuffed so full of emotions that nothing more fill fit, and some small, unrelated thing leads to a total breakdown. I hope you aren't doing that.

I hear you about wanting a friend or relationship. It's very hard to feel lonely. But I'm absolutely confident it will happen for you. When? Who can say. And if you are still young, it's easy to feel impatient about things like this. But the great thing about friendships and other relationships is that they can't be deserved or earned, even if people want them so badly. They can only be gifts given. And so eventually someone is going to offer you the gift of their time and genuine respect, and you can choose to offer yours as well when you feel the time is right. It's easy when you're grappling with loneliness to try and blame yourself and imagine that the problem has to be with you, like you don't deserve a relationship. But no one *deserves* a relationship, and yet people keep having them anyway. Because no matter how flawed we all are, we keep meeting people who will say, ""Yes, I will give you some of my time."" There are 8.1 billion people out there, and you haven't met them all. You'll find your friends. It's just a matter of patience.

Good luck, and please be kind to yourself."	Throwaway1653357	reply	na	na	na	0.9925649166107178	weak	strong	no	na	mmfb	no prediction.

"I guess the reason I posted is that I am very confused about the situation and wanted to know what people think about it. I was also getting ready to talk about it with my therapist on our next session two weeks from now. 

Because on our last session, two days or so before I posted, we ended the session with me telling him there's a topic I haven't discussed with anyone yet and I think it's connected to the topic of me being uneasy around men. 

The reason that was brought up is that I was chatting with this one guy online for a while and we were really hitting it off. So we wanted to meet in real life. After doing so I ended up crying. He was extremely nice, we went to a restaurant, movies, etc. 

On the bus home I ended up crying because I felt an overwhelming feeling of anxiety and i was extremely confused about that. As nice as he was, I was creeped out the whole time for no reason. My therapist said it's hard to understand why that was happening and said it might be because I felt safe prior to that because we were chatting anonymously, kinda. And it became too real for me when I met him. He also blamed it on my social anxiety partly. 
But probably the actual reason was connected to what I posted here. 

Before people said it, I didn't think it was rape. I get it now, I can see how it makes sense but I didn't know that before. 

I am not 100% sure what falls under PTSD and my perception of it might be different than what it actually is. 

I didn't really mean not that bad. I guess I am having a hard time explaining my thoughts. What I meant is that I recognize it's something that's bothering me and that probably shouldn't have happened but before I posted I thought it was my own fault and that I was just stupid and that's all there's too it.

"So I had a friend called H (he uses it/he pronouns). I was the first person it had ever trusted with what was going on at home, and his mental health and so many other things. We always hung out, all the time. 
But then H and E (another friend of ours) got closer and closer and closer. I didn’t see anything wrong with it. But at the start of this year I realized me and H didn’t talk as much as we did. I’d send a few messages but not get anything, it would just be left on read. But he’d talk to E and other people more then me. And yeah, maybe he wasn’t answering me cause he knew it could leave me on read and I wouldn’t be offended. But what really set off mixed signals was I sent a msgs saying “hey! We haven’t talk in a while, how are you?” And he said “hi! I’m good, is the skate session 1-2:30?” I corrected him and asked why and I got back “I’m taking E on a skate date ^-^.” I didn’t get “how about you?” Or anything. What really hurt was that he was going somewhere else with E on my birthday week by plane and couldn’t make it. I understood so I let it off. H said “I was thinking about having a little late 16th birthday with you when I get back” It’s been almost 5 months and still noting.

You might not have access to enough protein, but you have youth and  hormones on your side. I think your odds are great, actually.

The diet/program doesn't have to be _perfect_ to work, especially for a 19 yo. You might lose fat and/or gain muscle more slowly than in ideal conditions, but you will anyway.  I really think if you stick to a program, you'll see results.  Just get a training program you like (I'm a fan of Pavel's Simple and Sinister, but there are tons of options, you can find many for free), get your diet as clean as you can (I like the Bodybuilding Revealed ebook, which is now free, AthleanX  on Youtube has good advice, also).

I'm eastern european when i moved away for college i had around 1.7 euros for the wholes day food. This was back in 2015 so 1.7 euros could go a bit further than it can now

For that money i could get a full lunch at the student caffeteria and a lighter dinner and change left over.

I judged that ti make my moneys worth only the lunch there was profitable.

The rest i spent on soy beans, eggs and liver (pork or beef).

Liver was actually the cheapest protein out of the three. And it had added bonus of packing more calories around the protein.


I used to work out in highschool as well for a time and in that more blessed time i got a dislike for fast carbon hidrates. So even when calories were sparse later in college i would avoid white bread, sweets, soft drinks etc

I recomped in the sense that i lost a lot of the fat and that i gained muscles. Definietly the lowest fat percentage i ever had. But i lost weight over all. So that isn't the true recomp. But i had abs and defined muscles i looked better than if i had lived like a slob

The only regret is that i didn't know at the time how to hit the legs right without am access to a gym. I used to workout only at home and in parks. Nowdays i could work my legs better at home. Back then my legs were lagging behind the rest of the body

">100+ grams of protein

That's true but i'm 190cm tall. Whatever i was getting from my protein focused small diet it wasn't enough

Vegetarianism while poor is tough. I guess you are already aware that not all plant based protein are born equal and that you should match amino acid profiles. 

Are eggs atleast cheap where you are from. I'm guessing not but if they are don't be afraid of cholesterol

I can buy eggs, I'm already eating 2, might increase the amount to 3, I can take soy flour but i cant find much information, the only cheap soy flour i can find has no nutritional value chart behind its product so i dont know what to do anymore. 

Yeah, I want to begin taking rope jumping seriously now, enjoy it, and just be skinny and be fit, athletic and see muscle making some other year when I can pay for it.

I meant it doesn't matter for losing the belly fat. 

I think that you should just continue working out and results be damned. You'll feel and be stronger. It's just that you won't add xx pounds of muscles


These days i eat 5 eggs and oatmeal for breakfast. But now i'm around 20kg hevier than in my shredded skeleton years.


I add white beans to my diet because amino acid profile combines well with my oats which i take for fiber and healthy carbs.

"Alright. This feels really quite dumb, but I have to let someone know.

All my “Friends” talk shit about me. I don’t get invited to parties, or any gathering of sorts, even just hanging out after school.

It wasn’t always like that though. The biggest problem now used to be my best friend. The worst part is that I still treat him very well, even thought he will talk crap about me the second I turn my back.

It’s all because I refused a vape. He started hanging around other people that did that sort of thing, and I didn’t have a problem with them, or him doing drugs, as long as I didn’t do any. Keep in mind I was 13 going on 14.

He would just start talking mad crap about all the weird things we did together, and how weird I was, when I wasn’t even the worst one. He’s somehow managed to tell everyone I hung around, and turned them against me, and it’s the fucking worst.

The only friends I have left are my pet snake and my dog, and the only reason they like me is because they rely on me. 

I can’t even complain, my family is in a good position financially, I have a job. If I really want something I could buy it. But I don’t want anything, other than to be acknowledged by those who used to be my friends. I really do try to check my privilege whenever I can 

There’s so much more I can say, but I feel like this whole MMFB thing is kinda fake. I figured I may as well let someone know I’m upset."	Incywincyoliver1	post	20.769867543576154	male	White	0.9988631010055542	na	na	na	1	mmfb	failed
It sounds like the two of you have changed a lot over time.  This is normal.  It may be time for you to seek a new friend, and a new friend circle.  It also sounds like you don’t “want” any thing.  I see an opportunity for you here.  Start looking for a hobby you might enjoy.  Join clubs, and groups with people who enjoy them as well.   You might find some thing you really enjoy doing, and ultimately make a friend in the process that is better worth your time.

"Read a news article about a guy who died because he couldn't breathe through his nose. The article mentioned he'd taken sleeping pills and wine too, but it was definitely phrased in a way that said he died mainly because he couldn't breathe through his nose as he slept. (his nose was already stuffed before he slept. He seemed fine for a while but his gf noticed he was not alive in the morning when she went to wake him). The guy injured his nose after an accident, which caused him to snore. His snoring annoyed his gf so after a while, he decided to stuff his nose before he slept to stop himself snoring, after taking sleeping pills and wine.

I read a study where researchers gave patients thiopental, to simulate sleep. They blocked their nose as they slept, and found that they didn't switch to mouth breathing, even as hypoxia developed (from them repeatedly trying to inhale through the blocked nasal passage).

The other group in the study were not given the medicine, they were awake during the test, and they could switch to mouth breathing. They said that in other studies, people must wake up to switch. They concluded that in order to switch to mouth breathing, wakefulness is required.

I'm wondering if that's true - that the switch to mouth breathing is voluntary, requiring a person to be awake, not automatic. Me taking sleeping pills would complicate the whole ''wake up so you can switch to mouth breathing'' part. I have a heart condition that causes a wide variety of other symptoms and some of them make it hard to get to sleep so I've been prescribed sleeping pills.

Here's the study for anyone wondering https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8398521/"	ThrowRA424324322	post	23.749485754192044	male	White	0.9471300840377808	na	na	na	1	mmfb	failed
"Honestly this sounds like the usual media lies meant to get you paranoid. Doctors will warn you that there are certain drugs that you should absolutely not mix with alcohol, and sleeping pills are one of them. When mixed, the effects of the drug are compounded, and it's possible that the guy in the story you read was so sedated by the combination that he would have stopped breathing even if his nose wasn't blocked.

All in all, maybe he died because his nose was blocked and he didn't switch to mouth breathing while asleep, but really, the reason he's dead is because he took sleeping pills and mixed them with wine, which meant that he was too sedated to be woken up by suffocation. Don't do that, it will kill you."	ThrowRA424324322	reply	na	na	na	0.9471300840377808	no	no	no	na	mmfb	failed

"Hey man,

I'm sorry you've gone through all that, and all those diagnoses.  I don't think these things make you ""worse"" or ""abnormal"". Many, many of us have mental health issues these days, and they are like any other health issue. Something to be managed, not something that has to define you.

I think all these issues_can_ be managed. I think it's critical to find a doctor you trust and stick with them, and to the treatment. If the treatment is not working, it's important to go back to the professional to change it or adjust it (as opposed to just stopping it, which I'm not saying you do). I think it's important to give the doctor and the treatment a fair chance,
considering the time scales that the doctor gives you. Only after that, if things don't work, I'd find it reasonable to look for a second opinion (unless you feel somehow mistreated by your doctor, or something like that, of course).

"So we decided to talk on the phone every evening after he gets off from work. Last night he said he had a terrible headache and coudn't talk on the phone. I do really like him and granted me only know one another for a week. But there was a connection and a spark like no other. I asked him if he was interested in me still.. he said yes but he's not 100% brcause some real shit he is going through plus he is the sole bread winner of the family. 

Plus the days which is a national holiday he needs to work on those day. Last week when he was freeer I was busy. He did tell me if I wasn't feeling the same effort from him to maybe move on. I don't know what to do.. maybe I will give him his space and then ask him out over the weekend? What do you guys think?

&#x200B;

The reason I like him 

\- We share the same birthday 

\- We are born one hour apart 

\- Our lives have overlapped one another when we were younger 

\- Our humor is quite similar 

\- He is sweet and sometimes communicative.

"I recently read this book about regrets and the author interviewed thousands of people talking about past regrets. The wide majority of them made decisions, mistakes and went through with their plans and despite not working out in the end they're glad they went for it. The latter half simply regretted not putting in the effort or trying for something they had their heart set on. 

Shoot your shot friend. You'll never know if it'll be a positive outcome and the Internet can't help you with that. If it goes well you might have just met a long term soulmate and if it doesn't we'll be proud that you had the courage to stand up and give it a shot. It'll be easier the next time around.

"I met this guy on my birthday and turns out his birthday was on the same day. That evening was pretty amazing and a memorable birthday to both of us, that evening he wanted to kiss me because he liked me, but I don't kiss on first dates and take time to open to someone. 

Fastforward to now. He is stil interested in me.  He sends morning text and I love waking up to them and sends messages to me whenever he finds time. But I do want to spend time with him. I asked him if there is a solution to this issue of not holding a proper conversation because then only we will be able to get to know one another. It was cute when he said,""What can we do?""' I suggested that we talk on the phone which he replied he could try. Also I would like you to know that he is going through something in his life ( It's not my story to tell) I feel like I am demanding too much, but at the same time this is my need in order to get close to someone. 

He said that he would try his best to talk to me over the phone. And the best part, he was willing to try and collborate  and make this work. But when I asked him initially if he was interested he said that I am not 100% nowadays and it's because of something going on in his life. But he told me I understand if you don't want to continue this. I was upset that he didn't want to fight for this initially. I also had to come up with the solution.

Stop sending mixed signals. If you're willing to wait for him to get whatever is going on sorted out, say so and then do it. Give him whatever time and space he needs. If that means that for now you maybe talk in the phone a little from time to time, then live with that.

This seems to me like even more reason to slow down. 

Regardless, it's still up to you to decide how to proceed. If you feel that he's not putting forth sufficient effort, that's your call, but just like you don't want to kiss on the first date, he may not want to step up his effort before he feels he could see some kind of future with you, and may feel too preoccupied with whatever he's dealing with to think that far ahead.

Hi, I'm from Syria, before the war I had a very comfortable normal life, my family made good money, I used to work also as a teenager and I made enough money for myself, I was a freshman in collage when the war broke out, the war hit my life very hard, I had to leave collage before graduating, then I had to work in everything possible in order to provide for my family as both my parents lost their income. A few years ago, I managed somehow to achieve finical stability, I can say I live better than 90% of Syrians, I work very hard. For a short period of time from 2017 to 2019 I found a balance in my life I was not much bothered by the war, it became a normal part of my life. However, in the last two years, despite having finical stability, I began to remember my life before the war more and more,  and it is getting worse by the day. I just can't get these memory out of my head, the easy of life, the happens, the innocence, the simplicity of  everything, my hopes, my dreams, all of these memories are hunting me every single memory, I found myself remembering games I used to plays, movies I watched, food I ate and even scents I came across, this is every single minute, I can't focus anymore, I lost motivation and all what I want is to set and remember these things, I got back to smoking just because I used to before the war, I spend the rest of my day working out or working. I can't enjoy anything anymore even the small things I used to be happy for like a good meal and a nice movie. All what I can think about is my childhood and teenage years, how relaxed and full of life I was. Nothing now can impress me or make me happy, I can clearly see the absurdity of life, but somehow I can't see it as a positive thing. I can't stop thinking about the past and it is now effecting my life. I'm not sure what to do about it because I fear this would soon morph into something bad in mind. I'm very grateful to be able to secure a living for me and family, but not happy, the responsibility that the war put on my shoulders is killing me from the inside. I'm haunted by my past and I don't know what to do, I think I might be going mad. 	Imaginary-Rub7416	post	24.055447402246624	male	White	0.9974451065063477	na	na	na	1	mmfb	failed
Does work provide benefits? Seeking therapy I'd imagine would help. What you've gone through is too much for one individual to bear. The fact that you've achieved stabilitiy despite what you've experienced is a testament to your persistence and hard work. Down the line I hope you can help others who've experienced the same.

"I wish life was easier to talk about. I have this feeling where I just want to pour it all out from my childhood until today but I just can't. I can't start, I can't continue and I can't end. 

I know what I want to let out but no words come to mind. And to let out I wouldn't be able to fit everything here. It's just so much. Yet so little. Everything stemming just from a few known core issues. Being, social anxiety, GAD, ADD and Autism. 

Four known issues just two of them I learnt when I was 17, being social anxiety and GAD. And the two last I learn last year, being ADD and Autism. There may be more buy there may not. All I know looking back to my childhood now is how much regret I have. How much time I spent being someone I wasn't. How much time I spent struggling in subjects I just couldn't grasp. How much I cried knowing every homework I had within certain subjects that anything I and dad did I never could understand why or how it was. Still today I struggle with subjects such as math. My whole life in school learning about something I never managed to figure out. Simply because of my ADD and Autism with no help to truly work around it and find my own way to comprehend what I saw. Each time I tried my self someone would tell me that my formulas were not what they were teaching or that I was lucky. 

I always was seen as special. First the class clown through doing things my own unique way. I did try to be funny at times but as many times I tried I also just did thing others found funny through my natural self. Honestly, when I think back I don't know what happened. Why I started isolating myself more and more. Maybe it was once I reached the highest grade my school had we had to switch to another close by school where I still had all my best friends in the same class in my new school but that my new school still had half new people to me. But that switch, I never truly learnt to get out of my isolation. 
Most breaks I sat outside the next lecture door with my friends playing mobile games. And three years of that closing my self in more and more we eventually had to pick what we wanted to specialize for and I was the only one who chose electrical engineering. 

Switched school again for that and while the first few months I had my friend a few classrooms down that I could go to during the breaks that friend eventually quit that school and went somewhere else. For the next three years I was all alone. I had one guy be with me always though and he always sat with me trying to talk with me and such for those three years but I at that point was completely shut in. I appreciate him so much for spending the time he did with me, and I know he could have had far more run around others but I will never understand why he chose he wanted to be around me. And I'm okay with not understanding. I just feel bad for him. 

I was a very depressed kid. No one knew because hiding it became easier than dealing with it. But even dealing with it at some point becomes easier than hiding it. But I hid it real good. Good enough I'm still today struggling to fully understand what I went through mentally. 

Life to me is very weird and confusing. I have nothing but sadness and regret when I look back on it. Yet when I look forward behind all that doubt and failure my future may hold I still see some light. I still see myself traveling the world, absorbing the beauty it beholds. I still see a family one day formed with children of my own living their happiest life possible and I still see myself to be able to be loved and to love. Not only for what you have, but what you may have and what you had. 

Life in its own way is beautiful, and while unfortunate events happen, learning about them and working to adapt and move with them if you can't around them, I believe has the possibility to find that inner love and happiness we all so much deserve.

"It's been falling apart for a while.

Nothing really went as planned. I left high school with 60 something college credits, thousands of dollars saved, a good relationship with my family. 

Then it was just one thing after another. My mental health collapsed after my assault in my freshman year. I spent two years in an abusive relationship and another year after that drinking myself to sleep every night.

And now I'm starting over at 22. College isn't finished. My friends are moving forward without me. I'm working the food service job I had in high school. Trying to pull my credit back over 600. Trying to pay off the debt I accrued. Trying to show up for myself and take my meds and go to therapy.

Tomorrow I move into a new apartment. The third one I've had since I moved out of my mom's at 19. I want to be excited but I'm just scared. 

It's been a hard week. My dad had a psychotic break. He blacked out and tried to unalive twice. He's always had an alcohol problem, but nothing like this. Now he's in a psychiatric hospital for the week, and I'm struggling to believe he has it in him to get sober once he's out. If he doesn't get sober he is going to die. He would have died yesterday if my sister and my step mom weren't there.

I can't focus on much else. I have a job interview next week and a weekend trip in a few days but I'm worried sick to the point where it's hard to eat or work or sleep. All I can think about is the 12 hours in front of me.

This is how I've been living for the past few years. It's why my life is such a mess. When you're that hopelessly overwhelmed you can't really see the bigger picture.

"My husband had an emotionally abusive friend. We finally ended that relationship, and so did our close mutual friends, but if they hadn’t, we would’ve distanced ourselves from them too. 

I think you need to be prepared to leave these friends behind. You can’t control the actions of others, but you can make it clear to them how their actions impact you. Once you do that, if they don’t make an adjustment, that tells you all you need to know about your friendships. 

You’re very young, and you’ll make many new friends throughout your life. I’m 30 years older than you and don’t really have any friends from 20 and younger. People change and move on. It’s just part of it.

I don't want to trivialize what you're going through but if I'm being blunt, and without all the details, it sounds like you need thicker skin. Think of it this way - the goal is to move through life as a (well-intentioned and benevolent) subject, whose actions have an effect on the world around you, rather than an object whose actions are determined by the world.

"So I met this guy on my birthday on the 3rd and it happened to be his birthday on the same day too! So that's how it started! Turns out we had a lot in common.. turns out he was just one hour older than me.. honestly what are the odds! We have a similar sense of humour and we both love food.. so when I met my friend in a pub for celebrating my birthday.. she said why don't you invite him too!  I said yeah why not.. I was pretty excited to do that! The night went really well and he wanted to kiss me but I wasn't ready.. so he didn't do so!

Cut to the weekend.. his responses are pretty dry and take a long time to reply! He tells me that he is catching up on some sleep because he was working on his (our) birthday too! I don't know.

"This is kind of a rant into an empty cave I guess. 

I never wanted to be born, and I don’t think I’m the child my parents wanted. I think the only reason they support me, even if minimally, is because they’ve already put so much money into raising me that they can’t give up now.

I never wanted their support, I tried to overdose and they stopped me and took me to the hospital. Things never changed after that, they just wanted me to change my outlook even though they know they’re the reason. 

The way they treat me it’s like I’m being punished for wanting anything for myself, and I just want to end my life. My biggest priority has been and is my future, but the second I try to slow down and enjoy the present, even in the slightest amounts, I get punished. I don’t even have hope for my future anymore, so what’s the point if I can’t enjoy tomorrow or today?

What’s the point of my life if I don’t get to enjoy it? I just want to be hit by a truck or something out of my control so I don’t even have to feel the burden of trying to kill myself anymore. I’m too lazy to feel or even try. Just let me die.

"I’ve been and still sort of am in the same boat as you. My childhood was wrought with problems that wouldn’t have existed were I not to be born to parents who had their own childhood trauma and were still effectively children themselves at 18/19.

An emotionally distant father and an angry stressed mother is far from ideal. I haven’t spoken to them in about 2 years now. It sounds like you have no choice but to live under their roof, but once you start living for yourself independent of them, it will be slightly better.

As Albert Camus said, “The struggle itself towards the heights is enough to fill a man's heart. One must imagine Sisyphus happy.” Life in itself is a boulder that we’re constantly pushing up hill only for it to fall back down. 

And as someone that had a best friend, akin to a brother, purposefully overdose- the pain is always there. Even when my mom’s dad died, she broke down in tears and actually told me “I don’t know how to feel. He was never around and I hate him for that, but when he was around he was the best dad ever.”

Which he was a deadbeat. Rarely came to any birthday parties, celebrations or events for me or my siblings. According to my mom, he would just hang out a bars and drink. Though according to the pastor at the funeral (who worked with my grandpa before the aneurysm), he always spoke highly of us even though he was never around and felt ashamed for being who he was as an absent father and grandfather.

Point being that while we don’t think people will miss us or hurt when we’re gone, especially when it’s so sudden and without warning, they do. Feelings are difficult to deal with sometimes. Even the good ones like love and compassion. 

While I don’t talk to my parents, I do acknowledge why they were and are the way they are. And there really is no point to life, but we’ve gotta find one lest we fall down the black hole of nihilism. Even something small like it being a nice day despite knowing of or impending struggles as climate change gets worse. It’s difficult, but doable.

"i have this one experience i can’t get myself to say out loud, even in therapy. i wish it didn’t affect me so much but it does. and i feel embarrassed that it does, ashamed that it’s such a big deal yet unable to talk about it because the thought of even acknowledging that i have genitals repulses me. 

i have PTSD from childhood abuse, stuff way worse than this. so why when we start doing body-based therapy, does this of all things come up so strong? any other experience, i can talk about. but i can’t get the words out about this, i just tear up and feel overwhelmed and mad and hurt 

to put it to words, over text at least: when i was 14, i got arrested for “assaulting” my abuser. aka, hitting their hand out of my face. bad as is, but the part that keeps coming up for me was the court mandated drug test. 

no one told me i would have to expose myself till i got there. and i’m supposed to just be okay with it? i cried and for hours, refused to do it. i’d never done drugs in my life, straight A student. i weighed 70 pounds. im just a kid. i don’t want anyone to see me there, that’s private, i’m not okay with it. i didn’t consent. the only reason i didn’t is it was court mandated and my dad said i couldn’t leave till we got it over with, it had to be done that day. but no one told me, no one gave me a say in my own body. i wasn’t okay with showing myself so some fucking stranger, let alone urinating in front of them. why the fuck was that okay. 

it has been nearly a decade. i feel so much shame and humiliation and violated thinking back on it. i don’t want to have a body, i don’t want to have a physical form. i just want to cut that whole area out or curl up and cry or burn down anyone who was a part of making me do that. 

i feel like i could never say this in person, people wouldn’t get why it’s such a big deal. “just grow up, it’s just a urine test”, etc. there’s far worse things that can make people feel violated, esp in that area, i feel weak to be affected by something so mild in comparison. i don’t even feel like i can call it SA. what would you even call it? 

i can talk about literally anything else. i’ve been hit, choked, threatened with a gun, so many “worse” things. and i’d take those any day over this.

"Hey,

Nobody has the right to tell anyone what is or isn't a big deal for them. We all have different feelings, and there is no single ""valid"" criteria.

That being said, what you went through does seem like a big deal to me. I would have expected that a child could be deeply affected by that. Especially when you add it to the unfairness of the cause of the whole thing.

I understand that talking about this has to be really, really hard. You have been already really brave reaching out and writing about it here. I would be very proud if having a child like you.

I don't know the proper steps to start healing from this, but I'd say the first thing is to understand deeply that none of what happened was your fault. You have no reason to be ashamed, as you did nothing wrong.

I'd  think next thing to consider is that you are away from those people now, and that you are safe. You don't have to expose yourself to anyone if you don't want you. You don't need to share any of you to anyone you don't trust, love and feel comfortable with.

The previous are little more than guesses, which I hope help a bit, but yeah, I know little of these things. If you manage to talk to a professional, I think that will help. Of course, you just do it whenever you feel ready, without pressure.

is it a mental disorder to look back at your trauma and dismiss it saying it's not as bad as you thought at the time? An example. I recently experienced something involving my mother, her boyfriend, drugs, and my siblings screaming bloody murder (3 and 1). My mom went to her friends house and I was in the pool with my brother. My mom's boyfriend came home, told me to get my stuff, and leave (without taking my brother. So I got out the pool and went into the bathroom to try and change, but he saw the door was locked and broke it down as I was getting naked. It was at 8-9 at night so it was cold. I had to walk half a block in a wet bathing suit in the cold carrying all my stuff. It got so bad the police were involved. At the time I was having a panic attack (it was my first one). The police said it was fucked up, my mom said it was fucked up, my friend said it was fucked up(she helped me through it over a phone call), and her mom said it was fucked up. Bit when I look back at it I feel as if I overreacted and it was fine and nothing was wrong etc, basically dismissing it as a normal occasion. I don't think it's ptsd. Is this a mental disorder?

"After two years of struggling to get pregnant, including difficulties getting my IUD out, infertility treatments and a miscarriage, I found out I was pregnant again. It seems different and more promising than the first one, but we were still planning to wait to tell anyone until I got through the first trimester. At 6 weeks, I found out I’d be getting laid off in about 2 months. I love my job, and I love the company I work for, and I appreciate how much notice they are giving me. They’re doing their best, but they’ve had a difficult year financially and are a small company. I don’t feel wronged by them in any way, but it still sucks.

It’s really upsetting first because it has put a pretty big damper on how excited I feel about being pregnant. It’s something I’ve been trying for for so long and now it is very entangled with my anxiety about finding a new job. I wish I’d had more time to just be happy to finally be pregnant.

I’m also worried it will make my job search more difficult. I work in a profession that is less than 10% women, I’ve only met 3 other women in it that were mothers, and I’ve never actually known someone while they were pregnant and working this job (although all 3 of those mothers did do that). I’ve faced a lot of discrimination in my career, and I was happy to be at a place I knew would be accepting. My plan for the new jobs is to go through the interview process, but tell them before they give me an offer. My job will not be protected during my maternity leave, so it seems like a bad idea to leave that detail out. I figure if it loses me the offer, I probably didn’t want to work there, and if it doesn’t, it probably wouldn’t look good that I had hidden it.

I’m also really sad because I have looked forward to being able to tell my friends and family that I’m pregnant, but now it is part of a more complicated and less happy story.  I’ve been talking to my professional mentors about it, and I’m similarly sad that I feel like this is news I would have told them with a lot of humor and happiness but is now told because it is a complication.

In addition, I’m nauseous all the time. its bad enough that’s it’s been waking me up really early in the morning, so I’m also exhausted."	DrawingA______	post	19.789741447497363	female	White	0.9989847540855408	na	na	na	1	mmfb	no prediction.

"As the title simply states I feel alone, and it's been this way since I graduated college a little over two years ago. Long story short the course I took in college was something I did not want to pursue and ended up moving back to my parents and getting a job in Baking that I really enjoy. This comes with issues though, I live in a very small community with almost nothing to do for young people (22 Male) to do, and I don't want to pursue a relationship because I really want to go somewhere more populated plus I'd like to move out of my parents even if it comes with financial troubles, I'd be willing to do it to improve my mental health. Since I mentioned relationships I have never been in a relationship with a women, let alone kissed one, and I also haven't socialized with friends probably since I left college, so yeah I feel very alone.
  

  
So yeah just wanted to share how I'm feeling since I have nobody close to share this with, I have been looking for bakery jobs and I have applied to some but no response from them either so the mental health stock is really dropping.
  

  
Anyways, if anyone reads this, thanks for reading the sad start to my life, and can only hope it gets better soon."	xToxicPayne	post	30.234151946194316	female	White	0.008606408722698689	na	na	na	4	mmfb	'no prediction.'
"I’m sorry to hear you’re going through all of this. I felt the need to comment because I’m 29M.  As I end my 20s, I often think about how nobody prepared me for how difficult 20s can be. A few points:

It’s great you have a job you enjoy, let’s start there. I would venture to guess roughly 85% of people your age hate their first job. I know I certainly did.  The reason I bring this up is because when you find something you’re passionate about, it could be a great way to get out there and meet people. In general, we like to be around others who radiate positive energy. Easier said than done, of course. But I think focusing on a career you love is a great way to start picking things up. 

Living with parents can be tough, but it’s a great way to save money. I moved out when I was 24, and sometimes I wish I stayed home ab extra year or two. However, when you move to a more populated area, it’s innately easier to meet people. I lived in Brooklyn when I moved out, and even though I hated my job, I had such an incredible experience. I also felt, on a personal level, I grew and matured so much within that first year. 

Okay, let’s talk friends. Do you have any college friends you keep in touch with?  How about HS friends?  I know friendship is a two way street, but it might be worth reaching out to some people. We’re all kind of shy, and we like to hide behind our phones. I know it’s hard dude, I get it. But I implore you to take that initiative. See if anyone wants to grab a beer after works. Or play some board games!  That’s what we did back in my early 20s, and that’s what we still do now. 

Okay, dating. Dating can be tough. It takes thick skin. Have you tried dating apps?  There’s not as much of a stigma anymore. I would recommend Hinge, as it’s the only dating app I ever had success with. As a matter of fact, my current romantic endeavor began on Hinge. But again, it takes some initiative. You can’t be afraid of rejection. It’ll happen. But, it gets easier. I wouldn’t let your lack of experience get in the way. You will get out of it what you put into it. 

Mental health…get a therapist. You’re under 26, so you should be insured with your parents. Again, no stigma there. I’ve been seeing one since 2018 and he changed my life. As with everything else I’ve mentioned, these things take time. Give it 4-5 sessions. Don’t be afraid to open up. You have to look after yourself. 

Lastly, make sure to look after your physical health as well. That always goes hand in hand with mental health. Eat well. Exercise. I find even just a walk in the park can turn a bad day around. 

Look dude, being a guy is tough. Male mental health is frequently overlooked. We’re so often told to “man up,” or “suck it up.”  To that, I say nonsense. There’s no shame in asking for help. 

Okay, I think I typed your ear off here. Like I said, I went through what you went through not that long ago, and I can assure you, things get better. 

Feel free to message me anytime if you need any support, or if you just need to vent. I’m here for you!  All the best to you."	xToxicPayne	reply	na	na	na	0.008606408722698689	strong	strong	no	na	mmfb	'ethnicity: no prediction, age: 29, gender: male, explanation: the author identifies himself as a 29 year-old male but does not provide information about his ethnicity.'
"Wow... what a in-depth and honest response, thank you it means a lot and its something I can look back and remind myself that I'm not alone out there.

So yeah I really do enjoy baking, and I'm the kind of person that doesn't need to be making a lot of money to enjoy life, I just need people around me. But yeah enjoy the job just not so much the workplace, looking for a change of scenery and again somewhere a little more populated to make new friends and hopefully a romantic partner.

So, I don't really keep in contact with anyone from college, had 3-4 guys I became I would call friends but haven't talked to them in a little over one year. But there are 3 highschool friends that I have been talking to, to try and meet up before the summer is over, it's just hard since were not all living close by and jobs get in the way, but am working on that so that should be nice.

I have not tried dating apps, but trust me I want to, its just feels like a bad time since I would really like to change job locations and have to deal with that and a potential relationship, only to then move 5-6 hours away seems pretty rough, but as soon as I find a new job, and I feel settled enough I definitely plan on stepping out of my comfort zone and start trying to date.

In terms of mental health, I have thought about it, I've looked up prices and yes I could afford them, and the nearest one is almost two hours away. I also think about how my parents would react to me getting one and I wouldn't want them to pester me or make comments on seeing one, idk, I know it's my life and my mental health it's just the comments and cost I guess that makes me second guess it.

Anyways man, I have typed the ear off you now, if you plan on reading this, and I may just message you in the future if its not too in convenient for when I'm feeling not myself. Thanks, man I really mean it. ([https://mealprepmanual.com/](https://mealprepmanual.com/)), which has helped me lose about 20-25 lbs which is awesome (currently 176ish lbs). I have been trying to do some simple bodyweight workouts at home, and sometimes I stop for long periods cause I just don't want to do it (I know bad me) but then sometimes I start up again, maybe I just do not have a good motivator to keep working out cause I feel like it's not doing anything.

My dad didn’t love me till I was around 9 and slowly started giving some love. Around when I got to around 12-13 my dad got into fights with my mum for buying land in his home country and buying it under his brothers name and therefore giving the power tony to him. My mum and older sister tried fuelling hatred into me towards my dad and uncle. Ever since I get called occasionally a mistake, a dickhead, a unsympathetic fuck, unwanted child, I wish I could have aborted you etc. only my brother and sister were wanted and I was born as a mistake. I get abused by sister and mum for speaking logically and they ask me about the family problems and I always give a logical argument and they fight with no logic and lose the argument and results in me getting hit by mum and sister or verbally abused. I have a neutral relationship with my father and brother. I am 17 currently and don’t know what to do I never hit back and always give love to everyone but they hate me for no reason or never listen to me either.

Many, many people are the ""result"" of birth control method failure (or the failure to use one properly).  That doesn't make them, or you, mistakes.

"Sorry you're in this situation. It's definitely one that would make me anxious. But a few things jump out a me about your post - 

\- You have until May to figure this out. That's 10 months. Human beings can solve pretty much any problem if they have enough time and you have a lot of time. Way more than you need actually.

\- There are two ways to go forward that don't involve moving back in with your parents: Either you find a new roommate for your current apartment, or you become someone else's roommate in a new apartment. If you live in area where living with a roommate is common enough than either way should be easy enough. Housing is expensive and a lot of people are looking for roommates. If I were you I'd start looking for a new situation in February or March of '24.

\- You don't need to feel ashamed of moving back in with your parents for two big reasons. The first being that it's nothing to feel ashamed about. You'd be doing the right thing for your long-term financial health to do so. But the more important reason is this: You haven't moved back in with your parents yet and you probably won't have to. There's no reason to be ashamed of something you haven't done and probably won't do. That's like someone who hasn't crashed their car feeling ashamed they might crash their car in ten months."

"I don’t even want to post here because it makes me feel pathetic, but I feel like I need a space to air this out. 

I start seeing someone casually, then I might develop feelings, whether I want to or not, and they don’t want something serious. Or maybe it’s the case that even though I don’t want something serious with them I then feel like I’m not enough when they get into a relationship, which makes no sense. 

I just wonder why the feelings of wanting something more with someone never ends up reciprocated, or it seems like it is but then I get messed around by the girl and left confused.

I’m pretty much wholeheartedly confident in myself, but I always end up thinking I’ll never be enough for someone.

"Hey there. Really sorry to hear what you're going through. I can definitely relate. When you want to have a substantial relationship with someone, and they don't, it's really hard not to take that personally. It feels like it's the definition of personal. And that hurts like hell.

But there are a couple things it might help to remember. And I can definitely vouch for their accuracy:

\- You not being to have the relationship you want has nothing to do with whether you're ""good enough"" or ""enough"" or whether you ""deserve it."" Like, zero. That's like saying your town is going through a drought because it's not ""good enough"" for rain, or ""doesn't deserve"" precipitation. The reason this is happening to you right now is because of conditions that are largely outside your control and have little to do with you. I'm guessing that you're fairly young. Even when I was young, a lot of women didn't want to commit to a relationship. They had other priorities. They wanted to play the field. Relationships were a lot of work. Whatever. So it's not you. It's what they want. And that will change. Eventually, most of women will want relationships. And then you'll be in demand.

\- It may seem like this current spell of loneliness will never end. And for sure, loneliness do be that way - it definitely makes time run slower. But the flip side is that when you do find someone who you want to be with, and they want to be with you, then it takes all of 10-seconds to get into a relationship that lasts years. (Of course it takes some time to make that relationship work right, but that's another issue.) So what I'm saying is like, when this does change for you - and it will change - it will change fast. 

\- Lastly, it seems from how you write it that what's happening is that you're crushing on some girl, then she doesn't want a relationship with you, then you repeat the process all over again: crush, no relationship, crush, no relationship. Most people do this. But what it creates is a common situation where you focus your attention on a small number of women, get really attached to them, then get hurt when they don't return your feelings. I used to do this a lot myself. Eventually I realized that it was distorting how I viewed the world. I didn't feel like I was enough because I wasn't enough to be with these three women. Okay. But there's like billions of women in the world. So I started going out and meeting women who I didn't already have crushes on - just to get to know them, see what they were like, etc. etc. A lot of times I didn't like them. A lot them didn't like me. But slowly I started to realize just how many were out there, and of that, there was a large enough number that liked me. I guess what I'm saying here is that the less you tunnel vision on a few specific women, and the more women you meet, the more clearly you'll see how in-demand you are."	zag-gaz	reply	na	na	na	0.012935052625834942	strong	strong	no	na	mmfb	no prediction.
Really appreciate the response. I’d say I do kinda fall into the “having a crush” category, but it usually develops after we start seeing each other and I get to know them. Obviously the main problem with that is that intimacy can lead to forming deeper bonds and all that. Aside from that, the other things you’ve said have been reassuring.

"For sure. Yeah, I know what you're talking about. I think that post-intimacy weird period is interesting. I get a sense that in a way, coupling has become a lot more like shopping since the advent of the apps. People get connected, they like what they have in front of them - but before they ""buy"" a relationship with you, they just want to see what else is out there in case there's a better deal. It's a foolish way to look at things, since relationships aren't purchases, but I think that way of thinking does get into people's heads. i.e. ""this person is great, but the perfect person could just be a few swipes away"". But that's not your fault either. It doesn't mean that you're not good enough.

"I get it, your own growth and well being is the best way to move on, revenge won’t do you any good. Or it isn’t realistic. Or it’s not right. But please hear me: 

I am 7 years out of my abusers house, in treatment for PTSD for years. And i’ve grown, i do have my own life and it’s going well for the most part on paper. but mentally, i’ve also been very stuck for months now, to the point sometimes I feel the only real option I have is to die.  

I need to find closure with the whole abuse situation, I need to somehow move on, or move forward at least. But I cannot, in good conscience, “move on” without doing *something*. My abuser is currently living consequence free, very likely abusing another kid in fact. To me, to let things be would be to let my abuser get away with it. To let all the shitty people involved (cops, CPS, psych hospital, and a counselor or two) just do what they did, and for nothing. And I just go about my life unable to be real with people, cause to be real about what’s on my mind all the time would be way too heavy. 

People always say to grow as a person and be happy is the best revenge, but do they have any idea how bad it hurts to see all those people who abused me or contributed to my abuse live their lives as if they never did a thing? How powerless it feels? My abuser gets friends, a life, a false image of being a good person, the systems that helped them still continue existing, and I’m just supposed to live in that world? 

I genuinely would rather die. So seriously, please. Someone please tell me there’s some third option. It’s a long shot but I’m genuinely desperate. Can’t keep doing this."	KeiiLime	post	30.955034804681564	male	White	0.9983071088790894	na	na	na	3	mmfb	failed
It's great that you're in therapy for PTSD. Stay with that. My only suggestion would be to work on that inner part of yourself where your spirituality may be. I don't mean religion, if that's not your thing. I mean the inner part of you that makes you *you*. Some people find it with art or music or religion or daily affirmations, or being out in nature. You have to decide where that part of your inner self is and nurture it.	KeiiLime	reply	na	na	na	0.9983071088790894	weak	no	no	na	mmfb	no prediction.
"Can you join a group for those who have experienced what you have? Sometime sharing with others who understand can really help, and it can provide a sense of community. Maybe your therapist can even help you find a group for this.

Also, is there any way to try to get justice, or is that too overwhelming to even think about? I know things are stacked against people who fight abuse. 

Even if you can't address these perpetrators directly, maybe you can work on advocacy campaigns or something like that? I don't know.

But there may be some way you can help others in a similar situation or who have gone through this. Maybe you could train to be a peer counselor or something down the line. But I think finding some way to connect with others and contribute to others in this kind of situation could help you and them, and maybe refocus things for you. I can guarantee your experience can help others in some way.

Wishing you the best in a very very unfair situation. You deserve so much better than this. 

Oh and lastly, wondering if you have done EMDR therapy for the PTSD. That is something that can be really helpful too, though I know it isn't super-accessible for lots of reasons. 

But there are a lot of things to try, and a lot of hope potentially. Hoping something eases some of this very understandable pain and injustice and sense of hopelessness."	KeiiLime	reply	na	na	na	0.9983071088790894	no	no	strong	na	mmfb	failed

I struggled with similar feelings about the lack of justice for a long time before finding peace in acceptance and shifting the focus to myself. It isn’t easy but it is possible so please don’t think of death as an option. I had those thoughts but after moving past them had many days where I was so so grateful I hadn’t acted on them because I never would have gotten to experience the beauty and joy I did subsequently. There are still hard days of course but knowing that there can be good ones if you hold out makes a huge difference. And I also thought of my death as another win for my oppressors. 

Keep in mind that no one’s life is as perfect as it seems.

"Hey Elliott.

I do care. I'm not a MD, but I understand it is pretty common to be depressed for no obvious reason. There are several possible causes. When you say you can't talk to anyone, I suppose that includes a counselor at your school? Some cities have  therapists/counselors one can go.  Some universities also provide that for free. If not, you can at least post here more often. You can also post here more often.

I'm sorry people are not noticing you. That doesn't mean there is anything wrong with you. People can just be like that, especially at your age, and especially if you are shy/introverted (I should know, I'm pretty shy myself). I am absolutely sure it is not fair to hate yourself. It might feel that way, but that's just the depression talking. I think it's important that you know that, and that you tell yourself. That you are good, that you can be happy and can make others happy.

"Hi everyone... I don't know what to type...

Some important details: I'm an 18 yo Female living with my Dad and my Step mom and i have 2 brothers 28 and 23 that don't live with us anymore but still hang out with us. I get along just fine with my brothers and Step mom. I'm not an english native, sorry for any mistakes that i'll write.

&#x200B;

So i just finished high school here in Europe and i was searching for a good university that i'd like to attend and i found one just 30 minutes from where i live where i would study what i want. Let's call that place ""MYPlace"".

Between all of this my Dad contracted some guys to come wreck our house and build it again because some things were just getting really bad which would need to be rebuilt. That was a couple of months ago and today my step mom fired them because they were incompetent which made my dad angry and stressed because he wants the house fixed. Just picture a man in his mid 50s who wants everything done just how he likes.

Example: when the team told him they were gonna find some things needed for the bathroom (completely remodeling the bathroom so we're talking about things like a sink a toilet that stuff) and my dad told them that HE was gonna take care of that. I'm not saying that's bad, i'm saying that is how he operates, doing things as he wants them to be.

&#x200B;

So today i told him i would like to go to ""MYPlace"" because even though it's 30 minutes away from here it has what i would like to study and do as a job in the future. This would require to rent an apartment over there. We aren't rich nor poor but we get along fine, not bad not good just at the middle.

He wants me to go to another location which is 10 minutes away from where we live and we'll call it ""HisPlace"".

His response was and i quote ""You can't go there because yo're dumb and stupid and you can't figure stuff out on your own. You must go to ""HisPlace"" because it's 5 steps away from university and you are gonna like that much more"". I just sat there listening not saying anything... Maybe he's like that because of the incompetent team that my step mom fired? My boyfriend (18M of 4 months) said it's unacceptable to behave like that to his sensitive daughter (me) but deep down i know my dad always thought like that about me.

Also: ""you think going from MYPlace to university is a walk in the park are you stupid? You wont make it."" he thinks ill be walking from my apartment to university walking and the sun is too strong for me to go outside... I guess buses dont exist? He doesn't trust me to do SHIT.

I swear he called me names and i just don't know what to do. I can figure stuff out on my own i'm not incompetent nor a kid, i admit i'm not an adult but damn im not a child. He just does not trust me and he said he's NOT interfering with my university choices so i wonder what he would be like if he did in fact interfere lol.

&#x200B;

I just dont wanna go anywhere right now, im anxious and a bit depressed cause i know he won't support me and whatever i do or wherever i go. Honestly i am just sick of this and i want to give up on college and go work on some random shit.

He says i need to go to HisPlace because my cousin went there and he's doing ok in life even though i don't want to do what he does for a job (agronomy) and i what i want is to be a nurse. I spent all my life pleasing this man so in the end he can trust me and now i find out he doesn't even a bit... He thinks that without him by my side i'm gonna end up fucking dead lol.

He doesn't deal with half terms so it's his way or i don't know... Please help me i do not know what to do and i need to apply to some university..."

I feel anxious af right now . In 1 hour and a half I'll have probably the biggest rehersal of my life as a singer. I sing with an orchestra,some old creepy guys that tend to judge me all the time. Every rehearsal I feel nervous and anxious because Im afraid they might try to laugh at me because I'm pretty young. I am also afraid of the antourage there. I feel sick just watching them watching me sing. I hate them. But I cannot renounce this habitat because there's a lot of pressure on me coming from my family. Don't get me wrong, love singing, but not with these shitty, mysoginistic, toxic men. I feel so depressed just thinking about this rehearsal. Any advice?

"I know this is going to sound like a lot right now, but life really gets better if you stick with it.  I attempted suicide when I was fifteen, too.  I was intercepted and put into therapy and, while I was really resentful at the time, I came to realize that all the problems I thought I had were environmental.  I was in a bad situation, and it felt totally inescapable, and the people around me were feeding into the toxicity.  Stuff would pop up (a lot like your gf's parents intercepting her contact with you) and I would just think *oh great, this is another sign*.  

But — and this wasn't easy, don't let me seem flippant here, it was a lot of hard fucking work — it got better, because I got better.  I got out.  I got help.  Therapy and being away from the people who were bad for me was what I needed.  It sounds like you need that, too.

"It’s ok. I wonder though if that means that you are safe to talk to a teacher, guidance counselor, etc when you start school, and not worry that it means CPS will break up your family. Because I remember you didn’t want to talk to them about it for that reason. 

Anyway, it’s up to you what you want to do next. But I think you should keep trying to talk to people about your situation and see what resources might be available (looking up “homeless youth” plus the name of your city on Google etc. is another good place to start, there are probably nonprofits or agencies that can help). And even if you don't get concrete help right away it is probably good for someone outside your family to know the situation—if someone at your school knows what’s happening with you, they can keep an eye out for you and check in to be sure you’re ok. I think that a lot of the stress you’re feeling now comes from feeling alone and like you can’t tell anyone what’s happening. 

It’s really unfair that you have to be the one to deal with this situation, but it is temporary.

I am 50 years older than you and have lived life long enough to tell you that no one gets through life without going through some tough stuff. Only yours has happened at such a young age. The very best thing you can do for yourself now is to find the adult you trust the most and tell them what you are going through and that you need help *right now*. What you're going through right now is like carrying a heavy weight all by yourself. When you get help, it's like sharing the weight with someone else so it's not so heavy anymore.

Your mum's question seems odd to me though. Of course there are abusive siblings - but they wouldn't run to the parents and proudly tell them what they've done.

I’ve been trying to encourage him and make him feel better but last time this happened I obviously failed at that because he spiraled pretty hard and I’m scared it might be even harder on him this time? He kept saying he wasn’t really quite experienced enough for it and wouldn’t get it, but I think he still got his hopes up because he absolutely **hates** his current position, and this promotion was basically crucial to his (and my) sanity/happiness in a way.

"Oh, mighty Brigid, goddess of healing and compassion,
I humbly reach out to you with a heavy heart today.
As the sun rises, casting its warm rays upon the world,
I beseech you to hear my prayer for my beloved Cappuccino.

In this transformative moment, as he prepares for surgery,
I implore your divine presence to guide the hands of the healer,
May they be steady, skillful, and filled with wisdom profound,
Performing their sacred duty with love and profound care.

Goddess Brigid, I ask that you infuse the operating room,
With the gentle energy of your loving and healing touch,
May the surgeons be granted knowledge beyond measure,
Removing every trace of this cancerous burden from Cappuccino.

In the sacred realm of the operating theatre, I beseech you,
Banish all malignant cells, leaving only health in their wake,
May the lights shine bright, revealing any hidden darkness,
Guiding each stitch, each movement, with unerring precision.

Goddess Brigid, I implore you to watch over Cappuccino,
As he slips into the realm betwixt sleep and wakefulness,
May your divine shield protect him from any pain or discomfort,
And may he awaken from surgery with renewed vitality.

Please bless Cappuccino with a swift and gentle recovery,
Let his precious body heal swiftly, without complications,
Surround him with your tender warmth, like a mother's embrace,
Nurturing his spirit and body with your divine grace.

As the days unfold, may Cappuccino's strength be restored,
May his appetite be hearty, and his spirit ever vibrant,
I pray that you grant him many joyful moments ahead,
Free from any lingering effects of illness or pain.

Brigid, goddess of the flame, hear my earnest plea,
Wrap your healing energies around my beloved Cappuccino,
In deep gratitude, I offer my love and devotion to you,
And thank you for your divine presence in our lives.

"I'm so sorry you're going through this. It's more than anyone should have to struggle with, especially so young.

Being a teen is pretty awful for everyone, though. Most don't have your acutely stressful circumstances, but everybody's a hot mess. It's often the worst time in one's life.

But that means...*it gets better*. Please, don't cut yourself off short. Then you will have suffered the bad times, and never get to see the better ones. Which you deserve, and *can* have. You just have to get through this, and get to a place where you can start to heal.

I was on the verge of killing myself once. It wasn't just that I was miserable and suffering -- I also couldn't see what was the point, I couldn't even *imagine* anything that would make life worth it.  But that was a symptom. It really meant, my needs hadn't been met for so long, I didn't even realize that was what I had to do.

The reason to keep going is the *good life* that you *can* have. But only if you get there. A life worth living takes decades to build. But it gets better every year. First, you yourself come together. And then you can work steadily on your circumstances. When you can turn beyond yourself, to making this good for other people too -- then you feel good, and glad for life.

But that's the endgame. For now -- please, no cutting. Slap a wall or something if physical pain helps distract from your trauma. (Not punch, don't break your hand). Just keep putting one foot in front of the other until you can start to pull together a better situation for yourself. It's going to take a while. Like, years. I'm sorry. It's hard and shitty and you deserve better. I'm sorry I don't know what to tell you about helping your situation -- except talking to a school counselor, who should know resources.

The one thing I can say is: you *owe it to yourself* to get to the good life. You can do it. Just breathe. And one step at a time.

 Be safe. I'd love to hear how you're doing. Maybe post updates here when you can? Rants, breakdowns, whatever you need to unload is welcome. And of course any good news.

"I'm having this weird feeling that might be suppressed anger. I can't really place what it is, or make sense of it. I know it stems from my marriage falling apart, and feeling like I could have died today.

I took my husband to a pool. He does not know how to swim, but he usually is okay with having a floatation device and staying in the shallow side. There was also a hot tub there, which I know he enjoys a lot. We've been having some terrible struggles in our relationship. I'm trying to decide if he has narcissistic personality traits, it would explain most of the issues we are having.

Back to today. I decided a mini vacation might help us relax, and had planned a little day trip. My husband was very neglected in childhood, so when given the opportunity, he kind of reverts back to child-like playfulness and wonder. I was enjoying watching him act like a little kid playing in the water while I relaxed and floated around.

Suddenly he turned towards me and says ""help"" and I knew he had accidently gone beyond where he could touch the bottom. I can see he is starting to panic and struggling to catch breath. Without thinking I swim to him, and I bet you can see where this is going.

I try to pull him to me, but he pulls me to him. He then uses me to push himself up to breath and my head is now quickly underwater. I can feel myself go down, and take a deep breath in through my nose, which is cut short by being pushed under. I can now touch the bottom of the pool with only 8"" of water above me. I now have time to think as he is pushing himself forward on my, now very stable, shoulder.

I recognize how panicked he is and think I have enough air to wait this out. I am very comfortable in water, I've been able to swim since I was 3 or 4. He gets to a part he can touch again, and releases me, and I push him further towards the shallow end.

I have read countless stories, advice, and instructions that you should not swim to a drowning person for exactly the reasons above. Their monkey brain takes over and they will try to climb you. I can't blame him for this. I think I do feel upset that he didn't realize he was getting too deep. That he had put the kick board on the edge of the pool thinking he didn't need it, and that he put us both in a dangerous position because he wanted to test how far out he could go, or just wasn't paying attention.

I think I also feel guilty for taking someone who can't swim to a pool. I have tried to give him a short swim lesson, but as usual he quickly lost interest, and in general, does not like me telling him what to do. Even if it is something I'm well versed at, and I am doing to help him. He said he just wanted to have fun, which is great, and is what we were there for, but because of what happened I am now irritated about.

He seemed like he just wanted to play it off, so I went along with it not being a huge deal. We enjoyed the rest of the time in the pool and hot tub. 

However, this evening I can't help feeling like there is some HUGE emotional turmoil happening right below the surface for me. I just can't seem to identify what it is. Shame? Anger? Betrayal? Just know it's a deep sense that something is not right."	2Tawayacct	post	29.64109000868003	female	White	0.9946887493133545	na	na	na	6	mmfb	failed
"It's pretty common for the rescuer to be drowned by who they are rescuing like you said, you said he seemed like he wanted to play it off. He might be embarrassed or ashamed.

Really sorry to hear about this. Even though you may not fully know what your feelings are exactly, they're completely valid. If my wife put me in a similar situation I'd be pissed too - not so much about the pushing me under water situation, but the larger context. Your husband refuses to learn how to swim, then refuses to stay where he's safe, then gets in trouble, then puts your safety in jeopardy when you try to help him. That is egregiously childish behavior. My bet is that he's completely embarrassed by this situation. In this situation he acted like a 4 year-old and everyone saw it. But maybe in a week or so this is something you could have a private conversation with him about?	2Tawayacct	reply	na	na	na	0.9946887493133545	strong	strong	no	na	mmfb	failed
Thank you for replying. I think we have identified that there are some childhood issues that he still has to process. We have been in couples counseling and our therapist has recommended that we go to individual therapy sessions. He agreed with her during the session, but I can see that he does not intend to follow through with doing individual therapy. I have such a weird mix of emotions about it all, that it's hard for me to identify what I'm feeling, or what I should do next.	2Tawayacct	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9946887493133545	weak	strong	no	na	mmfb	no prediction.
"Thank you for the kind words and empathy. We are currently going through a very difficult part in our marriage, and it would complicate having a conversation about it. I have offered to teach him how to swim, but I think he probably would only be receptive to being taught by a professional.

There is a dynamic that I have come to believe stems from some narcissistic personality traits, that blocks him from putting value in what I say/think/can do. So me teaching him anything is near impossible, because any correction or in-put that is not positive, automatically becomes an attack to him.

I think we are bound for separation, but I am still exploring how we got here before deciding what the next step is."	2Tawayacct	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9946887493133545	weak	no	no	na	mmfb	no prediction.
"Sorry to hear that. I'll be wishing you lots of luck. Narcissism or no, it can be really tough for adults, and especially adult men, to be ""taught"" anything. Especially things that most people learn as kids. 

In the meantime, if the situation comes up again, swim up behind him and put your arms under his armpits, to hold him from behind, then use your legs to kind of frog-kick your both to shallow water. That's what they taught me to do in lifeguard school years ago, in order to make sure the person you're trying to save doesn't drown you."	2Tawayacct	reply	na	na	na	0.9946887493133545	strong	no	no	na	mmfb	no prediction.
Excellent instructions. I hope in future I would be able to separate the emotional reaction to seeing someone think they're drowning.

"First up sorry if throwaways are banned, I can repost it on my main

So here is what happened:
Me and a bunch of friends including one girl attended a party today. The friend I talked about in the Title (I’ll refer to him as A from now on) is pretty much in a relationship with that girl (who I will call G from now on) What is important to know is that they aren’t „officially“ in a relationship if that makes sense but it’s clear that it’s gonna happen soon. So me G were sitting next to one another just casually talking (I have no feelings for this girl whatsoever, I just consider her a good friend of mine) when she suddenly kissed me on my cheek. (I made no hints that I would want that) It all happened so quickly that once I realized what was happening it was already over. To make things worse A was sitting right next to both of us. I’m not sure if he even noticed what happened because as I already said it all happened quickly and we were all somewhat drunk. Either way I feel horrible right now and I just don’t know what to do.  I definetly don’t want to loser either one of them, because both of these people mean a lot to me. Just to clear up any misconceptions I am not angry at G for what she did.

As someone who has been through it, I’d highly encourage you to start collecting as much evidence as you can, secretly. You can email yourself records of things that happen so it has a time stamp, take photos, whatever you feel you safely can do to start having proof build up. Much as calling CPS would be justified, they do not always listen to children or help them (even when there is abuse), so you are aware. If you can distance yourself emotionally from family and find close relationships in others, like friends, that can be another way to keep yourself and your mental health safe.

"Hi,
I’ve been having bouts of sadness about once a month sometimes more. I get sad and need to cry. Feel a huge need to talk about feelings and relationship issues that might or might not be a big deal. I get feelings of emptiness and loneliness as though I’m all alone in the world. I usually get a steady build up of emotions during the day until I break down sometime in the evening. I get bitter, angry and so sad I end up having a meltdown. 

I can’t control it very well and end up being mean to my significant other. I feel like this is borderline abusive of me and needs to stop. I’ve tried affirmation exercises and all sorts of self help to calm and soothe my feelings by myself. Recently I’ve gotten a bit better about controlling my outbursts. They still happen but I think I’ve become a less mean when they do. 

My feelings and thoughts go through circles or spirals. I feel unloved and uncared for even though ma partner is doing more than bare minimum to try and show affection in his own way.

I have had a crush on this guy since we were kids. But i'm the kind of person who runs aways from her feelings. So I  stopped hanging out with him. Then years later we connected. 

The first instance we met after nearly a decade. Me, him and our mutal friends hung out. I forgot to get my hairtie, and no one offered to help me out except the dude, he gave me his bracelet to tie my hair with. He also offered to pay for my food when I was low on cash. Later on in the night when he was drunk he kissed me. A week later, when I approached him, I asked him about it and he aplogised  saying he had alot going on in his life. Then I left it at that


The second instance, he planned an impromptu plan for me within couple of hours our whole gang mt up and he joked around that I planned this entire thing for you! Then when it was time to leave, I got into a shaddycab, so he asked me send him my live location. Later on I switched it off my mistake and immediatley got a call from him asking if I was okay because my live location was not updating 

Third instance we all met again and but this time we went to buy some alcohol. He didnt ask anyone what they would want, he came upto me and asked me, I was like I am in the mood for some wine. So he picked out his favorite wine and we were the only ones to share it among the group



The third instance I found him on a dating site, so I thought maybe he was ready to date. So I asked him if he would like to get some coffee. He said yes, but he was sick. So the next week would be better. The next week I asked him how he was doing, and he told me he was doing better but he will let me know the hours. I was kinda pissed so I decided to treat myself and get some fried chicken. Just when I did, he messaged asking me if I was free this evening. I waited patiently for 45 mins before replying then I said yes. 

So here are some highlights

\- We shared a coffee together and ate a cookie

\- He took care that my bag was by my side so I needed worry about it 

\- He held my head and prevented me from seeing a side where there was a dead animal because I love animals 

\- He held my hand while crossing the road. 

This is all sweet but the problem is when were not together I don't get any text from him. So does he like me or are we just friends."	Relevant-County4560	post	25.81316985490495	female	White	0.007880019955337048	na	na	na	2	mmfb	failed

"i know the title sounds bad and it gets worse and i'm not trying to defend what i've done here but i just needed to confess and maybe get advice.

a bit of background, me 14M had fallen out with all my friends 14M and they've gathered screen shots from our group chat and have posted all of them, i've gotten some new friends but i feel like i'm going to lose them very soon because of these screen shots.
i can't post on reddit exactly what i said in the screen shot but it was about wanting to have sex with someone, if i'm honest it was out of spite to a tik tok someone made and i thought it was someone random but it turns out they go to my school, so my old friends posted these screenshots saying who they were about and now the boyfriend of the girl added me to a group chat on snapchat and wants to kill me, i know what i did was wrong but they know where i live and i'm scared in my own home i don't know what to do anymore i'm not sure if they'll come to my house but what if they do what happens then?

Similar things happened with me when I was in high school. And i can mention a number of incidents that happened. I had a fall out with my girl gang after one of them grew jealous of me then my own best friend put me into trouble by ‘recording a phone call’ with me where i said something about our common friends which i was not supposed to say. She recoded it and sent it to everyone. All my friends turned against me. They hated me, said mean things to me, degraded me and in the end i was left all alone. None of them would hang out with me after that but i managed to find new friends. Today i am 22 years old, and trust me none of it matters. They are so irrelevant to me now. But back then when i was in school it felt like my world is over. I’m not in touch with any of my school friends and hardly remember any of them now. And I’m SO much happier and at peace. I am also doing well in life with regards to my career as compared to them. Yes, these incidents did cause me a lot of anxiety/distress specially because i did not share it with my parents, even though i was close to them and comfortable with them. Remember that people who leak screenshots, call recordings, or people who throw you under the bus, or betray you are very low life people. Get get a certain amount of satisfaction when you suffer whether they admit it or not. My advise to you would be to just take a deep breath, think calmly. Speak to your parents about it to which ever extent you feel comfortable. Apologise to the girl if you think it will ease things out. Do not show arrogance. Apologising does not mean you are lesser than them it only shows you take responsibility for your actions. And i would say even if you dont mean it, apologise regardless to stay clear on your part.

Better yet, tell someone you trust? Why do you feel like it was creepy? If you’re feeling unsafe that more important than what was said and the bullying is real and scary. If not your parents do you have an older sibling, aunt, cousin, relative? Just be safe okay? The sex thing will work itself out. It too will pass.

"Can you speak to a counselor or someone at the school? That might not be an option I guess? If you’re feeling like your safe, then just ignore the bullies and stay away from them and don’t let them rent space in your head. I know it easier than it is, but it might be the best option. If you’re feeling unsafe, you’ll need to talk to someone who can do something to help you. You probably think this will be a forever nightmare, and it feels that way right now, but please don’t allow these bullies to have more power than they really have. They gain power over you because you allow them to have it You can take away their power by simply stating you’ve apologized, you didn’t mean to hurt anyone and everyone makes mistakes. 
If they can’t accept that it’s time to find other people to hang out with and stop responding and interacting with these people. They’re toxic. Can you do that?"	_mhcord	reply	na	na	na	0.9980558156967163	weak	no	strong	na	mmfb	failed
I have huge social anxiety right now. So I work with college students at school in Louisiana, a bunch of whom are lovely and hilarious and clearly look up to me/made it clear they think I’m great (so kind!) with social media follows wanting my phone number, etc. Our office is open and super comfortable and kind. Our director, whom we all have a comfy relationship with, was openly talking shit about another coworker. Since I’m so relaxed and comfortable with the accepting atmosphere where everyone cracks jokes, I didn’t stop myself before letting slip out to my director “yesss girl end him!!”. It was quiet, absolutely meant as a silly joke and not in any way meant to shame her for talking shit. A best passed and no one laughed. It was so deeply uncomfortable, I was worried I had offended her. We got back to talking slowly with my students and my boss and our director. I cautiously tested the waters and asked for my director’s guidance on something and she was super smiley and receptive, so I thought then that she wasn’t upset and maybe people didn’t hear/understand my joke. Still uncomfortable to trip and fall over a joke like that especially in front of my favorite students (twin girls). Is this that bad? Does everything think I’m dumb??

Ooof. There's nothing quite as painful as the bad joke. I've done this a lot, despite my best efforts. I've found that the thing about these situations is that when you tell a bad joke, you remember it so much more than the person you told it to. Usually there's like an 80% chance the person you bombed in front of just didn't get the joke. Then there's a 20% chance they got it and didn't like it, but forgot about it an hour later. Try to remember all the times that someone has told a bad joke in front of you. If you can't remember that many examples well then...there you go.

Hello all, I 26M is spiraling out of control and I don’t know what to do. To be honest I don’t know where to start so I guess I’ll start from the beginning. Growing up I didn’t have the best parents. My dad was always gone for work and my mother was a drug addict. You can see it wasn’t the best situation and I went through a lot growing up. After my mother unalived herself my father had no choice and eventually settled and got a remote position so he could raise us. My sister 29F was kind of like my mother at that point. While living with my father he was a bad alcoholic and never really paid attention to me no matter how hard I tried. I was always depressed and I drank and used a lot of drugs. My father never taught my sister or I any life skills so we have been learning everything through our own personal experiences. I’ve finally had enough and joined the marines running from my past. I served my term and the marines was only a distraction from my past. I also went through a lot while I was in the marines because I was an 0311 infantry rifleman. When I got out is where things really started to hit the fan. Now that I was an adult my father really tried to make amends by buying us gifts and giving us money. It never really worked and even till this day our relationship has always been rocky. Since I’ve been out of the military I decided to go to college since the government is paying for it. So I traveled across the country to attend a university that some other family members also went to. It’s been disastrous  and I don’t know how to really take care of my self. All I do is drink and do drugs now. I have no energy anymore and all I care about is getting plastered. I am so committed to drinking I even joined a fraternity. (All great guys by the way). My life style is so bad that I haven’t filled my taxes in years, I’m in all this debt from when I was younger and it seems like everything in my life is falling apart I also have horrible spending habits as no one ever taught me anything about life. I’ve been trying so hard to get better but I just keep spiraling. Last month I got so drunk and high that I crashed my nice truck into a fire hydrant and was arrested. It is not fun calling your father on Father’s Day to let him know that you are in jail. Even after everything that has happened I still cannot stop drinking and doing drugs. Im even In AA and have revived counseling but nothing works. Any advice? Or am I doomed.	Money-Golf-773	post	16.452779577589496	female	White	0.9989506006240845	na	na	na	1	mmfb	failed
"You’re not doomed. You’re a marine. If you were disciplined enough to become a marine, you have it in you to stop sitting in the mud, pick your ass up, and get to work on yourself, if that’s what you want to do. It’s your choice and yours alone. Your life isn’t “spiraling out of control”, it spiraled a long time ago and it has nothing to do with the story you told, or the people in it. You’re not a child anymore. What happened to you as a child has nothing to do with what’s happening now. So if you want to have a successful and happy life, you can. You’re young, and your entire life is front of you. All you have to do is choose to start your life right now. Stop looking back, and only look forward. It’s the only direction you’re going in and the only one that matters. Every single one of us wakes up with this choice every day but not every one of us is your age. 
You chose to write this message. Now choose to make a change. You CAN do it. You really can. Feel free to send me a message if you would like suggestions on where to start, but ultimately it’s your choice and you have to want to make the changes and you have to do it only for yourself. 
I wish you all the best and hope you take the path that leads you to happiness and success. You’re a marine. Most people cannot accomplish something as difficult as this. Be proud of yourself. You are a strong, resilient person with drive and commitment. Get up and move forward."	Money-Golf-773	reply	na	na	na	0.9989506006240845	weak	no	no	na	mmfb	no prediction.

"You're not your emotions. You're just a being that observes them. You're not ugly! <3

You're the one in control of your thoughts, actions. 

You're the protagonist in your own story, every day. Making good and maybe not so good choices.

We're all kind of stuck in this timeline where the internet is still this new amazing thing, but social media is so awful. You really have to pick and choose where you participate. 

For **dating websites**:

Solid name, no 69 or 420s. Silly if you want, but not dirty.

Upload a few pictures of you inside and outside with good lighting. A smile helps, try to make it natural. :)

Fill out your profile as much as you can, but not too much. Leave it a little vague so there are things to talk about.

When writing a woman, go to her profile and pick out some things in her profile that interest you or stick out. Write about those. ""Hey, I like this too. Have you had xyz? I had this that and this"" or ""What other bands do you like besides xyz? Maybe we can go to a show sometime?"". Just basic small talk to break the ""Hey, what's up?"" style of messaging. No ""What's ups?"" or Dirty talk. Women get TONS of it.

Be genuine with the messages. If you're interested AT ALL then send a message, doesn't matter if you like her looks or personality more (or both). Send that message. Can't go on dates if they don't know about you.

Go on that date anyways!

For dating locations: Ice Cream, Benihanas type japanese grill, Sushi, Amusement Park, Arcade, Bowling to name a few.

For **meeting others**:

-Discord servers for internet friends or real life meet-ups. Discords for your city.

-Facebook groups/events.

-Literally just going to things that sound interesting and making small talk. ""Hey, I love your shirt"", ""Mind if I sit here?"", ""Have you seen this band live before?"", ""What else do you make?"". Anything to break the ice. 

-Local concert venues for different cover bands. 80s, 90s, 2000s, Yacht Rock, etc. Some places are pretty cheap like $15-$30. Here is a [fun venue near me](https://amossouthend.com/).

-Co-workers and what they're up to.

-Halloween is coming, look into events coming up!"	Puzzleheaded3364	reply	na	na	na	0.013541259802877903	weak	no	no	na	mmfb	failed
"please, dont take this the wrong way. i am NOT gonna hurt myself in any way, its just a genuine question. dont let this message affect your mindset either, it can get unhealthy. thank you ..

on to the point, is there really any point in living? well for me at least ? i dont think i serve a purpose whatsoever. i thought about this already , and the people i thought would care about me if i were to die. but i dont think they care enough in my opinion, but im pretty sure thats just because i have a grudge against them because of something. im considered the universe, or god (if there is one) hates me. this mindset has gotten so bad to the point i think my family and friends would only care for me if i were to get hurt. i can picture them sobbing over me, and that makes me feel happy in a way. is that weird? it just makes me feel important. but only when im on the edge of dying i guess. it also hurts. i guess i dont like feeling like im not enough, usually, i dont care if i feel like this. but it does hurt. it hurts when people dont show that they care, in an “i care about you mentally and emotionally” way. it really does hurt. physically. i wish people were to show it. i dont want this to become an everyday thought, to the point i possibly hurt myself. this mindset is scary. i feel like if people were to care about me because of it, im willing to do it. 
i know its wrong and im sorry. but im just in desperate need of mental and emotional comfort.
someone please help me, im just a teenager and my parents think its wrong to have depression and go to therapy. my aunt is the only one willing to help but she lives so far away and i can only visit her on weekends therapy would be impossible to earn.

"Sounds like a classic case of depression. You know what? It's shit. There's not much good about it. But if anything I've realized that opening up about my depression to others - people whom I feel I can confide in & feel safe sharing to - that there's a ton of other people who feel/have felt exactly the same way. 

I'm not out here to convince you there's a meaning to life or a greater power. That's a question humans have been asking themselves for centuries and I don't think one reddit post is going to 'solve' that. 

What I am convinced is that you absolutely have people in your life who care about you and would miss you if you were gone. People show 'love' through different ways though so that might not even be felt. Sometimes we need to go 'looking' for it too. I'd say keep pouring into others. Do a small nice thing for someone you know, a random stranger or heck go volunteer and help out someone in need. These are desperate times we're living in and anyone could use a hand. It's hard to be sad when you're grateful and there's always something we could be grateful about in life.

I just got in a bad car accident a few hours ago. I was driving my sister and her friend home from bowling when I saw my air bags and could smell my engine and everything was really really hot and hurt. I don't think I'm ever gonna forget that smell. The kids (all 15-16) in the other car went to the hospital and will be okay but def banged up. I'm just a little bruised and sore and dizzy and nauseated and scrapped but okay thankfully. But God I feel so stupid and dumb and can't believe this happened and I'm never driving again and my new car is ruined and I'm so fucking stupid and I can't stop crying and I can't sleep. Thank God my dad is smart and he's taking care of all the insurance and tow truck and everything but I should have been more alert and I yelled at that poor girl who's even more scared than I was. And I don't know why I'm here but I just had to do something cause I can't stop thinking about this and it really hurts, not just physically. I really wish my dad and mom could say something to me but he's focused on insurance. It's really really terrible for me to say this but I'm almost glad my sister's friend was there cause her mom showed up to the scene to take her home and she hugged me and told me it's okay and she's not mad and my parents wouldn't do that and I'm sure my dad's pissed and I can't stop crying and I just feel so fucking stupid and now I can't go to work tomorrow and who's gonna cover me?

"Oooof. Really sorry to hear about this. That is really scary and it's totally normal to feel as unsteady and panicked as you are. Anyone would feel the same way in your situation. I think it's just the nervous system's reaction to something this frightening. You're messed up now. But you will be a little better tomorrow, and a little better the day after that.

Was the accident your fault? You don't really say what happened in the post. But if it wasn't your fault, you don't have anything to feel guilty about. Anyone in your situation will wish that they had done something to stop it, even if they realistically couldn't have. Driving is inherently risky, unfortunately. Even when we all do our best, accidents will happen.

As for your Dad. Yeah, I hear you, a hug would sure go a long way. But speaking as a parent myself, I guarantee you that he's not mad at you in any meaningful way. Getting a phonecall that your kid or kids have been in a car crash is just about the most frightening thing that can happen to a parent. It was almost as scary for him getting that call as it was for you getting in he crash. Just like you don't know how to process all of your emotions now, neither does he. It sounds like in this very overwhelming situation that he's dealing with his emotions by focusing on the one thing he knows how to do, which is deal with insurance. Give both him and yourself some to exhale and come down from this. He's just glad you're alive and okay. He'll tell you that he's not mad at you and that the car doesn't matter in due time. But right now you're both too freaked out to really process that."	SailorUranus221	reply	na	na	na	0.9987630844116211	strong	no	no	na	mmfb	no prediction.
So the situation is... I have been unemployed for the last two month now ( close to ) I am currently doing an internship, in the beginning they said a 10 day internship and when I went and asked them about the role they said it wasn't open. Now they are looking to hire new people and I am serving and now they are checking my performance in the next two weeks! This Tuesday I will be completing one week. I just now went to a Tarot room and asked what the result will be, and they said I won't get the job. Now I am sitting as crying here, I just can't seem to catch a break. I have applied to several places and keep getting rejected! Honestly it's so demotivating! Why can't I just catch a break!

Really sorry you're on an emotional roller coaster here. Unemployment can do a number on your self-esteem, and make it hard for you to anticipate good things. But you're doing much better than you think you are. You've landed an internship and it sounds like they'e considering hiring you. You should find out soon whether you got it. That's good work. You might get it, you might not. You don't know. The tarot reader doesn't know either, despite what they say. But even if you don't get it, you've done a great job getting this far.

"Yes, I'm one of those obnoxious people who calls their pet their child.

I'm heavily disabled and unable to have children, in fact it's unlikely I'll ever manage independence or an adult relationship. I don't even have friends because people my age don't want to be slowed down by a cripple who can't drink, can't dance, can't do anything fun.

Even if I did find someone kind enough to sit around and do nothing with me, what would we even talk about?

So my baby Cappuccino is the closest thing to a family I'll ever have. I dote on him, love him, and worship his tiny little toes. He is my son, and anyone who says ""it's just a rat"" clearly has neither empathy nor understanding of my situation.

"So I've been friends with this girl for 6 years almost. We are very close almost family related now, she and her mother cooks for me when I go to their home, sometimes stay over and chill, she lives maybe few blocks away from me.
Well for the past 6 years I had feelings for her. Well it was on and off type, but mostly On. She knew the whole time too but we played cool, until in 2020 we separated cause it got kinda weird between us also somethings happened. But in 2021 July we got back together again on my birthday. Since then we're very close friends again. But I've developed feelings for her again since then and We had a big conversation last year December and I confess every last bit of my feelings and said I won't let this ruin our friendship also she articulated that she doesn't have feelings for me. After a month we're back again, But I think my feelings never went away and it never will I think. This year I dated someone, it was alright but then I had to breakup for some reason. But the girl I dated, I tried to look for ""her"" characteristics in the girl I dated which was not right or realistic I would say. So after that I got lonely again and started  falling for her again. It's not like I just out of nowhere fall for her, it's the eye contact we always have, we just sometimes stare at each others eye for minutes and play music. Sometimes I feel like she always wanted to date me but scared that it might ruin her. 
But anyways she's been mentioning a guy she likes very much for last couple of months now and yesterday she told me she's kinda getting into with him. That kinda hurt me like hell again. As I'm taking Hits like this for the past 6 years. I can't imagine her getting touched by someone else  or marrying some else.
But I'm kinda getting tired of it but at the same time don't wanna give up my feelings for her but I feel like letting go is the best option for me. We decided that we'll study somewhere in Europe next year together but I guess that will not happen cause I might end things soon. I want to treasure this friendship til I die but I think it's really effecting my both physical and mental health cause I get heartaches everytime something happens. 
So either I'll try to move on in the next 3 months or I'll just end it and start a new life somewhere else."	Iexistmaybe	post	20.956872628102587	male	White	0.012475834228098392	na	na	na	1	mmfb	no prediction.

You gotta stop listening to those dark voices in your head friend. We all have thoughts like that from time to time. You're definitely not alone but it's far from the truth. You're a unique individual and like everybody in this earth, you bring something special. If you don't feel that way invest your time in improving yourself. From a random hobby or just doing things that you like to do. 

I'd recommend seeking therapy too. If you're willing to open up and be vulnerable you'll realize a lot of people are struggling with similar things. Having the humility to ask for help is huge step.

"Although I know it is not possible. But each time I see pairs of best friends I get jealous, especially when it's a guy and a girl. Jealous in the ""that's what we could've had if it only worked out"" way. Bruh even seeing Tiktoks of cats being best friends makes me sad. I did technically get a new close person but it doesn't fully cut it. We cannot game together, cannot talk about stuff in the same way. Maybe it's a matter of us knowing each other for a shorter time but idk. Nor do I really count on finding another person like that now that I am 20 and people seem to be growing out of the ""bestie"" stuff.

Now I know that things really can't get better between us (for reasons I can't tell), and that our friendship was never how I thought it was. But damn. If I could get these times back just for 1 day, I would.

"Reddit.  I need your help to feel better.

My wife had a mini stroke because of high blood pressure.

We have three boys 17,16 and 4.  Out four year old is non verbal autistic and our 16 year old is also on the spectrum.

She is stable and she is doing ok.  I work two jobs and I am trying to add as much as I can to my workload so she and the teenagers don't have to do all the household stuff.

She is tired and gets worn out very easy now. She is on medication and it's been able to reduce her blood pressure.. we are engaged with our doctor and we have plans in place to assist her.

Our older boys have done amazing for everyone and everything with this happening.  They have stepped up and done so much and haven't had to ask them to do a lot because they know how serious this is.

I just need someone to really tell me we can handle this. I feel like I am failing my family by not doing enough. It's so hard doing everything and not knowing if my wife will be ok or not.  She has been so rock steady for me during our time together and I am scared that she will have a full blown stroke and even though I have been looking and reading to know the FAST stuff on a stroke I am so scared that I am gonna lose her and I don't know how to deal with that. 

Her parents are in another state as is my mother . We have friends here but everyone has their own issues.

"TW : Domestic violence; loss 


So my husband and I have been working on getting our house finished the last year to year and a half.

During that time, I got pretty familiar and friendly with our local electrician's wife who helps him run the business and he's the licensed electrician. I'm not his biggest fan as he can be pretty crass and doesn't necessarily behave the most professional - BUT he seems to be a great electrician, reliable and knows what he's doing from all they've done on our house so far. So I keep quiet about my personal opinion of him. He's doing the job we hired him to do and has done well so far, so being turned off by his mannerisms, way he speaks and just a weird vibe from him doesn't affect the business side of our interactions. 

We're not besties or anything but we do message and chat on occasion. I usually go through her for questions and such about the house. 

My husband just got a call from another subcontractor we use for other areas on the house. Apparently he (electrician) was beating the hell out of her and she shot him. No idea if he's alive, if she's okay, if their child was there at the time, none of that. (This other guy called bc they were supposed to be finishing all our electrical at the house starting next week when he finishes.)

I'm in absolute shock over this and it's really sent me mentally back to some dark places from abusive past relationships of my own. Not to mention, I'm worried about her and their child, if he will live, if she'll be charged even though she was apparently defending herself and (not to be selfish) as my husband said, what we're going to do now on trying to get this house finished that we've been having roadblock after roadblock with.

This doesn't seem real. I'm trying to shake away the negative memories, stay in the present, and breathe through the worry/anxiety for them.

I just needed somewhere to get these thoughts out and I hope that's okay."	search4solace	post	39.59997872182909	female	White	0.017918627709150314	na	na	na	9	mmfb	no prediction.

This is just a vent. You can ignore it. But I am falling apart and I juSt need someone to hear it and this way I can pretend someone did. 

I’ve been dealing with medical stuff for a long time. They’ve had ideas, misdiagnosis, thrown medicine at it and seen what works, but nothing has ever really made things better. 

I’ll go through times where it’s okay and times where it’s completely disabling. 

Recently I started going  through one of those disabling times again but this time it was worse than ever. I couldn’t control my legs and had complete loss of bladder control. Scared the piss out of me literally you could say lol

Went to the ER and they did a lot of tests. They compared to old imaging. They honestly took their time and looked at my stuff as a whole. 

They came back and said that it’s MS and I need to get in with Neurology immediately. They found lesions, spine degeneration, newly developed scoliosis. They had a neurologist come in from another city just to talk to me in the middle of the night. 

I’m fucking scared. 

My husband doesn’t seem to understand the severity or he’s just playing it off. Idk which. “Oh it’s just MS that’s fine” but then again all my in-laws are checking in constantly and I ain’t tell them shit and he never tells them bad news unless he’s struggling severely since they can’t help, so it’s most likely just a front. 

I don’t know what the point of this was honestly. I am just scared. I feel like I’m bothering people talking about it. 

I always wanted a real answer to what was wrong with me but now that I possibly have the answer all I want is to shut that box and never open it again."	OldEmergency3723	post	26.959411995462034	male	White	0.9968271851539612	na	na	na	2	mmfb	no prediction.

"I, 18M, just got back from orientation at a fairly well known school. Long story short, we had a lot of weird icebreaker activities and at the end had a dance party till 10. 

Everyone was bonding so fast with each other but I was sitting in the corner like a freaking loser filled with envy for their joy. 

This isn't the first time this happened and happens pretty much any time I go to a ""fun"" social gathering. I keep wondering wtf is wrong with me. Why do the others seem like creatures entirely different from me? Why can't I freaking talk to people and actually establish relationships with others and share in their joy? Am I not human like them? Am I just a piece of subhuman garbage who's company is utterly worthless?

After experiencing such bouts of self loathing, I throw myself into my work to forget this pain. I grind programming and other work to prove to myself that I don't need people.

It’s been about a month since I moved after graduating from boarding school and into my grandmothers house, where my parents have been for the last year. We sold our house last year under the assumption that we would be moving to London because of my dad’s job. Unfortunately, plans changed, and we were unable to make the move. Now, we are living with my grandma for the foreseeable future, at least until next year when my parents plan to move out west. Since I moved in, I have been suffering from anxiety, insomnia, and recently symptoms of depression. I have never had problems with anxiety or depression, so this is all new. I have done a lot of thinking and research on my situation, and I have come to the conclusion that these emotions might be caused by my living situation, specifically how I dislike the area we live in now, and how stuck I am for the time being. Just knowing I’m in a place that I don’t like for so many reasons, specifically how much of a downgrade it is from where we lived beforehand (where I spent all my life before moving), has really demoralized and demotivated me. Has anyone else ever had to deal with this kind of stuff? So much I’ve read says that moving anxiety/stress/depression is common, but I feel so alone right now.	eBicGayMer99669	post	21.923012534614553	female	White	0.9958479404449463	na	na	na	1	mmfb	no prediction.
"Hey there. Really sorry to hear what your'e going through. I haven't moved around as much as it seems you have, but I've definitely had times in my life where I've struggled to adjust to new settings, and haven't really felt like I was at home, or where I wanted to be.

Looking back on all those times, one thing I wish I'd done was to take a deep breathe and realize it was temporary and that the next place would be better than the one i was at. I spent so much time moping and focusing on what was wrong with my surroundings that I didn't take advantage of what they did have to offer - and then years later, I feel like ""oh I didn't do x y and z while I was at this place, all I did was sat in my room being vaguely sad."" Anyway, I guess what i'm saying is that you'll be out of this place sooner than you think. Six-months feels like a long time. But it's really nothing. It's really just like a long airport layover, or an unplanned vacation. 

In the meantime, figure out what this place does offer that's unique and see if you can embrace it. Maybe the town is shit. But you're with your grandma. Maybe this is an opportunity for you to get to know her better. Old people have loads of great stories that they won't tell you unless you ask.

"Why not speak to them about this? It's only causing you more anxiety to let it fester. 

It could be that they are trying to push you to join them. Have you tried recently? I'm not putting you down or anything like that. I'm just asking because I don't know you. Would it help if you brought something with you that smells strongly of something you can tolerate? Like Vick's Vaporub, for example? It's a known trick to rub a little under your nose to help block intolerable smells. The only downside of that is that the food you eat will taste slightly of Vick's because smell is a part of taste.

"Yeah sure. What I'm saying is that your specific condition is relatively hard to ignore. If you are not present at family dinner, your family will certainly notice because within a smaller social circle the absence of presence of an individual is hard to ignore. simply put, your absence itself serves as a reminder to bring back food. You also mentioned that, additionally, you have reminded them to bring you something back by texting them while they were at dinner. For them to forget to bring something back after seeing your text, they would need to forget within a relatively short time-span. A typical dinner doesn't last more than one to two hours, and I could argue that that is a short timescale for an adult to forget to do something, especially when they are preoccupied in engaging in the same task for themselves (ordering and eating dinner). Additionally, it would take more than one parent to forget to bring back dinner, assuming you have no other siblings. For this excuse to be valid, you'd need both people to forget to do task x, plus reminders, at a consistent rate while engaging in task x themselves.. Additionally, the more they engage in task x and the more you remind them, the less likely they should be to forget. I'm not sure how consistent ""lately"" means, but this already seems improbable to me. Especially if it is a task related to the nurturing of their own child.

What you could do, that *would* help, is for you to tell her that you know what's been going on. Also tell her that while you don't agree with cheating, you still absolutely, without question, love your mom. Maybe she doesn't deserve the love of her family right now, but it doesn't change that she needs it.

The truth is, when an affair gets concealed like this, it's a dealbreaker. Your parents' marriage is almost certainly over.  You can't be expected to keep her secret forever.

"So this is probably just a long shot searching for some sort of advice or even just validation. For years now I've suffered with severe depression, but lately its been worse because of a situation between my fiance (22M) and I(21F). Anyways, back when he proposed in March, we agreed that now that we were engaged we would finally start trying for a baby. Well, come May, I still wasn't pregnant, and I was bouncing some ideas off of him about different things we could try to up our chances of conceiving. He then admitted to me that somehow he didn't realize we weren't actually trying (even though we agreed we were gonna back in march) and asked me to wait two months as we were getting ready to move and he didn't want the stress of trying to interfere with the already stressful moving. This was already pretty painful to me, because for those few months I was putting my all into trying and apparently he wasn't really trying at all. He also promised me that he wouldn't make me wait more than the two months because I was concerned that because we were moving into a smaller space he would be worried about space and we wouldn't get to try at all. I agreed to wait two months, but after a month I curiously gave it a shot to ask him if we could start trying a little earlier than we agreed upon. He could've said to wait another month and I would've been fine. Instead he asked to think about it, so I gave him a week to think as my fertile window for that cycle was coming up. Much to my excitement at the end of the week he said yes! I was ecstatic and we both went over a mini game plan to boost this time of trying. Enter my best friend, who voiced some minor concerns about financials between my fiance and I. Fiance and I had already discussed these prior, and I thought we had a good enough footing still to try. Well, for note, I have always been very emotional and I can't really control it. And the conversation between my best friend and I got me a little emotional ofc, and my fiance noticed. So I ended up telling him what we were talking about. And this was when he went back on his decision. He told me that he changed his mind and felt that my best friend made a point and that we should now instead wait an indefinite amount of time (at least more than a year because we agreed to live here for a year) until we are moved in somewhere new, completely settled (I'm assuming this means also completely unpacked) and have a dog. 

The day he told me that I broke down fully. And to this day I can't exactly pinpoint why it feels like my heart was shattered. I know I have wanted kids for years and years, and I know I already had my hopes up because we were already trying. I know I put in lots of effort into it. But is that really why I'm so upset? Or possibly its because he went back on promises twice? Sorta feels like he betrayed my trust a little. 

I'm not sure. My therapist is no help really, only advice I got from her is to just let myself ""grieve"", just to sit it out until it stops hurting. But its been over a month and I just don't feel good still. I still get so sad, crying at least 5-6 times a week. And when I'm not crying I am just so distant and dead inside it feels. My fiance isn't a whole lot of help either. He will cuddle me while I cry and insist I shouldn't be this sad because he didn't say never, just not now. 

I know this isn't a big thing like someone dying or something. But I still just need some advice or assurance or something. Its eating me alive and I just don't know what to do to make myself feel better.

● TLDR: My fiance told me after months of trying to concieve that we can no longer try for an indefinite amount of time (at least a year) and it broke my heart and I don't know what to do now because my depression is eating me up."

"Guy's perspective. 

We tend to think of it differently. We don't get the kind of ""baby fever"" women are prone to. We think of a child as a small, helpless thing to feed, care for, and support. If he was already nervous about finances, someone else feeding those fears may have been all it took to push him into the ""not yet"" camp. It's the place we run to if we're uncertain. 

I'd give him some breathing room on this. I can understand how you feel, but pressuring him is unlikely to do more than push him further into that camp, and could start to drive a wedge between you."	TortugaDiablo	reply	na	na	na	0.9886674284934998	no	strong	no	na	mmfb	no prediction.

"My dad is a narcissist, any advice?

Hi, first of all, my english is not very well, but I'm kinda desperate.

My dad has always been a very narcissistic person, he has anger and agressive issues, he explodes sometimes. And for some reason that I can't understand, he suddenly start blaming, yelling, insulting and even hit me for any reason (he has hit my mom too, idk why she never leave him). My recent problem with him is that I have 2 bunnies, they're are my entire life, I love them, but my dad feed them with cookies, for consequence, one of my bunnies get sick, I went to a veterinary and they told me what I already knew, bunnies can't process that kind of food. I explain to my dad but he still feed them with those fcking cookies. At this point I really don't know what to do. I have this lock on my door, but he gets mad for that and he threatens me to sell my bunnies or throw me out of the house.

 I'm a 21 girl, and I hope this year start a career, so, I hope find a job as soon as possible to finally leave my house. But I really fear that one day I'm gonna explode (we have more problems than this) and he'll ended up hitting me again or even worst, I really fear for my life. Do you guys have any piece of advice?

"Basically, I'm going to be 30 in two months and I'm living with my parents. I'm a male. I'm severely stuck in self isolation without any job or career. I visited a local career center for help, but found it wasn't helpful much at all. I struggled to get anything out of it and eventually depression took its hold once again and I stopped going there entirely. It's been since February. I'm trying to find ways to help myself out of this situation. I really don't want to live like this anymore. I have no friends (in person) at all and a boyfriend who only texts me.

Here's the problem... I've been living on food stamps for the last two years. Well, they are now trying to abruptly take them away from me and I have no other source of food at all. My parents can't support my eating habits (going to get into this too) and I can't just not eat at all. I've phoned another job/career resource center that's local to our area and they are to schedule a consultation, but have yet to call me back about it. I'm scared that if they don't help me I will be stuck without any food and practically paralyzed.

It's not all, I have no teeth. I have a set of dentures that don't work at all and my dentist is a 40+ minute drive away. My insurance wouldn't cover any other dentist to repair them as I tried to get to one in town (I could walk to). My weight is currently about 103lbs, I have a BMI of 17.1 which puts me significantly underweight. I drink almost all of my meals, which is why my parents would severely struggle to help me. I'd been ordering Boost, Ensure, Soylent, (and Huel when I get extra cash) from Amazon with food stamps. My diet is literally 95% liquids and it has been this way for the past two years.

I'm a severe psoriatic... I'm on biologics medication that I can't have taken away from me. My body is covered in psoriasis if I don't have the medication. I don't know what to do if I lose my insurance. The condition itself is so exhausting and honestly so heart breaking, so upsetting. I've tried everything outside of the medication, but with the medication I'm 95% clear which is absolutely stunning. I'm also homosexual and it's such a struggle on its own, but even worse with this condition.

A lot of my days are just spent in bed, due to physical exhaustion as well as mental. I've tried countless meditations, countless imaginal acts, subliminals, everything you could think of to make my life better. I'm so scared that if I can't get employed I will literally starve. I feel as if my family wouldn't let this happen to me, but they have themselves to take care of... It's also worth noting that I never interact with any of them more than an hour a week despite living in the same house. They do not check up on me and I don't talk to them much at all. My dad and I never got along and still don't see eye to eye.

I feel like I'm getting older and older without getting anything out of life. The want to live a life with the man of my dreams is practically the only thing that keeps me going. Yeah, probably sounds crazy or weird to others but I'm so tired of feeling these feelings all alone that I don't mind what others think anymore. I am a very loving person and I have always been this way, without judgment toward any other. I have no clue why I don't have any friends. I visited a psychiatrist and they basically just overlooked my conditions. I have an autistic cousin and I'm starting to think I may have a similar disorder that's undiagnosed.

I have obsessions, but I couldn't tell the psychiatrist as they are almost all exclusively sexual by nature. I was not and am not open about it with most people. The isolation and lack of human contact/experiences have made this really bad.

I appreciate anyone who read this and comments.  


\*\*UPDATE EDIT: I called OVR back today, they set me up with their local consultant so now I'm just waiting on a call back from her. Apparently, I wasn't fully signed up for it from the last time I called and the agent on the phone was able to fully finish the signing up process with me.
  

  
I also called EBT support and they told me to go ahead and renew my stamps, that it's not being implemented (The new policy is waivered in a lot of counties in my state) at this moment but will be something to look out for in the future. They also told me that since I'm going to be getting help for jobs by OVR, that I can inform them for an exemption. I appreciate everyone that commented here. As for the dentures, they will come second as if food supply isn't cut off or short I can go back to higher amount of consumption of what I was doing before this news came about.\*\*"	Philleth93	post	26.951367148815944	female	White	0.012910333462059498	na	na	na	8	mmfb	age: 30, gender: male, explanation: the author directly states these corresponding aspects of his identity. there is not enough information given to accurately predict the author's ethnicity.
"Shit man. Really sorry to hear about where you're at. It sounds like an almost impossible weight of things to have pressing down on top of you. I don't know what I would do in your situation, but I know it would be really hard. 

I have just a couple thoughts. I hope they're helpful - 

\- You have a couple problems. Or maybe one big problem, depending on how you look at it. But that's not important. What's important is that problems are solvable. Everything that's currently wrong in your life can be made better. The situation may be exhausting and depressing, but it's not hopeless. Not by a long shot.

\- It sounds like you're pretty isolated and I think that might be the first problem. It seems like you're trying to solve these problems by yourself. But it's going to be a whole lot easier to solve them with the help of other people. Do you talk with your Mom? I bet that if you were to talk with her and say ""Mom, I need help. I don't want to live like this, but I don't know how to change it"", you two could work together and come up with some first steps. 

\- I think professional help might be a good first step. You said you'd seen a psychiatrist, but that the psychiatrist didn't give you the answers that you wanted to hear. I would respectfully say that it might be worth going back to a different psychiatrist and listening to whatever the say, even if it's not what you think is wrong. Continue treatment for a while, do what they say -and if it doesn't work, it doesn't work - move onto another professional. But you have to be willing to take that chance for a while, you know?"

"I’m sorry to hear this man. When things start to pile up in life sometimes we freeze and let them take over our lives. I have also been through this and am currently working on it. During the pandemic i started having health issues relating to my appetite, throwing up if i ate more than a few bites of a meal. doctors never found out what it was but through the 2 years of testing and feeling completely unable to live my normal life, I started to have a similar issue of isolation (beyond just the quarantining). I have a job but it allows me to work from home so i isolate more. I also moved to a new city 2 years ago at the start of all this where I didn’t know anyone. After losing just about everything from my normal life to the isolation (friends, family, my girlfriend, my health, etc.) I started thinking of a plan to make it better. The kicking point was when my girlfriend cheated on me while I was in the hospital for a flare up with my stomach where the doctors told me I could have died. 

My insurance didn’t cover any therapists near me and medical bills were too high for out of pocket so I made my own plan: Itemize everything that was holding me back, work on a fix, and take it one by one. it’s slow but gratifying and I am still on my journey. For me i knew i didn’t go out because my apartment was such a shitshow i’d be embarrassed to bring anyone back. I knew that i didn’t clean it enough because i spent too much time in bed depressed and smoking weed. so weed was out and cleaning was in. I started seeing the doctor much more frequently and between losing the stress of my apartment being dirty and my shitty relationship I started feeling much better and my appetite is starting to return. Haven’t had a drink of alcohol since february. no weed since march. bought a scale and focused on gaining some weight back. (was down to about 130 lbs at 5’8” from normally being close to 150/155) having diet/exercise goals playing into larger goals of self improvement has given me something to focus on and helped distract me from the depression. I am no where near where I want to be but these steps have taken some weight off me and lifted that feeling of hopelessness that kept me from doing anything. my remaining goals are to continue on my health journey and prove to myself i can keep a clean, stable home. from there I want to join a volunteer group or some interest group and meet people, and hopefully be much less isolated.

I just thought I’d share since when i read your post I related a lot. i was isolated and losing weight for 2 years and it caused a lot of my life to collapse. I think a key difference is that my job was pretty much the only steady thing for me throughout everything while you are searching for one. I cannot imagine how hard it must be to look for a job when you have so much else weighing on you that it freezes you. I’m not sure Id be strong enough to do it. But i can recommend trying something similar to what I did, and addressing things 1 step at a time. your problems are too heavy to lift all at once, but you can take it in pieces. it’s slow, and it’s disheartening to know that even doing everything right things will still suck for a while, but i promise it is worth it to try. It sounds like for you, your #1 goal is to get a job. what kind of career are you looking for? some jobs like night security or bussing at a restaurant may seem terrible but you can usually find openings and they don’t require skill. even if it isn’t what you want to do for a career, it will help you get in the working mindset and give you a source of income and independence until you can find something more permanent. Life has ups and downs, and if we let ourselves, we can sometimes never climb out of the downs. You will never see the ups if you don’t though.

I'm glad you shared your story.  I'm happy to see that you are improving.  I can't really change my diet up, but I'm not sure if it's the problem.  I was able to gain weight while consuming more of the meal replacements.  I only quit because my food stamps expire in August.  I wanted to make sure I had food available for when the time comes I don't have an income or food stamps, hopefully just a small transition or potentially avoidable altogether.  


I know there will be a week or two though before I get a first pay check at any job I manage to acquire, so I have to have food stored for that as well.  Basically, I went from working out and getting my weight up to just freezing all activities and laying in bed after I heard the news of these new requirements.  I seriously feel like I'm not mentally ready or prepared for a job, especially not interacting with others or any hard labor.  Then comes the possibility of not having insurance and I can't pay for 6,000$ injections out of pocket.

"Seems like you're going through a lot and I don't really know if there is one solution to it.  I agree though that it's best to break your problems into small little solvable chunks instead of having it all as one big pile.  Priority number one is definitely to find a job.  

You're stressing about not losing weight and being overly exhausted, but I'd say you don't know that thats going to be the case when you have a job so it's best not to worry about it for the meantime.  The most important thing is to keep moving forward and putting one foot in front of the other.  Focus on finding a job for the time being and worry about the other issues later on.  

If ever you find the courage to talk to your mom, go for it because talking through your problems with someone is definitely gonna be a massive weight off your chest.

sorry i have been traveling and haven’t been on reddit for a little. unrealbadness already replied below me with excellent advice though. with so much going on it’s easy to get overwhelmed but just working on the job for now is the best idea. even if you aren’t prepared for that feeding yourself is priority. once you have income a lot of problems become easier or less stressful to deal with (rich people have it easy), but you can worry about everything else later. i think your sentiment at the end of your first comment is right on track.

"I have never felt so lonely in my life as I do now. I am due mine (f40) and my partners (m38) 3rd child in 2 weeks. I am more than 98% positive he has been cheating on me and not just messaging I've caught him now at least 3 times in the last month staying out all night not coming home till about 7am. He no longer shows any affection towards me, hardly spends any time with me or our children and gaslight me when I question him about things.

We do not live together but live on the same street and there has been many times I have been phoning and messaging him and got no answer so went to his house and his car is gone. Then the next day when I ask why he ignored my calls he lies and says he was sleeping. 

I got contacted about 18months ago by another woman he had cheated on me with and it had been going on for 6 months, she got suspicious when he wouldn't add her on Facebook and saw I was tagging him in things so got in touch and asked what our relationship was and confessed everything. I have also noticed he has deleted everything I have tagged him in for the last 3 years including milestones of our children, he has also changed his relationship status to private. I forgave him last time and thought we had got past it. 

I am at a loss as to what to do he is the biggest narcissist who does nothing but blame me and gaslight me over everything but I am struggling to cope with the children myself and I will have a newborn in 2 weeks on top of this. I love him and loathe him equally and I know he's a complete scumbag for what he's doing but I don't know what to do.

I have no idea who he is cheating on mevwith I just know the signs. I have questioned our relationship countless times this week with him giving him and out and each time he says he wants to be with me.

I want to track him to this other woman's house and catch him in the act and also let the woman know what he's playing at but have no idea how. I don't drive and I have the children so I can't even follow him. I am going crazy and I have no one to talk about this with. I feel like my head is going to explode unless I get proof but have no way of getting it.

You deserve better. If it would be me I would have left him after the sidepiece messaged me and confessed. There are obviously many signs. I understand that it is frightening to end up alone.

Younger sister is totally a teenager. Because of summer holidays, she’s spending all day on video games, barely pausing to eat. Our shared room is a mess, all her stuff, so I can’t clean it without risking her getting mad, and my dad is frustrated with the stuff on the floor. I’m the only one of the three of us doing any chores. My sister refuses to communicate about problems, and just gets angry instead. She claims she’s busy doing other stuff, which she wouldn’t have to do if she just did something other than playing on the computer all day. She’s causing herself problems and getting my dad angry. Unfortunately, I’m the only one he can talk to, so I have to listen to his rants and trying to solve problems. He raises his voice unintentionally pretty much all the time. I have trauma that results in me often dissociating when he does this, so he thinks I’m ignoring him like my sister. Usually, my mum is here, which would help with the chores and parenting that my dad isn’t doing well, but she’s on a trip right now and won’t be back for another week. I’m so sick of getting caught in the middle of arguments and getting all of my dad’s frustrations dumped on me. Someone give me a hug, please.

You absolutely don't need to be your Dad's therapist especially if he doesn't ever heed your advice or the emotional dumping is getting too much.

I don't know what to do with this information, but I found out about a year ago that my dad has been seeing a woman when my mom goes out of town...I stalk her socials and know when and where they go and hang out. I thought it had ended, but I was suspicious of something since my mom had been out of town to take care of her sick mother. I was really hoping that it was done and I could forget about it, but the last time I knew for sure they saw each other was March when I went on a girl's trip with my mom. He takes her to concerts, fancy dinners, and even to Vegas one time. I tried to tell my sister I was suspicious of something and that I saw something on his phone that I didn't like, but she shut me down immediately before I could get a word in. She said she didn't wanna know anything, and so I'm all alone in this, and I can't look at him every day... I lose respect for him more and more. I don't know what to do because this is the last thing my mom needs to know, and I don't want to blow up my family...I'm lost. I guess I needed to vent, but I can't tell anyone because there is no one I trust enough to expose my family to. Any advice?

"Oh man, this is a really tough situation. I'm glad I've never had to deal with this. Sorry your sister shot you down. One reason this is so hard is that the people you most need advice from are the one's that you can't go directly to.

It's hard to know exactly what your next move should be. Every family is unique. So what might make sense for one family might not really work for yours. One thing that I might think of is this: Does your Mom have any sisters or close female friends whom you could share your suspicions with and ask for advice from? Chances are they know your mom really well, want the best for her and if they're older chances are that they've seen this sort of situation before. And unlike your sister, they're in a position where they can handle and process the information."	Fearless-Law-1641	reply	na	na	na	0.9987727999687195	strong	strong	no	na	mmfb	no prediction.

1. Your Dad has blown up your family, not you.

2. It is not fair to you to have to keep this from your mom. Your dad shouldn't get to interfere with your relationship with your mom.

"My husband and I eloped in May and he left to join the Navy on July 2nd. His flight was supposed to leave on the 29th but it was cancelled due to weather and we got to spend the weekend together including Saturday, our one year anniversary of when we started dating. He’s truly the one for me, you always hear old couples saying “when you know, you know” and now I truly know how it feels. It’s probably selfish for me to feel so sad and lost since I haven’t uprooted my whole life and I’m not going to literal boot camp right now but I’m so lonely and sad. He falls asleep every night holding me and I’m used to talking to him throughout every day and seeing him every day and now I just have no one. I only have 2 close friends and one of them is pregnant and has a 2 year old
so I don’t want to bother her with also keeping me company. I feel like half of me is missing and the person who I want to talk to the most just can’t talk to me at all. He got to make the phone call when he got there and he told me he would be able to call me in a week. I’m naturally a solitary person so I thought i would be able to handle this a lot better than I am. I also started my period the night he left i just feel like such a mess.

"I envy handsome men. I wish I was a man sometimes… 

I keep getting ghosted by other lesbian and bisexual women.

Most women I know who are into women are bisexuals with a boyfriend.
Or they have a girlfriend.
Most of the lesbians are taken or just much older than me.

A lot of women showing interest want a third for a threesome with their boyfriend, or they want ONS/flings and experimentation.
I want a relationship not that.

Why is this so hard. 

On the other hand my straight friends have such an easy time. My best friend just found the love of her life. My mom found her dream boyfriend.

"Hey there. Really sorry to hear what you're going through. I'm not a lesbian, but I feel what you're going through. Loneliness, and feeling like your romantic life is dying on the vine, is a really tough set of feelings to feel. 

It will work out for you. It will just take longer than you want. I promise.

FWIW, everyone of every background wishes they were someone else. Straight guys who can't get laid low-key envy gay guys because gay guys seem to get laid constantly. Some straight women envy lesbians because women are a little more mature and easier to deal with in relationships (supposedly). Gay guys sometimes envy straight women because it seems a little easier for them to get men into relationships. And lesbians, man ,there just aren't that many lesbians out there - so that's hard. 

Being aware of greener grass (even when we can't get it) is part of our DNA as humans, I think.

She’s my first serious relationship and i found out today. she told me the truth and what she did with some of the guys and then to, “HAHA IT WAS A PRANK” and it would just be an unending cycle. all i did was treat her with love and respect and she even hung out with my best friend and broke us apart. I thought she was different and she has no remorse and refuses to take responsibility for what she did. She just plays with my emotions i feel emotionless and suicidal. I have nobody anymore. I don’t know what to do i am beyond hurt. She doesn’t care at all and i think honestly might be a sociopath because she only cares about herself and how people view her. idk what to do and i dont  know how to live with myself after i invested so much time into her and money and everything. i have to wait months u til i even meet anyone else to make friends and stuff like that. i don’t know how i thought if her so good until now, she is beyond manipulative.

Go look up Borderline Personality Disorder and Narcissism, and block her on everything. It doesn't feel good that her friends or anyone thinks poorly of you, but trust and believe that each and every person in her life will walk away from her if she continues to behave this way. Y'all sound very young, she may grow up and learn from her selfish bullshit someday, or she may just get worse, I've seen both happen many times with many people, but be thankful you won't be there to find out. It's hard to see anything but the pain and anger and the fresh seering slices she's taking out of you but like a kidney stone, this too shall pass. And believe it or not, this is an important experience that most people go through. The important part is on you; you can take this experience and learn from it and come out stronger, smarter, and healthier on the other side or you can hold on to the bitterness and let it rot in you and taint the relationships you'll have in the future.

I ended up going in to work anyways because I did no want to leave my coworkers down a person with no warning. As expected, I was treated like the same as the previous night. I had to sign a contract acknowledging what I had done, was berated the entire night, and was humiliated in front of my customers. They took me off of the schedule for the next week which I guess is their way of firing me. Thank you all for acknowledging my reasoning for the decisions I made. With so many people at work agreeing that I had stolen from the owners I guess I had just assumed that I was in the wrong. In hindsight I now know that what I should have done was tell my customers that it would have been made with a different liquor and have them decide if they would want to pay for the shots themselves. Anyways, I know that this is for the best. I have worked at some crappy restaurants but this has taken the prize for being the worst.

Y’all I am super anxious lmao. I got my period May 29th. After I got off my period me and my boyfriend had sex with a condom and just to be safe I took a plan b right after. From then I began to have protected sex and he would nutt in the condom, from times I would make him pull out even with the condom on. A week before my next cycle was supposed to happen we had protected sex and immediately took another plan b after due to a slight scare we had with the condom. Keep in mind we always check if the condom broke or if there is any holes in them. It is now July 3rd and no period has arrived. I’m so scared because PMS and pregnancy symptoms are so alike and I can’t tell which is which. In addition as I look up pregnancy symptoms I feel like my brain is trying to trick me into thinking that I am pregnant. I don’t know what to do! Is this normal?

I had Hodgkins Lymphoma 10 years ago and was fully treated, and am in remission. Coming up on my 10th year anniversary of treatment, I looked back to this past decade and I’m decidedly worse off than I was now at 33 than I was at 23. Back then I was in my second year of a relationship with a long-time friend who would become my wife, working an honest job as a pharmacy clerk, living on our own in a dinky little apartment. Now I’m divorced, homeless, jobless, struggling sober, mountain of school debt and waiting in purgatory for a yet-undecided date to start DBT courses. Had I known what would have awaited me down the road I would have let cancer take me. There’s nothing for me to be proud of, no legacy I’m creating to leave behind.

"Ooof. This sounds really tough. Illness and depression can really flip the script of what you think your life is supposed to be. I'm really sorry that you're wrestling with this right now. My heart goes out to you. Like everyone else said, please don't hurt yourself. 

Just a few thoughts - 

\- One of my favorite quotes is ""we know what we are, but we know not what we yet may be"" (it's a little weird, as most Shakespeare quotes are, but say it a couple times out loud and it'll hit you) but i think it's true. Right now you're in a hole, granted. But you really have no idea how the next year is going to turn out for your. You may think you know. But you don't. Just like you didn't know that you'd get diagnosed with cancer before you did. Forget everything that's happened in the last ten years. You have a lifetime's worth of possibility right now. 

\- You seem to be hung up on achievements. Baked into your comments I sense the assumption that life is only worth living if you have achievements to show for it. Achievements  like being married, or having a job, etc. etc. Those are all good things. But not having them doesn't make you worthless. Your dignity comes from something much deeper than all that.

\- You mentioned that you have no legacy. I feel that a lot too. But the truth of the matter is that almost no one has any legacy. No one is building statues to any of us after we're gone. If you'd died 10 years ago, no one would have put up a monument to you. If you die tomorrow, no one will put up a monument to you. Even the things that seem like legacies to us - children (which you can still totally have by the way), money (same), property (same same), reputation -    all go pretty quickly in the scope of time. My grandfather used to say ""Hate to tell you buddy boy, but in a hundred years no one will even know you were ever alive."" Legacy is a dumb concept. Your real legacy, your real importance, isn't about how you'll be remembered after your gone, it's about how you make a difference in people's lives right now - and because you're still alive, you can do that as well as anyone. 

\- You have a lot of accomplishments that you don't see. You were an important part of your ex-wife's life. You give your family immense joy simply by existing. A conversation you had with a friend, one that you don't even remember, may have had a profound influence on their lives. Just because you don't see the impact you've had doesn't mean it doesn't exist."	blaizek90	reply	na	na	na	0.9942581653594971	strong	no	no	na	mmfb	no prediction.
"Yo what’s up peeps I’m about to vent and some advice from people would be much appreciated. I’m 26 years old live in south Miami, not to toot my own horn but I would consider myself a good looking dude I’m tall swole a people’s person I could strike a conversation with anybody seriously.

Anyways I feel like my life right now is litterly rock bottom, with all the things I just mentioned and this where I’m at.

First off I’ve been working at the clubs for the last 8 years of my life, some clubs good some clubs trash whatever. Recently I was working at the best club in Miami if you know you know. I was making anywhere from 250$-1000$ nightly. 


Anyways I managed to save up around 25K which I ended up blowing on gambling. Yes I know stupid as f all that time wasted and gone in a span of 3 days.

So now I’m litterly working at the WORST club I’ve ever worked at in my life, I make no money a night except my hourly which if you work in the nightclub industry everybody leaves with cash in there hand. The club is ginormous like litterly the size of a concert hall yet we only get 50 people tops a night and management is horrible.

People look at me and they think Im the happiest dude ever cuz I get all the girls and Im always having fun but im litterly feeling depressed and I’ve never ever gotten to a point in my life that I’ve wanted to admit that but im depressed right now.

"So I moved to a new city for a 1 year co-op and signed a one year lease starting in the fall, everything looked great for $845 but I discovered roommates were messy and unhygienic and the place had roaches which appeared a few weeks into my stay. 

I moved into a different place for the next 4 months and I was able to find a sublet during that time and my new place was cheaper so I was getting some money back. 

In spring I signed a new place with some close friends I had met around the same price however I couldn't find a sublet for the remainder of my 1 year lease so I was essentially paying double the price from may to August (4 months). To add I had to secure a place in the city where I was going back to school after my co-op, which started in June. So I'm losing a lot of money - the one year place -$3380.

I'm 22 and entering my last year of university after this August. I basically am paying an extra $3380 for a habitable place over 4 months which is way more than I need to because I messed up and signed a 1 yr lease. Will this $3380 be worth that much 5 or however many years down the line? I am making a lot of amazing memories with my friends but now, I'm worried I'll feel like I'm just chasing the money I lost and I'll live a lot differently now that this has happened."

"That's a tough situation, but remember, sometimes things just don't go as planned. Yeah, $3380 is a chunk of change, but it's also an investment in your well-being. You got out of a bad living situation and found a place where you're happy and making awesome memories.
  

  
Years down the line, I bet you'll value those memories way more than the cash you had to part with. Money comes and goes, but experiences and good times with friends are priceless. Plus, you've learned a valuable lesson about leases and living situations that you won't forget.

I work at a bar that serves craft cocktails and allows for no substitutions whatsoever. The idea is the the cocktail was perfectly created and each guest will get to try what the cocktail was created to taste like. The other night I had a large party that ordered shots, but we had run out of the liquor made to use them. The bartender then replaced the normal Titos vodka with Malibu rum and told me not to tell the guests. Our manager knew and told me to charge the same price as the normal shot which is around $15. To preface: I know what I did is wrong. But in the moment I thought it was unfair to the guests to lie and thought this was a good solution (obviously it wasn't). I open item'd the shot and charged for around half the price. My table was happy and I felt okay telling them it was made with Titos instead of Malibu. But my manager found out and he and the owners had a meeting with all of us this morning where he told everyone that I had been stealing for weeks and that this is inexcusable (this was the first time I did this). I know what I did was wrong and I am okay with facing the consequences that will follow. My question is, do I still go in to work my last shift? They haven't fired me yet, but at the meeting the owners said that it would happen with no questions asked. I worked last night and everyone could tell that I was being treated like crap, even the guests. I know that the right thing to do is to work my last shift but I am not sure if I can mentally handle 8+ hours of being called a stealer. Please no mean comments I cannot handle much more of it. What I did was stealing but it was hard for me to lie to my table and in the moment I thought it was a good solution.

I'm not sure I'm following the story. It seems like out of everyone in the story, you did the least wrong thing, and that it was both the bartender and the manager who were doing shady things? (And then on top of that, the manager made up a lie about you and is damaging your reputation?) Regardless, if my work environment was making me feel like absolute shit and they hadn't even technically fired me yet but it was coming down the tube and I only had one shift left, I'm not sure I would show up for my last shift. I might quit, or say I was sick, since it seems like that bridge has already been burned (although again, this still doesn't seem like a just or fair situation towards you at all, and if that's truly the case, then I might request a meeting and get it straightened out.)

Tito’s is a decent quality vodka and Malibu is a sugar filled coconut rum. Those two things are not even close to an acceptable substitute for each other. I’m also (not severely, but it makes me break out in hives) allergic to coconut, so that’s not something they should be doing without warning to a customers anyway. You should definitely have warned customers that it was made with Malibu then let them decide if they were ok with it- that’s your biggest screw up in my opinion, because if there’s not other coconut ingredients in the drink what you did could potentially cause problems. I don’t see it as outright theft but the bartender and manager were both extremely sketchy before you came in. I know this is probably a blow to you but that sounds like a place you’re way better off without to begin with and I hope you bounce back fast and find another job that suits you much better!

"you did not steal, you did not do anything wrong, and screw corporations and business culture for making you feel this is at all a reflection of you as a person. 

those corporations steal from you and your fellow workers every day, profiting off your labor. you are not the bad guy here, you just helped take back for your own people, as you should.

"You didn't steal anything. Stealing means you took something that didn't belong to you. You didn't take anything, did you? Did you personally benefit from what you did?

Or--Are they trying to infer that you robbed them by not going along with the bartender's lie, and knowingly overcharging and defrauding their customers, instead doing the honest and standard protocol of itemizing the downgrade with a discount? The only thing that wasn't done, that was arguably the most important, was getting the customer's consent to substitute an ingredient with a very different, less expensive ingredient. It's not just about honesty or money, it's about liability.


Stop being so meek. You're being a doormat to terrible people. You did the right thing. The bartender should never have done that. The manager should never have told you to lie.

"I (18m) have been going through a rough time and i don’t really have many people to talk to and i really cab use some advice. It all started in 2017, i had a girlfriend we were together for almost 1,5 half years. She passed away in a car accident. After that basically my life was a mess I couldn’t look at anyone else with the same eyes for 3 years. in 2020 i started catching feelings for someone, i only had 2 friends at the time they were like brothers to me i would die for them. So they were the only people who know about my past. Anyway one of them lets call him A, started texting this girl behind my back and long story short the girl used me for attention and left me for him. It was a really depressed time for me after all that time i finally catch feelings for someone and the person i call brother used me for just to be with her. I really didn’t get over it I tried to kms couple times in some i failed others i just couldn’t. And 6 months ago i again started to catch feelings for another girl, this was the only girl i ever felt like “hey, this is it. I will marry this girl” (dont get me wrong i never date someone for just fun i always was serious until the very end but somehow i never felt this in my heart) we started dating and everything is perfect but suddenly somethings gone wrong and we broke up early this month and since then nothing is going right, one of my friend khs and i dont know the reason, my parents decided to get a divorce and they only aunt i love and talk to had a heart attack. those are only couple of the things happening every day in my life and i have no idea what to do where to go. I feel so lost, I can’t get over her that’s for sure and i really dont want to. If she’s happy then i am happy with or without me idc. But i dont have that energy and power anymore to keep going. I am lost i dont know what to do. To be honest I don’t really thing anything anyone is going to say to help me is going to work. I will probably be gone soon but i just wanted to talk to someone i guess.

Im not type a guy who go on parties, clubs or bars. I don’t look at other girls, i don’t follow any girls, i don’t have girl friends. I love my girlfriend so much i will do anything to make her happy, make her life easier for her. I talk to my close friends about my relationship with her sometimes and they even get mad at me because of how much i love her. (What i mean with ‘get mad at me’ is they can’t even understand this amount of love and get confused) I always tell her that i love her, i make sure that she feels that i love her and i know she does, last thing she said to me before we broke up was “i never felt loved this much in my entire life, thank you for that really” so i know i did what i can. I never let her sleep in a bad mood i used to save bunch of funny videos and send it to her all at once at the time she goes to bed to look her phone for a couple of minutes so at least she can laugh before she sleeps. Its never about pride for me i’ll apologize and make things right even tho she’s wrong, we always can talk about the problem and fix it later.

I go to the gym to keep myself busy and stop thinking for at least an hour. I barely can sleep at night because of how much I overthink and when i at least fall asleep i always see a dream about we are getting back together.
I cant cry, I couldn’t be able to cry for a long time now. Its not because it doesn’t hurt but for some reason i really cant. I feel like I’m going cold and this is not who i am. I love showing how much i love my girlfriend but it feels like if its really end for us to be, i won’t be able to love someone else ever again. Maybe she doesn’t know this but she saved me man. I gave up on me on my life and this little hope of me being happy with this girl is kept me alive, that hope was the very thing that made me put the knife on my throat down. I don’t want to live without her.
Yes i know kms is selfish i have parents i have a younger brother (16m) and i have my friends but trust me when first time you have those suicidal thoughts your family keeps you going, if you can get out of this mindset you’ll live but if you can’t than your family is not gonna hold you for much longer. After my family wasn’t enough for me to keep going my religion stopped me (muslim) fear of going hell stopped me from kms but right now i don’t believe in god anymore so that is not helping either.

Its like i know i will kill my self but still trying to hear something that would make me feel better about it. But lets be real, only thing that can make me want to live its she and i being together again and forever."

"Hey dude,
  

  
I'm really sorry to hear about all the tough things you're going through right now. It's a lot for anyone to handle. Losing people you care about deeply, in so many different ways, is really hard. And it's okay to not be okay.
  

  
You've been through a lot, more than many, and you're still standing. That takes strength, even if you don't feel strong right now. It's okay to need some time to process all this. You're not alone in feeling lost and overwhelmed.
  

  
When everything seems dark, please remember there are resources out there for you, like hotlines and counseling services. There are also strangers online who genuinely care about you and want to help. I'm one of them.
  

  
You've mentioned that you think nothing can help you, but have you considered professional help like therapy or counseling? Talking to someone qualified can really help to unpack and process everything you're going through.
  

  
I understand if you don't feel the energy to keep going right now. But trust me, things can get better. You've been knocked down, but that doesn't mean you'll never rise again. And it's okay to ask for help to get back up.
  

  
Don't be afraid to reach out, whether to professional services, online communities, or even just posting like this again. You're worth helping, you're worth listening to, and you're worth more than you know.

"hey op! just wanna chime in as an almost-therapist (soon to be): it’s perfectly okay and normal to struggle with transitioning to a new therapist. i hope you know that it was probably a hard call for her to make as well- much as we want to continue to help and see our clients grow, we aren’t always the best person to facilitate your growth. it sounds like your therapist recognized this, and did the responsible thing in referring you to someone who will be the most likely to help you grow the most, even if that hurts and is hard in the short term. though, of course, it also is totally understandable you’re feeling shitty, given that to you it felt like it was a good fit.

"The definition of cheating depends on the people involved. To your now ex, yeah this probably was hence the mutual break up from the sounds of it. Talking amongst friends is one thing and crushes can happen but if your ex saw that and anticipated it, it doesn’t sound like it was innocent and he probably saw that feelings were clearly involved which I can imagine probably hurt him. Even if it’s not overtly flirty or sexual, you indulged in feelings for another person in a relationship and your ex saw that for what it was. To me, that can be considered cheating and I think you know that as well which is why you’re trying to justify it for yourself so you don’t feel the guilt that comes from something so objectively bad.

All of that said, clearly it played itself out and all of that is in the past. There is nothing actionable that you need to do here for anyone involved. People make mistakes and it’s not worth beating yourself up over it at this point. Acknowledging it for what it is will help you move past it. If it’s nagging on you enough to make a post like this, you’re clearly feeling some form of guilt. You’re not a bad person. You’re human like everyone else.

"I’m in the best state I’ve ever been in in life. My family has reeled back from constant verbal abuse and religious slaughtering of my emotional self to quiet disappointment and religiously blackmailing me to live under their roof. My friends lives are all changing and growing and living their best lives. And my mental health is the best it’s ever been, and you know what?

I fucking hate my life.

Is this really the best I can get? I’ve been academically dismissed from my university because my ADHD, depression, anxiety, and CPTSD beat me into a state of needing to cope 24/7. I can’t go anywhere or do anything unless there is music or TV or video games, food, or any other unhealthy coping option I’ve developed over the years present and available. My therapist tells me that I have a great understanding of myself but I can’t even comprehend the violent hurricane of emotions within me. My friends have left me behind and barely register my prescience online, and I haven’t seen them in person in over a year. I can’t make new friends because I’m so damn traumatized that I overwhelm everyone, and even those who haven’t been overwhelmed can’t connect with me emotionally. I can’t take sick days from work because my parents track my every move, and I can’t work because I’m so mentally drained and exhausted.

Why didn’t I just kill myself 3 years ago? If this is really the best my life can offer, I should’ve done it. The only thing that keeps me alive is the art that I use as a life support. “I can’t kill myself until the next spiderverse movie” I’m always joking to myself about. But how much of a joke is it really?

Not like it matters in the end, the only people I have ever had contact with either hate me, have low opinions of me, or purely professional opinions. No one cares about me beyond the work I do.

This happened last year but it keeps traumatizing me and I think about it often. I went to the local shelter and saw a dog named ‘Big Spot’ because he was white and brown large dog with a big brown spot on his back. I remember his eyes, looking up at me with hope. I remember he still had a collar on, it looked worn and dirty. At that time I couldn’t adopt him due to my apartment not allowing his breed. I though surely he would get adopted he was so sweet and gentle. About two weeks later I called because I wanted to know if he got adopted…they told me he had to be put down “due to capacity” of the shelter. I cry everytime I think about him. I wish I would have just adopted him right there and then he would still be alive now. I think about how scared he must have been when they put him down. I failed him.

"I’m so sorry. It’s a terrible situation all around. Unfortunately, you were restricted due to your apartment regulations. And often times shelters check with apartments to prevent their animals from getting returned or abandoned. 

The only thing you can do now is move forward. If you’re out of that apartment, adopt a dog that’s been waiting awhile for a home, or ask the shelter to see if any are on death row. Even adopting any dog from a shelter that you click with would be great. Big Spot would want another dog in a shelter to go to a loving home."

"You could not do anything for him because you could not take him in at your apartment. You have absolutely no fault or responsibility in this.

What you are feeling is the bubble of unawareness bursting and the empathy for each dog pouring through, and that hurts, but it is ultimately a good thing. It makes you a more sensitive person, a kinder person. It will make you a more loving dog parent and someone who puts awareness in the world as to what is wrong with the system.

It is a horrible situation because people keep breeding dogs with the idea they will make quick money, because people want dogs from puppy mills because they are attached to a specific breed, so only one dog in 50 gets a forever home. It IS horrible, but as Mr. Rogers used to say, look at the people helping. There are vets who spay and neuter dogs pro bono to help reduce the problem. Bob Barker used to end his show remining people to get their dog fixed. People volunteer at shelters, work to get the word out about how dire things are.

You can do a lot. You can adopt a shelter dog that your apartment will let you have, and that frees up a spot at the shelter. You can donate money to shelters, or dog food etc. You can only adopt shelter dogs so the dogs we already have get a loving home. It will sometimes feel like not enough, but with so many of us doing these things, it adds up."	Majestic_Indication5	reply	na	na	na	0.9940673112869263	weak	no	no	na	mmfb	failed
">At that time I couldn’t adopt him due to my apartment not allowing his breed.

There it is. You did not have the ability to save the dog. You feel sadness, which is appropriate, and speaks well of you.  

You should not feel guilt, because there was no action you could have taken that would make any difference.

"The sad reality is, a lot of life can be painful and cruel. Suffering can't be avoided entirely and not everyone can be saved from such a fate. You can't put that kind of pressure on yourself, it'll just drive you mad. You have a good heart and that empathy makes a difference. 

Even at shelters, the veterinarians and vet technicians still do their best to end lives with respect and dignity. If he was humanely euthanized, it shouldn't have been painful. The word euthanasia means ""good death"". Hopefully he got some yummy treats and kisses before he was anesthetized (the first injection, to make sure unconsciousness is induced before the one used to stop the heart). It was all done to prevent further suffering, don't forget that. There aren't enough resources to keep everyone healthy and happy and difficult choices had to be made. It's NOT fair.

Adopting another dog, volunteering at a shelter, donating money, spreading awareness, and just caring, all of that helps. I'm sorry for the devastation you feel. Allow yourself to feel everything. It means his life mattered and impacted you, which is truly a beautiful thing in the end.

Every time you think of big Spot, you honor him. When you adopted another dog, you also honored him.

Get help.  Grieving takes time even if you aren't trying to get a diploma against a tide of depression.  Find people who support you in this time of need.

Please talk with your high school counselor.  That's what they're there for.  You have been through things that your peers have not.  Most schools in the U.S have online credit recovery, which can help you make up the classes you missed.  You're only 16, so please don't get downhearted about your credits.  You can still attend school, hang out with your friends, and make up those credits during a special accelerated class rather than repeating the same class all over in a classroom with students who are younger.  You can do this.  I wish you all the best, and please, let us know how you're doing!!	CodGod27	reply	na	na	na	0.9986269474029541	weak	no	no	na	mmfb	no prediction.

I understand not having friends at a new school.  Trust me, I've been there.  But what I did not have back then was a way to make up missed credits so I didn't have to re-take classes with students younger than me, who might have laughed at me.  I'm sure that your school has a credit recovery program where students can go and take classes they've missed.  Often, students learn even more from these programs than they would from an actual teacher.  Please give your counselor one more chance,  Or, schedule an appointment with an administrator such as an assistant principal or a dean.  Your graduation means a lot, not only to you, but when it comes down to numbers that the principal has to defend in front of the school board.  Please don't give up!!

"i’m not sure what forum to submit this to but basically being on time is really important to me. for example, if my sister and i had plans to meet at 3pm and by 3:15pm she’s still not at the house, i get sooooo angry i don’t even want to go anymore. i also feel this way with “unofficial” scheduled times. 

i’m sure others have felt this but i feel like the way i experience it is different? there will be times when i will just refuse to go somewhere after a certain amount of time waiting because in my head, if i don’t do it when i was supposed to, there is no point. maybe that’s impatient or bratty, but i NEED things to be done on time and i even prefer to do things earlier than needed. i think a major part of why i get so frustrated and angry is because i can’t drive, so it’s just me waiting around for whoever to finally be ready so we can go. 

i just got really upset with my bf because he gets off work at 12am and we made plans to go to the gym after he got off but he was calling his mom for like 2 hours… it’s 2:30am and we are still at home. im frustrated because i want to go but i can’t as i have no means of transportation and it’s been pushed back by over an hour. it was an important call so i feel like i can’t be too upset, but i am. i really hate that i’m like this and i have absolutely no idea why."	g0thsugarr	post	10.203571986663203	female	White	0.9983677268028259	na	na	na	4	mmfb	no prediction.

"Hey there. Really sorry that you're feeling this way. It sounds like you feel really powerless, and that's a painful way to feel.

I don't know: You say you have no idea why other people being late makes you so mad, but then you give a pretty good, convincing reason as to why it makes you mad (that, since you can't drive, when the people you depend on are a little late that ends up throwing your whole day totally off.) That makes a lot of sense, honestly. Even if it's just a few minutes of lateness, it might be giving you the (exaggerated) feeling that you're out of control.

Knowing why you're getting mad can help you get less mad. Like, when you start to feeling yourself winding up, you can remind yourself that ""okay, i'm just doing this because i'm afraid of this other thing."" 

But long-term it might help to start working towards the goal of getting your license, so that you're a little more independent and you don't have to be afraid that you won't get able to do what you need to do because of someone else's lateness, you know?"	g0thsugarr	reply	na	na	na	0.9983677268028259	strong	no	no	na	mmfb	no prediction.

"Trigger warning, this story includes mention of mental illness, suicide, and workplace discomfort/abuse.
  

  
I am a 24 year old woman living on the East Coast of the US. A lot of things in my life were traumatic events and due to those things I have severe PTSD. I went to Catholic school my whole life until 11th Grade, and was extremely bullied. When I would come home, my parents abused me too, and I had a lot of undiagnosed mental health issues as a child. Two of the main diagnoses I have received were ADHD at 20 and BPD at 21. Most of my life has been spent in and out of doctor's offices, mental health hospitals, and treatment centers. My social life has always been very chaotic and toxic until the last few years. Basically, I never got a break.
  

  
I have been really late to everything when compared to others my age. I went to college late and established myself late, and always felt very left out due to my mental health struggles. I have also been taking a long time away from social media due to how toxic the internet can be, and decided I would live my life more peacefully without it.
  

  
On top of my trauma from family and peers, I also had multiple traumatic and abusive encounters with police officers, in which they took advantage of my vulnerability and hurt me. Between the ages of 10-15, my parents would just call the police whenever there was an issue at home. I would have manic episodes so severe I would need to be taken to the hospital, which was a result of my home situation, high doses of the wrong medications, and lack of help. I saw lousy therapists who always sided with my parents, and psychiatrists who put me on heavy duty Lithium and Seroquel at the age of 10, which lead to me being rushed to the ER with a reaction.
  

  
My vice principal in high school told me to ""snap out of my depression"" when in the middle of a panic attack due to the pressure and lack of direction and sense of self in 11th grade. As soon as that incident happened, I told my parents I would never return to the all-girls Catholic high school I was forced to go to, and transferred to the nearest public school, where I already had some friends. The friends I had in public school only lasted for that one year, using me for free rides, and disapproving of me being a virgin. They would pressure me and tell me I needed to have sex with my first boyfriend. Right after high school, I had to grow up really fast, taking care of my grandmother with Alzheimer's while also going to college and working full time. I worked as a waitress while going to community college, and at that job I met an older man who groomed me and convinced me he was single even though he was married. After 1.5 years at community college, I transferred to a state college and dormed there. I'm going to keep this part short, but I attempted suicide while dorming, which landed me in the ICU where I was in a coma and almost didn't make it. I had to remain in the hospital for the next month due to abnormal bloodwork. Since then, I am grateful for this experience for it has made me stronger and more grateful for the things I have and for life in general. This toxicity and lifestyle continued for the next few years until I met my current partner and future husband in 2020. The pandemic was a whirlwind and I don't feel I would have gotten through it to this point without my man. For the past 3 years, I have been feeling much more stable and grounded due to my environment and the fact I have been living with my partner.
  

  
I wanted to include my background and the things I have been through because it is important to know the vulnerable and unhealed state I was in when going into this job.
  

  
In November of 2022, I accepted a warehouse position for a clothing company near my home. This company is quite small and I had never been in one of their stores, but knew one had opened up near me. I really needed the money and was sick of gig economy and Uber Eats, wanting a full-time position that made me feel rewarded. At the time, I was going to school online and wanted to pursue my Bachelors degree in Marketing. I was hired pretty quickly, and during the interview it was kind of weird because the man who managed the warehouse (we'll call him ""B"") was very strange in how he introduced me to everyone, including one girl who didn't even say hi and didn't look like she wanted to be there, compared to everyone else. On my first day, it was apparent to me the workplace was very cliquey, and throughout my first week I met a number of people who worked for this company and got the impression that everyone really hated their job. For reference, I am 5'7"" and around 190 lbs, and was always able to lift more than other women who worked in my other workplaces, but wouldn't consider myself extremely strong, probably being able to lift 60-80 lbs at a time. B was extremely surprised that I had the drive to work that I had, and was always complimenting me and calling me things like ""Rookie of the Year"" even from my first day. Just to preface, walking into this job, I was very vulnerable and was not on speaking terms with much of my immediate family due to an argument that happened in August 2022. I was very broken up about it because the holidays were nearing and I was worried about how Christmas would be.
  

  
After about 2 weeks of working at the warehouse, the girl who was quiet during my interview (we'll call her ""A"") started to talk to me. A would come up to me during random points throughout our shift and we would get to know each other. We spent a lot of time together pulling orders on Cyber Monday due to a big sale. The second day after we started talking to each other, she came up to me and told me how she felt about B: that he was an old, horrible man with very bad intentions. A came up to me multiple times while I was tagging clothes to tell me that B was circling behind me and she would whisper ""He wants to F\*\*\* you."" This caused me to feel constantly paranoid at work, despite trying to shrug it off and saying it didn't matter because I was happy with my partner, and we were planning on getting engaged soon. I constantly talked about my partner, and it was very obvious that I wasn't single. One other coworker (we'll call him ""D"") would constantly follow me and A around the warehouse, snooping on our conversations. A told me that a former employee had filed a complaint that D was stalking her, even following her to her other job. When A and I were talking about this, D was eavesdropping and approached us, denying any of that happened. I rarely spoke with D, not knowing much of what he did besides printing tickets, and the majority of the time he was in the backroom either sleeping on a table or on the floor. This made me question my work environment because I didn't know what I was really getting myself into. D approached A and I randomly to rave about Andrew Tate and tell us how much he loves him. I started to laugh and said ""Seriously? That guy is no good."" which was met with prying and questions while denying Andrew Tate had done anything wrong. Later that week, Andrew Tate was caught holding women hostage and forcing them to make OnlyFans videos, while taking their profit without their consent. A and I found out about this on Instagram and were discussing it. As soon as one of us said ""Andrew Tate is a rapist,"" D came over denying everything and coming to his defense.
  

  
The following week, I found out that I was making less than everyone else there, being hired at $16.25/hr, while everyone else was making $18/hr. At the time, my boyfriend and I were really struggling to make ense meet and those extra 2 dollars/hr would have made a huge difference. Of course A is the one who told me I was making less, so I immediately told B I wanted to be paid the same as everyone else because it's what I deserved. He then said ""You're not supposed to talk about salary and we can get in trouble for that."" In NYS, Section 194 of the Labor Law prohibits employers from restricting employees' ability to inquire about, discuss, or disclose wages with other employees. I didn't know this at the time, so I thought I was just trying to fight for my rights and equal pay as a woman. B did not like this and even mocked me saying an extra few dollars would not make a difference. I came in early to talk to him about this in his office and was crying hysterically. I was really enjoying working there, and I love clothes and fashion, so it was fun for me most of the time. The job was also only 10 minutes from my house and the physical labor was awesome because I was losing weight left and right.
  

  
After this, B started giving people weird hours and promised me personally he would give me the most hours because he could not give me a higher wage. This was suspicious to me because I was becoming friends with A and her boyfriend who also worked there. B always made fun of A and commented on how her and her boyfriend ""were attached at the hip"" and were too close, which he didn't like. This was a huge red flag to me, because my boss should not be so concerned with his employees' love life, and B and D made many extremely sexist comments. B was a strong Trump supporter with a lot of hatred for Biden, which didn't add up to me. He was Jewish and would speak very negatively about the Jewish culture and would not even acknowledge that Hanukkah was coming up during the holiday season.
  

  
I arrived at work early and left late just about every day and always made a point to organize the entire store, sweep and mop, which nobody else really did. I took a lot of pride in this job and was really proud of how I was doing, because due to my social anxiety and the pandemic, I was finding it hard to work anywhere. The last couple of weeks that I was working there, in February 2023, there was a strange vibe in the office, and B was ignoring me which was odd because he would usually come up to me throughout the day to have random conversations. One day on my way to work, I stopped at 7-11 and ran into an old therapist of mine, who was the first good therapist I had (we'll call her ""V""). She was very excited to see me because the last time we spoke was right after my suicide attempt in college, and we lost touch afterwards. We had a great conversation and caught up. I was very excited to get into work, my hair and makeup were done, and I was wearing a cute outfit. This meant a lot to me, because the last year was really hard for me and I was just started to regain my sense of self and confidence. When I got into work, B ignored me and A came in frustrated with me as well but wouldn't tell me why, acting extremely nervous and upset with no clear reason. I got in at 8:00 and around 11:30 I was pulled into the office by B for no reason. When I walked into the office, I saw the HR manager (who I only met once when I was first hired), and B took a long time to get to the point, but then told me out of nowhere that I was being fired. I had never been fired from a job before so I was in complete shock. That same day, he rehired a former employee, who was a high school student. When I asked him why he was firing me, he said that ""it just isn't going to work out."" When I turned to the HR manager flabbergasted, she had a smirk on her face while sitting on a folding table, swinging her legs and chewing gum. If not for my growth, I would have laid her out because she deserved it, laughing and making fun of someone she has no understanding of, and just didn't give a damn. I asked B why he hired another guy then if he needed to fire me, and he told me it was none of my business what he was doing. To me, this seemed very staged and odd, and when I went back to A, she had no response and looked like she was holding back laughter at me. On my way out, I was extremely frustrated, so I flipped over a few folding tables and screamed that B was a sexist asshole. I then left and went straight home, because I didn't want it to escalate to the point I would get arrested for doing something stupid.
  

  
My partner went back to the warehouse to talk to B and get an explanation, and got no sympathy or any kind of explanation. After this, I was extremely suicidal and thought my world was ending. It is incredibly hard for me to trust people now, but I plan to pursue a career in Home Care in the future, and am taking care of my other grandmother full-time at her home. I really just wanted to vent about this because I am feeling extremely lost and think about this every day. it feels like it has outweighed all of the other traumatic events in my life and I don't know how to move on from this. I am just looking for listening ears and any kind of advice on how to move forward from something like this that is affecting me so strongly every day.

It’s been about three weeks since I moved into my new apartment, and all of a sudden I’ve been having some problems. This was my first permanent move out of my parents house after college, and I feel like the “novelty” stage of moving is finally over now that I’ve set everything up. I’m having trouble comprehending the move. I don’t really miss home, I’m just struggling to accept the fact that I’m living somewhere other than home for the first time in my life. It’s been very disorienting, and I’ve found myself panicking on the toilet, or suddenly feeling out of place like I’m somewhere totally unfamiliar, despite having surrounded myself with deco and furniture I’m familiar with. This issue especially manifests itself at night, because I start to feel scared and uncomfortable in bed. It feels like when I was a kid and couldn’t sleep at night because I was scared of monsters, or the dark. Ive tried breathing techniques or other CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy) techniques to calm myself down, but haven’t found a solution yet. I know it might sound childish, and I certainly feel that way. I just want to know if this is a me problem, or if anyone else has had problems adjusting to a new place like I am.

"Really sorry that you're going through this. It doesn't sound very pleasant. 

Everyone has slightly different reactions to the same stimuli, so it can be hard to say what's generally true and what's particular to you. But though I haven't found myself panicking, when I've moved I've definitely found myself to be restless and disoriented. I definitely have a hard time sleeping in new locations, even ones that are comfortable.

 (It's strange, whenever I go out of town and have to stay at a hotel - no matter how nice it is, I can never sleep well. And it's not like my home is a four-star resort. It's just that my brain knows that this isn't home, and thus it's a bit on edge.) 

My gut feeling is that this is probably a mostly normal reaction. It takes time to get used to a place and to really feel comfortable where you are.

You sound a little like me and I’m more than double your age. Here’s the thing. You are feeling lonely. It doesn’t help that all your friends are in a relationship which makes it particularly hard because that changes their priorities. There are a couple of things you should be mindful of. Your need for someone is coming from a place of loneliness. You will not find the right person if you are not in a good place yourself. Trust me I got attached to the wrong person and it hurts. Third, make the best of being single! Who knows how long this will last? Eventually you’ll find someone. You can totally be independent right now. You don’t have to consult a partner in making plans, deciding what to do with your spare time, what games to play, where to go eat, who to hang out with, when to sleep in or get up…. All of those decisions you can make in a whim. The only person you gotta make happy is yourself. Make yourself your biggest priority. You have lots of love to give? Give it to yourself! Do all the things the ideal you would wanna do. Learn a new skill, watch movies in a theatre by yourself, do whatever. Enjoy the company of your family and friends. Take in all the good don’t accept the negative. Dude this is an opportunity that not everyone gets. Discover yourself. Learn about mindfulness and self love. Do this work now unlike people like me who got into a relationship without doing the work then had a midlife crisis.	aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa85	reply	na	na	na	0.9981673955917358	weak	strong	no	na	mmfb	no prediction.
"The further out from the relationship I get the more I feel I made the right choice in ending it. I don't miss them anymore. But I am now starting to feel rage for my past self. 

It was so bad that I was too ashamed to tell anyone about what happened after.  The type of verbal/emotional manipulation that makes you physically ill after experiencing. I'm not sure I can even describe the things they did without having to put a content warning on this post. 

I've been finding out in pieces that they are painting me to be a monster to the people around them. Telling people outright lies about how I was controlling and demanding, despite how I was constantly accommodating them and putting myself last to make them happy. 

I know I will probably never know these people. I know in the grand scheme of things it doesn't matter. But...sometimes I want to scream from the rooftops what they did to me. I find myself wishing I had screenshot the disgusting things they said to me so I had 'proof' before I blocked and deleted them. I know that's not healthy...and it's for the best I don't have access anymore, but still. 

Sometimes I imagine scenarios where someone comes up to confront me and I pull out the receipts and tell them every single disgusting thing they did to me. I imagine posting it online with their full name attached so everyone in the world can know. They are a licensed therapist who works with abused teens. I think it's disgusting they are even allowed to have that job when they are so sick themself.

In the end, I won't ever do anything about it. I might tell a friend or two, but never my family. Probably not even a therapist, because I am so ashamed of letting any of it happen to me. I'm ashamed of being so naive. 

I'm trying my best now to move on, but a part of me keeps pulling me back into that frustration and exhaustion. Something about being seen as the villain while I was being abused makes me sick to my stomach. It's a terrible feeling."

"Argh, this sounds horrible. I totally get how awful this must be making you feel. Not being in control of your reputation is a really powerless feeling.  And I totally get those daydreams you've having about confronting him with all of the receipts and making everyone know what he's done.

All that said, as awful as these feelings are, and as much as you cringe at your past self, you're actually really lucky to have gotten out of a relationship with him. As bad as things are, they were worse before and you made them better.

FWIW - whenever anyone tells me about how crazy their ex is / was, I don't remember or take any of that seriously. It's like someone telling me the weather in a city I'll never go to. So whatever he's saying is probably falling on deaf ears. One of my favorite quotes of all time is ""You wouldn't worry half so much what people think about you if you realized how seldom they do."" And I think that's important to remember here.

And secondly, about being ashamed of being so naive: Everyone who is not naive started out as naive, then something embarrassing happened to them and they learned some things.

"Before I started smoking weed regularly, I had dealt with depressive episodes, but after I quit and dealt with the withdrawal symptoms, I’m left with a completely new depression that is unending, unlike what I’ve dealt with previously. 

I’m 18 and live with my dad who doesn’t know anything about what’s going on with me, and I am not going to tell him. However, I can’t afford therapy and even if I asked him he would be upset with me for not talking to him, instead of focusing on the actual issue, (which is the major reason I don’t talk to him, ironically.)

The only time he has put me in therapy, it was with some christian organization and they mostly just prayed for me, which obviously had no effect.

I’m young and stupid, so I don’t know how medical insurance works, and it’s under his name anyways. I move out in two months, but I don’t think I’m gonna be able to deal with this for that long. Even if I could afford it, he has my location and I can’t just sneak off to go to therapy.

I saw a picture of myself today, which I hadn’t seen before. I was looking down a bit, and I totally had a double chin. I’ve always been called very skinny because I’m tall and don’t eat much (anxiety reduces my appetite, and I’m quite anxious most of the time), but recently I’ve been eating less healthy. I probably look like I’m a healthy weight, but I’m technically overweight. My genetics are not in favour of me staying a healthy weight. I don’t want to be overweight, but I really don’t want an eating disorder, either. I don’t know how to find the middle ground.

Sorry to hear what you're going through. I've definitely had those moments when I see a picture of myself that sends me into a spiral. I think we all have.  First off, I mean, photos aren't a great measure of how healthy you are. One picture, from one angle, and show a double chin. Another pic from another angle can show no double chin. Perspective is everything. Also, if you do want to lose weight - and it's okay if you do, and okay if you don't - there's no need to panic. There's not just two options, overweight and having an eating disorder. There's a third option, which is making a few relatively minor changes to your diet and exercise routine, being a bit more conscious, and looking and feeling better. It takes a little effort. But not a ton. And it's something that 98% of people in society have to deal with.  It may be something to work on, but it doesn't sound like it's anything to be anxious about.

"You realized that your physical image of yourself no longe matches your mental image of yourself, and that is causing stress because you have dissonance in your identity.

The first thing i would do is remember that pictures are not the best representations of ourselves. Angles, lighting, and perspective matter dramatically. There is no smart phone on sale today that doesn't do some kind of image post-processing to edit colors, tone, brightness, and even sharpness by default. It's literally baked into the firmware, you cannot turn it off. All of those things contribute to minor alterations that can materially change how we see ourselves.

I would go and check with the mirror. I don't mean stare yourself down naked and *look* for things you're unhappy with, because you *will* find whatever it is you're looking for. Instead, just give yourself a glance over in the mirror in normal lighting, make eye contact with yourself. See if you feel that same reaction.

If no, then rest easy that it was just the camera. If yes, then sit down and ask yourself some questions:

1. Is your condition medically concerning? If yes, seek advice from a trusted doctor.

2. Is your condition mentally distressing? (More than just uncomfortable, but giving you feelings of wanting to stop eating altogether, binge and purge, self harm, etc) If yes, seek advice from a trusted therapist.

Remember to have patience with yourself regardless. Don't buy into fat burning schemes. Don't buy into ""get ripped quick"" schemes. Dont kill yourself at the gym 7 days a week. Don't cut your calorie intake in half suddenly without paying attention to nutrition. Even if you think you'll only go ""halfway"" just to get back to ""normal"".

Go easy on yourself, both mentally *and* physically. Your body is *supposed* to change. Maybe it's not where you would like it, but chances are you're not going to get back to exactly where you were before, and if you do, it won't be for long.

Remember that every diet regimen works by creating a calorie deficit. There are so many out there because there are so many different types of bodies, and someone is always trying to sell what worked for them. Remember that exercise doesn't ""burn calories"", and you can't work off the dessert you had last night. Regular physical exercise is one component of a healthy lifestyle and measurably reduces the chances of developing certain conditions and diseases. The easiest calorie to burn is the one you never eat in the first place. In other words, it's easier (and safer) to regulate weight by decreasing food consumption than by increasing physical activity.

The only people whose opinions you should value  on *what* you should do and *how* you should do it is your doctor and maybe a physical therapist or personal trainer. Otherwise, generally try to reduce your calorie intake through whatever means are comfortable for you. If that's replacing a meal with a salad, go for it. If it's meal prep to stop from buying fast food, go for it. If it's intermittent fasting, start small and don't go crazy, but go for it. For me, I knew I couldn't count calories or change what I eat, so I just changed how much I ate. I reduced the size of my meals by roughly (and I do mean extremely roughly) one third. Doing so I lost 45 pounds over about 6 months. That may very well not work for you and that's totally okay. Your body and habits are completely different from my own.

Ultimately, know that putting on some weight is far from the end of the world. Be patient and gentle with yourself as you go through one of the many transitions you'll experience in your life. Wishing you all the best."	SilentSatyress	reply	na	na	na	0.9925258159637451	no	no	no	na	mmfb	failed
"Throwaway account because I am mortified.

Long story short, I rear-ended someone on the drive home from work. :( the driver two cars ahead braked suddenly. I saw the car in front of me start to slow down, and I remember looking into my rear-view mirror for a second as I braked, to make sure there was no one following too close to me. When I looked back at the road, the car in front had completely stopped. I slammed on the brakes as hard as I could but it was too late.

Thankfully we weren't going super fast anyway and I was already slowing down, but I still hit her pretty hard. I drove home shaking and my husband took me to file a police report. No one was hurt but the front of my car was damaged pretty badly.

I'm in my 30s, I've been driving for over a decade, and I've never, ever been in a collision. Let alone been at fault. I know it was just an accident and everyone makes mistakes, but I feel terrible. The other driver was incredibly kind and cooperative, which sort of makes me feel worse - she kept telling me it was okay and trying to calm me down, when she was the one who should have been upset.

I feel stupid, guilty, embarrassed (what do I say to my coworkers? my family??), devastated. Sore. Irresponsible. Angry at myself. Annoyed that I have to spend time dealing with police, insurance, mechanics, possibly rental cars... not to mention the financial cost. We were just getting ready to apply for a mortgage to buy our first house. This won't bankrupt us, but it sure doesn't help.

"You're human, and we humans face limitations in reaction time. You chose to check behind you, which was a reasonable thing to do. It's just bad luck that you didn't have enough clearance to brake fast enough. Nobody was hurt, and you leave with a lesson for next time, which may help you avoid a more serious accident. A little morbid, but over 1.3 million people die globally every year due to road accidents. You weren't drunk driving or driving recklessly, and you didn't hurt anyone.

It takes a decent person to be concerned about what happened. It sounds like you're being a bit hard on yourself. Self-compassion is important - would you think a friend of yours would deserve to feel as terrible if they were in the same* situation?

From a relationship falling apart to losing the grandparent I was closest to this January along with numerous health issues that ended up hurting my income massively and rejections, I'm really worn out. 

Tonight I ended up talking at length with a former romantic partner that I've had feelings reemerge for. While I have these feelings they pretty confidently said that although they love me very much as a friend they don't have any romantic interest in me at all. 

The conversation ended fine and we're closer than we were before but there's still a sense of exhaustion and lingering pain from the complete lack of anything on their part.

I just desperately want one thing in my life to go right. Whether it's health or money or love or fitness or what I'm not too concerned with.

This shit you've been through is really tough. I'm not gonna pretend it's not, rejection and death and health issues are all miserable things to deal with. But you did deal with them. You made it through the adversity and you stayed true to yourself and remained a good person.

You didn't pressure her, you didn't question her, you didn't judge her, and the value of the friendship didn't disappear just because it couldn't go a step further. And that's a wonderful quality to have. That's a win. When you're dealt a bad hand breaking even is a win, and you stay true to yourself.

"I hear you. I've definitely been in places that are similar to yours before, and it just seems endless and so dispiriting. Two thoughts pop to mind:

\- Surviving is winning. Coming back to hope, to try, to love and to push yourself forward in any way you can - that is winning. It is a necessary pre-condition to any other success you want. All this is making you grow in ways you can't fully appreciate yet, but you will. So just by continuing on, you're winning.

\- In times like this, I think of George Washington. (Odd choice, but it works for me.) He's this epic figure of American History. He's got monuments. He's incredible. But if you look at what he's most famous for - fighting the British - dude hardly had any wins. Every one of his battles was a draw of a half-win. Most of those he just got lucky. But he hung in there, he kept trying, kept regrouping, kept balancing all the spinning plates until, after long enough, a big win just kind of fell into place. It can happen for you too."

"It's hard to understand what is going on in your post, you need to use more punctuation. Write in sentences.

That being said,

You're 21. You are still setting up your own life. It sounds like your brother is being unrealistic and unreasonable in his relationship with your mom - while he is 18 and van do what he likes, there are consequences of those choices. $300 is *nothing* in terms of rent and groceries and tbe necessities of life. Your brother is an adult, yes,  but he still needs a healthy relationship with his mother. If he doesn't want to hold up his end, well, he will find out what life is like without her help, and it won't be pretty. 

As for you, though, Stay out of it, except to insist that everyone be respectful. Focus on getting what you need to get your own place.

"Shit man, this really sucks. Sorry to hear that you're going through it. I've definitely lived through bouts of imposter syndrome before and know lots of people who have as well. It's not pleasant.

One thing that really helped me deal with it was a realization that i had a few years back. 

Before I had this realization, I thought that I was the only one ""faking it"" in my life. Basically, I felt like I was surrounded by real people, who had all the things I wanted - careers, money, relationships, etc. etc. - and I was among them, but everything I had wasn't ""real"" - that I was just an actor, faking my way through each day. And that made me feel really inadequate, and lonely.

But the I realized that the truth was that everyone else who I thought was ""real"" - they also had Imposter Syndrome, and they also thought that they were faking it. After talking to a lot of people, I realized that almost no one had any real idea what they were doing. Some people were successful in some ways, but actually had lots of failures they felt horrible about and kept hidden. Other people thought of themselves as failures, but had all these successes that they couldn't see or didn't count. And almost no one really knew why good things (or bad) things had happened to them - they just did what they did and stuff turned out well or it didn't. No one had any secret formula. Everyone wanted one, but no one had it. 

From that day on, I realized that yeah, okay, maybe I was an imposter in some ways. But so was everyone else. And if we're all imposters, making it up as we go along and trying to get people to think we know what we're doing when we don't, then none of us are imposters. The way I like to think about it now is that everyone I meet and know is, to some degree or another, an actor. The world is really just a stage. We're all actors and actresses, all playing parts. And if you get to know someone really well you can tell what parts are acting and what are real. But that takes getting to know them. 

I guess the important part is, don't be so hard on yourself for being an imposter. Everyone is an imposter, and it's not really a bad thing."	Dadou2329	reply	na	na	na	0.9994747042655945	strong	strong	no	na	mmfb	no prediction.

"*** I’ll be discussing this post with my therapist on Tuesday to break down parts of it, so if comments can roll in by then, that’d be as it’d give me time to apply others’ thoughts and ideas to the situation and interact with it more instead of interacting directly with this person because I’m now attached in both an anxious and avoidant way. 
I finished my sophomore year of college at Temple University in Philadelphia just almost a month and a half ago. I was born in the suburbs of PA an hour away from Temple to Jewish immigrant parents from the Soviet Union. I am 20 years old. In my freshman year, I met a (now 22 year old) violin prodigy who’s also an international student from Ireland and has a multi-ethnic background, including speaking Russian very well. I have an anxious attachment style while he has way more of an avoidant attachment style. Alongside experiencing generational trauma, I’ve been relatively unsuccessful in configuring my sexuality as a bi/queer/questioning individual. Out of unsolved difficulties with this sexuality growing up (ranging from bullying to my parents wanting to shut down my self-expression for a “best child” version of me to exist), I failed to be able to love myself enough to understand the position I hold with loving my shadow self while recognizing that karma is a bitch and I’m bound to get hurt, so I have to protect myself. Two years into our friendship, there had started a pattern of allowing myself to go at odds with both subconscious flirtation and internalized homophobia with this friend to the point that I had to address it by proclaiming that I wasn’t sexually attracted to him, to which I learned that he, too, had a “weird relationship [with his] sexuality” but he was “in fact straight” and then laid the boundaries out, trying hard to not offend me in the process. It’s important to mention that several months before this, I was told by him that me sharing pics of my face over WhatsApp made him uncomfortable and that he reserves pics of himself and such for romantic interests  By the end of the semester, after he got a girlfriend, had unexpectedly sent me two selfies of him in his graduation gown (which had on affect on me that I wished to ignore), and was planning to go back to Ireland in the coming days, he and I had gone to the local park in my area where we got to know each other well and bonded more over music and each other out of a desire for connection. The unpredictability from then on out was astonishing and I mostly mean the unpredictability with myself. I was very emotional the days after and it was like I flew to him in a flurry of attention and for once, he was somewhat steady able to reciprocate it, so it was kind of like heaven sometimes. However, I began articulating in my mind how I wished to express my hopes, fears, and desires for this friendship and I came across psychological wounds from the past that I’ve been having to tend to and loads of mental and energetic blocks, so it became an anxious and vicious cycle like it had been back when I had to first proclaim that I wasn’t sexually attracted in him months ago. I’ve been dwelling on this situation it puts my ability to communicate with him at jeopardy because I’m fixated on whatever I say being a make it or break it situation instead of developing a growth mindset. Does this make sense to anyone? Please, if anyone can relate or provide some insight, or help piece together my broken feelings, please do so. Thank you. I want to feel positively autonomous  in the present moment when this friend comes back for a week in August, so I’m looking to untangle my mind from the pain of losing all the love that was lost in trying to bridge the gaps with this international student."

"From what you described it certainly seems you’re into him more than just as a friend. Sort of like a crush. He is straight so end of that story. The reason he may still be around is because he values the friendship and/or because he enjoys the attention. Him sending a selfie in graduation gown is ok because that’s a special occasion. I’m sure if you were to only reserve your selfies to him for similar purposes it would be ok with him. Selfies otherwise aren’t really normal even among straight women unless talking about some occasion etc. 

It’s easy for me to say but I know it’s hard to do.. what you need to do is let go. Keep the friendship but keep it at arm’s length to protect your own feelings. It’ll only hurt you more otherwise."	SpecialistEagle5130	reply	na	na	na	0.9837502837181091	no	no	no	na	mmfb	failed

"I've posted this on other subreddits but I need all the help possible and I haven't received advice so maybe someone here can help.


I (19F) Am constantly invalidated, and I'm never listened to. If it boiled down to it, my mom would choose her boyfriend over me. He's allowed to say and do things my mom scolds me for. Even when he takes shots at me, she laughs with him, but if I attack him, I'm wrong. Despite her talking badly about him, saying she doesn't think he'll make it through law school, he likes the thought of being a lawyer. Talking about how much she hates his family. He talks to her about marriage, and she isn't even sure if she wants to. Her mindset is, ""Without him, who would pay the bills?"" 

There are constant comments that he has made. My mom made me change my shirt when he was in the house. He commented on my body when I was 16. He has repeatedly told my mom to gain weight so she can be curvier. She didn't take that as disrespect and allowed him to walk over her. She kicked him out, and he came back with sweet nothings, and suddenly he was back in the house. They constantly break up. Yet she stands up for him more than she would ever stand up for me. He laughed at me when I cried about my weight, and she said nothing. When I commented on his stuttering, she immediately got on me. 

This man had cut up her panties, invited his family to our home for Thanksgiving when she said no, constantly told her to shut up, and told me he was unhappy with her. Yet somehow, I always end up being the problem. Everything came to a head when she accused me of turning off her white noise machine to listen to them have sex. I was walking up the stairs at 2 am, and I heard them, so I turned it on. 

I told her about it because this happened several times. That's when she told me to maybe not ""stand around and listen."" She said she and her bf have constantly heard me outside the door. Oh, I don't know, maybe it's because your room is next to the stairs. She later on, told me I didn't need to make a comment on everything and to mind my own business.

I'm disgusted that she believes I want to hear her have sex. How selfish and delusional do you have to be to believe that? Her boyfriend has gotten in the way of our relationship. Due to her allowing him to, I'm unsure if I want one with her when I move out. I should've already moved out, but due to everyone thinking I'm useless, I'm unable. My mom's boyfriend said without her, I would be lost. 

This took a massive toll on my confidence despite his being irrelevant. She told me she expected me to make myself available for his Father's Day dinner, and I didn't want to be around either of them. He isn't all bad. He buys me food and does things I may need help with. But now that he's said this, I'd rather rely on myself for everything. I probably sound like a spoiled brat who needs to get over herself, but considering I get blown off when I talk to my mom, I'm not sure who else to talk to. Advice would be appreciated. Thank you."

From what you've said you're not worthless at all! It sounds like your mother has some serious codependency issues that lead to her bending over backwards to appease her boyfriend so he won't leave. That's her problem, and I'm sorry she's letting it affect you. She shouldn't and that's not fair to you. You didn't leave enough context in this post to know if it's an option, but if you're able to live anywhere else such as with your father, grandparents, or even on your own or with friends it may do you a lot of good to get out of that environment. If that's not an option, then the best you can do for now is be confident that you're not doing anything wrong and do your best to not let your mother's issues make you miserable too.

This post made me see red. This is the exact time of your life when you should be setting up your future. Your mom sounds like she has huge self-esteem issues if she thinks this dope is the man for her. That said, get yourself a strategy to: a). put a dream together for where you want your future to be b). break the path to this future down into little steps that you can take to bring you to it c). Counter ANY negative comments with opposite ones in your head d). see if you have an ally somewhere out there (is your dad still around? Is he worth seeking out?) and hang out with them a little more when things are crappy at home. Keep this in mind: we really get TWO lives - the one we were born into, then the one we end up making for ourselves. Keep your eye on the second one because the first one is no longer serving you.

There are dating apps now. They’re not great but they help with “getting out there”. Like I said they are not great but they solve some very specific problems. I think if you’re introverted, keep showing up to hang out with the few friends you have, it helps a lot to be there and show up consistently. People notice.

hey, I think this is a common feeling, especially prior to your first relationship. I know I certainly felt the same way, I was also very quiet back in high school, and I couldn't imagine how or where I'd meet someone. Trust me on this, you absolutely will. You'll find yourself in new situations and with new people, sharing new experiences with them, and with someone (or, in all likelihood, several someones haha) it'll just click. What you're feeling is completely normal, because of course it seems strange and outlandish when you haven't experienced it yet. Don't worry about being alone, not even for a second. Be excited instead, the future is going to be so much fun in this regard, I assure you. Please don't be afraid to put yourself out there a little bit though, despite it being uncomfortable at times. Show up in social contexts at school, or later on in college, with your friends, or through your hobbies... There'll be fun people to meet in these places.

And the first step to loving yourself is taking care of yourself. Eat right, sleep right, exercise.

"Hi everyone. I'm really not sure where to go from here. Earlier this month, I was going through a huge financial crisis and that brought me to have severe anxiety and panic attacks. I'm a student so I didn't know what to do at the time. Everyday I'd wake up in a full blown panic attack and it made me afraid to sleep at night.

Fast forward to today, my financial situation has improved and I now have support for it. I'm able to return to my studies, but my anxiety is still here. I hate it. I still wake up feeling like it's the end of the world for me, that I'd amount to nothing and that I'm all alone. A pit in my stomach is formed whenever I feel anxious, and it just feels so bad. At the moment of writing this, I'm suffering through that same pit in my stomach and I want to just cry right now.

I don't know why I'm like this. I thought the situation was going okay but I'm still so anxious and worried. I'm eating better compared to not eating at all a month ago. I was never like this until my financial crisis was brought onto my shoulders, I really don't know why I'm still suffering. It hurts a lot and I could just use a hug right now.

Now, Im 21 and mom has decided to organize the trip. And now that its actually happening Im so fucking scared. The nearly 13h plane ride, the fact that I wont be able to talk to my friends for 10 days, being in a foreign country and having to leave my guinea pigs wirh someone else.

"I’ve been to Japan three times. Before you go, look into getting wireless internet. You can usually pick up the little dongle or whatever it is they give you (it’s been a few years now) right at the airport. This way you’ll have internet the whole time, which is great for getting around but also means you won’t get disconnected from your friends! 

For what it’s worth, I find Japan a really easy place to travel. It’s not hard to find people that speak some English and once you get your head around the train systems it’s easy to get around everywhere. The people are mostly really polite and if you make an effort to pick up some Japanese words you’ll have no trouble finding people to help you out. 

Japan is amazing with so much to do! You’ll have such a great time!

I know it wasn't all just me it was moving and money wise my aunt wanted, but let's start, I am 20 and recently we had to move because money wise, my aunt wanted some money and kept getting mad at us forcing us to move out taking our food and tables and more, now that I explained she was moving everything... my 2 dogs and grandmother are near each other, they are cremated, my dogs box had her paw print in the top, they all knew of my dog harley, she then threw my dogs ashes away, her paw print too, see if I had a box that felt heavy and a print on top of it I'd ask if it's important or even open it! So made no sense at all!!! She did this on purpose on us and took the other dogs ashes and my grandmothers, I then was angry now never wanting to see her again angry at everybody and crying constantly I didn't mean to but I'm grieving all over again! We now do not talk to each other and my mother got a text from her asking if we fully moved out which we did, my mom added on that my dogs ashes may have been thrown away and asked her if she knew about it, she did, but my mom acted like she didn't know, my aunt then ignored us now and I gotten no apology... am I the asshole in this situation???

"In the last year and a half my partner has become the most narcissist, selfloaded and selfish person I've ever met in my entire life and I can't hate her but feel sorry for her.

The issue started when we were fighting, I'm a highly disagreeable person when it comes to certain topics and a couple of our problems were part of these. Although I never had bad intentions I can see that I did some terrible mistakes with her and I regret it so bad. For some of my stupid and harmful acts and huge personal problems that she had at the beginning of our relationship everything went the wrong way and she ended up so hurt and desperate. At that time she started to have some attitude with me when we had problems and I'm not gonna lie, that helped me to be humble and connect with her feelings and needs a little bit more, just enough to retract myself when it was needed, say sorry and try to make things right. Sometimes I knew, or believed, I was right but I started to let things pass and care more about her wellbeing/feelings than about the way I saw things. I loved her and I knew she loved me. 

To sum up, I wasn't just trying to behave in a good way, I was also trying  to be highly empathic towards her to let her see that I wasn't trying to manipulate her or harm her, I was all in with her and trying to compensate my wrongs.
This didn't work at all. Harm was done and nothing I did at that time fixed anything. 

Soon she started to be more agressive with me, she started to insult me and not wanting to hear *any single word* I had. I was getting mad for that and I told her, not in a mean way, but letting her know that my boundaries meant something and that she should respect them. There is an important thing that I said, that I think is a good description of what ended up happening: ""You must treat me right for now on or you will lose all the respect you have for me, and this will harm you more than it harms me because you won't like me anymore and you won't be able to trust me or take my help if you need it"". 

This situation just scalated and she started to be not just more mean but to be more unstable. She would cry, break things, shout, hit me hours straight. Why? Because she couldn't manage my disagreement, or my needs, or me getting slightly mad for something she did, or me don't fully understanding what I did so wrong, etc. This lasted HOURS and it wouldn't end (I swear on god it wouldn't) unless I became the most selfless person that ever existed, listened to her ranting about me for 40m and saying yes to EVERYTHING, not interrumpting and apologizing one hundred times. She needed as air me being so submissive and making sure that in the most toxic and humilliating way I let her know I understood her and regreted everything. Later I wasn't going anywhere, I had to be there with her and make her day until she was ok with me leaving the place (no matter what I had to do).

I said that she hit me, but this is not the worst thing, her words is what has destroyed me completely, I will just spit a list of the most cool ones:

""You are a mistake. Your fathers made a mistake having you. What a mix of genes"".

""You are a fagot. You are not strong by any means. Not mentally nor physically, which is the same. I feel ashamed everytime I see you"".

""You have a small dick, my exboyfriends had huge dicks. Maybe that is the reason I didn't lose my virginity with them, I would have been afraid. Also I like big guys, they were and you are not"". 

""Your mother is a fake bitch and is a sick person. She is mad with me screaming and she is worse than me, she just take chill pills to deal with things, that way I wouldn't make a noise too"". (My mother has an anxiety disorder due to agoraphobia I experience some of that too)

""You ruined my life, I've lost my most important part with you and it will never come back. You made me have anxiety, I don't have it without you. You even ruined my university years"".

""I miss my exboyfriend, with him I was the version of myself that I had liked the most"".

""You are a psycopath, a monster, I don't know why would you study pshycology, to ruin people's lifes?"".

The list is way longer.

She has destroyed my selfsteem with all this crap and she is also destroying my future. These past 4 months I had to study like a maniac to pass the test that is making me enter university since I decided I wanted to study again and make something meaningful with my life, I have been three years fighting to be here and although all this time I've been destroying every test I took she has managed to make sure I don't have time to do the most crucial test of my life. It lasted three days and was last week, I did it just because and just wrote my name in some of the subjects. She literally had me solving his crap the two weeks prior to that test and sent me free when I had five days to go wishing me luck and under the condition of seeing her two of those five days. We are messaging one of those days and I had the great idea of saying that I wasn't feeling great because I knew it was impossible for me to do it and... We have a fucking argument on how I was spreading a bad mood towards her and that she was stressed too, that I has nothing to complain about since she was doing difficult things too.
Btw I have another try for that test in two weeks and it is nor going good again, I'll have to wait for a year.

More misstreats like this happen with reregularity.
At this point I don't really know what may you people think. I just feel bad. I hate her deeply and love her deeply and I'm pretty sorry I had something to do with this thing that is happening, specially inside her.

I know her whole life, I know how good she is because I saw her being that, I would die for her since I know she is a talented, kind and awesome woman but now... Now she is this. And listen to me, I watched her, I carefully watched her when she lose it, when she gets insecure or mad or sad. I saw how her family triggers her, sometimes with a reason, sometimes without (tho her mother is a cruel bitch and her father a fucking unreliable mess). I saw her also getting triggered and blaming everything on everyone when she feels bad or ignored with people. She is NOT ok and this tears me inside, I know I don't want to be with her (she probably doesn't want me too) but I can't leave or at least something makes me highly insecure about it. Not because I'm afraid of being alone but because I'm highly worried about her wellbeing. I feel that I have contributed to her being like this and I don't want to contribute to her losing sanity. She is currently seeing a great therapist (I've met her personaly a couple times) but the sessions have been very sporadic and meaningless due to external problems. I think for now on it's going to be a routine for her and I know it will help her since it did in the past. 

I don't know if me going would help her or end her, if I just knew I would do what is necessary without hesitation but I just don't know. Some days I think I'm killing her, some days I think I'm holding her together... This is a mess.

And I fucking blame myself for not being the hero that she needs you know? At least for a time so she can go feeling good and stable. But I'm full with problems, insecurities and sadness due to her and I have my own mental health shit (social anxiety and agoraphobia). And everything feels so hard and forced with her too. We can be fine and then she is the most annoying person on earth for 30m and I'm supposed to be fine later, funny and playful. I just can't take it and can't take it specially when I'm missing the next whole year of my life and my dream because of her and it's driving me crazy.

I don't believe in god but I pray for her to be ok again I assume I have to put my big boy pants on, lose my last opportunity on this goddamn test (while I act like I'm gonna do it in front of her ofc) and be what is needed until she goes without knowing a single word of what I feel. I can't harm her, it's all I know.

"So is this a *current* partner then? I worry about your wellbeing, because what you have described is not healthy for anyone to have to deal with. Your duty is not to her first, it is to yourself first. You cannot help someone else unless you help yourself first.

You write about boundaries, but between the verbal berating, personal insults, use of hateful slurs, and physical abuse, I don't see how those boundary issues can resolve satisfactorily with this person. The red flags are so numerous.

If you're being mistreated this way in a relationship, the MMFB solution would be to leave the relationship entirely. Truth be told, my last relationship ended because my ex began to experience a mental health crisis and what ultimately made me come out of a very severe bout of grief that spanned months was figuring out that their faults are not my fault. I too feel so bad for them but...as crass at it might sound, their personal issues are theirs and not my problem: ESPECIALLY because they mistreated their partner. Does it hurt me that I can't be there? Yeah, it still does, but at the end of the day we all make choices—no matter our mental health—and mental illness is NEVER a valid excuse for the kind of mistreatment that's been going on. Realizing I was mistreated, and that I deserve so much better than that helped open my eyes...and I'm sure that applies to you, too. You deserve better than this.

The MMFB answer here is that you have done what you can. You have been patient far, far beyond what your partner deserves after treating you this way. You deserve to be free from an abusive relationship. She has a therapist, you don't have to be her savior and it really doesn't seem like a good idea to try to help someone who insists on continually hurting you.

I would recommend consulting resources for people in abusive relationships, such as [https://www.helpguide.org/articles/abuse/getting-out-of-an-abusive-relationship.htm](https://www.helpguide.org/articles/abuse/getting-out-of-an-abusive-relationship.htm)

A word of warning with those resources is a lot of them unfortunately assume the reader is a woman, which is absolutely repugnant: statistics indicate that in heterosexual relationships, women and men abuse each other with near identical frequency. The method of abuse is where the stats diverge, but abuse is abuse no matter its specifics."	iCanFlyyyy	reply	na	na	na	0.9981048107147217	no	no	strong	na	mmfb	failed

"Thank you so much for taking your time to write all this.

I'm sorry to hear about your last relationship going that way, I really understand. It is very nice to hear that you could think about yourself and make the right choices. 
Sometimes I think like you did to exit from that relationship, I'm just too unsure to make it. 

(Yes she is my current partner)
Maybe I'm worrying in extreme about her and it would be fine to go. The problem I have is that she has her own narrative of everything from a long time ago and I can't interfere with it. I would talk to her with all sincerity but she is so far from the reality that she wouldn't take it, nor let me fully express. I want her to know that I really understand her feelings and why she is in such a bad spot, and that as much as I love her I can't handle this and she can't continue doing this (both for me and for her wellbeing). I wish this was easier to do.

I feel really mistreated yes, and is so refreshing to read someone telling me that I did everything I could and I deserve better. Thank you for that, it's so kind.

I know our relationship is over, I'm fine with that, I just want to leave as nicely as possible and maybe that's what's making me stay longer than I should. I'm going to wait until next week since she has to end her final degree work and then do things in the nicest way I can to end this. I know I will feel so guilty for doing this.

I went to therapy last autumn, it didn't help me much because I didn't feel really understood by the therapist, his approach and advices were very theorical which could be fine but I'm more sentimental, I feel relieved when someone can relate somehow with the things I say and responds me with empathy. Also it is really difficult to me to make a breakthrough of everything and with him I felt like I was talking too much when I was having a hard time trying to express myself since he wanted to make his observations too quickly (in my opinion). 

I've planned to try another therapist this summer as soon as I'm available (in two, three weeks max) and get more deeply involved in the process in and out the sessions.

also- it’s nice that you want to leave nicely, but given her past abusive behavior, i would encourage you be prepared for potential backlash. put yourself first on this- it is not selfish for you to not tolerate abuse. her feeling and behaviors are *her* issue, and you’re absolutely right that if she treats you poorly, it’s time for you to leave and focus on your own well being.

"Really sorry about what you're going through. It seems like school has been really stressful for your, and what you're feeling is probably related to just living under that stress for so long.

Just a couple thoughts - 

\- Try whatever therapist you can get time with now. I mean, they might not work out. But they might. And sometimes any help is better than no help. If you say you don't want to take medications, they won't go down that route. In general no one will give you medications without your consent.

\- There's no need to feel guilty. This is just something that happened. It's not your fault. Imagine you were going on a five mile hike, and on mile 2 you hurt your foot, so that the hike became more difficult. You don't need to feel guilty about your hurting foot. You just have to figure a way to complete the hike with this slight problem. And you're a smart person, so you can figure out a way to do that. (Going slower, favoring the other leg, etc. etc)

\- I struggle with distraction and restlessness a lot at work. It's real. I'd agree with the other poster. I'd agree with the other poster to try to lower the time of your study sprints and try to add back a minute or two each session. Another thing that sometimes helps me is acknowledging my restlessness. Like, I'll be working for 20 minutes and then I'll feel that ""itch"" that I have to be doing something, anything else but what I'm doing. But if instead of avoiding the restlessness, I say out loud ""i'm feeling restless now"", or do something else like touch a post-it note, or make a little checkmark in a notebook, that somehow puts the restlessness in it's place, and helps me re-focus on my task. It's kind goofy, but it works for me."	Responsible_While_50	reply	na	na	na	0.9992827773094177	strong	no	no	na	mmfb	no prediction.
"Hi guys this is my first post ever.. coming on here because I want to speak my truth but it’s been a few years now and regret not speaking up when the incident occurred. For Christ sake I almost died. How was I supposed to know what to do I was just a teen, 16 at the time. Now I’m 23 of age and ever time I go to any amusement park the trauma follows. It occurred at six flags magic mountain which is located in California. 

It occurred on the ride called “scream” 
For those who have been do you guys realize how many loops and how many aggressive turns it has. I’m surprised I even did it. 
My harness opened completely mid ride…The scariest fucking thing that can ever occur to anyone. Can you imagine if it would of opened mid loop I would of been instantly dead. But it didn’t, it opened right after some turn the whole thing made an odd noise and lifted I quickly fucking grab on to it pull it down and prayed to it to stay like it but it kept shuffling. Thank god for my friend who was there I was Able to hold on to her harness (while I pull my own down) I kept yelling to her and she panicked because had no idea what I was saying or yelling in terror for. She hold on to my harness as I pleaded for her to do so and I was basically living a final destination movie (the rollercoaster scene). Ironically the impact of the ride had actually is what kept me alive ? I think, due to how much pressure was pulling on me that it kept me pushed down and not up from injecting. If the ride was not as fast and pressurized then I would of flown out instantly because how can I possibly do it by myself?? Or maybe I did , I don’t know , gravity definitely played a part somehow. Anyways the ride finally came to a stop and I was full on panic mode which I regret because it is what stopped me from doing anything . I was it utter shock to do or say anything. The only thing I did was tell the worker that my harness literally opened mid ride and he looked at me with the most blank face ever seen that are you sure? Bitch what the fuck you mean am I sure? I nearly died. And he followed with , are you OK and I told him to please check on it or it will open on the next and then I walked off as if I almost didn’t die. I’ll never forget it the way it walked away and then I turned back again, and the worker was still staring at me, he was way older than me probably thinking of things in his head that I could’ve done, but I was too afraid in the moment, and just wanted to get away from everything. I talked about it with my friend and she was just as confused as me. God I wish I would of sued or do you guys still think it’s possible? I go to any amusement park now like knotts or Disneyland and I’m just so afraid to get on everything because all i picture is that 16 year old me holding onto dear life. Eventually Over time I got over it and thought what are the chances of it happening again? Right? but then I realize that 7 years later it still follows me everywhere I go the trauma of every time I’m getting strapped down on a ride the vivid memory of me holding on.. I just didn’t know what trauma really was and the use of my voice but I was a teen I figured no one would believe me.. if I would of known my rights at the time and was not in “fight or flight” response , I would of sued six flags, because not only did I almost lose my life but what if this happens again.. to someone else. 

Please someone that’s a lawyer or anyone that is just knows something that I don’t please help me."	Fickle_Variation_920	post	24.990622023814883	male	White	0.9945460557937622	na	na	na	1	mmfb	no prediction.

It’s been about a week since I (18M) moved into my parents’ new house. Leaving my hometown for good for the first time in 18 years was definitely a struggle, but I think I have moved beyond the grief I was experiencing about leaving home. Unfortunately, now that we are living with my grandma (who suffers from OCD, important), I have found it very difficult to get settled in. I am prohibited from changing my bedroom much, since my grandma is very particular about how things are placed in the house. I just don’t feel safe in the house, everything feels unfamiliar, and it has been getting me down emotionally. I’ve researched relocation depression, but I haven’t really found anyone who has been experiencing the same emotions or difficulty sleeping as I have. It just feels like my body is trying to keep me awake at night because that subconscious part thinks I’m in danger, and I can’t seem to calm myself down enough to fall asleep. I am wondering if anyone else has experienced something like this, or if it’s just a part of the moving process? Any advice or information is welcome.	eBicGayMer99669	post	30.393590654228106	female	White	0.9983872175216675	na	na	na	2	mmfb	no prediction.
"Hey I’m sorry you’re going through this and it’s awesome you’re reaching out. Is it the move or the loss of agency that’s really bothering you? It’s totally normal to feel unsettled after a move (I’ve moved 36 times in my life), but usually the healing comes from when you get to nest and set stuff up to your own liking. You sort of are moving in to your feelings as well as the new space but it sounds like you can’t really do that with the restrictions on your room. 

My family rented a lot and we usually couldn’t hang anything on the walls. My stuff and my clothes became more important to me than the space. I had some really excellently designed binders because that’s what I could control. 

Have you tried talking to your parents about this? And if that’s a no-go then maybe try and “move in” to the larger area. Go out and explore. Find an awesome coffee shop or a library to hang at. Make that your “home base” and then start wandering around out from there and slowly fill in the map of your new area. 

Have you checked Atlas Obscura to find anything weird near you? Good luck out there."	eBicGayMer99669	reply	na	na	na	0.9983872175216675	strong	strong	strong	na	mmfb	no prediction.
Thanks, this is some really interesting stuff, I’ve never heard of atlas obscura. Will definitely take a look at it! I still haven’t really been able to move in, since we have family staying at the house in the room that will become my “bedroom”. I am definitely looking forward to setting up my clothes, unpacking etc. I guess I just haven’t had the chance to get out and explore quite as much as I would like to. I valued knowing my old town so well that I could draw it on a map, so maybe it’ll just take some time and getting to know where things are. I guess I’m just not used to not being able to hang around my house for hours and not feel uneasy.	eBicGayMer99669	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9983872175216675	weak	strong	no	na	mmfb	failed
"I think a big problem is that my signs for depression don't look bad on the outside. I'm usually I very clean person. Now I still take showers every day but I don't scrub myself. I just sit in the tub and let the water hit me until it goes cold. I've stopped doing my skincare routine and now just slap whatever lotion I can scrape out of an empty tub of lubriderm and hope for the best. I'm getting acne again. I brush my teeth but sometimes I can only manage once a day and I don't have the energy to floss. I wash my hair once a week and braid it back with dry shampoo when it starts to get gross. I haven't shaved in a long time, and while I know that's not inherently unsanitary it makes me feel ugly.

I'm barely hungry anymore. I get yelled at for not eating but everyone thinks it's because I'm worried about my weight. I used to love food and trying new things. Now I can barely choke down toast. 

I'm tired all the time. Every time I try to take a nap my body freaks out and I wake up to an anxious fit. At night my brain reminds me over and over again of all my shortcomings and how much time I've wasted. 

Then the next day comes and I can't do anything. I want to so badly but I physically can't make myself do anything. It's like my body uses all of its energy to be anxious and sad and I have no room for anything else.

I have a therapist but she hasn't been able to help me much. She'll be going on maternity leave soon and she's trying to figure out who to hand me off to. 

I have a friend to confide in but she's been going through so much I can't burden her with my insignificant problems even if she says it's ok.

I have family that loves me and tries to help but there is nothing anyone can really do for me. I desperately want to be alone but I don't want to be alone.

The only thing that makes me feel any better is imagining that natural causes will take me out while I sleep that night. I'd never hurt myself or do anything life threatening, so my only hope is that something outside my control does it quickly and quietly for me. 

I know that's an unhealthy thought pattern but sometimes it's the only thing that calms me down.

I can't tell anyone in my real life I think that way anymore because I get screamed at and threatened to be taken away to some facility if I do. Maybe if they were nice, inexpensive, and could actually help me without putting it in my medical history I would try it. But it doesn't work that way, and I'm not a threat to myself so there is nothing to be done. 

I'm just stuck here to drown. I know in theory there are things I could do to make it better but I don't know how to make myself do them. I'm so scared of wasting my life but I feel crippled. I don't know what to do anymore. I don't know how to find myself again and I'm terrified I never will."	Maximum_Map_233	post	20.269359520637106	female	White	0.9989688396453857	na	na	na	3	mmfb	failed
I’m so sorry your depression is getting bad again. It’s good that you’re recognizing the signs, and it does sound like you don’t want to be depressed. I just want to make it clear that your problems aren’t insignificant. Depression affects your brain and mind, and those define how you see the world. I’m sorry you don’t feel like you have anyone you can truly confide in, and your therapist doesn’t sound like a good fit. I’d try to find someone else.

"Me, 32F and my best friend “Sarah” (also 32F) had a mutual friend (32M) through your high school, we’ll call him “Simon.” We all hung out a ton over the 10 years we were all in high school and although we went to different universities we’d met up over the holidays. I wasn’t super close with Simon but he was good company and we went to a lot of house parties at Sarah’s and always had a good time. 

When I was around 22 we had all graduate and had a house party at Sarah’s. I got too drunk too quickly and tapped out to go and sleep it off around 9am. These parties always went on until the early hours so I figured I’d have a couple of hours sleep and then bounce right back into the party.

I awoke to a hand down my underwear and someone kissing my neck. In my drunken state I immediately thought it was my boyfriend (we’d been together around 18 months by then and we’ve now been together over 10 years, married just a month ago!) 

Because I was dazed I made an appreciative noise, then turned to give what I thought was my boyfriend a kiss. I’m sure you guessed it, it wasn’t my now husband it was Simon. I immediately said wtf are you doing?? Shoved him off, punched him in the shoulder and left crying. 

Sarah didn’t really believe me I don’t think. She said “well you were both drunk right?” And no matter how many times over the years I’ve tried to explain how absolutely disgustingly wrong he was to touch a basically unconscious girl she is still friends with him.

We’ve been friends for 20 years, she was even a bridesmaid in my wedding a month ago. Do I let go of a two decade long friendship because she’s still friends with the guy who sexually assaulted me?

The thing is, I just want to move past it but it’s IMPOSSIBLE because she keeps having events and inviting us BOTH so I look like the asshole if I don’t go. She’s getting married next year (for the 2nd time in 3 years) and he’s going to be there. I’m so tempted to say “me or him” but ultimatums seem so dramatic and entitled. 

Also, she’s VERY selfish. On my wedding day she complained about how early she had to get up, that her eye make up needed fixing, was judgemental about two  of the girls from my hen, and came to me crying when her and her latest fiancé had a domestic. 

What should I do? Should I cut her out? I do love her so so much, she wouldn’t have been a bridesmaid if I didn’t, and we do have fun together and she can be so sweet and loving and thoughtful. HELP."	Bikergirlzeldanerd	post	24.488548624405773	female	White	0.9958570599555969	na	na	na	7	mmfb	failed

"Yep. Flat out, say you won't be attending any functions with the man who tried to rape you. If she says you're being petty or overreacting, then your response is 'Okay, fine, think what you want. But I am not going to stand and smile in the same room as the *guy who tried to rape me.*'

When she says 'He wasn't going to *rape* you', look at her gobsmacked and say 'That's your response? I should be fine with everything because I woke up before he got his dick out? Are you being serious right now?'

The point is, she doesn't want to accept your feelings about this, she wants to sweep it under the rug. Don't let her do that. 

Explain that if she insists you have to come to her wedding or whatever that you don't want to cause a scene by throwing your drink at someone and screaming,

> 'Stay the fuck away from me you fucking rapist'


because that really ruins an otherwise lovely evening, but if she insists you attend, **that is absolutely what you're going to do, over and over again, until he leaves.**

"That's such an awful situation - I'm so sorry you're going through this.

I cut someone out of my life for similar reasons; I was assaulted and she blamed me. (It was a stranger, though, and I cannot imagine how painful it would have been if it was a friend who was still in the picture.)

She introduced me to my now husband and was a bridesmaid in my wedding, and we had been close friends since childhood. It took years to finally decide to choose myself, to put my happiness and mental health first. I realized that I couldn't have someone in my life who was unsupportive - not just around that particular incident, but in general.

I'm SO much happier now. Yeah, there are a lot of years I look back on fondly, and sometimes I miss the better parts of the friendship. But not constantly having to explain myself to her? Not putting up with hypocrisy and drama? It's been like finally coming up for air after a lifetime underwater. I didn't give an ultimatum or anything, just quietly stopped reaching out and lived my life away from her hurricane of nonsense.

A friend who blames, disbelieves, and judges is not a friend you need. Please choose yourself. You deserve better. I know it's hard, but it's worth it."	Bikergirlzeldanerd	reply	na	na	na	0.9958570599555969	strong	strong	no	na	mmfb	failed

All the way until I graduated High School ive had friends but those friendships were always short lived and usually it was due to irl things, my own insecurities getting in the way, or something involved with that friend to where I just couldnt be friends with them anymore. When I graduated I thought Ill just accept the fact that I wont have friends anymore and maybe being alone would just be fine if life kept telling me to be alone and I dont think ive ever been so wrong in my life. I feel like a complete outcast to everyone now since im paranoid of what ill say Ik the internet shouldnt influence my life but I feel like its done stuff to me that just completely changed how I feel around people. I even look at myself and I cant help but think I have the look of someone nobody wants to be friends with like I look like a creep or something like that. Ive always had a hard time trying to understand how other people think too considering Ive known I have been diagnosed with autism since I was 8 and thats probably one of the bigger reasons I feel worried about what im gonna say. This might feel weird to bring up but as someone whos also been raised by my mom a lot more since my dad had to work ive always been more comfortable to talk to women which is also the kind of problem that I feel like I look like some kind of creep because I feel like I would harm the possible image they would have to other people. I feel like I even make my mom upset about it sometimes since all of my family has friends both her and my dad and my siblings have friends and the fact her oldest is the lonliest one makes it harder. I just dont know what to do. I am not feeling suicidal or anything if anyone would be worried of that. I just feel like I need to make myself better as a person somehow.

It's ok to feel that way. The internet and specifically social media has been horrible for human socialization imo.

With my former law teacher we live in the same neighborhood so we greet each time we see each other in the street (We get along quite well). 
But yesterday I was walking and he passed not far from me in his car. I looked at his car for several second but I wasn’t able to see him  ( I know it was his car). When he was at my level I saw him but he didn’t look at me. 
I feel bad because I don’t know if he saw me or not. If he saw me, I didn’t say hello and I’m afraid he could be mad.

"TL;DR

Girl seemed to really like me at first. Now she won’t talk to me.

I’ve been tormenting myself on how I could have prevented this.

&#x200B;

**BACKGROUND**

Hi Everyone,

Last October this absolutely gorgeous Ukrainian girl joined my gym class. She was really impressed that I spoke Russian (very similar to Ukrainian) as her English is limited. Much of my learning material is also Ukrainian. Next April, I asked if she had a boyfriend or was married and she said no. So I asked her for coffee and she agreed!

I met her for coffee many times. We got on really well and I really enjoyed talking to her. She told me her age, that she had a 10-year-old daughter, was divorced and worked as a beautician. (None of this bothered me as I really liked her.) The only negative was that once I said I felt bad for her (she lost her home in Ukraine). She got a bit annoyed but was OK when I apologised. She thought I was not interested in her also because of her intelligence but I truthfully told her that this was incorrect.

She asked why I spoke Russian and I told her the truth and I made it clear that I did not support the current Russian regime. She said knowledge of Russian was concerning but that she was not annoyed. She even later stated that my Russian knowledge was positive as it allowed us to communicate. She asked me if I ever had a girlfriend. I said no and she was very surprised and asked why. I told her I did not think I was handsome or interesting to which she giggled but still seemed OK and believed otherwise.

I met her a few times also for dinner, walks and bowling. We did not text/call between dates but we met once every week.  I also bought her flowers once to which she was elated! She insisted on walking arm-in-arm, holding my hand, caressing it and moving it between her legs and on her butt. We hugged numerous times and often, she massaged my forearm and shoulder.  I told her many times that I really liked her and she seemed fine. She said once that she wasn’t sure if she wanted a long-term relationship, but that we’d continue to see each other. And I made it clear that I’d be very happy as friends if that’s what she wanted.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**WHAT HAPPENED**

On our last date, we met for dinner (I paid on all dates) and went back to my house and she seemed to really like me. However, she then got a phone call from Ukraine that her friend’s father died in battle. I consoled her and I don’t know why, but I asked could we kiss. (I wasn’t being indelicate, I just felt I missed the opportunity on our previous dates as I never kissed a girl before.) She just said that she wasn’t ready but she still seemed to fine when I dropped her home.

A few days later, I felt guilty for asking to kiss. So, I rang her but she said there was nothing to apologize for and that she could not speak now but she’d ring later and asked me to message her to plan our next date. She never rang me back, and she ignored my messages to meet next but she sent a disturbing video of a Russian man saying very derogatory things against Ukraine. I was unsure on responding, but I said it was very sad to watch and that the man was evil.

Her response was: ‘It is not just this man. It is the whole Russian nation. So, your admiration for Russia is very difficult and hard for me.’

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**AFTER**

I was again shocked and unsure on responding. On our previous meetings, I never elaborated my knowledge of Russian until she asked me (which she did numerous times), and I clarified that I did not support the current regime. I considered either ignoring her message or apologising/clarifying further. But I panicked. I told her I loved her, that she was the girl of my dreams and that no other girl was ever as close to me. (I know this is very cringey, but I was afraid of losing her.)

She never responded.

I apologized later via text if my message was too strong. She just said she could not talk now and that she thought we were just friends. And that she wouldn’t want a relationship with me. I asked if we could still be friends and she never replied.

I really miss her and feel awful. I finally found a girl that liked me. And not just any girl – she was even lovely to speak to. And I feel I made a mess of everything. I feel that I'll never meet anyone like her again, and if I do, that I'll repeat the same mistakes."	PoppyBell123	post	28.96177883551743	female	White	0.01340712234377861	na	na	na	1	mmfb	failed
"She was never your girlfriend. You literally never even kissed. You hung out for a couple of months and it doesn't sound like she was that into you.

You don't love her. You're just caught up in your own head and missing what's *actually* happening. Everytime she tried to pull away, you'd get desperate and try to level up your status. That's manipulative at worst, at best, it leaves you vulnerable. Protect yourself!

You tried to date someone and it didn't work out. It's fine. Just move along.

Edit: She said she didn't like you but you're here ending your post with ""I finally found a girl who liked me"". She said she didn't want a LTR but you did. (this was a good point to dip since your wants weren't matching up) You said you'd be fine as friends but you're not.

"My parents have just told me to leave my BF's home (with his parents and his brothers and their wives), where I've been living in for 2 months now, when they come over here.


I rarely share what happened between us to my parents, but sometimes I do share to my dad.
During the 2 months I'm with my BF, we've had a lot of fights about:


- His smoking: I once talked to ny dad about this problem and he didn't seem to be very happy about. Whenever I mention smoking in front of him, he immediately feels annoyed because I keep talking about one thing over and over. He even told me to ignore his smoking.


- Him always saying that I TALK BACK to
him whenever we fight


- Him leaving and avoiding me when he comes home by staying in the garage and in the washroom for at least an hour because he says staying in there makes him feel better


- Our problems not being resolved immediately   because the way he responds to them are very annoying to me, like ""Why are you still thinking about the problems"", ""Put them down"", ""Focus on yourself"" and so on, which to me does not help solve the problems at all.


My parents want me to move out of his house to protect myself, my dignity and my esteem. They don't want me to be in inequal position compared to others when I'm just a GF. They only allow me to move in again when he wants to propose and marry me, which I don't think gonna happen anytime soon due to our incompatibility. 


I'm a bit sad because when I'm with him, I felt like I've helped him change: 
- He eats breakfast with me now, which he never did so in the past
- He has reduced smoking (whether a lot or little)
Now that I leave, I'm afraid that all my efforts gonna go wasted if he changes back like before...


My parents insist on staying wherever I want to stay. And I can't make them do that because that's extremely selfish...I'm very lost right now.

"Never ever go into a relationship with the mindset that you will change the next person. That’s your first big mistake. 

In relationships we often find out partners annoying, we may have disagreements etc. but we also love them and care for them. So in one moment they may drive us insane, in another we adore them for who they are and how they make us feel. If you share all the things that are annoying about them with your family, they will see them as an annoying person. They won’t feel the same love and care that you feel. So it’s important to draw that boundary between your relationship and others. Don’t go talking behind your spouse’s back. (This doesn’t apply if you’re in an abusive relationship and need support). What do you expect your family to do? You’ve been complaining about your bf and they’re saying to not live with such a person. That’s a natural response on their part. 

You are right you two don’t seem compatible. You need to be with someone that you will accept exactly how he is instead of trying to change him. Your bf needs to be with someone where he can be himself with so he doesn’t have to stay in the garage etc just so he can be himself."	gumball_bunnie	reply	na	na	na	0.9988704323768616	no	strong	no	na	mmfb	failed

You can't. Making people unhappy is just a fact of life, and if you spend all your time trying not to do that, you won't accomplish anything, and people will be upset anyway.

"A few things: 

1) Let the time alone in the garage thing go. Loads of guys just need some alone time to decompress after work. That's totally normal. I think it's reasonable to ask him to come and say hi or maybe give you a hug and a kiss, but he may really need that alone time to avoid dropping a ton of work stress on you. 

2) Quitting smoking is really hard. If he's cutting back, he's making progress. Try to let it go. Even better, tell him you've noticed he's cut back and you're proud of him for doing it. Offer encouragement, not criticism. 

3) it's hard to know what to tell you about the idea of ""talking back."" It's a bit concerning, but are you letting him finish his thoughts, or are you interrupting him? Are you disputing things he's starting as facts without having evidence to dispute them? Men are logical creatures, mostly, and you're not generally going to ""win"" an argument by disputing facts with opinions or emotions. 

4) Are the things he's telling you to drop really critical? Most guys like to handle their problems themselves. If it's not something that directly effects you, ask him if he would like to hear your thoughts on the matter. Unsolicited opinions are often not welcome while a question like ""Can I help?"" might be received a lot differently. At a minimum, he's not going to feel like he's being challenged. Of course, if it is something that effects you, different rules apply. 

Finally, you're a grown woman now. Your parents no longer get to decide where you sleep. It's perfectly ok to tell them to mind their own business. 

As for your bf, some of the stuff you said is concerning, but it also seems a bit like you're going out of your way to find things to criticize."	gumball_bunnie	reply	na	na	na	0.9988704323768616	weak	no	no	na	mmfb	failed
"Whether or not you want to be in a relationship and/or live with someone is your decision alone and not your parents, however, you yourself said you are “incompatible.”  If I thought there was no way a relationship was leading somewhere “due to our incompatibility” I would see staying in that relationship as a waste of time and energy and a set up for disappointment.

Also, it’s not your job to change people, and changing people is an unrealistic goal. You can’t force change on anyone. People only change when they really want to. If he really wants to better himself, he will eventually, with or without you. If he doesn’t want to, he has a right not to.

The only thing you need to worry about is “am I happy?” Will staying in this relationship, assuming NOTHING changes from the way it is now, make YOU yourself happier? I’m sure in your heart you know the answer.

Since he feels better without you you should take that as a hint and let him go. I know it’s not easy but it’s the best thing to do. 

Listen to the podcast called “where should I begin” by ester Perel. People have different conflict and resolution styles. Some people need time to cool off and others feel like things need to be resolved right away. When those people are in a relationship together they need to figure out how to go about things so they work for both. 

Change comes from within. If just knowing something isn’t good for us kept us from doing it then smoking wouldn’t even be a thing. It sounds like you’re trying to convince him to change. That sounds exhausting for both parties. Instead of trying to convince him to change accept him as he is and encourage him to change for better by supporting him.

"I’ve always been the type of person in the friend group to go crazy, but I didn’t think it would actually happen.

A few days ago I was walking my dog and I swear I heard someone call my name. My first thought was it was a wendigo or something.(I listen to scary stories all the time btw). So I calmly walked back home and nothing came of it. 

Until yesterday when I swear I saw a cat out of the corner of my eye, but of course nothing was there. And I was freaked out for a bit but I got over it.

"I have a bit of an update. 

Since posting this I took the advice and decided to take a step back and try to not stress myself out. I would like to say that it helped for a little bit. I got a new job and got out of a tough relationship, things seem to be looking up, but of course life isn’t that easy. 

Last night was horrible, I heard whispering that sounded like it came from right outside my window. So I grabbed my heavy duty flashlight and investigated, found nothing and decided that it was just me hearing the wind or something, it happened again about 5 minutes later and I ignored it this time, thinking I was just stressing myself out. This went on till about 3 AM, and I was finally getting tired of it and I took some melatonin and clocked out. 

This morning I woke up and the only thing weird is the funny side effects of taking melatonin. I decided to tell a close friend about it and she said I was haunted (basically she made it worse). 

I have no clue what it was last night, my imagination, a ghost or something, or the most terrifying actual people."	More-Dimension5654	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9934008717536926	weak	strong	no	na	mmfb	no prediction.

I'd recommend two things:

1) Stop reading/watching scary stories. Get your mind grounded in science and remember Occam's Razor (in short, the simplest answer is usually right). Take your beeping for example. I had this happen to me once. Couldn't figure out what the source was. But rather than attribute it to ghosts I kept looking and finally tracked it down. It was an app sounding an alarm I didn't know about.

"Long story short. From about 17-18. Maybe 19 I became extremely depressed. 
I’ve always felt lost and depressed but I had sixth form/school/university to at least keep some discipline in my life and socialise hence allowing me to feel better.

I’ll try summarise my situation/life as best as I can:

1. I am not mentally strong. I try my best but somedays/sometimes I feel completely defeated and hopeless. I’ve lived with my mum whom suffers from PTSD and severe mental depression.

- can’t cook for herself sometimes.
- Randomly has outburst and can just overall be negative.
Love her to bits but I’ve told her obviously if this is what I’ve been seeing for years it’s going to ‘rub off on me’ a bit.


I lost contact with my dad for a few years (they had a case together - both parents) it was overall just a bad situation and definitely affected me a bit.

Mother lost some benefits and privileges due to losing the case

I am okay with my dad now but he can’t see what he can do for me.



* I feel I need to read or do things to build  mental strength and discipline. I know for a few months or years it may be a struggle or ‘harsh’ but I need to learn to be positive about that. 

2. Finances. Are poor. Don’t have any real savings. Currently I’m working a 39 hour job contract that pays about 10.52 an hour. 
Job is fine. But it’s quite meaningless and I’m not gaining any real directed / specific experience.

However like I said I’m trying to pull myself out of a terrible position and understand the importance and discipline of doing things I ‘may not like’ 
Just to be stable again. Like I need to work regardless whether I like it or not.

* I do want to move out. So I’m trying to use this motivation as best as I can to just constantly work and save.

ODD confessions: I also lied about getting a bachelors on my CV and still have some jobs I’ve never actually worked in there. Should I remove these?



3. Slight Insecurities: I lost hair badly around 16-21. I tried everything but to no avail works - I definitely don’t care as much but it did strip a few years off of me.
I stopped going out. Missed a lot of opportunities and friends birthdays etc.

I DO regret this and do wish to get better so I at least have some friends left in my life (I don’t know how important this is)

- Physical Appearance. Don’t really like it but I understand I need to get in the gym etc. 
- I’m not fat or overweight anything but just don’t like how I look. 
I understand I need to go gym but I have a slight anxiety about it.
I do plan to go soon.

4. Lack of direction and knowing what to do.
As mentioned before I haven’t worked much jobs that are substantial or specifically targeted in a particular field.
reasoning why is I still don’t know what career path or profession i wish to take on.

I somehow wander within the thoughts of being a therapist or counsellor.
I may start trying to work jobs as careers etc or try find an trainee course / internship for this type of field
Or don’t know if going back to university would be a viable option.

I already went university but didn’t finish my course so would be tripling my debt.


Embarrassing (maybe) confessions.

I’m 23. And have PIED (Porn Induced 
Erectile Dysfunction)

- I use Viagra (100mg) to combat this.
I’m 23 and my self conscious has been eating me up about it.
I have a girlfriend I love her but feel she’ll definitely not be with me if I can’t pleasure her in the long run.

She claims she doesn’t care and can go years without sex / stay with me until I recover but I just don’t believe women these days.
This isn’t too important it’ll hurt to lose her but if I better myself maybe with time we can be reunited / never know what will truly happen.  

I’ve seen a doctor multiple times. Said it’s fine to use just not too often and try to stop in the future.

Great advice. I've been doing Therapy since I was a kid, because of abuse and neglect throughout my childhood. OP should for sure look for exactly that. The difference is mind blowing. OP I really hope you find some peace and comfort. You aren't to blame. I have PTSD/Depression/Anxiety/Agoraphobia. Some people get to a point where they don't see an easy way out of feeling how they are feeling at that time. Climbing out of depression, is a long and hard process for many. I hope you can move on and have a happy life. You can always message me if you want to talk as well.	RaspberryAny722	reply	na	na	na	0.9987634420394897	weak	strong	no	na	mmfb	failed
"I so badly want to be loved romantically. I know I'm not supposed to want it but I do. I keep falling for and giving chances to people who are cruel to me and then ending up alone.

I'm tired of being told it's all my fault that a kind person hasn't come along to love me. I know I'm too trusting and that I give effort to the wrong people. I know I'm supposed to love myself before anyone will love me. But why can't I just be loved now?

I'm just so sick of being told it's all my fault and I have to change myself to be lovable to good people. I'm a good person now. I try really hard now. Why isn't that good enough?

I know nobody 'deserves' a relationship or love. But I want it so bad. And I'm so over being told I invited the pain into my life by being kind and trusting people who didn't have good intentions. It's so frustrating and invalidating to be blamed for the ways other people abused my naivety. I just want to scream and cry sometimes. 

I just want someone to hold my hand and buy me flowers and have good intentions for me. I don't understand why that's so hard for anyone to do for me. It just really hurts."	Maximum_Map_233	post	17.680669279552035	female	White	0.9978873133659363	na	na	na	4	mmfb	no prediction.
"It is absolutely okay to want to be loved romantically, its a very natural human desire. I’m sorry you had the misfortune of being with bad people. 

Fuck the idea that you need to love yourself wholly before someone else can love you, HOWEVER, you must respect yourself wholly and stand up for yourself and pay attention to any and all red flags no matter how small. I also think working on loving yourself is always a good idea and you should proactively do that, but it’s not a requirement to be loved, you are worthy of that just by existing. 

Put yourself out there honey, just keep going, share dating experience with people you trust so you can be sure if someone’s fucking you about and if they are get out immediately. 

The people in your life sound like caring but frustrated arseholes who want the best for you but don’t know how to express it. Personally I’ve been in abusive relationships before and ignored when family and friends have tried to tell me but they did so in ways that I was closed off to, be mindful of that.

"> I just want someone to hold my hand and buy me flowers and have good intentions for me. I don't understand why that's so hard for anyone to do for me. It just really hurts.

You absolutely deserve love and we all have a desire/craving for it. It's nothing to be ashamed of or embarrassed about. It's also something which we can't fully control. 

What we can control is how we treat ourselves, how much we pour into ourselves and developing on our own. Nobody likes desperation - but on the flip side the more we work on ourselves, are comfortable in our own skin and grow to be more & more independent it makes us more attractive to others. Do it for yourself though. You don't have to be 'complete/whole' to jump into a relationship. We just just can't expect others / rely on their love to fully make us happy. 

Keep running in your own life and when you're ready, get out there, and you'll find someone running in the same direction as you ready to push you to be more. That's certainly the dream."	Maximum_Map_233	reply	na	na	na	0.9978873133659363	weak	strong	no	na	mmfb	failed

Do you need to work on yourself before you find what you want? IDK. Maybe. Maybe not. 

Do you need to make better choices about who you date? Again, maybe you do. I'd say it's possible, but still, maybe not. 

Here's the thing. Yes, the common denominator is you, but unless you've dated dozens and dozens of people, the sample size is too small to say ""you're the problem."" You may have just had a horrible run of luck. 

But to say you shouldn't want something? That's a steaming pile of horse sh!t.

Hi everyone, This is my first post in here. I'm 24 years old female. I want your help with this. I don't like going out often. I have my own reason like( me not being able to drive at evening due to eye problem, having strict parents , me myself not liking travelling far distance,etc) So, the thing is all people around me like to go out frequently/regularly. And they always judge me for being at home. I really like being at home. It's my safe space and believe me Covid Time was best for me since I don't even have to go out and people won't bother me with question like why don't you visit/meet us, etc.. . So, It is wrong to not go out often and what to do if people judge me regularly for this? I really need help Just adding I'm not scared of people. I can hold good conversation with people in group whenever I meet them or even can talk with strangers but the thing is I just don't like going out often and everyone is stuck with this idea that I should go out often to the point that if I say I'm having some problem in life they will literally connect it to the fact that I'm not going out and thus facing that problem which is ridiculous. So, can you all please let me know is it okay to not got out often? Or am I really crazy which people around me makes me feel like?"

"You sound very similar to me.  I grew up an only child and I was always far more interested in books, video games, and playing with my toys in my room than going out and playing with other kids.  Turns out a child who is rather solitary by nature grew into an adult who is *incredibly* solitary by nature.

When I grew older, probably a year or two younger than you are now, I started going out on the weekends solely because ""that's what people my age do, I guess?"" (this phase coincided with my acting career in NYC, so choices were limitless, and not a bit daunting).  After a very short period of time, I realized that I wasn't enjoying myself, and that's all it took.  

It really is that easy.  I realized that I was expending vast amounts of time, money, and energy on *a 'fun' thing that I didn't have fun doing*.  As soon as I had that revelation, I just stopped going.  Sure, I'd go out for a pint with the cast and crew after a performance, but I stopped ""going out"" on weekends entirely.  I was *overwhelmingly* more happy spending that time at home doing my own thing.

I had a friend group at work for a few years, mostly kids your age or a little younger, and they knew how I was.  They'd still often invite me to go out with them, but knew that 9/10 times I probably wouldn't.  Admittedly, the times I went out with them were a blast, but it was more fun because it was a rare treat for me, and not a standard part of my week.

If your friends actually respect you, they'll understand.  ""Hey guys, sorry, but I've realized I really don't like going out all the time.  Every now and then is cool, but I'm just not that much of a partier deep down.""  

Stay strong, and do what makes you happy.

"It's not wrong, but you can't survive in the world like that. Strict parents, eye problems are fine, you mostly can't do anything about these. You can try to change your mode of conveyance. Be open to change, you might like it like that but the people around you just mean that they'd appreciate it better if you'd be outside more often.   
You won't realize it in a couple of visits, you need to go out willingly, with the thought it'll be fun and better than being a couch potato stuck inside your house. You'll find new people, connect with them, and bond better with the ones who had always been around you but you never realized. It'll be a chain reaction and you'll love every bit of it.

This week is finals week at school. Yay. I have an orchestra performance coming up that I’m not ready for. I feel lonely even though I’m surrounded by people. I was at a youth choir performance tonight, and I was immediately drawn to one of the people in the choir because she looked familiar. I think we made eye contact a few times throughout the concert. When the choir mingled with people at the end, she came to me and we had some small talk before the noise of the room got to me and I couldn’t stand it anymore. I think there was a connection of some sort there, and it makes me sad to think I’ll probably never see her again. Lonely I stay, I suppose.

From how you describe it it does seem like there was something there. But I wouldn't give up on it so easily. People are more findable these days than they have ever been. Keep thinking about how she looked familiar - you might why she looks familiar, and that could be a clue. Check out youth choir's social media pages if they have them. There could be a clue there.

There might be others, near you but lonely and alone. Think of it a different way - what if you were the person to approach someone else? 

Seek connections. 

Next time, perhaps before leaving ask if you can get their number or message them or add them on xyz (however kids do it these days). This way you could still maintain something and/or continue a conversation. If someone says no, that's not a big deal. Don't feel bad or stress over it.

A) you should not tolerate physical violence- even if it is just pinching. That’s a boundary that should never be crossed and you need to have a serious discussion with her as to why she did that and why it is not allowed to happen again. B) if she’s not in therapy she should get in therapy, there are a lot of cheap/free options, she may even be under her parent’s health insurance if they’re in the picture.  (everyone should be in therapy). C) if it’s just the screen it shouldn’t cost that much to get fixed, much less than an entire phone so go get it evaluated before dropping $$$.	landcruiser7777	reply	na	na	na	0.9970313310623169	weak	no	no	na	mmfb	failed

As for how to fix the situation. As a boyfriend I think it'd probably be best to step up and just pay for the whole repair if you can.

I truly want to be better, but I should have gotten better a long time ago. I just fear that it's pointless at this age. I fear that even if I put a whole lot of work in, I will always be seen as a terrible person. And it will be extremely painful to no longer be a bad person but have to carry that label around for the rest of my life. So that's what kinda makes me worry.

Not if those victims never speak to me again. No point in putting in the effort for them if they aren't going to talk to me.

Today I got scammed through my college email. I was told that a lady at the college was trying to get rid of a guitar after her husband died and I only needed to pay shipping. In hindsight, I should’ve known it was a scam. But I got so excited that it was hard to see. The past year has been hell for me. I’ve been fighting chronic illness that makes me feel completely unlike myself. I found out about 4 months ago that my mom has stage 4 pancreatic cancer. I thought that getting a nice new guitar would be an incredible way to uplift my spirits. I’ve been battling mentally and considering how to move forward — whether that be through antidepressants or another way to stop feeling like nothing matters anymore. Not a lot has seemed to help but I’m trying my best to do things like working out, making new friends, and developing hobbies. They asked for $150. Money is really tight for me right now — I pay for my own college and I’m trying to help my parents out with other things as much as I can. But for something like this, i figured I could work it out. In the time when I thought I was getting it, I looked into books for improving guitar skills. I was excited to stop laying in my bed, depressed. I felt excited to do things again for the first time in forever. But now, it feels like nothing matters again. It’s just my luck for something like that to not work out and it just seems like a sign that all I should do during my free time is lay in bed and try to hurt a little less.

I, (16M), have been interested in this girl (17F). But the problem is, I've already told her how I felt. She said that she didn't see me that way. I told her I understand and I thought I was okay with it. To this day, as I'm writing this, I keep wishing that I was with her. I'm not usually the jealous type but I think that its's because I can't have her. I'm glad that she's happy and I wish her all the best, but I think of what could be a lot. I'm also worried that me and her are gonna fall out of touch because we don't talk to each other a lot. We used to be close, and I feel like I ruined it.

"First, I promise you that you will get over her. How do I know? Because I remember that feeling so, so well but I also know Ive felt it many times in my life and I have always moved on. It can take time, of course, but it will happen. 

I'm someone who happens to get really, really invested in people I like. I have experienced ""limerence"" (google that and research, it's helped me a lot) a half dozen times in my life at least. I have found a few key things really do help me. You might try one or more of these strategies and see if it helps. 

1) Realize that you do want to move on. Sometimes that feeling pulls us in and the misery starts to feel kind of good.  It gets comfortable to think about this person with sadness and you feel like that's the price you are willing to pay to not forget these feelings. You might think ""losing her [moving on] would feel far worse than this sadness so I choose the sadness"". That's a trick your brain is playing, though. In reality you won't feel sad when you get over her. It will feel liberating. You might have these feelings for someone else and this time they might be returned! Now *that* is definitely better than this sadness. So while you may feel moving on feels so much worse, in reality you'll be so happy when you can move on. 

2) Try to not think about her too much. I know this one can be hard, and I'm a big day dreamer so I get it, but really try to destruct yourself. Instead of love songs listen to something else. Instead of consuming media about couples or dating switch to comedy or horror for awhile. Our brains get into patterns so the less you think about her, the less you'll think about her. 

3) Know that this doesn't have to be the end at all. I've had feelings for my best friend on and off for 15 years. We remain closer than we've ever been.  Give yourself some space at first but that doesn't mean you can't get closer again. Don't expect her feelings to change, and don't put in any effort you wouldn't put in for a guy friend of yours. That will help you not feel resentment and will maintain that you are in the friendship for the right reasons. 

4) Journal. Even just in the notes section, type a text to her (but don't send it). Sometimes getting those feelings out is all you need to work through them. Keep them. In a few months read them back and evaluate if you still feel the same. Knowing your patterns can help in the future. 

You got this, dude. I know it feels overwhelming now but give yourself a few months and see where you're at.

This past thursday I stayed up all night to study for a math test that I was not there the entire unit on and studied only the day before so my brain was so amped up that I was not able to sleep. The next day I fell asleep fine. this is where shit starts to get fucked up. Saturday night at around 10 pm i was feeling so tiered ready to go to bed when my friend asked if i wanted to get in and out. summer just started so i said fuggit and got in n out. i pushed off the sleep so hard to hangout with my friends late at night that when i came home i was not able to sleep. last night, sunday, I did not sleep at all because i randomly got some thought in my head that kept me awake. it is now monday at 5:38 am and i did not sleep a single bit because my mind is racing so hard that I close my eyes, feel like im about to fall asleep and lowkey start to sink into my bed, but then thoughts just start to race extremly fast in my head like what the actual fuck do i do. my parents currently are planning on getting me sleeping pills first thing tommorrow so i can finally sleep.

I don’t believe you are dying. I’ve had trauma induced insomnia for over 40 years and I just had a really bad bout starting last Thursday until I was finally able to sleep last night. I tend to only sleep 3-4hrs a night on good nights. Hallucinations definitely can happen when you haven’t slept for days. If you are able to sleep at anytime today and tomorrow, you should try. Over the counter sleep aids tend to have antihistamines in them and may make you feel more groggy, but sleep + groggy is better than no sleep at all. Good luck to you and keep us posted.

The best back up plan is to go to college and get a teaching degree and theater degree. Then you can always be a high school drama teacher and give kids the opportunity your drama teacher has given you. As a college theater major, you can continue to be in plays and musicals. Being a waiter or working at a phone center while you wait for your big break isn't a backup plan	Camero2006	reply	na	na	na	0.9940080642700195	no	no	no	na	mmfb	failed
"Definitely education is solid. There are also loads of ""back-up plan"" majors that are easier than pre-med and super useful. You mentioned that you like tech, so computer science would be a great one. Ditto business and accounting. Neither of them are super exciting, but that's what your theater major is for. And business is super flexible - you can do a lot of different things with it.

I'm a 5'6"" male that's actually, genuinely and objectively ugly. That's it, that's how bad it is. Just like that, my life vanished in front of my eyes. I'm worthless, literally worthless.

Ugly men find women all the time. Men value looks way, way, way too much. If you're a good person it literally doesn't matter what you look like. I've never once dated someone who society would deem handsome. My last ex was 500 pounds. Why? Because he treated me amazing and we had so much fun adventuring together.

Nobody here knows what you look like so assuming that yes, you're as ugly as you believe you are, well it's not a crime to be ugly. Most people aren't good looking anyway. Genuinely ugly people still have lives and have friends, and even find love. Maybe not a human status symbol of a partner, but still someone they get along with and care about and who cares about them. Good looks, high status, money, prestigious job or position, social skills, these aren't guarantee that you'll actually find people who you trust and can connect with. At the end of the day these are arbitrary. They can help, but often they also don't for a lot of people. I've known beautiful and intelligent people who still ended up lonely. It's all about finding someone you connect with, and they don't have to be good looking or have high status either for you to like them.	jaguarcosworthr1	reply	na	na	na	0.9981010556221008	no	no	no	na	mmfb	failed

I know I'm a bad person for saying this, but I'm pretty sure other people in the comments are sugar-coating it majorly by calling you cute and stuff. Being ugly is no reason to kill yourself though; you're no worse than me and I've been with women, cute women in my opinion. Some people are weird and have different tastes so you'd pretty much have to drag your face across concrete to be repulsive to everyone.

"It's a blurry poor quality phone pic of you with a neutral face in the bathroom. Even the best looking guy wouldn't look that good in that setting. Setting that aside, you can use better grooming. A lot of very handsome men aren't like that effortlessly. They try to find the best hairstyle that compliments their natural features, they groom and shave, and many of them even get their eyebrows plucked or waxed.

That haircut isn't helping you, and you can groom your facial hair and get your eyebrows done to frame your face. The shirt that just goes straight across your collarbone doesn't help either, it doesn't compliment you. You can also lift a bit. Exercising and lifting in itself drastically changes your body shape, and even your facial features can look different due to the body fat composition and a healthier amount of hormones that are released due to exercised. The athletic guy with a chiseled jawline and sculpted cheekbones is like that due to his lifestyle and his own efforts in the gym and out in the field. You can't do shit about your height, but you can do something about everything else.

"Most men aren't chads either, but most of them still get laid and somehow convince a woman to commit to them and have kids with them. Most men don't even work out, they're out of shape, they don't have Golden Ratio facial structure, they have recessed jawlines or sagging features. You never saw an average looking guy, even an ugly and grotesque looking guy, with a partner? Sure maybe not a supermodel partner but someone who the guy seems to be happy with, the woman seems happy with him, and they look happy to be around each other?

It's not just what you have arbitrarily, at the end of the day nobody actually gives a shit about your stats, they give a shit how you make them *feel*. I know beautiful and ""successful"" people who don't have genuine friends and struggle with finding a partner, it's because they can't find someone they genuinely connect with (no one's particular fault), or they don't know how to make someone else feel good and feel heard. Nothing is a guarantee, there's a chance that even if you had physically attractive features, you might still struggle with connections and end up resenting women.

>how much they carry themselves as if they're the shit and how they ignore me and won't ever look at me as if I don't exist

You're projecting and assuming what you think they're thinking. Most men are ignored from the getgo, even attractive ones. It takes time to get a woman (not women plural) to notice you. Most women are also ignored as well and you probably don't notice the average woman either, and most women don't think highly of themselves. It's not like they're intentionally holding something from you and looking down at you like they're taunting you. They're just as insecure and self absorbed with their own problems as men, that's just people in general. They're not even thinking or worrying about you because they have their own stuff going on.

I don't know what the girls are seeing when they see you in person, since nobody here on reddit knows what your body language and demeanor actually is like in real life, it may be your looks, it may not be your looks, it may be the things you say or do, it may be something else entirely, a combination of things. Do you have any close friends or family members in real life who you trust will be *honest* with you? How is your relationship with your family? If you don't have close friends, you should worry about that first before thinking about women."	jaguarcosworthr1	reply	na	na	na	0.9981010556221008	no	strong	no	na	mmfb	failed
">You never saw an average looking guy, even an ugly and grotesque looking guy, with a partner?

They're always more good looking than me. Always.

>maybe not a supermodel partner but someone who the guy seems to be happy with

All men are dating down their looks. I don't quite believe there's some girl below me if we aren't starting to let go even the most basic standards like basic hygiene and such.

>You're projecting and assuming what you think they're thinking

Yes I am projecting, since I can't actually hear their thoughts or whatever, but I'm projecting based on their body language, the look on their faces, how they talk and walk and interact with the world around them as if we're all slaves to their princess fairytale.

>It's not like they're intentionally holding something from you and looking down at you like they're taunting you

But they're definitely looking down at me. They know they succeeded and I failed biologically/genetically and that I need their approval in case I also want to succeed. They know they can make or break a man, they know their power.

>Do you have any close friends or family members in real life who you trust will be honest with you?

Friends and family and honesty are two things that don't walk together. My mom thinks I'm the most handsome person even and would curse me when I say I'm ugly, my dad cannot understand why I never brought anyone home despite looking ugly like him, and my friends have let me fall in love with an attractive girl before and let my self esteem be demolished because they lied to me that I had a shot with her."	jaguarcosworthr1	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9981010556221008	no	strong	strong	na	mmfb	failed
"I have panic disorder and therefore panic attacks that are pretty random and I can develop triggers and phobias out of nowhere. I'm getting treated it's just a really hard chronic problem. I also struggle with ocd tendencies but not sure if full blown. But I kept getting video clips of guardians of the Galaxy 3 floor, the abused robot ? Spider? Rabbit named Floor on my YouTube feed and also on TikTok leading me to avoid both of these apps. I've never seen the movie and refuse to. This rabbit keeps giving me panic attacks every time she's on screen. I feel nauseous and close to throwing up going about my day when suddenly my brain flashes images of that poor rabbit. And then my imagination goes wild imagining it having limbs removed, tortured, all very r-rated. I start imagining blood that isn't even present in the video clips. That scene where she's crying to go/escape is stuck on loop in my brain for days.


Here's the thing though I love horror movies and have been exposed to a lot of gore, some real online and some in real life. I should be plenty desensitized for a pg13 movie. But normal things haven't affected me this strongly. I am so embarrassed and my friends always watch superhero movies with me. Absolutely dreading being asked about this one because I cannot do it. I don't know why though. Because I have a rabbit myself is my only guess, right? Because I  project my own bun into floor's place? I don't know.

I feel lonely, but I’m surrounded by people. I have a couple close friends, and many more distant friends, but I still feel alone. There’s not really anyone I can talk to about my real life, as opposed to how I present my life, other than my therapist. I feel invisible. I suffer from minor depressive episodes at least once a week. I have flashbacks far to frequently. Unfortunately, I’ve made myself the person others lean on. My most common thought error is telling myself I can’t help others if they know I’m “weak.” Logically, I know this isn’t true, but it’s such a strong feeling. I pretend I’m fine, which leads to a lack of true connection and support. I’ve learned how to feign confidence too well. I wish I had a person who was just a perfect match for me. A best friend or soulmate. All I have is my RPG characters or characters in books or TV that I wish I could be.

Today a man started screaming at me while we were at a stop light. I think it all came from a very insignificant moment minutes before where we surprised each other from around a blind turn. I thought nothing of it because all we did was make eye contact and moved on. But the thought that he then followed me just to scream at me like that is so frightening. I completely ignored him which I know is the correct way to handle stuff like this. I had my grandma in the car with me and I was so scared because I didn’t know what was going to happen.

"why is it that i miss you, is it the feeling of being held? is it the attention?
It’s the love, that genuine connection that i’ve never had with anyone but you, you were my everything, I was so happy with you, happier than i’ve ever been in my life, holding you in my arms, the moments when it was just us and we would laugh at everything, the late night talks about whatever came to mind. It hurts so much not being with you. Not seeing your face everyday. I try to forget, I try to move on, but I can’t, every-time i see another person smile it reminds me of yours. Every time I walk into my room, it reminds me of you, the time where I showed you the games I play, when i tried to teach you how to play them. The time spend at yours, watching movies, hanging out with your family, playing with your dog, your sisters, the jokes i would make with your parents. 
You doing my makeup, playing with my hair, holding you tight, holding your hand in the car no matter where we were going. I genuinely loved you, and as wrong as it is, i still do
But now i’m here alone, with nothing but questions. Why would you do that to me, you said you loved me but you still broke me, you still hurt the boy who wanted nothing but for you to be happy, seeing you now, you are happy, living your best life, but it breaks me that i’m not there by your side. 
I find myself thinking about you more than I should be, at work thinking about you, wether it’s happy memories, or the memory that will stick with me forever.
I can’t even listen to our song anymore because it breaks me every time i hear our part, the part where we both used to sign together. I can’t even bare to hear your name come out of people’s mouths because it hurts so much.

"Hey guys, I'm a 20F who's been under alot of stress lately, all this stress has lead to me feeling under confident, lower self esteemed and sad all the times, I have been crying alot lately and think this might be really not healthy for me.
  

  
Firstly I am currently struggling to accept the fact that I come from a household of 3 other people my mom, my dad and my elder brother who are fighting their own problems everyday and no matter how much I try, I can't really help them because I'm just a kid for them. I can only love them but I feel like giving up, isolating myself, punishing them with silence when they fail to misunderstand me and just working on myself in a way that I'm enough without them. But the truth is that I truly love them and no matter how hard it gets or whatever decisions I take, I want them to be with me. So, it's just a struggle to accept that this is the consequence of my actions only. It's hard loving people after all.
  

  
Secondly I feel extremely guilty all the time for not having a source of income like I used to before all my life took a turn. Even though I'm trying to focus on upskilling, I am constantly questioning myself that if I'm really good enough for anything. So, my struggle is accepting that it's okay and that I need to start acting my age right now by just doing my best and being dependent on my parents because they're only investing in me. I am struggling with accepting that I am still just a kid.
  

  
Thirdly I feel like I'm not good enough for any relationships of any kind and that I should be left alone because I've my own struggles and managing to love my people along with that is a task that I'm not good at. And all I've ever learned to do is run away than actually facing anything. I've tried to avoid pain by not allowing myself to make mistakes instead of protecting myself from pain which has only made me a coward. I feel like I keep dissapointing my boyfriend, even though he keeps helping me and supporting me, I just keep pushing him away, because I feel like I'm not good enough for him and he deserves better, I feel like such a mess all the time and I don't want to be a load on him, but I really really like being with him.
  

  
Lastly I ignore my feelings to be more desirable for people, even my boyfriend keeps saying I need to stop being so fake and a people pleaser, I have almost cancelled our dates just to get some college work done for my friends. I pretend to have my shit together even when I don't. I hate looking weak because I don't want people to worry about it and I struggle with opening up because I'm scared of being misunderstood by the people I expect to know how to handle me when I open up to them. I always think of myself as a strong independent woman and don't want to be or feel weak in front of anyone, not even my boyfriend, even though he know's who I really am, its just so hard for me to accept my reality.
  

  
It's like I distract myself with work when I'm sad instead of actually feeling my feelings, and then I sit alone and find a empty space to just cry and cry over and over again.
  

  
I don't know whether this is a call for help or just a ranting session, but I need some kindness, solutions, motivation and uplifting comment's really bad right now!"

"Loving isn’t hard. What’s hard is accepting that some people may not love you back or love you in the way you are expecting to be loved. We have these preconceived notions of how we expect people to love us back. Not everyone will, and while it might suck, it doesn’t mean we have to stop loving them. 

You’re 20 only. Don’t assume you have to do anything. Go at your own pace. Don’t feel guilty. You didn’t do anything wrong…unless you robbed a bank lol. It’s scary to open up and feel like you’re doing things wrong or feel like you’ll be seen as weak if you do something. The only weakness is the person judging you for something they can’t fathom. They don’t have your brain, so how can they make assumptions? 

Find the things you love to do. When you’re bored, ask yourself why you’re bored. If you feel sad and upset a lot, there could be other things at play that maybe talking to someone about will help. Not saying depression, but it’s good to figure out what’s making you feel down, and if there is anything you can do. 

Hopefully you see this and take the strides to change your reality. Because you have the power to make a difference in not just your own life, but others. Life is what we perceive it to be, not the other way around."	CrazyEvery3682	reply	na	na	na	0.9836634397506714	weak	no	no	na	mmfb	no prediction.
I didn’t mean to do it, ran right in front of me.  I tried to swerve, may have swerved into it, and everything went flying in the car trying to stop.  I felt the bump as the tires rolled over it, looked in the rear view mirror and saw it thrashing in the middle of the road.  I’ve never hit an animal before, I feel overwhelmingly sad and guilty about this.  For anyone who accidentally hit an animal, how did you move forward?

"God once I hit a rabbit. I was so depressed, I have two rabbits of my own so I felt especially bad. It was dead for sure, otherwise I would've tried to help it. It's definitely a tough mistake to get over. Unfortunately in this car centered world, and humans urbanization, it is bound to happen. It really sucks. I like blame humanity as a whole cause we are always killing something just by living (a little extreme but that's what I tell myself to feel better). 

I'm really sorry that happened to you. It's unlikely that it will happen again soon, as you will probably be wary on the road. I believe in your ability to process this situation.

I ran over a skunk 2 days ago too. terrible feeling. I shed some tears and still feel something heavy in my chest. I accelerated at night in a free road to test out my new car, and out comes a skunk just lumbering across the street. I hit the breaks, manage to miss it with front two tires but a back tire hit it. I felt so sad knowing that I killed that amazing animal. But in another sense, it felt like a warning to me not to drive recklessly especially at night. What if it was a person or what if I lost control of the car while my two friends are in it? These are things I think about. Either case, I decided to go vegan again for some time to at least save some animal lives and atone in a way. Hope you'll feel better in the future.

Please help me forget my ex. Ever since the break up, we've been on and off. We were just talking nothing more nothing less. They don't want anything more than that, but I want more. Having this in mind I tried looking for new people that would hopefully would want to start something. And i found someone, i stopped talking to my ex, and we're all good until i start missing them and they feel the same. This has happened 3 times already. That was until i found this person. they're amazing just so lovable. I ended up talking to them and just falling for them off the bat. i stopped talking to my ex and started dating this person and things were going good until my ex came back into the picture i tried so hard to forget about them but they were my first love and everything and then saying they miss me i just lost it. i apologize to the person i was dating and i ended stuff with them. i didn't want to lead them on with my idiotic ass. but they insisted that they'll wait for me and that they saw hope in me. so i kept talking to this person and my ex. i honestly felt like shit. i really liked this person but my ex had these strings attached to me and i would go back to them. two weeks into this whole thing i just fell for the other person and i ended up cutting things off with my ex and ended dating the person and we were good i told my ex that i didn't want to continue this they agreed and blocked me so i just simply let it happen and continued my life with this person that was my ex texted me and i just fell for their trap once again and i'm in complete distraught with myself. i found a person that i could see myself. i found a person that i could see myself having a future with but then when i'm happy my ex comes back to haunt me. i don't know what to do. it's as if they have this spell on me. i just want to be free and happy. I want to forget my ex but how? I don't know how to forget them. i'm not one to block or end things i find it extremely difficult. i just want to forget them. i want them out of my life but they always come back. i don't want this person to fuck me over like the other 3 times. i want to be over with them. Please help me. Please help me forget them.	Zealousideal-Count76	post	12.883077847938802	male	White	0.997678816318512	na	na	na	3	mmfb	failed
"Friend, I say this with love and care for you. Heartbreak sucks, it absolutely can destroy you. But you need to start showing yourself respect, because right now the person who is treating you the worst is yourself. 

You need to set this boundary and cut this ex partner entirely out of your life, you cannot ask to forget someone but refuse to stop them from waltzing back into your life. When we fall on hard times we often feel out of control so I’m here to tell you straight, you are in control and have total power over everything that is happening with regards to this. You can cut them out, you can heal from that trauma, and you can date and meet someone more aligned to you. 

I will say this to you though, it is disrespectful to other people to lead them on and date them when you’re caught up on your ex. That’s not fair. 

Talk to your friends about it, get yourself outside, learn to laugh smile and love again as who you are. You’ll be okay petal."	Zealousideal-Count76	reply	na	na	na	0.997678816318512	weak	no	no	na	mmfb	failed

"This is a throwaway account. Also, I have never actually posted on reddit so I apologize if this is not the right format or if I miss anything.
  

  
I (21M) am from a small college town but I'm in a big city for the summer. I woke up this morning with a really bad back ache and decided that I wanted to get a massage. Now, I do this all the time in my college town but since I just got here I searched around for the cheapest one I could find. I ended up finding this asian massage parlor with pretty good ratings for only 40 dollars.
  

  
I should have known the moment I got there that this place was sketch because it was behind a grocery place and when I first walked in they asked me if I was paying in cash and seemed surprised when I said card. Usually in my college town I don't take off my underwear but these people insisted on me taking off all my clothes. I did so and covered myself fully with the towel. The lady walked in and started my massage. It was pretty normal and underwhelming, wasn't really helping my back. It was going okay and I was mentally thinking ""aight this is why it was 40 dollars"" until she started removing my drapes. I was obviously uncomfortable and kinda just froze (I should mention I am much less ""sexually mature"" than other guys my age and have never really done anything before). Eventually she lowered it below my butt and then a few minutes later the towel was completely gone and she seemed to be constantly aiming to work on my butt and even between my legs all the way up so that she would touch my genitals every once in a while. She kept on rubbing the upper part of my inner thigh and up to my genitals. I was completely frozen and (I think) visibly shaking. She kept on going and touching me in places I didn't want her too and I was too frozen to say anything. Then she asked me to flip over and held up the drape I flipped over and she covered me completely again and I began to relax. She started massaging my legs and just kept on slightly touching my genitals. I was really uncomfortable and was trying to nudge her away. Anyway at the very end she said to me in broken english, pointing at my genitals, ""I will do that for extra tip"". I said no way and she left the room and I got dressed. When I got out of the room she started haranguing me for a tip. I originally said 10 dollars (25% more than generous) but she wouldn't stop till I made it $22. At that point I wanted to leave so bad I just paid and left as soon as I could.
  

  
I feel so guilty because I basically (inadvertently) paid a prostitution place. I feel disgusting in so many ways. As I said I am not very sexually mature and this is effectively the first time my genitals have been stimulated and I can't believe that it was at some sketchy alley massage place. I want to throw up. Am I can't stop thinking that I should have gotten up and left when she started touching me in areas I didn't want her to or said something and I can't figure out why I didn't. Am I overthinking this? Now that it has been a few hours I am starting to worry that maybe I could even be in legal trouble. This place is most certainly illegal in California and I inadvertently funded them.
  

  
tldr: massage place touched me in places I didn't want them to and exposed my whole body, I am shaken and feel violated"	Adventurous-Mall802	post	23.760181811914936	female	White	0.9987307190895081	na	na	na	4	mmfb	failed
"Yo, there's a lot to unpack here and I'm not certain I'll fully be able to address it and reassure you, but I'll try my best to help ease some concerns.

Firstly: Try not to worry about getting in legal trouble for this, these kind of places operate all around the world in many cities where they're not technically legal. They're more likely to be in trouble than you are (though they do usually have connections that get a blind eye turned towards them).

Your feelings are valid, and I can understand where many of them are coming from. You made a mistake and put yourself in an uncomfortable position that you weren't mentally, emotionally or sexually ready for - I hope you can work past the guilt and come to the understanding that it was just a mistake, and that you can learn from this experience.

You're still young (as mature and ready for the world we think we are at all stages of life) and you will have plenty more experiences to learn from and situations that you will think back on and wonder if you can handle it better.

I'm sure there were things that you could have done better - but that doesn't mean that you were necessarily prepared to. There are millions of humans out there that are too awkward to say that their coffee order is slightly wrong, or that the guy painting their fence is using the wrong colour or any other thousands of scenarios were people have the chance to speak up and say that something isn't quite right. Your scenario is certainly one of the more uncomfortable ones to be in and experience, and it's perfectly natural to be unable to act or speak out against it.

I don't think I'm really able to help you with your feelings of being violated - which, again, are valid. In terms of being sexually mature, you will come into that in your own time and with someone you trust. Don't place too much stock on the whole 'men need sex and should lose their virginity as young as possible' stigma that society pushes. Everybody is different and has different sexual and emotional needs, over time you will be better able to communicate those needs.

Hopefully some of this has helped - do feel free to reply or DM if there's anything I could try to communicate better or if you need any more help."	Adventurous-Mall802	reply	na	na	na	0.9987307190895081	weak	no	no	na	mmfb	failed
Hi OP, I’m so sorry this happened to you! Rest assured your reaction was completely normal. When we are faced with an uncomfortable situation, especially of the sexual nature, our body may go into fight or flight mode. Your reaction to freeze sounds like an instinctual reaction and it’s very common in the face of uncomfortable situations like this. You did nothing wrong. While leaving or speaking up sounds so easy in hindsight, you were in a very vulnerable situation with a person you didn’t know in an environment you couldn’t control. Perhaps your survival brain was concerned something worse would happen if you said no or tried to leave before it was done. Being naked and having someone standing over you is a very vulnerable situation to be in. It’s completely understandable if you didn’t feel safe leaving or saying no. Be kind to yourself. They should have asked for consent to touch you in sensitive places though I get how illegal businesses may not practice their services ethically when it comes to body touching. Just know that you deserve to have others ask to touch you wherever on your body. You’re feeling dirty because you were violated and I’m so sorry that happened. Practice extra care for yourself over the next couple weeks being violated can bring up some painful feelings and undeserved self blame. Pay attention to this and try to not punish yourself for being human. Talk to someone you trust and get extra support if you need it.

It’s very common to freeze up when being touched in a way you don’t want. It doesn’t matter what your gender is. The fear, confusion, dread, cringy feelings leave us unsure what to do to make it end. You got yourself out of it and you did absolutely nothing wrong. Absolutely nothing. At least you spoke up and said no and got out of there. That’s more than I was able to manage, but that’s all I could do at the time.	Adventurous-Mall802	reply	na	na	na	0.9987307190895081	weak	strong	no	na	mmfb	failed
You were sexually assaulted. It wasn’t your fault. Freezing like you did is pretty normal. A friend of mine froze in a similar situation. She also reported the incident to the police. You didn’t do anything wrong, and you won’t get in trouble if you want to report it. You don’t have to report it if you don’t want to. It’s your choice. I’m sorry that it happened to you. Your college is likely to have counseling resources for students who have experienced sexual assault. Please talk to someone about it. They can help you a lot more than folks here on Reddit.

"Hello,
  

  
today when i was driving home after a fun day with my friends i saw randomly my ex gf which i've been in a commited relationship for 2 years.
  

  
We broke off because she said she has depressions and want to work on her self but immediately after the breakup she dated another boy from the past which she knew before our relationship.
  
I never reached out to her since the breakup and never begged if she wanted to leave i said fine and got myself immediately in no contact apparently after some hard months i had no wishes anymore to get into a relationship with her.
  
After a couple of months of no contact, self improvement , thai boxing classes in thailand i came back home and then she contacted me i met up with her and she said that she still has some feelings and that she regrets that she broke things off with me and she asked if i still consider being in a relationship with her.  

  
It was a hard decision but the only for me to make i said to her that i can't consider to be in a relationship with her since i knew that she left off only to pursue that other boy which she declined but since i got some friends they told me about it and i got some infos which approved that.
  
She said that she understands my decision and i blocked her ass in insta just to move on.
  
But today after 4 Months i saw her randomly in her car in the streets driving towards me with her boyfriend , yes the same one she declined she is not dating.  

  
After she saw she did a u turn to drive past me to look in my car and then she did it again.
  
I just don't understand her behaviour, i guess she was trying to make me jealous to show that she has a boyfriend when i didn't wanted her back but why do you think this means?  

  
She is still blocked i mean she won already she broke off with me to be with the new guy why is she trying to prove that she has a boyfriend to drive 3 times past me, i mean she is already with the new boy for almost a year, the meetup with me was 4 months ago and the breakup almost a year.  

  
Maybe you have some opinion about her behaviour or in general, that would help me very much.

"When you're mature, you realize that a healthy relationship is when you care about the other person, how they feel and what happens to them.

When you're not mature, you only care about how that person makes you feel. Feelings change.

A good relationship is when you work to make sure those feelings last, but you also decide what you're going to do when those feelings change.

She's immature. She's chasing the 'feeling' of a new relationship, first with you, then this other dude. You can't get those brain chemicals any other way, and some people literally get addicted to the way a new relationship feels. When you can see this for what it is, you can avoid a lot of bad relationships. 

Second, she doesn't like being told 'no'. She resents you for telling her no, and so she needs to show you that she is happy now, whether she is or she isn't.

In short, you are good to be away from her. While she was certainly attracted to you, she's not the sort of person who is ready to love another person. She's still just running after the way other people make her feel."	Equal-Ad9548	reply	na	na	na	0.9991841912269592	no	no	no	na	mmfb	failed
"I feel like I'm a boring person...

Everything about me feels plain and uninteresting. I have no sense of fashion, I don't have unique hobbies or interest, and half the time I'm stuck in my room all day. Everyone my age has something their passionate about, something their proud of showing-off. They have an aesthetic they like, they have a hobby or interest that makes them happy, or they just have something to be confidant about and know they have it.

Me? I got nothing. I'm a cisgender male, with interests that I don't bring the forefront of my personality, and any dream or passion I may have is never fulfilled because I lack the confidence or motivation to do anything.

And I've been feeling worse since I got an Instagram. Seeing these people show of their skills, and display how much they've changed over the course of their lives, meanwhile the only change I've made in my life is that I started wearing hoodies. The only thing I've got to my name is being Autistic. Not even the fun kind of autistic, with all the special interests and obsessions and unique traits. I'm an introverted white guy who looks like an incel soyjak; Glasses, facial hair and all.

I want to be an artist, because drawing and fan-art has always been my dream, but I never make the effort. I'm always upset that I can't draw the cool stuff in my head, and I'm stuck with nothing but my imagination. 

I have friends who actually like me and support me, but I always feel like I'm lesser than them. They have hobbies and interest, they're productive with their lives, meanwhile I'm always watching YouTube or occasionally playing video games.

I feel like I'm a total loser. I'm a young adult who hasn't done anything with himself and lives in a shitty Red State that treats LGBT like shit.

"Sorry to hear that you're feeling down like this. I hope, like you alluded to, that getting this all off your mind a bit has helped.

The world we live in today is really strange and confusing, moreso than it has ever been before I think, so it's totally normal to feel like you're nothing special.  I feel this way often too. When I was younger, it was mostly younger women who were made to feel inadequate because wherever they looked, they saw unrealistic images mirrored back to them, telling them they should be more attractive, skinnier, etc. etc.  Now everyone is bombarded, constantly, on social media with posts and images they tell them that they should be richer, more interesting, funnier, smarter, harder worker AND more attractive than they are. If you're young today, your sense of self is just developing, and all these social media messages are killer. And they're all telling you that the it's not okay to be just average.

In my experience, the harder you try to be something - whether that something is ""cool"", ""interesting"" or ""good looking"" - the harder that thing is to be. The easier and better thing to do is to just do whatever you find interesting and then share it with people. It doesn't have to be a passion or an obsession. Go for a hike and then say to your friends ""I went on a cool hike yesterday"". Or watch a new kind of movie. Or whatever. If you do something that interests you, other people will find it interesting - and you'll feel more confindent.

You only have to do one thing: Get a full-time (40 hr / wk or more) job. This will give you a set schedule and force you to get out of bed. And even if it's min wage it will give you enough money to get an apartment of your own. This will solve 95% of your problems.

This seems to be very cliche, but I tried to go to gym, get online certifications for my future, go shopping, hobbies that helps me to focus, go out, etc. Maybe you can give all the love for yourself first :) the right person will come in the right time and now it’s not bad to go out by myself!

"My situation is miserable

It's been like this for  2 years, I'm used to it now, i just wanted to vent. I used my phone too much, so i put a limit of time i can spend on it daily, 5 hours(not counting messaging apps and the time since midnight til i go to sleep). I don't like using my phone this much. Fortunately it doesn't interfere with my extracurricular activities, i study 2 languages by myself, scots gaelic and Norwegian, and altough I'm not a straight A student I'm the best in my class. I hang out everyday alone for an hour or 2, sometimes i also read books. The problem is that i don't have a friend group. I live in a small town so the choices of who i should hang out with  aren't many. I used to have 3 childhood friends I'd hang out with. 1 of them, known him for 7 yrs (I'm 15) and since he went to school in another city he stopped talking to me, we didn't fight, he just stopped, he found new friends there(he didn't move there, just goes to school there). Second one same thing, 7 yrs, forgotten about me, i tried hanging out w his friend group last summer but they didn't really care if i was there or not, so i stopped.I didn't fight with both of them, i don't like fighting with my friends. The other one was a chill and nice boy, but his parents weren't so he got taken by the social workers without his phone and i haven't talked to him in 2 yrs, i miss him. I have a friend with whom i play every night when we don't have school the day later(all summer, Christmas break, saturdays...), But he doesn't hang out at all, he spends all day at home doing nothing, i think. I feel lonely, but I'm used to it. This id sad and idk what to do. Maybe next year I'll go to school in that city i talked about, i have a friend there that wants to hang out w me, but i have to convince my parents (I've already changed schools once). I just feel sad about it now, thx for listening."	ghost_hay	post	20.74580094127304	male	White	0.9963906407356262	na	na	na	1	mmfb	failed

"AITA: for feeling upset by my best friend’s engagement?

Here we go. Originally I would have loved to post this on r/AITA, but I don’t have enough karma to post there. Hoping I can get some feedback here. 

The story goes: 

About two weeks ago, my (21f) best friends became engaged. It was planned, he (20m) took her (22f) totally by surprise. I want to preface this by saying I am genuinely excited to see where they go and what they build together. However, my initial reaction was instinctive, albeit negative and piss poor. Concerns for them include the fact that they don’t live together, have probably less than $1k between them, and have yet so many mental/emotional stuff field between them to sort out. I know that these things are none of my concern in the long run, but I am close enough with both of them that I can comfortably talk with them about it, and we all have. 

About two weeks before the engagement, a few of us learned about his plan. He originally planned to wait another few months, so we (me and other friends) were slightly skeptical. Where did the change of mind come from? In any event, this is where things started going downhill. Myself among at least two others informed them our own opinions that it may be best to wait due to reasons already mentioned, but he was persistent. 

When just her and I spoke, I made the mistake of bringing up my own parents divorce. Fast forward for me to find she thought I was implied this would happen to them. (For reference, they are very devout and do not believe in divorce. Even if they came to be unhappy, they are very certain they would not leave each other, let alone that their unhappiness wasn’t true and it would merely be a struggle to sort out.) I never meant to make her think this. so is, my first mistake. 

Day of engagement: I had a lot of immediate conflicting feelings, but that evening I showed up for them because I thought it was the right thing to do, despite my feelings. They are my best friends, after all, and I should be supportive. I was fairly quiet through the outing though, trying to safeguard myself from saying anything I would regret. This course of action turned out the wrong idea, though. 

The following Tuesday, she rang to talk. I was at work and was unable to talk much, though didn’t get the chance to say so before she cut the conversation short due to having to go to work herself. In our brief conversation she mostly debriefed her feelings about the day of engagement. After she hung up, I typed out a very long text to her explaining and apologizing for the way I handled it all. This was not the first time I made a mistake with her, so I was on edge and feared losing her. Essentially, it all read that I understand they have a plan. Despite their approach being the opposite of many people nowadays, they have a plan and have faith in it and that is what matters. The way I reacted was wrong. I wanted her to know I was by her side. Little did I know she had already blocked me, and this text likely has still not been seen. 

Fast forward a few days: after some conversation with her now-fiancée, I was told that if I wanted her, I’d have to go get her. And so, I did. I was able to catch her at work and had the opportunity to explain myself and apologize for my poor taste in person. She let me do a lot of the talking before saying anything herself, but when she did begin, I came to find a few things:

- part of her blocking me was a result of several people at her workplace giving her similar negative feedback, when she was excited. (Another reference- both of them have already been through hell and back, so for this to happen is meant to be a very happy thing in her life. This she was deeply upset by the feedback received being majority negative.)
- she wanted to take a step back from our friends group and meet more people who shared their beliefs. (I later found that this didn’t mean all of them, it really only meant me, especially given they are not the only devout people in our friend group.) 
- they have already accepted the fact that they are going to struggle. personally, I don’t think their plan is fail proof but again - what matters it that they have faith in it, and that it’s what’s right for them. 

At the end of it all: I can still reach him though haven’t talked in a while. I still cannot reach her. It is devastating and heartbreaking that she is “moving on with her new life”, I trust that she will be happy but I never imagined not being able to be around for it. I will still worry about her and hope the best for both of them. I tried to apologize and she listened but did not accept. I can’t expect her to forgive me, and don’t. it just still feels so strange. To suddenly have zero contact with someone who I used to speak to at least twice on any day if I wasn’t seeing her, someone who I’ve developed such a strong relationship with (I don’t have many close girl friends), is driving a stake into my soul. I’ve received so much reassurance from other friends that I am not entirely in the wrong, and some selfish part of me still wants to believe that my honesty and concern about it should have been taken with a grain of salt, much less appreciated. But it doesn’t take away from the fact that what I did was horrible.  I should have put my immediate feelings aside and been more open. I know there is nothing more I can do, and that it is up to her now if she wants me back in her life.

I guess I am just looking for some advice. I have spent so much of the past three years (since Covid or so), trying to figure out who I am, and who I want to be, and part of that has come in the form of being more confident and more openly, honest with people, especially the people that I care about. However, it clearly doesn’t always turn out for the best. All I have been thinking about, for the past few days is her and the situation, the fact that I can’t reach her, just wishing I could take it all back, and just feeling like a horrible person on the inside., As though all of this building up has only lead to more problems than solutions.

Any feedback is greatly appreciated. Thanks so much for reading."	Asleep_Consequence27	post	29.04305249349167	male	White	0.9983301758766174	na	na	na	1	mmfb	no prediction.
"People need to be free to make their own decisions and live with those responsibilities. 

Even when our friends make seemingly poor decisions the best we can do is advise (if asked) and support them throughout it. 

That being said there have been many in history who've married young/abruptly/not in the best financial scenarios that have gone on and have great marriages. The same goes for the opposite. In the same vein people in great life situations/with great financial wealth/fit end up divorcing.

"I've had sleep issues for ages but they always said I wasn't bad enough to get a CPAP. This latest test though I was magically halfway between moderate and acute sleep apnea despite feeling just as much rest (or lack thereof) as usual. As a result, I'm set up to get a fitting tomorrow and it will be sent in the mail over the next two weeks or so.

With the iron, I just learned about it before making the post so I'm waiting to hear back from the liver specialist once he's hooked me up with a blood specialist who will direct me to yet another place to get an MRI with my gov't insurance. 

The allergies aren't something as simple as food. They're things like dust, seasonal, etc. It just warmed up over here so we suspect this latest one is also related to the seasonal change. However, what we do know is it has my eyes particularly absolutely irritated. Not just the eyeball but the entire eye lid is much more red. I've been taking special eye drops to try and help with it but it's so bad I've been having to go get wet cloths and keep them pressed against the area until they dry out, then re-moisten them up to 2 more times just to get it under control for a while longer.

"I made a post about this about a year ago, and the comments really helped me out, but lately its been bothering me quite a bit, and a lot of what i said is outdated. 

During the year of 2020, I was depressed/suicidal for a variety of reasons. I gave up on everything, and planned to kill myself when i turned 18 (I'm 19 as of now) and could legally purchase a gun. I basically had nothing to live for, so I became an apathetic/lazy person. Barely got out of bed, didn't do chores, didn't partake in hobbies, didn't eat right, and most importantly, didn't brush my teeth. I gained 20-30 pounds in this year due to my constant soda/sweet tea consumption, and you can just imagine the effect that had on my teeth

I had braces during this time as well, so all of the damage was even more extreme. Because of the pandemic, i went about a year and a half without going to the dentist or ortho. I eventually got my shit together and decided to make a change. I lost all of the weight and started taking care of myself again. my braces were taken off, and, unfortunately, my teeth had holes, dark spots, and unalterable bright, unsightly white spots. I had seven cavities, and one of them is probably going to be a root canal soon. 

I just feel so fucking sad. Im constantly thinking about my teeth. I can't even enjoy going out to ice cream with friends because all I can think about are the potential ramifications. I eat once a day now because I know eating througout the day increases the chance of decay. I miss being able to smile in photos. I miss not having to cover my mouth when i laughed in close proximity of someone. I miss not having to reject potential relationship interests because I'm worried they'll find me disgusting after they notice my teeth. I miss not being in physical pain because of the tooth that will probably need a root canal. A fucking root canal at age 19, and to make it even worse, its a front tooth. When the root canal inevitably fails, it'll be a noticeable extraction. 

I have changed a lot about my life. Got my license, made friends, enrolled in college, etc. But i still feel borderline suicidal because of this. I'm constantly stressed about losing my teeth in the future, and extremely insecure about the unsightly stains. It is my biggest regret, and there is nothing i can do about it."	whoevenknows232	post	14.846020294751467	female	White	0.9963458180427551	na	na	na	3	mmfb	no prediction.
"Your dentist can probably help with the stains, etc.  Worst case would be getting caps for the front ones. It's not the end of the world.

People just don't understand how important brushing teeth is. It's literally the cheapest and most impactful thing you can do for your health. But it takes years of condition to develop the habit, like literally your parents forcing and yelling at you to brush your teeth from 2yo to 18yo. Without this forced conditioning, most people would not consistently brush their teeth everyday twice a day for the rest of their lives. Not once a day, not every other day. But everyday, twice a day at the minimum.	whoevenknows232	reply	na	na	na	0.9963458180427551	no	strong	no	na	mmfb	no prediction.

"He has a girlfriend, you’re co-workers and you’re sensing that he starting to pull away. 

1.  Very bad idea to date a coworker — **unless** you have minimal contact, there’s no unbalanced power dynamic, **you’re both single**, there’s not HR rule against it, and you’re sure you’ll both be ok if things don’t work out. 

2. If he’s pulling away, you’re likely giving off way more than just cartoon heart eyes. You might be making him uncomfortable. Think about how you felt that last time you got unwanted/inappropriate attention from someone.

3. Everything points to him rejecting you if you ask him out. How are you going to deal with that when you have see him everyday?

Take a step back. Deep breath. Nothing wrong with crushing hard on someone. 

Try to remain as professional and detached as possible. He will have way more respect for you. You really don’t want him saying things to his girlfriend like, “Ugh there’s this chick as work who…” You don’t want him talking to your mutual co-workers like, “Ugh. What’s the deal with Sonny. She’s always staring. It’s creeping me out.” Ultimately, if there’s ever going to be a chance for the two of you, you want him thinking good things about you. 

What if he broke up with his girlfriend and you’re that lady from work who creeped on him? Wouldn’t you rather be that woman from work who was really helpful but maintained professional boundaries?

If he’s pulling away and you persist, his next step might be to go to HR. Don’t shit where you work. Be appropriate. Be professional. Then go home and write wild fan fiction about him."	Sonnyskies778	reply	na	na	na	0.004969086963683367	no	no	no	na	mmfb	no prediction.

"I'm a 23-year-old male. I was emotionally neglected in my childhood; I never received love and affection growing up; you only felt worthy when you accomplished something, and now it's affecting my life.
  

  
I only started dating when I was 21, and fortunately, I had good partners even though things didn't work out. Whenever I'm in a relationship and I'm being loved, shown affection, and supported, I become a different person. I know it's not unconditional love because it's a relationship. But it changes me; I thrive and want to be the best version of myself. I know relationships can fill emotional needs, but you can never count on someone or place that burden on them.
  

  
I've tried to go about it alone and be emotionally stable on my own, doing all that self-love stuff and therapy, but I still struggle so much when I don't have someone next to me. I feel like I'll never be able to fully function in life because I always desire love, affection and security. I try to ignore it and focus on all I need to be doing, but most of the time I can't. 
  

  
Maybe there are others who have a similar issue or anyone who has advice for me. Please help. Thanks."	No_Development_2627	post	25.01307488767863	female	White	0.0016584242694079876	na	na	na	2	mmfb	no prediction.
"Self-love, like everything else in life, takes practice. Don’t beat yourself up for struggling with it. Part of self love is awareness of your feelings (which you clearly have-congrats! That’s a solid first step many people don’t even get to!) and being able to accept those feelings, experience them, and move on. You cannot change your upbringing, but you can change your future and not let it hold you back. You are worthy of love. You are a good person. You are capable. Everything that you are when you feel your best-that is you, and only you. Can bring that person out or hide them, with practice. 

So make an effort everyday to compliment yourself on something, or a couple things. Maybe make it a nightly ritual before bed, or in the shower, etc. forgive your negative self talk(we all do it), but stop it as soon as you notice it, and switch the script. 

And treat yourself to the things you love. Indulge sometimes. Embrace your strengths. Be the best version of you for your own self. Because you deserve it.

" I was 13 when me and my family moved from Hungary to Germany, now im 15. My past 2 years was all about me trying to accept a new lifestyle,trying to get friends and trying to be happy. I've been really struggling to basically just live here, and i still do, I feel like i threw my freedom away for a comfortbale life, and it defenetly didn't worth it. Everytime anyone asked this question : ,,and is it good in germany? "" i always lied, and said ,, yeah, everythings fine"" ,  i guess i just didn't want nobody to worry about me. My parents never asked me if i like it here, and i always whised that one day they will ask what's my opinion . They still haven't asked me yet. I just can't believe that they haven't noticed why did i change that much , i wish they were more caring. I'm not the people anymore, that i used to be, I often get angry at every little thing , I often forget my manners towards my own mother, and father. I know that some will think that this might be because of my puberty , but i don't think so. I've used to be a talkative, kind person with lot of friends, now i just sit in my room thinking about my old friends , barely talking to anyone in my school , not doing anything , being actually sad . I had to leave my friends , the girl i love and my home behind, all because my parents decided to move, I don't talk to my old friends , not because i don't want to, it's because they already got new friends to be with. and yeah i get only a tiny interrest from them . I also disappointing my family , everytime i do something wrong. I know that these things doesn't matter that much for them , but still i want to prove them that i'm not useless , i'm trying. I think i just failed as a son . I just can't believe that my life really got to this point where i'm having suicidal toughts at this young age... i don't think i deserved this. I told my parents that i don't like this life that we living, this was 2 weeks ago , I don't think that they care.

I’m so sorry you’re going through this. Please get professional help if you’re having suicidal thoughts. Also working on your appearance and finding hobbies/joining groups will improve your chances of making new friends. People bond over common interests. Is there anything you like doing that you could join a after school group? Does your school have sports teams? Art group? Also talking to a therapist may improve your mental health and improve social skills which will help you make friends.

"Sometimes the best pain management isn’t medical. Sometimes it’s self care. fibromyalgia can be very difficult to live with, (forgive me for checking your profile but I wanted to give you a thoughtful response) but I’ve known people to manage their symptoms with light aerobic exercise like walking, yoga, Thai chi, or swimming. Yoga and Thai chi can be especially effective because of the meditative component, and since stress can exacerbate the symptoms things like gentle yoga can be very beneficial. But even walking can be meditative. I’m sure if you google walking/nature trails near you, you can find somewhere quiet and pretty to just be alone and appreciate nature. It isn’t a miracle cure but hopefully it can make things easier to manage.

And in regards to the stress related component, I think that maybe one of your biggest contributing factors to not only how you feel physically but how you feel emotionally. It sounds like you had a very tough childhood, and being non-binary and asexual are both hard things. As for your childhood, you can’t change the past, but I want you to know that yes. You deserved better. You are worthwhile and worth loving, lovable and good and even if your mother didn’t act the way you deserved it doesn’t make you less deserving. You are a beautiful person inside and out, and while you can’t change your past you can have a future.

I also wanted to say that being nonbinary and being ace and isn’t easy, but you’re not alone. There are lots of people like you. I know it can be hard to be both of those things but you’ve proven your strength by coming out as both of those things and you’ve proven it by living with your fibromyalgia. 

Also I noticed you’re an animal lover. You seem to take excellent care of your pets. That’s wonderful. You must have such a big heart. Have you ever considered volunteering at some kind of animal hospital? I know that by me there is a wildlife center that takes in injured wild animals to nurse back to health and they are constantly looking for volunteers to help out. Something like that might suit you. It can bring you some joy and therapeutic stress relief while making the world a little better. Regardless, i know you bring joy to the life of your pets and your kind heart shines through. 

So basically I just want to say that you are a wonderful person. The world needs more people like you in it, and I’m rooting for you my friend."	sockknitterporg	reply	na	na	na	0.9974977374076843	weak	strong	no	na	mmfb	no prediction.
I second this about using physical activity for pain management. I have terrible neck/joint pain from Injuries I got as a kid… I thought I couldn’t exercise cause of the pain.

"When I was a child, I wasn’t a ""good"" child. At least, not all the time, but most of the times. I don’t remember a lot about my childhood except pictures of either really good or really bad times, mostly bad. Nothing special, that’s just how memory works. I had teouble making friends in elementary school, i was angry or violent. I was a bully. I have apologized to most of the people i did bully in elementary when i got really guilty about it in high school. Anyways, i was a very creative child. I would draw a lot, made impressive dollhouses and many stories. But I wasn’t good at school. Didn’t care much about it. I wanted to have fun like most kids. I would fight a lot with my mom, I don’t,remember much but i was told i was ""mean"" with my mother, especially as a child. Like i wouldn’t listen to her and test the limits but with other adults i was an angel. When i was younger, i was often told ""be nice with your mom"" all the time. I don’t remember why i wasn’t. Maybe i was angry at her but i feel like it wasn’t my fault. I was a kid. If i wasn’t nice to her but nice to everyone else, how was it my fault and not reactionary? This idea of me bothers me till this day. I hate when people mention it. Like ""oh you were mean to your mom when you were young"" etc. Especially knowing how she is now that i’m an adult. 

I have a brother, he’s 6 years old. I’m 21 [f]. He’s an amazing child, yet, with my mother, he can be ""sort of mean"" but not really. I see myself in him as a child. My mother emotionally neglects him a lot. He’s hypersensitive, like i was. My mother tells me sometimes ""he has his ""you"" (as in me) phases now"" as if i was the problem. I don’t get why people think this is ""normal"" for a child to act this way yet not normal but isn’t related to the parent. It’s as if, the parent wasn’t responsible for the child. How can a child really be a bad child if they’re not with other’s who aren’t their parent. How can other adults not realize that the child isn’t the problem? Today, i feel this constant need at proving myself, and not feeling worthy enough.

I moved out of my mom’s at 17 because i couldn’t take it anymore, her emotional abuse, her narcissism. It felt like i was the adult sometimes and she was the child. She still hasn’t taken much account for anything she has done or even apologized. Yet she’s not entirely bad, like she wants to help everyone and save everyone, just not herself or her children. I feel guilty sometimes for leaving my brother… but i will be there for him, always. I just couldn’t stay there, and i’m never going back. My mother wishes i would’ve come back sometimes, to help her out financially or with my brother, she’s a single parent. But i don’t agree with how she deals with things.

I’ve had this longing feeling that in order to be worthy, i must be loved. I tried to find someone to love me the way i am and it was hard but it felt like it was my only reason. As if, if i couldn’t be loved, i shouldn’t even be alive. I don’t have a good sense of self, i’m not reslly sure who i am, or who i want to be but i know what i don’t want to be and i don’t want to be her. I guess i’m just writing this in hopes of freeing this pain inside of me. A pain that makes it almost impossible for me to love myself but also, makes me want to be more gentle to myself and patient, because even my own mother wasn’t."

You can’t change your past but you can change your future and you must start by loving yourself. Your worth is something you assign to yourself and you must do so generously. How you perceive yourself affects how you carry yourself which affects how others perceive you. Take time each day to remind yourself of something you like about yourself. It can be little things like, “I like the way I make pancakes with bacon in them.” Or “I like the way I always make a point of acknowledging cashiers.” Whatever. The point is challenge yourself to come up with something new to like about yourself everyday, forgive yourself for what you perceive as “flaws” and forgive your past mistakes and work to be the best version of yourself you can be, not because someone else needs you to be, but because you deserve to be the best version of you. Because you have worth. You are good. You are lovable. You are wonderful. You are strong. You can move past all the hurt. You deserve happiness, and I know that if you allow yourself to love yourself you will find it. Sending all the love your way my friend. I’m rooting for you.

"Forgive yourself first. Everyone has a rebellious phase in life and everyone your age just wants to have fun. That’s normal. You’re not alone. 

Now, if you (not your father) have goals, ask yourself what you need to do to achieve them. If studying isn’t working, ask yourself why. Is it because you have trouble focusing? Why? Are you too busy worrying about something? Can that something be addressed? Are you distracted? Can you minimize the distractions? Can you change study locations or ask a good student to help you? Does the study method not appeal to you? Not everyone learns the same way. Some people learn by listening. some people learn by reading. some people learn by doing. Try switching up your method. Make flash cards or highlight the book or record a lecture and then listen to the recording again, whatever works best for you. 

And you know what? If you try these things and it doesn’t work that’s ok. Forgive yourself for that too. School is hard. You’re not the only one to struggle with a class.

I've never met someone that finds me attractive in any way, physically or emotionally. I don't think I'm particularly ugly. I take care of myself. I'm caring about those around me. I worked a customer facing job for years and have been told I'm very good at holding conversations and a huge amount of customers expressed genuine appreciation for the way I treated them and said they really like coming in when I'm working. But it seems like none of that matters because nobodys actually interested in me being closer than arms length. A funny guy to talk to and be around sometimes, but never anything more than that.

"Loving yourself first is the most important thing. If you want someone to find you attractive, you must find yourself attractive. saying things like “I’m repulsive” will only hurt you and hurt your chances at finding someone. Sometimes when people are desperate for affection they come off as desperate, or their own negative self talk can kill the confidence that they need to put themselves out there. Or worse, they want love so badly they fall head over heels for the first person to smile at them, even if that person is terrible for them. Don’t fall into those traps.

You are wonderful. Remind yourself of that daily. Count all the things you love about yourself even if it’s as silly as “I love the way I make grilled cheese sandwiches” or as simple as “I love that I enjoy video games.” Love yourself first and foremost. treat yourself right and indulge in the things you enjoy. Nurture the skills you have and work on the ones that don’t have. Be the best version of you that you can be for your own sake. Because you deserve to be your best self. Because you are wonderful. When you embrace this, you will eventually and inevitably attract a likeminded person.

"I know this isn't a monumental issue, but it's something that I cringe at when thinking about it later in my day. I tend to speak quite loudly, and my voice carries quite a bit. I think it stems from feeling like I was never heard, but I get really embarrassed about it when people later tell me to tone it down. It's really bad when I go back to the gym that I work at to visit with my coworkers before my workout in the evening where there's a wide open area for noise to travel. It's something I'm being more conscious about, which is a step in the right direction for sure, but I'm still struggling with how bad it makes me feel. It does not help that I also have an issue with oversharing, something else I'm being more mindful of in my everyday conversation.

"Some people are just loud talkers. It’s nothing to be embarrassed about. The fact that you are conscious of it is a great first step. It’s very self aware, and you should be proud of yourself for noticing and for wanting to change.

"As the title said.
I have developed feelings for a friend and I really thought something was voting to happen between us because we were getting close lately. Since he’s shy and we have been friends for a while I thought maybe he was gathering up the courage.

And then I found out he has started dating someone and I was crushed. I decided to be honest with him because I will need some time away from him to heal. He said he’s sorry for hurting me and that was it.

Thing is… there was a tiny desperate part of me that hoped that he would say something like - I prefer you, f**k that other girl. And now I feel so, so dumb and lonely."	queenjulien	post	24.025810296133454	female	White	0.9992316961288452	na	na	na	11	mmfb	no prediction.

"Ok. Things I would recommend focusing on:

1. You did an extremely brave thing telling him! You knew there would be a chance he didn't reciprocate and you did it anyway. Be extremely, extremely proud that you were able to pull that off. Many, many people are not able to do this.

2. Be thankful he was honest and kind to you. You don't want to waste your time on someone who doesn't like you back (let me tell you!). He could have tried to pull you along but he didn't. He did you a favour by biting the bullet and being clear about his feelings.

3. It's going to suck right now so embrace it. You're allowed to mourn the loss of the potential relationship you had envisioned! You've already shown you're a smart egg by proactively taking the time to heal away from him a bit. Eat ice cream from the tub, binge watch a show, cry! Do the things that help you in this moment, it's not shameful. When you're ready you will begin to return to normalcy and you *will* be able to get over him.

And all that strengthens your confidence and just makes you glow as the person people like to get to know and be with.

"Am I crazy for feeling sort of hurt?

I usually spend hundreds and go out of my way to make my boyfriends birthdays special for him.

Mind you his Mom spoils him…she just is an alcoholic.


My parents live out of area so I was alone for my birthday but we were together this Saturday on my 25th.

We’ve been together 9 years. He had money as far as I know.

He never 👎 got me a card. He said happy birthday but it was like another day. I barely got any birthday wishes either from anyone else so I spent the day crying

Is it my own fault? Should I just forget it? Am I wrong to be feeling hurt that he just sat on the couch and barely spoke to me as usual? 

Idk I just feel like maybe I went over Board on the cupcakes and gifts and cards and chocolates in the past. I just like making people feel special.


I know I can’t expect people to think and act like me…I wouldn’t want that.

"Tinder is a hellscape that can easily kill someone's mental if they're not prepared for how uncaring a system it is (men and women alike!). I do not advise it until you have some experiences under your belt.

Honestly, it seems like the core of your issue is being comfortable around pretty women. Weird idea, but do you have any friends with attractive gfs that would be willing to help you get more comfortable chatting? Yeah it might suck to admit you're shy around girls but if they're real friends, they will have your back.

Looks wise you have nothing to worry about, not even slightly. You won't be everyone's taste, no one is. Looks are not a concern for you lol, believe me!

Confidence isn't always logical, people who have 'no right' to be can be super confident and it's fricking awesome. Likewise, some of the most successful and 'attractive' (whatever that means) can have super low confidence and self esteem. It's not based on external evidence, it has to come from your own personal work.

Confidence is a muscle. You gotta train it and a big part of that is learning to take Ls. They will happen, but it's almost always not a reflection of you as a person. 

Compatibility between two people is fricking hard man, we have so much shit going on in our heads, in society, it's fricking amazing that anyone hooks up long term. Accepting that means a lot of people you try to gel with won't work out, that's ok and GOOD. You don't want a partner that isn't a good fit for you man.

Try to find some excuse for social events, parties, gamesnights, sports, groups whatever and just get that experience. It comes with time.


That's assuming you don't have a neurological issue like anxiety or depression which is its own thing and defo should receive treatment but I don't know enough about you to make that determination (also, not a doctor lol).

"(sorry for any typos)

I haven’t lost weight, i haven’t had kids, i don’t have any health issues or anything that would be the cause of this. Ever since my boobs started growing they’ve grown downward, like my nipples face down. 

Every time i look in the mirror i wanna cut them off. I hate the way that they look and it makes me cry because i know men like perky tight breasts and i don’t hav that. I don’t wanna pay all that money to get a surgery. i literally cannot afford it.

Some days i’m just like..just deal with it this is how you are. And other days (like today) it makes me wanna cry and hate myself. I’m glad that i have healthy breasts, some women have breast cancer so i probably shouldn’t be complaining but it’s just not fair. I see these other women with perky nice boobs that sit so well (and they’re even bigger than mine! I thought that if a girl has bigger boobs they will sag.) It’s the fact that mind aren’t even big! Id be like a B cup!! So i don’t understand. I feel disgusted with  myself and the way that i look. I can’t stand looking into the mirror seeing my breasts.

I agree bras don’t really affect it, you may just have “slender” or “relaxed” breasts. There are different shapes of breasts and by no means are those uncommon to have, we just gotta learn self love!

"I've gone back and forth on trying to answer this. It's incredibly easy to say the wrong thing, so I've been hoping that someone else would say this, but, here goes. Here are the reasons that this is not going to blight your life.

To start with, as /u/PonytailEnthusiast said, you almost certainly look better than you think you do. 

Second, while there are men who will reject you because you don't look like a filtered, Photoshopped Onlyfans model, those are almost always **men that you don't want in the first place**. (Spider Robinson said, ""Any woman whose breasts are her best feature is almost guaranteed to have a shitty life."" He means that she will spend her life surrounded by men she's better off not surrounded by.)

Third, and stay with me, there are four basic forces in physics: Gravity, electromagnetism, weak nuclear force and strong nuclear force. The first one we ever know about is gravity. (We usually figure it out about the first time we try to walk!) But here's the thing: gravity is actually the weakest of the four. Everybody notices it; all the others are stronger. Now what I'm working up to is this: physical attraction is gravity. Everybody notices it, and notices it first, but... it's the weakest part of a relationship, and it tends to fade out fastest. 

So what is strong? What lasts?  Integrity. Wisdom. Kindness. Humour. Generosity. I have occasionally met women who became more attractive over time. I once posted an Uncertain Frye meme with the captions, ""Not sure if the most beautiful woman I've ever met.... or simply the kindest."" 

I'm afraid that this is boiling down to a fairly hackneyed piece of advice: Be the best version of yourself that you can. Don't assume that this physical feature will destroy your life."	AdvertisingFinal5165	reply	na	na	na	0.9992326498031616	no	no	no	na	mmfb	no prediction.

No matter the amount of compliments I recieve nor the amount of effort I put into a project of any kind I just cant ever be entirely happy about what I create on rare occasions I somewhat enjoy what I make. But whenever I make art, make a video, or do any kind of work that I commonly like to do I always just leave the results with low expectations and even though a lot of people enjoy what I did and give such sweet compliments I can just never see whats so special about it.

"Hi there. I read this and it really resonated with me. Sorry that you're going through this.

In my personal experience, this is part and parcel of what it means to be a creative-type person / artist. But it's also something that you can control. You can let it get worse and choke-off your creativity. Or you can work on how you think about it and transform it into something that you have more control over, and eventually something that motivates you.

The reason I say it's an integral part of creativity is that everyone likes to show their work to others. Almost no one ever creates anything and then hides it in the closet for the rest of their life. (And if they do, it's because they've lets this inner-critic win and choke off their creative joy.) In the first century the poet Ovid couldn't get people to listen to his poetry. A friend said, ""why don't you just write it and enjoy it yourself"" and he said, basically, that creating without sharing was like ""dancing in the dark"" - i.e. it just wasn't satisfying. And I think he was right. 

I've often struggled with this too, in my writing. And when I do, I remind myself of a few things - 

\- People who compliment me probably aren't straight up lying. Yeah, my mom might go a bit overboard in her praise, but overall people don't say they love something they hated and visa versa. The compliments you're getting are genuine. (To help remind yourself of this in dark times, try writing them down in a google doc and then, when you're feeling like your work sucks, just go back and look at the doc.)

\- Focus on the process, not the outcome. The creative process is a good, fun thing that you probably enjoy. (Otherwise you wouldn't be doing this.) You just like making videos, etc. Try to focus more on that, and tell yourself ""no matter what I feel about how this piece turns out, i'm going to enjoy it, and learn something after it's done."" 

\- It's also completely natural for the creator of something not to enjoy it in the same way as someone who views it from the outside. Say a film director directs an action film and then shows it to an audience. One reason the audience is going to like it because it's surprising, and they don't know what's going to happen. They just don't know what's coming. But the director does know what's coming. He directed the thing! He knows ahead of time exactly what's going to explode and how the final scene will go. So he / she won't enjoy it in the same way as the audience. But that doesn't mean that the audience doesn't enjoy it, right? And it doesn't mean that the director can't enjoy his own movie on many different levels, levels that the audience doesn't know or care about. 

\- You don't *have* to see your work in the same way that other people do. You just have to believe that they genuinely enjoy it. If they do, then what you're doing to create that enjoyment is working. Keep going. 

\- Also, i'm not sure this exactly what you're talking about, but when it comes to the subject of creative disappointment, like not feeling like you're work really is what you want it to be, I always remember this quote from Ira Glass:

>“Nobody tells this to people who are beginners. I wish someone told me. All of us who do creative work, we get into it because we have good taste. But there is this gap. For the first couple years you make stuff, it’s just not that good. It’s trying to be. It has potential. But your taste -- your taste is still killer. And your taste is why your work disappoints you.   
“A lot of people never get past this phase. They quit. Most people I know who do interesting creative work went through years of this. Our work doesn’t have this special thing that we want it to have. We all go through this. And if you’re just getting started or you are still in this phase, you gotta know it’s normal, and the most important thing you can do is do a lot of work. Put yourself on a deadline, so that every week, you will finish one project. It is only by going through a volume of work that you will close that gap and your work will be as good as your ambitions. It’s gonna take awhile. You’ve just gotta fight your way through.”

Anyway. Keep going. The world needs your work even if you can't see it right now."	Cave_in_32	reply	na	na	na	0.9985958933830261	strong	strong	no	na	mmfb	no prediction.

"I'm 23 and a guy (lonely guy on Reddit big surprise). I want to sleep around and hook up with people but being able to be in spaces where I can meet someone that wants to hookup or possibly date is impossible. I literally do not know where to go or what to do to change that. I just lost my virginity last year to my high school girlfriend (we had been broken up for many years) and I'm still embarrassed that it took me that long, or that I couldn't find someone else into me. She's pretty much the only girl that has ever reciprocated any kind of attraction to me, whether I was 16 or 22. Now she wants nothing to do with me because I was too mentally exhausting for her (I don't blame her). My parents forced me to go to an all boys Catholic school in high school where I was bullied severely and extremely socially isolated, and I believe I was seriously deprived of some key socialization and I still can't talk to new people my age because of it, especially women my age. And then of course not even two years into college (I didn't really wanna go to college to begin with) the pandemic hit. I didn't have any friends at school before the pandemic but it pretty much guaranteed that any kind of social networking that might lead to making an intimate connection wouldn't happen. I ended up not finishing college and dropping out a year ago. Now I'm living with my parents just trying to save up some money to move out. On top of the fact most girls are turned off almost immediately that I'm at my parents still, I literally do not know of a place, event(s), or social scene to meet new people where a relationship could happen naturally. People always tell me ""just do things and talk to people without expectations"" well I've tried that and look where it's gotten me. On top of my circumstances, I believe that I am ugly. I'm short and I feel like I have interests that a lot of people have a hard time relating to. So dating apps are pretty much a bust and most of the time I feel as though girls I talk to (and even become friends with) don't see me like that. All of my friends seem to be having relationships or hook ups (of course they don't know how to help me or offer me help) and I feel like I'm the lame one that they feel more comfortable with because nobody is attracted to me. I feel unwanted and ugly. I feel like I'm not allowed to talk to women because I'll just creep them out. I'm sick of always having to listen to my friends tell me about what they got going on in their lives and it's never the opposite way around because I have nothing to show. I feel like people see me as non sexual because I'm unattractive and they just assume that I don't get any attention, affection, or intimacy, and like I'm not a person with desires I deserve to have met when everyone else is. I feel like people look down on me because of my lack of sexual experience. I just want to feel respected. 


TL;DR: I want to sleep around more but I do not know where to go to find people that may want to do that. I hate myself and my life. I just needed to type this all out because I may lash out at someone if I have to keep this in any longer. yes this is cringe, and you have my permission to call me such."

"I'm sorry you're suffering. But, some perspective? You're super young. And therefore impatient. But it's not ""too late"" for anything. Life is measured in decades, and if you work at it, each will be better than the last. It just takes a long time to build a happy life. For anyone.

College is the happy hunting ground for the 20-something set, or was when I was about it.  (Apps came after my time.) You might consider taking another run. It's not only about your own earnings, or the dating opportunities, but also the earning potential of your eventual partner. It's worth thinking about another 'college try', for a lot of reasons!

And okay, you're not Chris Hemsworth. Me either! Still, working out or doing something like a hiking club or ultimate frisbee league bumps you into people as well as does the best possible with what you've got, physically. So don't skip leg day!

One thing it might help to keep in mind, too -- many, even most, of the people you see hooking up or partnering up are going to rush into mistakes. Ending in breakups, divorce, unwanted kids, manipulation and abuse....  It's often *bad*. Having more time to pull yourself together, calm down a bit, and get started in a direction you want before getting entangled is not a bad thing at all.

You're going to be okay. You just have to keep doing the work of physical, emotional, and financial fitness, and keep an eye out for possible connections. It takes time, but eventually someone will click. Probably...more than a few, before you're really ready to settle down.

I met my now wife when I was 28. On a camping trip for an Ecology class that I wasn't actually in (but the professor needed more warm bodies....) We hadn't spoken before, but she was stuck chopping vegetables or something as part of the cooking crew, and wouldn't be able to get her tent put up before full dark. So I offered to pitch it for her -- and her smile lit up the canyon again. Our first kiss was later that week. (Two years later, at the wedding service, the pastor told the assembled that he'd heard that I ""pitch quite a tent"". Right in front of grandma. My groomsmen held it together pretty well, I was proud of them.....)

The point being...life is weird and specific. And 23 is very young. The horniness is bad enough to suffer -- don't beat yourself up with illusory comparisons and thinking it's ""too late"". You can't win when you're fighting yourself like that.  Just breathe, and keep going, building your life, one piece at a time.  They'll all come in to place, eventually. It just takes time.

Best wishes.

Not sure why you are embarrassed it took you until 23 to lose your virginity. Virginity is a silly concept. You could be 60 and lose your virginity. 

You have normal sexual experience for a 23 year old. It obviously varies but sexual experience is not a universal thing. Hook ups aren't exactly all that it's made out to be unless you are really into them. 

Lastly, it's never too late to hook up if that is what you REALLY want to do, people hook up well into their senior years. You are super young in the grand scheme of things."	Mean-Grapefruit-8372	reply	na	na	na	0.9983262419700623	no	no	no	na	mmfb	no prediction.

"I [23F] recently and suddenly had some car trouble that is going to cost quite a sum to fix. I also am carrying 2 rents as I am about to move into a new place and couldn’t line up the leases ending perfectly. I also will need to spend money on myself for applications for higher education shortly. The car trouble sort of sent me into anxiety, especially because it happened close to my birthday. I ordered a custom cake for my birthday, and it’s more expensive than I expected it to be. I never get anything for myself and had initially considered just canceling the cake order. I feel incredibly guilty that I am going through with it. 

I feel like I have no money to spend and shouldn’t buy anything I don’t need for myself right now. I actually have a decent savings balance, even though I couldn’t make major progress on saving over the last few months. I’m not dipping into my savings too badly right now, and even with all the payments coming up, I still don’t think I will thanks to my paychecks. I feel like I’m getting scammed with car stuff and my cake even though I’m really not. 

I don’t need this cake. It’s food. I never spend this much on food. If I don’t get it I won’t be celebrating my birthday. I wouldn’t want someone else to not celebrate themselves, and I’m trying to be nicer to myself, but I just feel guilty over this cake instead.

I’m lucky I’m not hurting for money, and while I don’t have a budget spreadsheet or something, I do try to save whenever I can and know what I typically need to spend money on. You are very kind.

"Trying to remain hopeful but everywhere I turn, it’s a dead end. My last relationship ended last year, we got our own separate apartments and don’t talk anymore. My family has drifted apart pretty much, my Mom has her own life, my sister has hers and we aren’t really talking anymore. I tried getting a roommate when I moved in here and she bailed on me with no notice. I tried looking for a new roommate recently and she acted interested then I never heard from her again. I’ve tried being more social (this takes a lot for me) and people just don’t seem interested in talking to me. The conversation dies off pretty easily and they seem bored. I tried reconnecting with my ex gf and old friend, and neither of them wanted to reconnect. I have no support system. 

Last year I got fired from my server job.. i was pretty blindsided. At my pizza place I worked at, the GM moved stores without telling me and the entire crew that I was comfortable with, also left and they started over with a new crew. I just got the confidence up again to try serving again because I really need the extra income. And I just got let go again (I think this time it was staff cuts due to failing business) but I met a couple of really cool people there and don’t know how I’m gonna see them again. 

Seems like whenever I start to get comfortable and adjusted, things always get ripped out of my hands. I already feel like there’s really nothing left of me, I’m 28F and I don’t feel hopeful at all about my future. Also a college drop out who can’t go back unless I pay a fork load over to the university. It’s looking more bleak every day.

I don't know why it's so hard for me to consistently keep a job. I've been at this one since early October. I like my work, I like my coworkers, it's just so hard to make myself go to work everyday. It feels pointless. I'm making money to pay bills for the house I don't event spend time in because I'm at work. It's affecting how my manager sees me and reviews my work and I'm terrified I'll lose my job, but at the same time I'd love to be a homemaker. I have so much shame at the idea of not working though.

"Hey friend, I am really sorry to hear you are feeling like this. However, many people experience this so you should not beat yourself up for the way you feel. Unfortunately, a lot of jobs leave us feeling unsatisfied and unfulfilled.

Do you think it is the specific job in particular that is giving you these feelings or do you expect you would feel this way anywhere else?

Also, there isn't shame in not working and being a homemaker if you are in a position to where this is feasible. There is absolutely nothing wrong with that in the least. A homemaker is a job in and of itself so the thought of that being a non-working position isn't true at all.

I've struggled with depression and anxiety for years - this is not the first job where I've experienced this. Interestingly, the jobs I've stayed at over several years had flexible hours, whereas those I struggle at are traditional weekday hours. This has been significant enough to contribute to losing employment in the past, and I'm terrified I'm on that track but it doesn't feel like I can fix it.

"I just needed to get this out somewhere -- preferably anonymously. It's a small and stupid issue, but it's affecting me a emotionally quite a bit more than I thought it would. I have a best friend who’s in medical school, and HELLA busy, all the time. They’re getting married this coming year. For years, we’ve told each other we’d be our respective maids of honor. While I currently have no marriage prospects (lmao) that was still my plan up until today.

It makes sense why she’d pick someone else — I live across the country, they have other equally special & meaningful friends, they are busy as hell. But they let me know today that they’re choosing someone else.

And of course, I said that was awesome — whatever works best for them, and that even though I’d be sad I wanted them to make the best decision. Weddings are stressful enough.

I think I’m just shocked at how crushed I am. I love her so much, they are truly someone who I just adore.

Thank you for your comment, and I appreciate the advice! I feel much better after just taking a few days to process.

"My girlfriend and I just broke up and I don't know what to do anymore.

I never thought I would ever post something like this on the internet but I need help moving on from this and I don't know where else to go. 

My girlfriend (25F) and I (28M) just separated after 9 months of a serious relationship and I don't know how to deal with it. Background: We met through a local pickup sports group about 9 months before dating. We were both interested in each other almost immediately, a fact we didn't learn from each other until we made it official. I could tell from the beginning that she had had some terrible experiences in the past with men, both in abusive relationships and a SA during college that ultimately resulted her in dropping out of school in her last semester due to her declining mental health. 

I noticed these things through her body language around the other men in the group and decided to not actively flirt with her or ask her out because I didn't want to make her feel uncomfortable, despite having a huge crush on her. And that was the limit of our interaction for months, we would see each other once a week every Tuesday night for our pickup game and became acquainted with each other, though we both knew, in secret from each other, that we liked each other more than we were showing. 

She started working at a corporate pizza chain while in college and became a manager at a new store soon after dropping out of school. As you can guess, being a manager for a corporate chain post-covid means that she is constantly understaffed and overworked. She still found the time in her busy schedule to come out to our pickup game, at first, as a source of stress relief and exercise but later, she did so because she enjoyed our interactions. As the year progressed, we would talk more at the game and subtly flirt with each other, slowly going from going out for food afterwards with the group to doing so with just the two of us. We even had a playful game of picking up the cones at the end of the night and throwing them at each other to try and catch them like ice cream cones. 

I was so afraid of making her feel uncomfortable by me asking her out or making a move on her that that was a biggest move I could make to try and see if she felt the same about me. This went on for months until I mustered up the courage to ask her if she wanted to play a round of disc golf with me ( a sport that I had wanted to try out for some time) I learned then that she had played before, even having her own bag. It was during this round that I finally got to see her open up and be comfortable and show who she really was. It was here that I realized I loved her and everything I had stressed about for months meant something. We realized here that we liked each other and knew the other did as well. 

From here we started spending more time together, learned our new shared sport together. I was just learning how to play and she decided she wanted to play more regularly and had hopes of competing in amateur tournaments. We spent what little free time she had from work playing at the local pickup group and playing disc golf together. Soon after this, we started our romantic relationship and realized just how long the other had liked each other for and why we were so hesitant. Things for more than perfect for a while and I felt like I had finally found some true happiness in my life. 

It was a few weeks after that that I learned about the trauma she had suffered in the past and the reason for her apprehension around men and decline in mental health. She had been failed by the school's SA program and her own parents, who were ashamed of what had happened to her and blamed her for it. I accepted what had happened to her and made sure to be supportive and understanding of her. I was patient, even when her past trauma caused her to flinch away from me sometimes because the memories were so strong. I did everything I could think of to make her comfortable. I worked around her busy work schedule. I helped her when I could because my work schedule was a fraction of hers. I met her parents and many siblings at a few family gatherings. Family was crucial to her and she wanted to try and rebuild her relationship with them, and they were too. She met my family and we welcomed her at the holidays. We were doing well, I was learning about how to love her and she was doing the same. She trusted me in a way that she couldn't have just a little while ago. She shared her struggles with me and I listened and did what I could. 

I wasn't without my own personal struggles and insecurities and I had a hard time opening up to her for a couple reasons. Firstly, my problems seemed out of proportion to hers and I couldn't bear to add more emotional burden on her. Secondly, my past relationships all resulted in my girlfriend not being as interested in me as I was. I learned early on in my dating life that I couldn't be partially involved in a relationship. It was all or nothing for me. Something that has led to a lot of heartbreak. Despite everything that was going well in our relationship, I was still afraid to completely lower my shields. 

But I did. She had shared everything with me. What keeps her up at night and scares her. It wasn't fair for her to open up with me and for it to not be mutual. I allowed myself to be vulnerable with her. She had asked me to share my issues with her because she cared about my problems too and she wanted me to be able to come to her for advice as well. 

Work got crazier for her and we started spending less quality time together and we lost our emotional connection. She was stressed with her job, her finances, and her mental health. I couldn't do anything to help and she shut herself off from me. We had some serious talks during this time about us and what was going on in life. She wanted to try and stay together and I was willing to do anything for her. I expressed my needs to her and what I needed from her to feel like I wasn't the only trying to keep us together. I set aside my insecurities with being the only one trying in our relationship. I helped her move into her new apartment, something we had talked about doing together. I lent her money for her new apartment's rent because with her overlapping leases, it was putting a significant strain on her finances. I was supportive and understanding to what she was going through and put my needs on hold. Despite all that, she couldn't give me the bare minimum I needed from her. I would text her in the mornings when I left for work and she would ignore me. I would ask her to text me when she got home safely at the end of her shift, which often ended at 2 am and she would be too tired to text me. How could I be okay with her driving home at night when she was too tired to remember to text me and not be worried for her. 

This went on for a week until we had our final talk at her place and she and I both broke down about everything that had transpired. She wanted to care for me but couldn't love me when she couldn't love herself at the time. 

I was heartbroken but I still loved her and cared for her and just wanted the best thing for her. I still helped her finish moving and didn't pressure her about the money I had lent her. I was dealing with it okay and still held out some hope that we could still have a future together once she had time to heal and process her past trauma, sometime she had not truly done yet. 

She had a disc golf tournament recently, something that she had truly committed to and was doing well in her competitions. I was also playing in tournaments at the time and this one was one that had courses I had played frequently, either with her or my other friend who lived in the area. I had decided to sign up for the tournament last minute because there was room and realized that we would be on the same schedule. It didn't bother me that we would see each other because we were still interacting because she still needed some help with her apartment move. When I saw her at the tournament, it broke my heart. She was dressed up and wearing make up, something she hadn't done around me for months. She woke up early in the morning to get ready and get to the course, something she never did for me because she was too tired from work. She hadn't made time for me in the recent months because she was too tired from work but her she was, she had made time in her busy schedule to go out and practice for her tournament and was dressed up the morning of but she couldn't even spare a few minutes to text me when she woke up hours after my day had started or text me when she got home late at night. It broke my heart that when her schedule became busy, I was the first thing she cut out of her life and couldn't give any effort for. Everything I had done for her and us and I couldn't even get a text that took seconds to send. 

I don't know what to do anymore. I feel like the past year has been a complete waste and I don't know how to recover from this. I can't believe that after everything we went through and did for each other that she can just forget everything. My biggest insecurity has happened again and I don't know how to even remotely open up to someone to talk about it. Let alone fathom the idea of opening up in another relationship.

"There's always risk when it comes to love but it's better to have risked than not try at all. 

I think the best relationships are ones where you both push each other to bigger and better things. You both inspire each other to be the best versions of yourself. 

It's also a lot of pressure on the other person if all your happiness relies on how they treat you/feel about you. 

Live and learn friend. Take time to take care of yourself and when you're ready I hope you meet someone who 1) you can share all your insecurities with and 2) be in a more balanced relationship where you both like each other at a comfortable relatively equal level.

"I don't know where I went wrong, but I am destined to forever be the filler friend at most in any social circle I will ever be in. Someone you might invite if there's an open invitation to somewhere if you want a lot of people to show up, or if you want to pad the attendance,, but not the kind of person you want to be in youe life forever or your first choice. Even if I invite a group of people, they will just talk around me. This is how it always has been in the 30 years I've been here, and how it always will be. I am the only common denominator with all these different people.

I am just fundamentally incompetent at the most basic of social skills. I cannot start a conversation, I cannot let another person know they can speak to them, I cannot keep a conversation going. It even takes a conscious effort and me to constantly psych myself up just to say ""hi"" to someone I already know.

My therapist wants me to go to support groups, but support groups don't give a shit. They won't respond to my calls, they won't email me back. Every single one I tried. I can only scream into the dark void of the Internet about this. I certainly cannot risk destroying what little relationships I have with others by trying to open up, since I have no abundance at all."

"Well, ever since college, I felt down at my inability to have romantic or sexual relationships with women. I'd get depressed and sad about that. More recently, I decided that the best thing to do would be to focus on platonic relationships to help me gain the skills that I need for better relationships. But as I found myself unable to do any of the work needed to make connections, that made me feel even worse. I really started to notice that I've always been like this. No matter what goals I try to set for myself to get better, no matter how much I simplify them, I just... can't.

"Thank you for your honesty. I know it may not mean much, but I think that's really brave. Something struck me though: ""ever since college"". Were things better before college, or in college? Could that be when things changed? Also, I know this might be a sensitive subject, but have you had a romantic/sexual relationship with a woman in the past? Or do I take this to mean you are a virgin?  


I think it's worth to work on getting to know people, regardless of gender, platonically because it really ""trains"" (sounds strange to say) you to really see people as individuals with their own hopes, dreams, preferences and personalities rather than just sort of a species you're attracted to.  In your view, what kind of work should you be doing to make these connections? Are these goals you've set for yourself because they're what you truly desire or simply goals your therapist has set for you?   


I know you say nothing's really changed, but when I listen carefully to what you're saying, it does seem like something did change: something in college.

"Eh, not really. I was pretty miserable and felt excluded during middle school a lot. High school was a little better, because I did things like school plays which I enjoyed, and I had a few friends. Some I'd consider real friends, some were just utterly toxic, like one who had no sense of boundaries, would put me down all the time, and would be prone to fits of extreme anger out of nowhere. But I let him walk over me, because ""at least I have a friend, right?"" Even the more genuine friendships, I didn't feel like they were particularly emotionally intimate, more of ""we do activities together"".

I didn't have any success with girls in high school, but it was a small school, I'd tell myself I could wait until college for that. I went to a college that was about 80% female (to answer an anticipated question, that's not why I went there), and obviously, that never happened. I didn't lose my virginity until I was 22 with a woman from Tinder. Honestly, we were not a really good match. Looking back, the only thing that brought us together was mutual desperation.  Since then, I've had a couple of things with women, but not a lot. They rarely last, if it's more than one date, it's rarely more than a month or two. The longest-lasting thing I ever had was almost a year. But we never declared ourselves a long-term relationship. Looking back, we also weren't a good match. She'd never want to do any activities I want, even when it was something like just watching Netflix at her place, she would say ""no"" to anything I suggest we watch. It felt like I was pretty much going through the motions to keep the thing happening.

At college, looking back, I was the filler friend a lot of the time. I just didn't realize what other people's friendships were like, so I didn't notice it at the time. I was also mentally focused on trying to find romantic or sexual relationships, so it didn't register much with me to look for platonic relationships. 

The closest things that I can think of something happening in college were two things. The first one was that a friend told me that other girls there had described me as ""creepy"". I don't remember what that whole conversation was like, I remember she used other, more positive words to describe me that other girls have used to describe me, and it was more of an off-hand comment than something she pulled me aside to warn me about. When I reacted to being told I was described as creepy, she quickly backpedaled. She said something like ""I think they meant creepy in a good way?"" When I said there was no good way, she said ""I think they meant appearance?"" Later, when I asked her about that, she said she doesn't remember who said it or why. The other thing that I can think of is that I went on a date with one of my friends, and then afterwards, she clearly avoided me and ignored me. That pretty much triggered the first time I was truly depressed.

Really, what happened is me realizing how bad my social skills are and how way behind I am on them, if it's even possible for me to get better, not just an issue of me not being attractive to women or anxious about being creepy."

"High school can be like that because we're really just thrown into social interactions by chance: we get lumped into the same class... we get lumped into the same detention... we get lumped into the same sports teams. It's only really after high school that we realize that we were never really friends at all, just activity partners. Still, we were kids back then too... so it's not really fair to expect a more mature and holistic kind of emotional nurturing from that setting. What you said about ""we do activities together"" really struck me too because I think you'll find, perhaps in your own experience or in your observations, because you're very self-aware and aware of others' reactions to you, that much of adult relations revolve around superficial activity partners rather than actual connections.  


Alright, this is an important breakthrough, I feel. Being able to admit that it was mutual desperation that brought you together is huge- at least you don't have to pine for something that would never have been, right? Since you mentioned Tinder, are you on OLD platforms at all? I realize you said that you have two needs: romantic and sexual. Tinder caters to the sexual. Bumble and Hinge hold themselves to a somewhat more serious standard of looking for LTRs, FWBs or ENM. Even the latter two options still come with a basic kind of respect for the individual that you likely won't find on Tinder.  


In response to college, college is just as formative a time as high school. Sadly, it's really hard to reclaim the past. You certainly can't repeat the past. You can only devote yourself to the present with the hope of changing the future.  


Moving forward, there are a few things happening here. First your friend is very agreeable. She lied to your face when she said you were creepy ""but in a good way"". That is a lie. There is no such thing as good creepy. Good creepy is ""hot"". That's Twilight. That's 50 Shades of Grey. That's 365 (Netflix). That's every young adult dystopian romance with the tsundere guy being a borderline stalker. Women are agreeable by nature. And don't let anyone on Reddit fool you: they'll come at you hard with judgment and kick you in the balls... but women are people too. And people, under the aegis of anonymity, are often keyboard warriors. The fact that this friend of yours said she didn't remember who said it or why... just means she was protecting them. Agreeable people fear conflict more than anything in the world. That's why they lie: to avoid conflict. Unfortunately, it happened to **you**. A real friend would have told you the truth about yourself.   


The second part of my questions earlier was this: what are your goals? What are you doing now, in the present, to change this state? You clearly have the self-awareness (a much desired trait) and the observational skill that you can see your own dissonance with others. Now what is required is action: goals. I'd like to hear what you're working on in that regard, if you'd like to share."	CthulhusIntern	reply	na	na	na	0.999483585357666	no	strong	no	na	mmfb	failed
"My goal is to be socially fulfilled. I don't have enough of a frame of reference to even know what that would look like. What I'm doing currently about that is that I am going to therapy. As mentioned, I am also trying to go to support groups for desiring connection and community, as well as a 30s and 40s support group. But none of them are answering my calls or my emails. In addition to that, I am doing social activities, such as social dancing a few times a week. I enjoy the activities, but I don't feel myself getting fulfilling friendships in the same way most other people are. I can invite people to things I organize, but I just see everyone talking to each other, not so much to me. Yes, I'm aware a lot of adult friendships are just activity partners, but most people have more fulfilling conversations with others, right?

My therapist keeps giving me ideas for goals, which I do make genuine attempts at. But no matter how much I think about how to do them, putting them into practice seems basically impossible for reasons beyond my control. Like, if I need to talk to others, I always see everyone else just talking to other people already, and I shouldn’t interrupt them.

I've stopped taking OLD seriously at all. I hate it, and the more I use them, the more I'm convinced it's designed for people like me to fail at it so I pony up money and keep looking at ads and make them money."	CthulhusIntern	follow-up	na	na	na	0.999483585357666	no	strong	no	na	mmfb	failed
"You're absolutely right: people ought to have more fulfilling conversations and relationships beyond simply being activity partners for one another. But what is and what should be aren't always the same.  I think you have a very realistic goal and I think what that might look like is a place (physical or emotional) where you can share almost the entirety of who you are. I say almost because you also don't want to emotionally dump, you know? You can reveal yourself to others in increments. The key however is that you have to feel safe enough to do it and really see a real willingness on the part of your friend(s) to listen and reciprocate the sharing of those vulnerabilities. Sadly, as you said here, you're the one putting in all the work. You're the one taking the extra steps to be the glue in a very superficial social fabric of activity partners. I don't think that's fair to you... people just talking to each other, but not to you. I think you owe it to yourself to put your emotional needs first so that you can be the best friend, boyfriend, lover, etc. whatever form that may take... requires you to be whole.  


This makes me a little sad because it really shows that these people are not your friends. In any friend group, it should be a natural thing to just walk up and check in with one another. It's part of how relationships are kept going: we need to be constantly updating our ""stories"" to one another... always caught up in one another's story's progress, in a way. That's not to say you have to know every detail about every minute of their lives... but that's what ""catching up is""- it's a renewal of a vow of friendship: a way of saying that while we were busy, we're still willing to take some time to hear about one another's stories and growth. I think that if you feel you can't interrupt them, seeing as you are very observant, that's actually you picking up on their social cues that they do not want you to interrupt them... that you aren't welcome in their conversation.   
In short, you might think that you're the defective one... but in reality, it doesn't take much, just a little grace and kindness for them to open up the conversation to you as well. How hard is it... really... to just say, ""Hey, so-and-so, what about you? What's new with you?"" (since you mention you attend socials that are probably weekly/monthly). And just like they, they've included you. But they don't include you.  


With OLD; fair enough. It's a wasteland of despair for some... but other people have found some success or at least some ""practice"" there. I get it though.  
 So if you're going to focus on social groups/events, I just want to say one more thing: it really occurs to me that you're in a loop. In college, you were the filler friend. You were the guy who was talked over or talked around. Nothing's changed. You're attending social events: that's wonderful. You're getitng out of your comfort zone to do physical things like dancing: that's commendable. But they're still politely tolerating your presence rather than really being warm or open. You're still an awkward inconvenience to tolerate. I think you deserve more than that. Are there any other hobbies that you're truly passionate about that you can connect with people over? Your social dancing group, with respect, seems quite cliquis and, while they're happy to be the recipient of your polite and diligent efforts to socialize, organize and interact... I think we both can see that they just barely tolerate your presence. I don't think that's right.  


Just hear me out for a second...could you imagine, perhaps, a social group that's brought to together by shared passions that are so fervent that people are happy to talk about these interests/passions with anyone who shares them? Books? Movies? Comics? Intellectual properties? What I'm getitng at is, for example, an activity like dance, while it's a great place for extroverts or introverts who want to step out of their comfort zone, doesn't really invite much socialization after the event because it also has to be a safe and respectful place for both men and women. There's almost still an air of professionalism despite the warmth (though that warmth is not extended to you). What about a space or place where you can just hang out and chat for hours about say your favorite books?  


My final take on your current social situation is that while you are the largest contributing factor to your unhappiness (because action can only reliably come from you) it's clear to me that your social group is not interested in who you are as a person. You're convenient. You're the guy that organizes things that they just go to to eat/drink, etc. You're the guy they can count on to just do things for them while they have the fun. You're being used; I'm sorry to be so blunt but I feel as though you've been lied to alot out of politeness. If they were to actually get to know you... they'd have to actually care about who you are, what your hopes and dreams are, what your wants and needs are... and they'd actually have to do some real emotional labor to be a friend to you. But they don't. That's why they talk around you. That's why they talk over you. They don't want to be bothered. So if you take anything from this conversation, please consider this. Yes, you are the architect of your misery. But by staying in a group of people who don't even care to include you (when they can probably see your awkwardness)... you're just being a martyr.

"wtf are you supposed to do?

As a 60 year old woman, I found the tone of this post to be aggressive. There isn't room for a conversation. It is like you packaged up a huge block of your discontent and thrust it out before you.  But as somebody that others struggle to love, I hear and share your pain. 

In order to engage with you at all, I need to tackle love expectations, ""should"", giving up, ... that's just your title.  I'm already exhausted and none of those things are your actual problem.  You are demanding a lot from me just to be friendly. 

The things you list are common problems that people who are on the controlling side have, but wtf do I know?  There isn't any real information about you. I have no idea who you are. Only that everybody else is wrong and unfair.

I think the fact you don't really ask answerable questions and you couldn't hear somebody else that tried to engage with you are probably clues that you have a problem listening. Or maybe not listening but really being able to hear and make actionable others feedback. That's a hard skill to develop. 

But it is also a fixable problem and it never hurts to work on skills in this area. Maybe it will help.  I've read some books on listening to the mentally ill that helped me so much with normal people, but it means I don't really have a good book recommendation. But I bet there are a lot of resources out there that will be tuned to exactly like how you prefer to consume information.

"Man, I'm telling you now. In only 3 or 4 years, you will look back where you are now and have a freakout session where you think the exact same thing. ""What if I would've gotten started on X, Y, Z back then. I had more time!""

Rinse and repeat. You're always going to feel like that, but the main thing is that if you make something with the time now and take the reins to get this thing under control. Like /u/Offthepoint said, if it's debilitating you, then seek therapy, but staying stagnant and worrying about it is not a choice. Time only moves one way and you need to make the best of it.

I will say as you get older, you do become wiser. You gain a perspective you thought you'd never get. However, regret is something you can't go back on and you can only learn from. It's okay to grow up. Growing up doesn't mean you're not supposed to do certain things because they come off as childish. This is a great opportunity for you to take control of the situation.

Nostalgia is a very serious thing, so make sure to do hard things you don't want to do if you ultimately know it's for the greater good. You don't know what you want to do right now and that's fine. You don't really know a hobby or career you want to pursue, but you need to explore and push forward. You won't regret it in the future even if it sucks at the present.

"Into my 30s and I've found time rolls faster when I don't have unique experiences. Vacations feel like I can remember almost every day, as where if you asked me what I did today a month ago I'd be guessing. New memories make space, the same memories blur together.

Things have a way of settling out as you go.

"My mental health is spiraling; I'm grieving the loss of someone close to me; I'm drinking everyday to cope.

Because of my state, I'm struggling in school forgetting assignments and I can't drop out or fail. 

I feel overwhelmed and I don't know how much more I can take. I'm so exhausted and would like to go somewhere to rest for a while.

"Hey, if you're a girl, you should know that teenage boys can be somewhat dumb and emotionally immature. Girls mature faster than boys in many ways, so many of the things you're thinking/feeling most likely don't even occur to this boy. 

Highschool sweethearts are a thing, but I'd say it's exceptionally rare. Please don't lose tears and sleep over this boy - you're so young, and you have so many people to meet. The world is a huge place, so don't get saddled down so soon. 

If you're really serious about this boy, sit him down and talk to him and tell him how you're feeling, and what you expect from him and find out whether he feels the same way - the success of any relationship depends on good communication."

"If you have feelings, of course they're real. High school is a very intense and dynamic time, and some of the friends you make there will be important to you your whole life. The connections run deep.

But most people are changing so rapidly in HS, and are so inexperienced, that enduring romantic commitment is not likely. As others have mentioned -- the boys can be especially....well, selfish. The level of testosterone and lack of brain development (completes at 25!) has them in a condition that can unironically be compared to drug addiction or demonic possession. Or so it was for me, and it seems true of many others I have known.

Don't worry that this has to be The One, or you'll have nothing. That's not healthy for you or your relationship -- or true.  Your 20s will be better than your HS years, as you know yourself and what you need better, and as your peers mature into better partners. I personally wasn't ready to commit until 28, and left a trail of unhappy partners in my wake before that...and married my (she says happy!) wife of 19 years soon after.

You're going to be okay. Building a life you love, and connecting with people you love and are good at loving you back, takes decades. You'll get there.

Meanwhile, don't panic. If you feel like your current beau is slipping away, you might try asking if he wants some space or to take a break. Just know that teenage boys are often unreliable narrators of their own stories. It comes with the territory. But it gets better over the next 15 years or so. For the basically decent ones, anyway.

Best wishes. It gets better. And you're going to be okay."	No_Care_1132	reply	na	na	na	0.9975464940071106	weak	no	no	na	mmfb	no prediction.

Only because you asked for advice, I saw some of your other posts and it you are very talented with your crafts and jewelry making; have you tried to extend your marketing further than that? Social Media, Etsy, eBay, etc.?

I'm also happy to see you are keeping faith. That is a tremendous resource and you should be proud of yourself for having that. It's especially difficult to have that during hard times.

"Looking at your post history, the jewelry you make is well made with practice and care using good quality components. You have both talent and skill in this area, but as frustrating and genuinely awful as it is to say, none of this will give you an edge over the cheap mass-produced garbage that currently floods the market. This is clearly something that brings you joy and that you have a passion for, but for the vast majority of people that try, turning a passion into a source of income only leads to disappointment.

Are there other avenues of income that you could explore in order to build a base of stability, and then work on your art and your jewelry in your spare time from there? I know it seems like approaching it from that angle would detract from your time to work toward your artistic endeavors, but from the posts you've written lately, it sounds like you're being worn down from the stress and anxiety of never having enough money or resources. Bearing that level of stress is almost a full-time job in itself.

I've got another ticket for 3 hours from now, but I'm sobbing in the bathroom cause I hate that I missed it. How could I be so stupid??? Texting my mom and dad is not helping cause even though I know they are worried about me it seems like they think I'm ignorant and stupid. It is my first time in NYC, I'm 19(F). Homeless people keep approaching me in the bus station but I don't want to leave cause I don't want to risk missing it again.

"Okay so let me say this briefly:

1. Me and my ex had to breakup because they weren’t meeting my needs and had commitment issues. We broke up 4 months ago and they recently sent me a happy late bday text after 4 months of no contact. But a few days ago I blocked them because I don’t want them to try to lure back into my life. Btw I’ve been with my ex for a year.

2. Now, the ex friend I cut off was a huge pessimist and I couldn’t tolerate being friends with someone like that as an optimist. They also mainly talked about themselves so I couldn’t deal with it and subtly cut them off by saying I had to take a break from social media. Now what’s making me speculate it could be them is because they gave me a lot of mixed signals and once told me “I really wanna tell you something but I have feeling it will ruin our friendship” So after knowing each other for 2 months I would assume it’s that they like me romantically. Anyway, I blocked them everywhere.

My ex friend and ex partner are both blocked everywhere.


Since I can’t upload the screenshot here, basically last night I got a creepy obsessive message from an anonymous account on insta and this is the message they sent:

Anonymous: why did you block me on everything? i’ve been trying to look for you everywhere. i literally fell in love with you and thought we would go somewhere. i was fucking stupid

Me: who is this?


I didn’t want to assume on text who they are and I wanna see if they have the balls to tell me who they are and what’s their intention. What do you think?"	Expensive_Jacket_448	post	31.68079375135777	male	White	0.9987953901290894	na	na	na	3	mmfb	failed

"My strength to you. The true measurement of adultness is taking full responsibility for your own reality and the consequences of your actions and inactions.  You sound like you are already there. Congratulations!

I am sorry you are so boxed in. It sucks being better at adulting than the adults who are supposed to have your back.  I don't know the testing rules, but I have helped a few trapped teenagers find an arts camp to save the day. It doesn't have to be the arts, but there is a lot you can do.

Find every educational program, special summer, science, STEM, Space, paining, glass making, river clean up -- Any education program or environmental work party --- ANYTHING like that, especially if it is already interesting to you. And send in applications. Don't worry if you don't quite fit their program, yet. Like they could say you need to be 17, and you could just note that you don't meet this requirement but was hoping they could wave just that aspect because you would be so great a fit for their organization.  ""Fortune favors the bold"" is a cliche for a reason. 

Maybe one will come through at full scholarship! But either way you will win.

Even 100% rejections are lucky because this sets you up for relationships. However, you have to follow up. Really, a personal, detailed follow up appointment if you can get it. Ask for feedback.  Ask what things you can do this summer to set up next summer.  Ask if they know anybody who does this kind of training or if there is a retired expert that might help you as you help them. This training list becomes the curriculum for anything you study this summer.

And now you have an adult way to push back on your parents. You already have your summer school organized and prioritized and normalized. They should be very proud of you and offer to help you any way they can, but ... 

You sound like you have a good head on your shoulders. I know it would be so much easier if you could just go full adult now and have society recognize it. I hope you find that test! But if not, your best plan is to manage your parents before they try to manage you. Or at least that is what I found."

You look fine. I think the glasses aren't flattering to your face and bone structure, so I'd opt for bigger glasses but you look like a normal person.

You likely have body dysmorphia - Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD), or body dysmorphia, is a mental health condition where a person spends a lot of time worrying about flaws in their appearance. **These flaws are often unnoticeable to others.** People of any age can have BDD, but it's most common in teenagers and young adults. It affects both men and women.

There is absolutely nothing wrong with you. Societal views on what is attractive are a joke. If people are dicks to you, they might just be assholes. Most likely the case. If they then sense that you are self conscious about literally anything, that’s what they’ll hone in on. Find different people to associate with or tell them to piss off completely. I had years of self consciousness just because an ex who was mentally abusive figured out what I didn’t like about myself and used it as ammo in arguments saying no one would love me because of said thing. Do things you love, meet people in those circles, and life will get better. It makes me so upset that you would feel badly about yourself to this extent (of considering suicide) because of what you see in the mirror.

"I think you are very cute. I really hope you don’t harm yourself and that you learn to appreciate what you have. You are young and healthy and you can do anything.  I really think you are, by far, your own harshest critic. Please know that no one but you wants you to harm yourself. 

Please take the time to self-reflect.  Ask yourself what it is about your appearance that bothers you so. Then ask yourself why you are placing so much importance into your outer appearance. Isn’t the person you are on the inside what really matters?  Because before you know it, as you age all your peers’ bodies that you think are so perfect will deteriorate.  Eventually, we all wrinkle, our metabolisms slow and our waistlines expand.  Our hair thins and hairlines recede. And what we are left with is our personality, who we are. That’s what matters.

I really think you are a good looking dude and have a lot to live for. I know it can get rough and insecurities will absolutely eat you alive but you’ve just gotta try to embrace yourself at the end of the day and strive to live a happy life. I think therapy and some medications have the ability to help and I really really recommend talking to a therapist or psychiatrist before doing anything drastic and really trying to get some help.

You remind me of how I used to feel back when I was un-medicated. I was obsessively unkind to myself and felt worthless. You don't want to die though, you just want those feelings to stop but aren't sure how.

I really recommend seeing a doctor, and potentially trying an antidepressant if they deem that appropriate for you. Taking medication isn't an easy way out, nor will it fix you but it will help make things more tolerable and manageable. Just like a diabetic, you need insulin and while that helps you still have to be responsible for your own diet and health. Same goes for depression and other medications.

Sorry, I’m a photographer so that maybe seemed blunt I’m just saying it’s the best photo but not that it’s the only one I like. The second best one is where you’re pulling hair back.

That’s horrible to hear. All I can offer you is my opinion as a woman & photographer. I disagree with you, it truly is non issue. I’m married to a man with a similar hairline so I truly mean it.

"Haha, squinched. Like a mash up of squish and pinched? I’m stealing that. 

Anyway, I think I see what you’re getting at and to me, I’d say your proportions serve to make you look youthful in a good way. Seriously, it’s so jaded that this world have you in a tailspin of self loathing over looks and it’s even good looks. The world is so screwed up. 

If you type in cute boy facial proportions into google, your facial configuration comes up time & time again you seem to not appreciate what you have and that’s a real shame. Makes me sure that someone has told you to think this way, you’re comparing yourself to someone extremely different to yourself or depression is doing your thinking. I know the pain of the last one btw, I don’t say it lightly. 

Do you want to try a new look? Slick your hair back, wear a crisp white T-shirt and a dark navy & green shirt with a small pattern, maybe something Aztec. Get dark jeans and brown boots/shoes/trainers with a belt to match the fabric they are made of. Converse trainers would be my go to but whatever you’re comfortable with. 

I know this might sound strange but eat an apple as you’re walking. Try something new and refreshing without being wildly out of your comfort zone. I dunno, something about eating an apple on the go really peps me up. Find your thing. 

Go to the library (it’s free and has all sorts of people), take a drink with you, settle down and flip through some books. Go find a wall to sit on. Act like you’re waiting for someone but just sit there watching the world go by. 

Try any of this, see if you feel better because your mind needs a kick start into something. It’s playing tricks on you.

I’m still in school. In one of my classes, we’re talking about identity and masking, which is annoying to me. I’m in therapy, and it feels like they’re shoving identity and whatnot down our throats. It’s important for sure, but some of the assignments are uncomfortable, for lack of a better word. I’m one assignment we were supposed to provide examples of masks and what we are behind the mask, but what’s behind my mask isn’t any of this teacher’s business. She doesn’t need to know about my trauma, extensive analysis of everyone’s threat levels, constant communication with the voices in my head, etc., although I might open up about some of that if it were a one-on-one conversation with no risk of anyone else learning about it. I feel like there are a few teachers I would open up to. Funnily enough, the one at the top of that list isn’t even one of my teachers. I know her from a club I run. She thinks similarly to me in a few ways, we have similar personalities, etc., and I think we would be friends if there weren’t a student-teacher wall between it. I’ve always been more comfortable with adults than teenagers. You’d think in high school they would be more chill, but unfortunately that isn’t the case. I’m so exhausted from this week. My club is meeting tomorrow, so I’ll see that teacher. I’m worried being around her is going to cause a slip in the mask. I don’t know what the point of this post is.

"This is coming from somebody who had no mental health education in school but dropped out in part because of her mental health and the awkwardness of a teacher in 10th grade asking her to stay after class and saying “I always see you laughing and talking with all your friends and your face is so animated and smiling but your eyes are the saddest I’ve ever seen” wherein I did not feel “seen” but more “found out” and wondered why she couldn’t keep that to herself: Do not take this assignment as an opportunity to confide in this teacher.

The latest issues I’m dealing with are that my mother lashed out at me for setting a boundary with her and we’ve barely spoken in over a month (the full story is in my post history if you’re interested). 

Also, I was hospitalized about a month ago for stroke-like symptoms and my two brothers (17 and 18) didn’t bother reaching out to me until I was already discharged 3 days later. I’m very taken aback, and I spent my hospital stay depressed because of it. I haven’t confronted them about it yet. 

I also think I have a carpenter ant infestation in my room (I rent a room) all of a sudden and I’m scared my landlord will try to blame me for it. I don’t know how it happened because I never leave food out - it’s always sealed. Besides, the ants aren’t going anywhere near the food I keep in my room. Either way, it’s so disgusting and it just feels like another thing I have to deal with. 

I also have tons of health issues. I have acid reflux that has caused stomach irritation to the point where I’m at higher risk for stomach cancer, so I can’t eat the foods I love as much anymore. I have difficulty urinating which makes it hard to sleep. I am seeing doctors for both of those things. 

But now that means I have over $5k in medical debt. I have the money in my savings but if I pay it off it’ll mean I have no emergency fund. And with my toxic job and this job market, I need that. I have 6 months of savings right now. 

I started therapy yesterday. (I don’t know that I like this therapist, but that’s a different story.) I know psychological issues don’t get fixed overnight, but I don’t feel l can hold on much longer. 

I’m tired of life. I’m scared to try antidepressants though, because I’ve heard stories about them worsening suicidal thoughts, which I already have."	SistaSaline	post	29.443254995382286	female	White	0.999225378036499	na	na	na	14	mmfb	no prediction.
"I would recommend searching for another therapist while you go to this one just so you have the option. about anti depressants, I felt a lot of worry before using them and while it takes time to find the right one once you do things suck SO much less. make sure you bring your concern up with your current therapist.

as far as the ants go, you should have renters rights. find the free legal aid in your city or state, often at the local court and set up an appointment. you can also ask them about your manager telling your upper management what you brought up.

PLEASE don't kill your self. I know I'm just an internet stranger but I want you alive. yes, things DO get better even when it takes tome. you ARE loved.

PLEASE DO NOT KILL YOURSELF!!!!!!!!!! you will have a day where you are happy again and you will be glad you didn’t kill yourself! There is a reason you are here! Life sucks RIGHT NOW I believe you 100% but it will get better! All of the problems you are having are fixable, fairly easily. $5k debt is nothing. You will be able to pay that. Ants can be removed through pest control. Acid reflux Can be easily fixed through dietary and lifestyle changes. You may feel overwhelmed but these Can all be tackled one step at a time. Write a to do list of highest priority things, maybe take care of the ants first. Cut back on 1 thing that makes your reflux worse. Take care of your problems one by one, one debt payment at a time, even if it’s the minimum payment. You will start to realize how much CONTROL you have over your own life and situation.

"Well I have some good news for you. Almost every single case of depression is curable. The way you cure it is by identifying what is causing your depression and also changing your environment (get some sunlight and exercise and a normal sleep schedule). You have identified a number of factors that are negatively affecting you and are in therapy which is good. Now the next step is to realize that only YOU can improve your situation and take steps to solve your problems.

For the job, a lot of people are in the same boat as you. I applied to over 100 jobs my first year after college and that was with a degree in biology from a top 30 university. It’s hard. Get LinkedIn, go to a career counselor, and tailor your resume to include keywords from job descriptions. Make sure your resume highlights your skills, accomplishments, and experience, and use quantitative information in the bullet points in your experience section. Directly message hiring managers of jobs you want and ask them if they are available for a phone call to discuss the position.

As far as your family life goes, your therapist will help you more, but you need to be honest with yourself and determine if your entire family really is treating you badly for no reason or if there’s another story. If they really are treating you badly or disinterested in your life, you don’t have to be interested in theirs. Just find people who care about you and who you care about. It’s a two-way street. Use Meetup.com to find group activities to go to and meet new people or google your city/town and events. Good luck."	SistaSaline	reply	na	na	na	0.999225378036499	weak	no	no	na	mmfb	no prediction.

"I love that you’re pursuing a hobby!! That’s HUGE in my book! I’m a recovering benzodiazepine addict, I’ve been through rehab 4 times and the 4th time the counselors there, with almost extreme emphasis, told me to find a hobby. Something I can be passionate for.

Needless to say it was fucking TOUGH to find one. My hobby was drugs. Had *been* drugs as long as I can remember. I used to play RuneScape when I was 17.. I come to find out that a thing exists called Old School RuneScape. It’s exactly how it was in 2007, same shit graphics and everything lol.

I decided to use that as a fail safe hobby, something to fall back on if all fails. During my last rehab stint I had met a guy who crocheted. And his talent was off the charts. He made the beautiful stuffed animals. Most were actually Pokémon lol. 

So I put everything that I used to put into drugs into learning to crochet. At this point I would consider myself a master lol. Not even exaggerating- there aren’t many patterns that are too hard for me to figure out. My wife loves it. My family loves it. But most importantly, I love it.
Trust me on this- once you find something to be passionate about it will be a game changer! Try anything and everything hobby-wise until you find something you enjoy. 

Also, to me music is the greatest drug ever made. I love putting my headphones in before bed and lay there blasting music. In Flames, Taking Back Sunday, Blink-182.. try it out sometime.

Also have you ever seen a therapist? I feel like you should look into that and explain to a therapist what you explained to us in your post. Maybe you have ADHD and it could be treated. I’m sure they could explain things to you a lot better than I can😅 I hope things pick up for you and if you ever need a friend, that dude on Reddit (me🤦🏻‍♂️) is here to listen!

So I’ve never had a girlfriend, I hate it. I enjoy other aspects of life but I get down seeing all my friends have somebody. What’s wrong with me? Why do they have someone and I don’t? How come I have to suffer with this? I don’t get it, I wish I wasn’t different from them. I don’t care about fitting in, but they all get to enjoy this amazing (and apparently common) life experience and I’m stuck.

I DID talk to a girl. We weren’t ever officially dating but that’s what we had in mind. We both liked each other a lot, she was so special to me and I wanted to be with her more than anything. At this point, I don’t know nor care what happened, but she’s gone. I feel like it was my fault, I didn’t know what to do in a relationship and I think that scared her off.

We barely lasted two months (it was a little over 7 weeks). She left me in *November*. I still hate myself and the whole experience. She’s with some other guy now and I have to watch him be the luckiest guy in the world (from my eyes at least). I’m going insane, I keep thinking of memories of her and making up scenarios that never got to happen. This isn’t just some “learning experience” that I can look at and move on from. I can’t quit thinking about it. Why did this have to happen? I don’t wanna die, but I kinda feel like I’m in a burning building, and this is my only escape unless I want to just suffer."

When I was 17 I thought I was going to marry my high school sweetheart. Safe to say, I didn’t. I’m happily married to someone else and very happy! Oh man, if I could go back and talk to my 17 year old self. I really wish I could go back and tell myself not to focus so much in relationships and instead on being the best version of me and doing what I loved. There’s so much time for relationships and honestly, at 17, not very many of them have depth or staying power. You want a relationship of quality!!! Wait til you get to an age where both you and her can provide that for each other. I know it’s hard right now, but trust that you’ll get to your mid 20s and feel totally different looking back. I hear you that it’s a struggle and you feel stuck. And that’s really difficult to go through. It’s normal at your age to be comparing yourself to your peers. Just remember, your brain is actually still growing. All your emotions are super intense because of your neurological pathways right now - it will settle down but it feels really overwhelming right now.

"Like any real injury, it doesn’t just magically heal over night. You have to protect the injury and help it heal.

"So, firstly, almost every adult in the world has gone through rejection and heartbreak and come out the other side. So if you wait it out, you WILL move on from it eventually. It always sucks in the moment and feels like you will never get better, but over time, you do. 

Secondly, if you're feeling like you want to die just to resolve things, and it's been months already, it's probably time to get some help. Have you talked to someone older who you trust? Your dad? A coach? An older brother? A teacher? They might be able to suggest something that will help you get through this. 

If you have already talked to someone you know (or if you can't think of anyone), it might be time to check if your school offers free counselling. When talking to people you know doesn't help, that's when you call in the professionals. 

Also remember that sometimes the first person you talk to isn't the right person. It's ok to try someone else, as many times as you need to until you find the right person.

Actually, burning fat before you get tested, especially if its on a short notice, sounds intuitively correct but is actually not the right thing to do. THC is fat soluble, it STORES itself in fat. If you start burning all of your fat right before a drug test what you're essentially doing is releasing the THC stored in your fat cells into the bloodstream. You want to keep that THC stored until after the test, so I would NOT start working out like crazy right now if I were you.		reply	na	na	na	0.9968330264091492	no	no	no	na	mmfb	failed

"tw / mention of suicide thoughts

I've seen her 4 times so far, usually with a week or 2 between sessions. 

In that time, we have discussed a range of things going on in my present, past major trauma, as well as beginning to work on strategies to help me recover.

I felt like I was making good progress with my anxiety and depression while seeing her. There's been rocky patches, but overall I felt like I've been making progress. 

I've started doing the hobbies I love again, stopped resenting certain people as much, and made progress in planning things for my future. Not much, but considering I didn't plan to live after graduating high school, this is all major accomplishments for me.

But today, when I told her I hadn't made a schedule to follow yet, and couldn't think of any words to describe myself on the spot, what she said completely disregarded every bit of confidence I had in my recovery.

She said something about ""coming in each week just to talk about how you are"" and ""not going to make any progress"" if we keep that up. But that's not what we talk about each week at all? I really thought I was doing well but this really upset me and I immediately closed off. She's usually very nice, but this hurt.

I had also been wanting to explain myself, why these things are so difficult, but since she didn't ask me directly I couldn't share that information and it feels like she assumed I was lazy.

It's 1 am and I'm crying over this, I feel so stupid and like I'll never get better at all. My suicidal thoughts are making a presence again, and I can't see getting better as possible anymore."	Ok_Traffic3362	post	18.120652698024234	female	White	0.9993911981582642	na	na	na	2	mmfb	failed

I wholeheartedly agree with this comment. Your perspective is what matters most. Your therapist is there to guide you and motivate you on this journey and maybe she was too harsh towards you. I understand how it feels to shut down when you find yourself in an undesirable situation like you were receiving that feedback. A more productive response is to voice your concern when the time is appropriate which was the moment you received the feedback. In time you'll develop this skill. It's also a good idea to bring it up with her next time. You got this! Stay strong!	Ok_Traffic3362	reply	na	na	na	0.9993911981582642	weak	no	no	na	mmfb	failed

"Hi there, this post may be long so I apologize. Also, English is not my native language, so please excuse any grammar mistakes or typos.

I’m (20F) from a relatively conservative/religious/heavily-controlled country. That is all I will disclose. A few years ago, my family was able to land me a government based scholarship/sponsorship that will aid in paying for all my expenses whilst studying as well as providing me with a job upon finishing. I know I must consider myself lucky for this, however, I never wanted this and was heavily pressured into it as I knew there were going to be a lot of restrictions down the line in life. I am studying medicine in Scotland with the help of a scholarship that my home country government provided me with.

My partner (19M) of 4 years almost is from Canada. For a while, we did long distance and he visited me as often as possible here in Scotland. He is a wonderful human being, he is so sweet and wonderful and is my rock. I’m lucky :) I did not disclose this relationship to my family as I knew they would not approve of me dating (they believe in going straight for marriage lol). They also wouldn’t like that he is white and wasn’t from their same religion (I am agnostic, but they don’t know this either).

Last year, while I was visiting my home country, I told my mum (f46) about this relationship and she was very angry with me and threatened to take away my scholarship and not let me leave for Scotland again if I did not end this relationship (yes, she does have the power to do this). So, I said that I did that, even though I didn’t.

I went back to Scotland, and my relationship with my mom has improved significantly and we have been a lot closer, calling on the phone every day for a decent amount of time too. I can’t help but feel that this is only because she believes I am doing what she wants me to and am leading the life she wants.

Meanwhile, my partner has been living with me for a year, yay! It’s been lovely tbh. However, my family doesn’t know, and this could land me in a world of trouble and loss.

My partner and I have been looking into me moving to Canada (spoke to attorney, it is doable)with him and getting married (we both want this). I am currently able to go for that option, however that would sorta mean I would have to pull the rug from under my family last minute before traveling to Canada and saying, ‘hey, I have lied and been living with a man before marriage, and will be leaving you all for good’. They would also go in debt because of my scholarship, a significant amount and would have to pay it back gradually. I want to work my ass off in Canada and be able to pay all of this back, as I know it is my responsibilities.

But my mum will be so disappointed in me for lying again. I kept this because I was afraid they would intervene and I’d never be able to leave. I hate my home country and don’t like what I’m doing at university too, I just want to be free. I have a diploma and some training that could get me a job and my partner has a decent paying job he could do until I land on my feet and work too. He always says to me ‘you feel free to be a stay-at-home wife and I will spoil you, if that’s what you want’ haha, which is so sweet and funny but I want to work to support too and pay my family back. Also, my partner all his family are lovely to me and I met his mum and she treats me like her daughter oh my god :”) my partner says he will supprort me no matter what happens and stay with me

If I go back to my home country, my future gov employers will not even let me marry this man if I wanted to (yes, they have the power)

I love my mum with all my heart. She raised me and my sibling as a single mum and is now finally in a relationship that is happy again with her new husband. I know she loves me, a lot, but won’t support me in this as I would be going against customs and religion. I couldn’t give less of a shit about my other family members as they are all dysfunctional. But I love my mum and sibling. They are expecting me to go back to my country next month, which is when we may go to Canada instead.

They think I will be this amazing daughter and doctor, but I feel like a piece of shit for wanting a different lifestyle. For leading a double life and all.

My family will be shocked and disappointed. I mean what the fuck do I even say to my mum right before I travel ? I can’t say anything sooner as they might intervene with my plans.

My mum broke her back trying to get me this scholarship and trying to give us this life, she is such a loving person but I just wish she gave me more freedom to be human. She did her best. She is the strongest lady I know.

I know the noble thing to do would be to suck it up, finish school and be the doctor and daughter my family wants me to be. But I love my partner, he is my soulmate, truly.

My family did not even meet or give my partner a chance. Mum spoke to him ONLY one time on the phone, telling him to never talk to me again, and even then he made her laugh because he is so funny and sweet lol.

I want to be free. I want to get married. I want to be able to get a tattoo. I want my mum at my wedding. I want to open up my own bakery and work freely. I want my mum to be happy and proud of me

I truly don’t know what to do"	throwawayblah444	post	27.942253664632517	female	White	0.0019408100051805377	na	na	na	1	mmfb	failed
I don't blame you at all for feeling that way. You shouldn't feel bad, and you definitely should not make your life conform to what your mom wants just to make her happy. You would be miserable in the long run and be giving up on a better life and the love of your life, it sounds like. It will be hard for you and your mom if you move to Canada, but I think it will work out for the best. It sounds like your mom really loves you, and she will eventually accept your decisions, because she will want to be a part of your life and also when sees how happy you are she will realize you made the right choices. She will also be disappointed of course, but she'll get over it. You really will have a much better and freer life with more opportunities in Canada. Women are terribly oppressed in the middle east and basically second class citizens, which I'm sure you already know, and as an atheist the thought of living in a theistic state horrifies me (as an Agnostic I'm guessing you feel similarly). You deserve a better life then that. Good luck and I really hope everything works out for you!	throwawayblah444	reply	na	na	na	0.0019408100051805377	weak	no	no	na	mmfb	failed

"I met a girl recently. Girl A. She was everything I've ever hoped for-- smart, funny, attractive, attentive, affectionate, and loved me for me. We hit it off instantly, had amazing chemistry, and loved being around each other.

Then I met another girl, Girl B, who had many of the same characteristics of Girl A, but also had one crucial thing (at least it used to be crucial) that Girl A didn't have. I don't want to disclose what it was, but just know it was surface level and honestly a little ridiculous on my part to place such importance on it.

Anyway, despite knowing Girl A for longer, I decided to pursue things more strongly with Girl B. I didn't want to keep stringing Girl A along, but I didn't have the heart to tell her the truth, so I kind of disappeared while texting her sporadically with generic ""Hey, how are you? I'm good"" type of stuff. She knew something was up because I wasn't being nearly as affectionate and attentive as usual.

Then, eventually, at the behest of my best friend, I decided to tell Girl A the truth. When I called her, she felt a combination of relief that I was okay and happiness that we were talking again. She asked if we could see each other soon, and that's when, tearfully and painfully, I told her I met someone and that it's getting very serious.

I apologized profusely and said I hope she doesn't hate me. She cried and said she needs time.

Then, the part that's most fucked up, Girl B and I broke it off the very next day. I couldn't stop thinking about Girl A, and I realized I liked her more than Girl B.

Girl B had been kind of inattentive, and I just couldn't deal, and she thought I was being too needy, so we parted ways.

I desperately wanted to tell Girl A how big a mistake I made by throwing away what we had, and despite how it looks, this was not simply because of the breakup with Girl B. I truly had an epiphany that Girl A, not B, was the one for me.

I tried texting her, nothing. I called her, nothing. Facebook, nothing. Dating app we met on, nothing.

Yeah, I'm probably blocked. And deservedly so, in all likelihood. Doesn't make it hurt any less. Doesn't make me feel any less stupid or asshole-ish. Doesn't make me feel like my world is crumbling because I lost Girl A forever, and she was, I now realize, the best girl I've ever dated.

Listen. I know what I did was stupid. I know it was a dick move. I know that it was terrible. Please, please, please don't remind me of that. I'm fully aware.

I can't cope right now. I'll most likely never find a girl like Girl A again, and that feels devastating. I don't know how to deal with this."	RayAP19	post	15.057928747348567	male	White	0.9952855706214905	na	na	na	4	mmfb	no prediction.

"first of all, i might make some mistake, english isn't my first language.
i have family and friends that love me, but i still don't see myself comfortable around people. i love my family, and i am not in the best moment with my friends but i still love them.
i feel like if no one understood me, and i know it may sound like a teenager problem, but i've felt lonely and sad since a lot of time (specially since i was 14)
my therapist told me about the posibility to take antidepressants, but the tests i did were ok.
i dont feel bad about myself, i sometimes have problems with my appaerence and those things but the most of the time i am ok with it and i usually dont care about that, i think i am smart too., i think my problem is my head
it's hard to me to explain what i feel, i feel an empty space in my chest
i had suicidal thoughts, but thinking, reading and learning i realised i didn't need to suicide
i want to live, i feel like a corpse and i am tired of seeing ghosts
i am tired of talking to random people in the internet to not be bored, i need to live.

"The more I reach out to people these days the more I realize so many people are lonelier than you think. Recently I've felt the same. Have you heard of meetup.com? I'm sure there's some random meetups around your neighbourhood for you to check out. I'm sure there's something there that would peak your interest. Have you considered joining a sports league?

About a year ago my family and I moved to a new house and a ""nicer"" part of town. We had been living in our old house for a long time and I was so excited to move. The schools are better and the area is safer and I have been very happy with the move in general.

However, the house is big and I have three little kids and sometimes I just feel like I can't keep up with it all. We recently hired a house cleaner to come once a month and I am constantly trying to declutter and keep things organized, but I just never feel like we can get caught up with what needs to be done. I just feel like I am pretending to be that mom who has it all together and I'm just not. My husband is awesome and we take on everything together, but he works full time and I only work part time and I just feel like I should be able to get everything under control better than it is.

Recently, we got a letter from our HOA about putting a gazebo in our backyard. We didn't realize we needed approval before putting it there since it is not in the front yard and we have never lived in an HOA before. It was an honest mistake and it should be easy to fix, but based on the picture that was in the letter, I know our neighbors from behind our house must have taken a picture of it and turned us in. It just makes me feel like a failure and that it is proof that I don't deserve nice things because I don't know how to take care of them. It makes me feel exposed, like now my feeling of overwhelm must be obvious because even our neighbors have a problem with it.

I also feel guilty about feeling bad about this. It is such a first world problem and I know I should be grateful for everything I have. I just can't help feeling like I am just always going to be struggling to be ""good enough"" to some unspoken standard I have given to myself. It is not even like my friends or people I socialize with have it all together so I know this pressure is just coming from myself. I grew up in a house that was more like a model home and I hated the feeling of walking on eggshells because something wasn't clean enough. So I think I kind of rebelled against the obsessive neatness I group up with but it is still ingrained in me that the neatness of the house and yard is a reflection of my self-worth.

Anyway, if you have any words of encouragement or advice I would love to hear them. Thanks so much for reading. :)"	teacherturnedsahm	post	33.51402533693768	female	White	0.9955915808677673	na	na	na	4	mmfb	no prediction.
"First and foremost: take a deep breath momma, you're doing great, and you are enough, exactly as you are.

Second: HOAs are notoriously douchey and full of people who will find any reason to complain. I live in a small town and there's no HOA, but we have some old broad who literally walks around town with a clipboard to make notes and complain to the town about every thing from cars parked in the back alley driveway without a valid plate, to the grass being 21cm (20cm is the town's limit). Some people are just miserable and love to drag down others with them.  I don't have any advice for the HOA beyond being honest about never being part of an HOA before, and trying to reach a compromise.

Third: check out organization systems like the Home Edit or NEAT. Consider hiring someone to help you get organized. You're allowed to have clutter and a lived-in space, but it helps if you have a defined place for everything, as well as the right storage solutions for it all, and get the kids involved in putting things back where they should go when they're done. Turn it into a game if you have to.

"First off, I can’t see how a gazebo would bother your neighbors or be an HOA violation. I absolutely hate when you buy a house, yet you still have to answer to people of the neighborhood about what you do on YOUR property. It’s ridiculous. As long as your grass isn’t knee high or trash isn’t piled up in your yard, I do not see the problem. 

Secondly, give yourself a little bit of a break. You may only work “part time” but you are also a full time mother to 3 little ones. That would be overwhelming for anyone. Im sure you are doing a great job and things will get easier. Let yourself live a little. I know it’s easier said than done. Don’t make your kids go through what you had to and walk on eggshells as you did when you were younger. You are a family, your house is suppose to be lived in, not put on display.

"Really sorry to hear what you're going through. It sounds like you're going through one of those ""when it rains it pours"" kind of moments. In my experience, life is full of a lot of unpleasant stuff, and what makes it even tougher is that it's not evenly distributed across time. You can go through a period when everything is great (but sometimes you don't notice or appreciate it simply because it is so good.) And then you can through a week where everything bad seems to happen. 

But, I'd argue that life is improving. The very fact that you notice that everything seems to be going wrong right now implies that normally everything isn't this f'd up, you know?

You're strong enough to get through this, even if you don't feel like it right now. I think it's great you've been praying.

"Have you ever stopped to think about how your beliefs shape your life? From our political views to our religious convictions, our belief system influences how we perceive the world around us and the decisions we make.

Our beliefs can be formed from a variety of sources, including our upbringing, education, and life experiences. They can be positive or negative, and they can shape our attitudes, behaviors, and emotions.

For example, if you believe that success is achieved through hard work and perseverance, you may be more likely to put in extra effort and persist through challenges. On the other hand, if you believe that success is largely due to luck or connections, you may be less likely to try as hard or take risks.

In some cases, our beliefs can even have physical effects on our bodies. Studies have shown that positive beliefs and attitudes can have a beneficial impact on our health and well-being, while negative beliefs and attitudes can have the opposite effect.

So, it's important to be aware of our belief system and how it influences our thoughts and actions.

"So basically I had shared my life story to another subreddit, only to be met with harsh words and just generally rude comments. I wasn’t looking for advice on what to do, just sharing my life story, but people insisted that they knew what’s best and criticized my life choices like they knew every aspect of it (but I guess I can’t expect anything more, this is Reddit after all).

Basically the TL:DR of my life is that I (22) was given up as a baby, with an open adoption (which means at some point the biological family is open to meeting the child) after my biological parents had an extramarital affair. I wasn’t aware of my adoption till someone spilled the beans at age 17.

Anyways, later on in life I started to decline in mental health, starting with Situational depression that morphed into Schizophrenia with OCD by the time I was 19 (however, even though I was given this diagnosis my psychiatrist still doesn’t know exactly what I have since I don’t fit cleanly into the diagnosis and she pushed me to reach out to my biological parents for information). I was hesitant, but I agreed, since no medications was working for me and my doctor was banking on them to tell me what I have.

I found my biological mother (let’s call her Jane) online and I messaged her, first angrily (cause who wouldn’t be after what has transpired?), but then I apologized, and she accepted it. I told her I just needed my mental health history, but she insisted that she and my siblings on her side wanted to see me, she also gave me my biological father’s children’s info (cause he (let’s call him John) is in hiding from his children, since he doesn’t want the responsibility). She knew John’s number, but she refused to give me it because “it wouldn’t be right”. (I should also note that John was taking this time to flirt with her, just a total piece of crap).

Anyways, I contacted them, and long story short, they all denied having any mental illnesses and were pretty much unhelpful (although I was able to get some info out of them that implies that they did have some mental illnesses on John’s side of the family) even though I told them how important it was to get this information (to this day my psychiatrist if frustrated with me that I couldn’t get a clean answer from them. She has told me “I don’t know what to do with you”).

Along with being unhelpful, Jane’s side of the family kept promising to meet me, telling me they missed me and leading me on for a whole year. After they had forgotten my birthday , something Jane said was “a life changing day” for her, I cut contact with them, saying that their words were fake.

During my 22 years of existing, Jane did not tell her mother that I existed. Because I thought it was unfair to my biological grandmother (and for petty revenge as well) I wrote a letter to her telling her everything that Jane did. However, I have reason to believe that the letter was intercepted by Jane, since after I wrote it my brother verbally attacked me for “disrespecting” her, and a letter was sent to me, that deflected all blame from her. I have reason to also believe that the letter was feigned. 

5 months after I sent the letter, I was talking to my therapist (who is a psychologist) and she recommended I send another letter. So as of yesterday, I sent another letter to her (this time with restricted certified mail), but after this I’m going to leave it alone.

I feel like I have to come to terms with being alone. I (16m) feel like I won't get into a relationship for a while. I'm good friends with everyone at school, but recently I feel like that's all I'm going to be, a friend. Someone to lean on. I've tried to get into relationships but they've all flopped.

Several things about this, but mainly, you are probably not the only person this guy has scammed, so it is unlikely that he will figure out it was you. Even if he does, he has to have known this would be a strong possibility by scamming someone. Scammers usually will just make another account and move on to the next victim, so there really isn't any need to worry about someone tracking you down or anything.

The people around me that I talk to treat me like I'm ugly, so if everyone treated me as ugly I figure it must be the case.

I got with my ex when I was 21, and she was my first everything. Since we broke up I haven't met a single person that has shown any interest in me romantically whatsoever. I've misinterpreted kindness as interest once or twice but they made it very clear they weren't attracted to me at all when we talked more.

I'm 23, just about 24. I don't see a path for things getting better, they just keep getting worse no matter what I do or what I try. I can't deal with people treating me like I'm worthless and disgusting anymore, but the only explanation that makes sense after trying to improve is that I am worthless and I am disgusting. I don't understand why, when I look in the mirror I don't see someone disgusting. I think I'm a fun person to be around. I do my best to be genuine, caring, funny. I keep myself informed.

The only thing I could change is becoming someone I am not for the sake of appeasing other people, and I have no interest in that. I want people to like me for who I am, not change myself to appeal to others. But nobody likes who I am, they get bored or annoyed when I talk to them, they take no interest in getting to know me, and they look at me like I'm a Gremlin. I've tried meeting new people and it's just worse. The only people that give me any time of day is because I've known them so long they feel obligated to tolerate me, and I've given them no reason to completely cut me off.	skdeelk	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9994682669639587	no	strong	no	na	mmfb	no prediction.
"I felt the same way about my friends when I first started getting depressed without realizing it. My world felt so dull and gray and I felt like my friends didn't like me and were annoyed by it - I misread every potentially negative sign I could.

I get the same way still when I'm off my meds. It couldn't be further from the truth... when my friends are upset with me, it's because they care about me enough to be frustrated for not spending enough time with them or prioritizing something over them."	skdeelk	reply	na	na	na	0.9994682669639587	no	strong	no	na	mmfb	no prediction.
"Me and a friend of mine have recently started collecting Pop Mart figures. I just placed an order (granted one of them was a gift and another was an order for a friend who will pay me back), but I was suddenly hit with disgust towards myself for spending money on such a pointless thing. It makes me so happy to have them and display them, and I know people collect far more than I do and my collection is small, but I feel so bad. Spending money on things I enjoy has been something I've restricted for years, and now that I'm an adult and buying things I like, I feel awful. I can't help but think how my parents who are struggling with money would feel if they knew I was buying all these. 

I just want reassurance that it's okay, or any tips to not feel so bad."	Ok_Traffic3362	post	16.176153292004884	female	White	0.9992864727973938	na	na	na	4	mmfb	no prediction.
"Sorry to hear that you're going through this. These feelings are real. And anything to do with money is often really difficult, just because it ties with with our greatest hopes and our greatest fears. 

Ultimately, I guess I'd say that earning and saving money isn't really worth doing unless you can spend it in a way that makes you happy. Money exists to bring us happiness. So in that sense, I'd say that it's completely okay and even necessary to use money in a way that makes you happy, whether that's Pop Mart figures or whatever else.

You mention that your parents are struggling with money, and it seems you feel guilty for spending on collectibles when they're hard up. That's a real feeling. Maybe theres a way to hack your Pop Mart hobby to kill two birds with one stone. What if every time you bought a Pop Mart figure, you used the amount of money you spent on it to do something nice for your parents? A one-for-me, one-for-you type situation?

"I 35f can totally relate. I feel like I never really had a ""best friend"" and it can be a lonely feeling. One of my former friends did the same exact thing you described here and it was so frustrating. She started becoming best friends with someone she met through me and then pretty much ghosted me. I remember deciding I was going to stop trying to reach out and wait for her to and she just never did. It was sad, but the older I get the more I tell myself that it's not worth my energy worrying about. I know that is a lot easier said than done. 

I had a weird experience a couple of years ago where I made a new friend and she was really into spending time together and I was excited. We have kids similar in ages and our husbands got along. We even went on a trip together. But the more I got to know her the more I realized she was a little bit toxic. It felt strange because I was so happy to have a friend that seemed excited to spend time with me and I was always her first choice, but I started to see that she was draining me. Long story short, I started to create some boundaries, which I think was for the best. Then a few months later she moved on to a new girl in our friend group and I felt so jealous that they were doing everything together even though I knew that being so close to this person wasn't for the best. 

We are still friends, but it is just a different type of relationship. She's the type that always had to be busy and I am not. Anyway, I guess the point of the story is that the grass isn't always greener. When the question, Who is your best friend? comes up, my first thought is always my husband. I'm happy I have him but I still feel a little sad that I don't have a ""bestie."" I have good friends, but not the same type of relationship I feel like we imagine having.

I'm not sure if that makes you feel better, but I hope you knw that you are not alone in feeling this way and never feel like you aren't good enough.

I've been depressed for such a long time, but lately it's been absolutely crippling. I'm not able to get off the couch and can't force myself to do anything except get high and play video games. I have important things I have to get done, and no matter what I try, I just can't make myself do them. I quite literally have laid on the couch/in bed all day today. I didn't even walk my dog, just quickly let him outside. I'm finishing grad school 2 weeks from today and feel like I've really failed myself while I've been here. Everyone else seems to have made great groups of friends, and I've been so depressed that i wasn't able to keep the ones I did make. I'm lonely and in so much pain.

"I know how this feels, and can genuinely say it'll get better!

My teenage years were stolen by depression. I wasn't able to hold a friendship or do simple tasks, I lost all joy in the activities that used to make me happy, I had no hobbies, and did nothing but lay in bed all day on my phone. In my final year of high school my only goal was graduating, so I put no effort into my classes and took so many days off.

But still, I graduated. I did well. And I realized once I was finished with school, I'm the only one that can get myself out of this. I went to the doctor and got prescribed medication for my anxiety and depression, and have started therapy. I know that might not be accessible for you right now depending on where you live, but it's helped a lot.

I'm still not better, but I need to give it time and effort. Most days I'm still in bed on my phone, but I've been going out with friends more. I started reading again! I picked up new hobbies, and my average mood is starting to lift.

I have been in your shoes and know how crushingly difficult everything is for you right now. But hang in there and things will get better. It's not easy by any means, but it's possible.

Baby steps is the most important thing. Any progress is progress, and it's best to base it around where your at and not compare to where others are. If your room being dirty is something that upsets you, maybe you could work on that?

"Most immediate thing you could do is clean your room. The act of cleaning may help take your mind off of life for a while, and the sight of a clean room might motivate you. Another immediate thing you can do is begin putting out job applications.

Something as small as just making your bed when you wake up can also be a strong motivator. It may not sound like it, but it's something that *you* accomplished. Something *you* did that looks gorgeous. Start by making your bed, maybe cleaning off your desk/workspace/shelves or something, then sit down and go to some job boards and put some applications out. Take a break from that, look around, and figure out where you want to clean next. Rinse and repeat, and eventually you'll have employers calling to follow up AND a cleaner room that brings some semblance of pride.

Sure, the getting a job thing will take longer than it will to clean your room, once you get a job you can start saving up to get your own apartment and car. In terms of friends, figure out what you are into, then hang out where like-minded people would hang out. You'll make some friends in no time! But for the love of all, don't end your own life.

My (32F) bf (34M) and I have been together for over three years. For the last 8 month we have been apart 3 months  at a time due to me going away for school. After coming home for a break I found some explicit messages that my bf had been sending to his ex. Upon confronting him he first got very defensive and then proceeded to tell me that it was difficult being away from me and I never had time to sext him. Which is true unfortunately I’ve been very busy with grad school. The kicker is this is a girl I have had issues with since we started dating. She obviously has had feelings for him and he continued to have a relationship with her despite how I felt about it. He said it happened twice. Once was before I even left but he was gone for 3 weeks for work. I feel like an idiot for staying with him and am not sure if I can forgive him.

"As someone who has been through something similar I know how conflicting it can be. On one hand you have invested heavily for years into someone you trusted. On the other hand, he has betrayed your trust at least 2 times.

For an outsider this decision is easy. He cheated and you should dump him. But because you have so many emotions involved you might be making excuses for his behavior in an attempt to fix something that he broke. That's a very normal response to a sucky situation.

First, I need you to know it is not your fault. You are not responsible for his actions. Period. He chose to disrespect you and your relationship multiple times. If the distance was too much he could have communicated that and ended the relationship. Instead he wanted to have his cake and eat it too.

Second, do you truly want to continue to be with him knowing what he has done and what he's capable of doing again? Even in a perfect world where he reforms and never cheats again, could you ever truly trust him? Are you ok with living with the weight of that betrayal forever if you decide to stay? 

Beyond that, what are your reasons for staying? Sunk cost fallacy? Worry about 'running out of time'? Worry that you'll never find someone else? I'm not saying these are necessarily your reasons, but I know they were some of mine when I went through it. Do your reasons have more to do with wanting him as a person or do you want the comfort of a stable relationship? If the answer is the latter...I think you know what your decision should be. 

Most importantly, do you think he still deserves you after what he's done? Should he be rewarded with your continued support and loyalty?

You're young and educated. You're in the middle of building your life. There are many good people you have yet to meet. I personally think you deserve better. I think there is MUCH better out there for you. Men who would be loyal to you. Men who don't talk to their exs ever. Men who take responsibility for their own dicks. Don't let some loser hold you back from meeting someone worth your while.

I obviously can't tell you what to do. But if you do decide to leave him (which I think is the right decision) you should tell your loved ones what he's done. This will help keep you from going back. The embarrassment of having to tell my mom or my best friend I was crawling back to someone they HATE kept me from doing it. 

I'm not saying the road doesn't suck...heartbreak always hurts. But there will come a point down the line where the sadness will fade and you'll think to yourself 'I can't believe I wasted my energy on that loser. I can't believe I did that charity work.' And that realization will be simultaneously painful and cathartic. 

Regardless of your decision, I wish you the very best. You deserve healing and kindness. I truly hope you don't let this man take your happiness from you.

"Hey, MMFB —

I can't stop thinking about the fact that no one really loves anyone. And about how the things that we call love in our daily lives are so much different than the ideal types of love we write in novels and watch on television. 

I think that all our human relationships are too complicated to equate to that thing called love. We fight, we hold simmering resentment, we have jealousy and selfish desires and alterior motivations, we misunderstand and think too much of ourselves. Most of all, our minds are too complicated. I think our minds are sort of like prisons, and we're all trapped in our own personal one, with no way to let light in or out passed the bars. If anyone has ever read Their Eyes Were Watching God, I think it's all sort of like that passage about the diamonds in the mud, decimated by the angels. We humans — and indeed, probably all forms of life — have our inner shine, and we try to show it, but we're all just too lost in the ocean of mud, and we can't sparkle where anyone can see, or see the light refracted off of anyone else. I feel deeply hopeless when I think about it. The whole idea of love is just an exercise in futility. We hold up love as this modonna, something we should all pursue and aspire to...and it may not even be biologically, physically possible to love or be loved. 

The love we are taught to want is unselfish, untainted, and unconditional. But can any of us say that we have experienced a love like this? I certainly can't, even among people who I say I love when asked, who I love in what is probably the best way that I am biologically capable of. Can any of us really, in good faith, call ourselves capable of giving a love like this? In good faith, I cannot say this of myself.

Anyway, thanks for reading my rant. Drop your thoughts below of you feel compelled to do so; I'd be interested to read them.

"If you learn love from books and movies you're gonna have a bad time. 

Imo love is one of the very few real things. Love can take many forms and last for a short while or a lifetime. Just because it's not forever doesn't mean it's not love. Just because it ended badly doesn't mean it wasn't love. Love can be unconditional or selfless, but it can also be selfish and conditional. It can be short lived or eternal, it could be for yourself, for others, for books, for music, for food, for nature, for your pets for literally everything.

"You could think of it that way. But if you want to feel better, you can turn that thought around on its head:

We know other people are deeply flawed and imperfect. You might even go so far as to say no one deserves to be loved, in the sense that there is nothing a person can ever do to be entitled to being loved, that it can't be earned. And yet, people still choose to give their love, even to us imperfect people who don't deserve it. There is generosity in that.

And like, I'm not saying anyone should choose to be religious, but the notion that people can be undeserving and yet be given love anyway is so profound that some religious thinkers call it 'grace' and make it a pillar of their faith."

"Hiya,

I am a late 90s kid who's married, no kids, a house, and so many ""toys"" it might be unhealthy lol. I've been struggling with anxiety and depression my whole life but more recently I have gained control over it.

The last couple of weeks my first (serious) girlfriend from high school, like 13 years ago, kept popping up into my head. They are not unpleasant thoughts but also aren't sexual or anything either. More like memory  or something. Even though these are not bad memories I am happy with my life and life choices so I really don't want these reoccurring thoughts.

I felt like a fool looking up why this is happening or whatever. But my first ""feeling"" I got was, this person might be in trouble or something. But I fought the urge to reach out because it didn't seem right, or maybe it was me being selfish in feeling someone needed me.

But I resisted, and fought with it for a couple days then it went away. Then a week or so later, doing nothing meaningful it just happened again, out of the blue. Tried looking into it again and found articles on like esp and stuff where if someone's thinking about you hard enough they can f*ck with your thoughts and stuff. Idk.

"I work in an industry with multiple departments and share an office with 2 others from the same department. 

Long story short - I've had trouble with a colleague that's controlling, manipulative and aggressive in her manner. I'm not the only one that's had this experience with her and she's been reported to management 3 times but she's got most other staff members and our department manager wrapped around her finger so nothing ever came of it. 

Upper management have made comments about how well I've handled my workload on multiple occasions. My colleague has made it known that she's struggling. 

A position came up in the department that I'm most interested in and I decided to apply (with a strong nudge from the department manager of said position). I knew my colleague was also interested in that position but she didn't apply. Because of this, I was encouraged to tell my colleague that I did apply just so it didn't look like a betrayal, so I did. 

I was led to believe that the position was basically mine, I was the department managers top pick, but they had to advertise to allow others an opportunity and that upper management would have the final say. I've just caught wind that they've interviewed a much more experienced person in this position. From what I've heard, I'm pretty sure I'm not getting this new position after all.

I'm devastated and terrified to be given the bad news, but mostly, I'm dreading having to tell my colleague that I didn't get it. I know she will be smug and it'll likely make things even worse in my current position.

Update:
I got the job 😆 My colleague was super salty to me but my new office is great and the best part is, it's nowhere near my old department and has a door to close out all the negativity 💜"	Wtf-am-i-doing22	post	30.253784929082116	female	White	0.005523405037820339	na	na	na	3	mmfb	no prediction.
Been where you are. I think the universe sprinkles these toxic people around because if they were all in one place, they'd just kill each other! That said, access the strong part of yourself and get ready for whatever way this shakes out. Make your peace with her reaction ahead of time. Oh, she's going to be a smug you-know-what when the news hits? How predictable. Find a way to let her reaction roll right off of you. Listen, though you have to work close to this person, don't let it be that they run your life. Have another goal set up in case you don't get this. Always have a plan B running adjacent to what you want, OP. That's how I got through my career and it worked well for me. Good luck with this!

"Every single thing which i think of ends up happening the total opposite of what i thought. Even the things which i was sure of and things which i saw or did a hundred times. And this is making me worried because i think a LOT about my future. I plan a lot about my future and i fantasize a lot about achieving my goals. I do it 15 hours a day and have done it for 3 years and i am not kidding. 

I have one main goal in mind. In 2019 i made several plans to achieve that goal but all those failed. Then in 2020 i made a bigger and better plan which also failed even before starting. Then again in 2021,2022 and 2023, each time, i made better and more practicals plans which would help me achieve my goal easily but each better plan failed in a way worse than before. My recent and best plan just failed last night severely and so badly that i got physically hurt a lot. 


All this is seriously worrying me if i am even meant to achieve my dreams or not. When i first found out about my talents i realized this isnt something which most people have. I felt so proud and worthy. But now that all my plans to achieve my goals with this talent are failing i am wondering if i am meant to just end up becoming what my parents wish which also means lifelong insults from every relative and my parents. I am really anxious bcoz i think about my future each and every second and anything i think of doesnt end up in that way at all. 

Please someone tell me if it happens to a lot of people. Are all those people successful? Have they achieved their dreams?

My family and I have a summer outing this weekend, and I've been planning to wear a two-piece bikini. However, I'm feeling hesitant about it because I'm a bit overweight and have a chubby belly. I tried on the swimsuit a week or two ago, and when I looked at myself in the mirror, I started to second-guess my decision. I even looked up beach photos and poses for chubby girls to try and find ways to hide my belly and stretch marks. While I'm excited to wear the bikini, I'm struggling to find the courage and confidence to do so.	kitsesss	post	21.30947907895122	female	White	0.9817882776260376	na	na	na	9	mmfb	no prediction.

"This is the first class I've ever failed (well, currently a 74 so it's pretty close to a non-passing grade).

With a quarter of the semester remaining, I finally found a textbook that clicks with my brain. I finally understand what I'm supposed to do. It's too late to pull this grade up so I've registered to retake this class next semester, but it sucks to hit the eureka stage so late.

My first textbook (the one on the syllabus) was just a mindfuck of concepts and explanations with no big picture, confusing examples, no reason as to why you should do this and avoid doing that, etc.

I thought something was wrong with me, or that I wasn't built for organic chemistry, but it turns out that it was just a matter of changing the source of my learning.

Feels bad, but at least there's hope?"		post	8.53838179206236	male	White	0.9988104104995728	na	na	na	5	mmfb	no prediction.
"This class is intended to weed out many pre-med students as well as teach the subject. All across most US campuses, the class has a reputation for being hard. 

It’s been many years since college, but I can still hear all of my friends complain about that class. They got test scores in the 50’s and they were pretty good students (B+ students). They were always studying but never got it. Out of maybe 6 or 7 people i knew personally who did pre med and took the class, only 2 continued pre-med after that class. One became a doctor and one became a optomitrist.

I never took the class, bc I was not a science major, but that speaks to the fact how hard it is (I only know about this course bc it’s hard)

I also flunked out of a class (poor attendance) in college and vowed to never let that happen bc of attendance. You’ve also learned something valuable here as well—the ability to look at the issue again, not blame yourself, and evaluate other viable options. Next time you run into trouble, you can use this experience to keep your self doubts to a minimum and get back to figuring out the issue. But most importantly, it sounds like you understand the material.

Some closing comments:
1. Is it early enough to drop the course? This will result in better gpa bc you wont recieve a grade. The class will just be dropped.
2. Do you need to take another course in the future to meet graduation reqs? I had to take 6 classes (instesd of the five standrd) so i could complete all my credits for the major. I had to take 6 bc i droped a class so technically i took 4 courses that semester. I double majored so to make up for a slot that i had to drop, i had to make up for it. Your course this semester and next will be duplicate, so make sure you can take all your classes to graduate. 
3. What score do you need to get to pass? Calculate what you need to get on all your remaining assignments, tests and finals. College classes usually weigh tests and the final pretty heavily so i feel like you can bring that 74 to at least a B which im assuming is a passing grade. If on another country’s sclae, not sure. But it’s important that you know (for a fact) that the class is over for you. Calculate it based on the sylabus. If you dont know how your 74 is made, ask for a breakdown. Perhaps in a office hour, you can show ur prof that you are learning and improving and just trying to see how hard you have to work to pass. Everyone loves a tryer and a hardworker and i don’t think its too last minute to show this. 

4. This will not be your hardest class or challenge in life, but you figured this one out! While not the ideal solution, you solved it by looking at other books, researching, not giving up, wanting to improve, and wanting to understand the topic. These are really great persoanlity traits that will get you far."		reply	na	na	na	0.9988104104995728	no	strong	no	na	mmfb	no prediction.
"u/smallboxers, you just made my month with that response. It's really comforting to know I'm not the only one, and that things don't end here.

My uni has an academic forgiveness policy which offers three chances during your undergraduate studies to retake a course with either a W (withdraw) or a grade of C- or lower. The new grade replaces the original one on your transcript.
  

  
The advisor mentioned that if I take physics during the summer, I'll be on track, so that's my plan. 

As for Ochem, given my professor's notoriously insane final exam, I'm not very optimistic about getting that to a B. I might have to take the L and start fresh with this course.
  

  
By the way, if you were in my shoes, would you withdraw from the course now (knowing you'll retake it) or complete it to get a feel for the final exam (still assuming you'll retake the course)?

"I would take it til the end. If the final is cumulative, youll have a chance to preview the material for next year, and perhaps questions on finals will repeat next year. If it’s going to stress you out alot though, just take the L, regroup and go for it. If you’re behind in other classes bc you had to invest so much into orgo, maybe drop it. If you’ll end up not treating like a real class (not go or not pay attention) bc you know you wont get a grade, i’d drop it (a bad look for u).

I (f17) and my (f16) ex-best friend let's call her Sam haven't spoken to eachother in almost 3 years since a falling out that was 100% my fault. I have 2 classes with Sam this year and we both sit at the same tables in each class (assigned) Sam is very rude to me which I understand but later found out she's been saying I'm a racist & homophobic bigot behind my back to some of my close friends. To clarify, there was a time in my life shortly before our falling out where I was homophobic and I unfortunately didn't take the news that she was lesbian to well. I was brought up in a home that taught me being gay was a sin. I've changed as a person since and really want people to know that. I don't necessarily want to be friends with her because it was a toxic friendship but I dont want her to hate me. What can I do to make my situation better and show people I'm not any of those horrible things and that I have in fact changed? She doesn't want to have a conversation with me anymore even if I go to apologize for my past. I feel horrible for making her feel bad but now it seems as if I have no way to change it.

"I'd it were me, I'd say something like ""could I please get just a minute of your time to say something.""

If she says no, I'd try ""we were friends for a long time. Is just one minute really too much to ask?""

Assuming one of these two gets some kind of positive response, have your spiel ready. Start by apologizing for what happened and take full responsibility for it. Don't try to sugar coat it, and don't ask for forgiveness. Don't try to deflect any blame by talking about how you were raised. 

Then say that you really believe you learned something from it and that you know how wrong you were and no longer feel the same way. 

Finally, tell her that you don't expect to be forgiven or even to be friends again, but ask if there's anything you could ever do to make amends. 

Either way, even if you don't get the chance to say all that, get on with life and be the best ally you can be to LGBTQ people of every stripe. Call out homophobia when you see it. Call out bullying when you see it, and step up to intervene if necessary. Make it a point to befriend any LGBTQ people you know. Join a support group at your school if there is one. Participate in pride events. Show people through your words and deeds that you unequivocally support the LGBTQ community, vocally and without reservation. 

Maybe do all that first, then try to talk to her."	JennaBear14	reply	na	na	na	0.9981136322021484	weak	strong	no	na	mmfb	no prediction.

"(First of all i want to say I have ADHD and that this post is a mess and is probably going to contradict itself but that's basically what this is.) I really want to love someone but it seems that i cant or at least never have felt attraction to anybody, I also want to feel as if someone cares about me but that is also the thing i hate most, I always hear people talking about how good love is but i cant understand those feelings, the only kind of care I have ever felt is thinking i like hanging out with my friends and the care i feel for my family and pets, i always see things about ""matches made in heaven"" or people who are just made for each other, So now everyday i think how does it feel and is it worth it and is there anyone out there who would care about me? For more context I am proud of my body and that doesn't affect any of these views nothing physical its all in my head i think.

So the main thing I  want to know is how can I tell if i ever feel love?

Thank you.

(edit)

Another part of this is I start to feel empty and blank for lack of better terms when i think about love it just feels like i need something it doesn't make sense really and this feeling is only sometimes."

"There was a guy I had classes with at uni and he was just such a nice person. When I normally wanted to become friends with somebody I would try to make a conversation and with this guy I would feel a bit flustered and even had to force back some blushing. Couldn’t even hold a good conversation. 

And I knew I was interested in something more than friendship. So some weeks later, there was a party, and I had taken a few beers, he had as well, and I saw him looking at me in a certain way, so I asked him if he wanted to kiss and we did. 

I cuddled with him that evening and it was really nice. 

But I discovered he was also a bit immature and held some (to me) strange views and although he had a lot of potential he turned out not to be really the type of person I was looking for. So I just kinda lost interest when the image in my head didn’t fit reality.

But it did open up my eyes and I’ve been more interested in other experiences ever since.

I have another friend who is now also 25 started dating the second guy at 24yo. She had been liking for two years during which she really slowly began to grow more interested. They started talking more, going on walks, and kissed. They went on a few dates, but in the end he was the one to lose interest, so that was a bit sad. (The first guy she was interested in went back to his ex-girlfriend after a few dates so that quickly became nothing)

Hope this helps you a bit. You might or you might not develop romantic feelings for somebody. And I knew it immediately when I felt something for this guy, while my friend really slowly grew more interested. Everybody is different. 

Oh, one other story. My grandparents have two aromantic friends who decided to have a child together and raise it/them remotely from each other. But then they decided to move in with each other to become sorta housemates who also had and raised a child together. Their son is 26 now and the two of them still live together happily, just as housemates who really care for each other. You can find somebody to care for and who’ll care for you without a neccecarily sexual attraction too."	Shallows_s	reply	na	na	na	0.05066870152950287	no	strong	no	na	mmfb	no prediction.
Ive been taking Spanish for the past 3 years and I recently got a bad grade on something and it cause my grade to drop to a c which is still passing but my mom will get mad at me if I have a c on anything because that’s “barely passing”, and I understand that logic but there are SOO many kids in my grade that are failing and are just trying to pass. Meanwhile I’m stressing about a 76 which is only my 4 points away from a b but it’s also 4 points to low for my mom. I also have 2 other c’s in 2 other classes, so I have 3 total c’s rn and I’m beating myself up so bad. I feel like a failure. The end of the year is coming soon and if I have a c anywhere on my report card I’m NEVER gonna hear the end of it. I hate being dumb I really wish I was smarter. I try and try but it’s never enough. I’m still young but idk I’m still really upset and I’ve been crying cause I’m so disappointed in myself. My older sister made like really really good grades in school and only got a c once and this would be my like 3rd time bringing home a c and I just look like such a disappointment and failure compared to her. I’m so upset and angry at myself. I wish school came easy. I hope things somehow get better before the last day of school which is in slightly over a month. I’ve spent my whole 4 day weekend working on school and nothing is enough. A 15 year old girl shouldn’t be stressing about this to tears but I am. I hope things start looking up soon.

Im sorry you feel like that. Let me tell you a story. When I was in your age, I was an ok student, I was good in what I was interested in and not very good in certain subjects. Math was one of the pain points, because during my early high school years one of my teachers told me, that as a girl I should accept Im not good in maths. Surprise, my grades went down quickly to C level. I was A and B in literature, history, art, chemistry, etc. But languages were not easy, because the level of education was quite low in my country that time. I hated German for example and I was a C during the entire 4 years. I was just not interested in. English was another topic, my teacher told to my mother that I will never be capable of speaking English, because I don’t have the skills to learn languages. I got so mad at her that we hired a private teacher and after a year I put down to her table my exam results and I didn’t have to attend anymore to her class. My mom was usually upset about my grades, especially because 6 months before my final graduation I failed in German. I told her to calm down, because I am handling the situation, it happened because I always hated that language and I will be okay. She made it very hard for me cause she was panicking all the time that year. Fast forward I finished high school in time, I got to a university of my choice I got my diploma, even though I had a pretty rough year when I almost get kicked out of it. Im 34 now and this is my second career path that Im successful in and I don’t even remember my high school grades. It will be okay, you are enough and you don’t have to be perfect in everything, focus on your strengths and develop them further. You should not feel as a failure because you are not! You are very stressed and that doesn’t help with your performance and your mother should understand that. If not, then you should empathise with yourself to accept that you don’t have to be perfect you are good enough. When my mom stresses me out I always ask her: would you like to understand me and help me? If yes please don’t do it in this way because it’s stressful and this is what I need instead.

"In 2019 I got a new job that moved me across the country to the Midwest where my wife and I don’t know a single soul.

Since then, finding opportunities to meet people have been scarce. And when I do try, it doesn’t result in anything.

I tried for a few years to get people to meet at a skatepark in the area regularly through Facebook groups. People used to respond, and even show up once in a while. But now, nobody even responds anymore.

I’ll text people directly, and it always ends in “I’ll have to get back to you when I am open!” Or something like that.

I don’t attend or have any desire to attend any kind of church. That is what I often hear suggested from people.

I cannot find literally any meetup kind of group that is operating for my interests. And I’m not in a remote area. I’m near a decently big city.

I’m married, so not interested in meeting people by dating. And we get along and spend time together, but I would like to speak to more than just my wife.

I guess I’m just not sure what else to try. Where to go. What to do.

"It’s okay and normal to be tired and a little sad sometimes “without a reason”. 

Especially nowadays when social media presents versions of people’s lives where everything is great all of the time. 

Humans need rest and slow days, and days that are just a day. Not a good day or a bad day, just a day. 

My go-to when I feel these days isn’t to try to cheer myself up , because that takes a lot of energy; but rather to get cozy. 

Do some light stretching / yoga and then have a nice shower or bath. 

Put on your favourite cozy clothes. 

Make some snacks / comfort foods and snuggle up with a book or a Studio Ghibli movie. 

Maybe go for a stroll outside if the weather is nice. 

Every day doesn’t have to be wild and exciting to be good; humans need their quiet cozy calm days; you don’t need to earn rest. It’s inherently part of what type of creature we are. It’s not a want it’s a need so get cozy in your favourite ways .

"I was in a similar situation during the last recession. I had zoomed up the career ladder pretty quickly after college and so when I was laid off, I was competing with people with many years of experience on me for the same roles and was comparatively underqualified. But nobody would consider me for lower-responsibility roles because I was too overqualified. I was in a no-win situation, overqualified yet underqualified, so I noped out of my old industry and went to grad school. Fast forward seven years and now I’m making triple what I did in my previous career.

At the time it sent me into a massive depression. Now, kind of like Scarlett O’Hara swearing that she’ll never be hungry again, now that I have a good thing going in a recession proof and layoff proof job, I have absolutely no plans to retire or even to change jobs.

"Hey there. I'm sorry that you're struggling with this. Finding a job can be a frustrating experience where you might face a lot of rejection. I know it's hard not to take it personal, but still that's exactly what you have to do. If you don't get a job, that doesn't mean there's something wrong with you. It just means that the employer went with a different candidate.

By the way, I think it's really awesome that you sent 400 job applications in only two months. That shows you're really committed to finding a new position. Don't give up on yourself. If you keep at it and keep pushing, it will one day pay off. It only takes one employer to say yes.

That said, perhaps you could tell a bit more about what kind of jobs you're applying for and what you're doing in the application process. Perhaps there are things you can do in your application to improve your chances of getting an interview (if that's the problem), or improve your chances of converting an interview into a job.

"So this is all about a girl I know/knew. Let’s call her Amy.  I’ll tell you the shortest version I can of a long story. Hopefully you can give me some advice or at least confirm my diagnosis. 
I met her online last September.  She was 17. I’m older. We became friends. I was clear about that. We chatted by text every day for six weeks.  
I learned that she was from a very poor background.  She told me she suffered emotional and physical abuse from her parents and older brother. Amy said she  was in uncomfortable in social situations.  She had been denied access to school since the age of 14. She said she often went hungry. She just stayed in her room, did housework and cooked at home. She said she wanted to die many times. She admitted to previous suicide attempts. She tried to take her life once in the six weeks we talked. 
Amy focused on leaving home when she was 18. We talked about where she would go. I suggested my city as a better option than the capital. She mentioned a few times how people told her she should just go to the big city and become a sex worker, because that was her only realistic option.  
One day she told me she was coming to my city, leaving home and getting on a bus for four hours. I tried to persuade her to wait. She was adamant. She’d found a job, and a place to stay,  in a karaoke bar (basically as a hostess with an end of day option to be a prostitute). 
I intervened. I got her a room and she found a normal job.  In the next six weeks Amy had five jobs, being fired or quitting but quickly finding something new. She took some pills and slept for three days.  She sold her virginity online.  She went on holiday with a man when she had no money. 
We had an argument. She quit her job, left her room and found another karaoke bar to take her. Amy decided to leave for the big city. I tried very hard to stop her. 
I had become convinced she had bipolar disorder.  The first time I met her she was distracted and aloof. All her behaviour after that was contrary to how she seemed when we chatted online.  On her last day she agreed to let me take her to see a psychiatrist. We weren’t able to do it.  
After she arrived in the big city we argued more and she became distant. On her 18th birthday she went to work in a brothel. She always said that the old Amy was dead. That she is a whore.  That no one could be a whore like her.
 
I feel guilty. I failed to help her. 
Is she bipolar?
Will she go back to the old Amy? (It’s been five months). 
What can I do to help now?

That's a lot to take in. First of all, stop for a second and aknowledge all you did for her and how you really cared and still care. Her life isn't yours to live, her decisions isn't yours to make. You did your very best and as a stranger I'm proud of you. Many would give up at the first minimum awkwardness that comes sometimes with tough backgrounds like hers. I feel very sorry for her struggle, and her way of coping with it, taking in this stereotype people set up for her. Maybe she feels like she isn't worth of something better. About your diagnosis, I'm afraid I don't have sufficient information or knowledge to confirm or deny that. Fyi I study psychology, but still. Bipolar fits, and so does major depression. You didn't mention hallucinations or delusions and she seems like she can formulate her emotions into ideas and express them just fine like she talked to you about for weeks. But please, don't blame yourself. Don't stop your life either. Keep going. I'm here, if you need anything.	wwwdth	reply	na	na	na	0.9548171162605286	weak	no	no	na	mmfb	no prediction.
"Hi. Just to be clear, if you are not a mental health professional you cannot diagnose her. Nobody can confirm your diagnosis online, not even a mental health professional (which I am)

Is it possible she is bipolar? Certainly it is possible. From what you said about her background it sounds like there is trauma which is affecting her with, or without, a biologically based brain illness like bipolar.

Even a mental health professional cannot diagnose her without interviewing her, ideally several times over the course of months. They would have to ask about all of her symptoms including long standing sleep/wake patterns to confirm or rule out something like bipolar. 

On to your actions: You did everything you could. It is understandable you feel bad as the result does not seem like a good outcome to you. (To me either or to most people) However it sounds like she followed through on her own plans, however wrongheaded they seem to you or me or anybody else. 

It is impossible for anybody to know now what she will do in the future and whether or not she will revert to acting like the Amy you knew again.

The hard part is accepting that you do not have control in this situation. You cannot control the outcome. You cannot force, create, or will a good outcome for her. She makes her own choices, even if they seem wrong. 

You are good and kind. You are also taking too much on your own shoulders.

Maintain your loving kindness. Let go of the unrealistic burden on yourself. 

We do what we can. We do not get to arrange best outcomes. As a mental health professional, and as a survivor of family members who had significant mental health issues, I have had to accept this long ago."	wwwdth	reply	na	na	na	0.9548171162605286	weak	no	strong	na	mmfb	no prediction.
"Another possible factor is substance use. 

You mentioned her taking pills and I don't know if that was a suicide attempt or simply substance abuse.

In the world of substance use recovery, there is an important concept known as ""loving detachment"" Look that up and read a bit about it, see how it could apply to your situation. A number of bits of wisdom from the recovery world are completely valid in the world of mental health recovery or in just regular life.

If you do feel your friend is suicidal, make sure she has the hotline number 988 and also look up mobile crisis services in your area. Make sure she and you have the number on hand. Do not be afraid to call even if it makes her mad. 

You can encourage her to seek mental health treatment or other community resources if she maintains touch with you.

Remember, none of this is your fault and you cannot control outcomes.

I just wanted to offer information that can help you if something comes up.

Additionally, seeking therapy yourself to cope with the feelings of stress and loss is a very good idea for you."	wwwdth	reply	na	na	na	0.9548171162605286	no	no	no	na	mmfb	no prediction.

I feel like shit. Am I really unattractive? Is there something I’m doing wrong? 7 years of using dating apps, a handful of dates, but no girlfriend.

"There are people who are never meant to find a girlfriend/boyfriend - and you are not one of them. I am one of those people - by intentional, clear, and natural choice. I have never had an interest in being in a relationship.

If you have interest - then you are not one of the people like me.

I only know two things for damned positive.

1. It's not your looks. Do the best you can with what you have, take a little pride in your clothing choices and self-care - and move on.
2. It could be everything else. Most likely you ARE doing something wrong, it could be one of these:

a. As an assumed man, you are told to be the pursuer. I'm going to tell you that that is not the truth in this society, but it was  - last century. Now....you are to be pursued. It's the women who pursue (or....a better word would be ""follow"") now, and they don't do it like men do.

b. In dates or in your search, every new woman you meet, you start pursuing right out of the gate, assuming relationship first as your goal. This is scaring women away instantly....by the first 10 mins! Those vibes you're giving off....we feel those more strongly as our survival as a woman counts on it.

There's really only a handful of things you need to do.

1. Have a decent job that can provide. This is a biological requirement for women, not gold-digging. ""Can he make enough to support kids?"" is written into our GENETIC CODE. And sometimes, us women will set that to the side as long as the man is working towards some sort of bright future. That? That's what get women into trouble if the man fails, flails, and spirals - and when kids are involved, leaving gets a lot harder! So to have a better chance of attracting a woman naturally - have your career track sorted.
2. Have you started making a nest territory yet? (AKA do you own a condo or house or some property for which to defend and allow a nest to be built?) I mean, if you're homeless-  that isn't exactly making women flock to you. This isn't just about kids - this is about having a safe place and being a person she can count on to provide safety. Again, this is internal code. A man isn't anywhere near attractive until he is stable and able to provide. Even if he is Top A In The Looks Department - we will usually run away from a man that doesn't have their shit together...at least stable women do.
3. You're already doing this one, but just making it known lightly that you are single, unattached, and open to a relationship \*\*without forcing relationships as the first line in a conversation\*\* is good! Once in conversation to close friends. Let them spread the word.Now....be a human and go meet people, women, anyone, friends, family friends, friends of friends of friends....and just go have a good time! Bring something to the party (beer, a dish you made...a gift for the birthday kiddo, whatever appropriate for the event - always put thought into it.) Bring good conversation. Fun stories to have when conversation pauses. No expectations of finding a girlfriend! Make friends...who are women. Go out with them as Friends. Make sure they get home safe...that's about it. No. Expectations.

Watch for the signals. And when one is standing closer to you, asking to go out more with just you, approach the topic with a very gentle, no expectations but clear sentence. ""Are you interested in dating, or just remaining friends? Either is absolutely fine with me.""

Safe men with their shit sorted and no expectations...get dates and girlfriends."	Wxmike94	reply	na	na	na	0.9988588094711304	weak	strong	no	na	mmfb	no prediction.
"So this is a bit of a doozy, but I feel like I don't have anyone to talk to about this particular issue. 

Last year was probably the most challenging year of my life because I dealt with a horrible bout of depression. Thankfully I got help and have become more content and confident. 

WITH THAT BEING SAID, I still have this issue: I know that deep down I want to fall in love and be loved. But the idea of being ""intimate"" with other people makes me feel exhausted due to horrible experiences I've had in the past. Sex has given me nothing but emotional and sometimes even physical pain. A lot of times it left me feeling empty like it was something that was done to me instead of it being something I shared with another person. But the thing is that I know that I'm not asexual, at least not entirely. I've just found that I can't even enjoy fantasizing/dreaming about intimacy anymore because I'll be reminded of these past experiences and it just leaves me in such a dark place.

What's more is that after discovering I was bisexual, I felt relieved because I felt like there was a way I could start over again. Now that I know I'm attracted to women, I could try and be with women and maybe have better experiences. At the same time, I'm afraid of going out there and continuing to be disappointed, which I know is inevitable. Therefore, I end up continuing to not pursue any romantic or sexual relationships with others. 

As fucked up as this may sound, I'm clinging to the hope that maybe being with women will make me happier, but I don't go out and experiment because I don't want to be proven wrong because I'm afraid that will push me back down into that dark hole that I worked so hard to get out of last year.

Since fighting my way out of that depression, I've had a much better relationship with myself. But I guess my question is how does one even get to the point where they feel like they can let other people back in emotionally and physically when you don't think you can handle that pain again? 

Again, I know what I've posted is a bit of a doozy and I hope it's not confusing. I would just like some guidance, maybe words of encouragement, anything really. I'm tired lol."	RebeccaArgento	post	17.707581689096244	male	White	0.9946847558021545	na	na	na	8	mmfb	no prediction.

"All I have to say about that is that... that's okay.

If the idea is intimacy makes you feel badly right now, that's alright. You don't have to be intimate with anyone right now. I understand that you want to be loved - we all do - but that can happen in due time.

Your anxiety over intimacy will probably fade over time, at least a little, and sooner or later you will probably meet someone that you're comfortable enough with to hug them. Then it goes from there. 

I know what it is like to feel like you will think of past, hurtful events whenever you think of being intimate with someone. Those feelings may or may not ever fully go away, but they will weaken and you will at some point realise that other people aren't that one guy.

For now, just be. It's okay. Nobody is forcing you to do anything and you can find love in a year from now, or two years, or five. Take it slow and fully at your own pace.

Now let us talk about him. 

Every woman should read at least the first chapter of this book: \_Why Does He Do That?: Inside the Minds of Angry and Controlling Men\_ by Lundy Bancroft. It's available free if you search.  Spoiler Alert: men like your x act this way because it works out great for them.  

They do not think like us. They do not prioritize the things we prioritize. They do not care about deceiving us. There are people out there that will never take off their masks, but enjoy hurting others.  People like us always need to keep this in mind.

&#x200B;

And maybe he wasn't that bad, but I'm worried about your trajectory. How he treated you isn't OK. How he responded wasn't respectful of you. I worry that how you are thinking about all of this is more along the lines of a trauma-bond than love, but I can't know that.

"Reading the first paragraph made me cry. Thank you so much. Reading the second has me unsure if i should mention I'm a man as well. Started my relationship with my relationship with my partner who initially was dishonest about his gender identity with me and over time she became them and then he. And as difficult as it was i still fought and put my needs aside and stayed. 
As for how I'm thinking, i swap between: He's right, i deserved it; to I can't do this, waking up hurts every morning and I dont want to keep opening my eyes just to cry; to I'm deeply sad and hurt but ive made a life for myself and i should be proud im pushing on.
At the beggining of our relationship it started as love then his baggage came out and there was definitely some trauma Bonding because then mine came out and then we got through that and kept loving each other. But now he's changed and i keep wondering if maybe i did really fuck it up. He cheated on me and i wanted desperately to salvage us so I don't know how he can see a reason to give up.

Help, how do I get passed this.  I was showing my Manager pictures on my phone and a picture of a job posting came up.  I’m pretty sure my Manager saw it.   I feel so guilty, I had to ask for leave work early because I couldn’t concentrate.  She did not ask me about it but I’m worried she will ask when I’m back in the office with her.  I’m trying to shake it off but it’s so hard.  She’s one of the best Managers I’ve had in a long time.  What if she treats me differently now?  I was just seeing what my options were, now I feel I messed it all up.  Not sure how to get past this.  I’m looking for any advice right now.  I feel so sick about this.

It's perfectly normal to look for other jobs. Nothing to be ashamed of. It's nice to be friends with your boss or manager, but your life is your own. If she asks you about it, it should be ok to talk about your interests and ambitions. Maybe she can even provide it and you didn't know.

It also may work in your favor so don’t get too stressed. When you’re a good worker, and you sound like you are, management wants to keep good workers like you so she’ll make more of an effort to keep you around and not lose you. Who knows, you might even get a raise. But if by chance she does pull you aside and asks you if you’re looking for a new job, be honest and tell her why. If she can do more for you she will.

Legally there's nothing she can do to you for looking for a new job, but if you aren't seriously looking and she brings it up, you can tell her you were sending the screenshot to a friend that's been searching for a job and just forgot to delete the screenshot. Otherwise, just be honest and tell her how you feel. So long as your work performance isn't suffering and you quit the job with a two week notice, I'm sure nothing will come with it.

"I had all of this happen to me just yesterday and I really wish to vent a little and find out if this was a good behaviour for a psychologist, a specialist who should be trained to work with people of poor mental health.

So I was waiting for an opportunity to go to a psychologist at my clinic for quite some time and yesterday that day finally came. However I'm not sure if the work with her will improve my mental health at all. I basically start a conversation by saying that the doctor prescribed me psychotherapy and all I get is a very condescending reply of ""well, you are not at university lectures"", please tell me your problems. And that's not even the biggest thing that's triggering me. The first place award for this just has to be the victim blaming when I start to tell her about the trauma that caused my depression. Because according to her, all the bullying I went through at school was en my fault and it's always the victim the one who's guilty, when getting bullied because they do not meet the criteria set by the kids that bully and don't know how to react properly. Furthermore, a child should not feel insulted when they're told they're fat if they're actually fat, because it's true. Hello? Am I in some terrorist organisation where it's fully ok to kill and beat others for not conforming to one specific ideology or beauty standard? I understand that low self esteem, sensitive personality and social anxiety can be a catalyser in a chemical reaction but does that make a child deserving of being called horrible names and sent death threats to? To fully illustrate the conversations I had with her, here's an illustration how most of our conversation went:

*Me, traumatized by a lifetime of bullying, naturally having developed severe social anxiety and fear of being judged, wanting to get rid of these problems, therefore signing up for therapy with professionals instead of blaming my past unsuccesses on random people or indulging in alcoholism: (Psychologist's words will be in bold).*

**- So you did not manage to find any friends throughout your entire childhood?**

\- Well, yes, that's simply the way it went for me.

**- I'm afraid that's all your fault. Maybe your lack of social skills and personality are to blame** *(despite literally seeing me for the very first time and not knowing anything about me as a person)*

**- Why should anyone feel insulted when they're told that they're fat when they actually are? Look, imagine children in school are looking for their next target, and they have their eyes on a fat girl and then start to bully her. However she reacts in a way that does not allow bullying to repeat on her again and shines through other areas, communicates well, and shows good sense of humor. Then the kids simply move on to the next target.**

\- Okay, what if I simply don't pay attention to the bad comments about me nor show any emotions when they're directly said to me?

**- Well, if a child does it so autistically, kids will then tear him down and that's gonna be his fault. See some people have a bad body language and others simply do not wanna be friends with them. It's all about the way you react**

*So in other words: a child goes to school and the evaluation committee of social skills called school bullies examines each child's social skills and attractiveness. If a bully sees a bit of a different person, then they start to call them horrible names. Then they rate how a the target reacts and responds to it before deciding whether a child is a worthy target. Pfew, examination passed for some. Unfortunately, some aren't so well and don't fit in to bully's criteria and then start to get psychologically tortured beaten, and have rumors spread about them. This is a sign of he needs to develop his social skills and know how to respond to violence better. In conclusion, you must lick some hooligan's ass in order to be fully accepted as a human being. Is it common to think like this nowadays? Is it normal for a grown adult, that has a job of communicating with traumatized people in 21st century?*

**- I will not believe that everyone in your class were hooligans, barbarians and very bad people in general. You can always find people like that in every school but you're fully free to find an introverted, shy person who's just like you.**

*Yes, majority of people weren't barbarians and bullies, however the thing is, the majority were sadly ass lickers, enjoyers of the torture I had to go through and believers of all the rumours spread about me just to win social points, who are absolutely no better then the torturers themselves.*

As you can see she very clearly perpetuates the idea that if the majority abuses you, you always are a very horrible person and that the herd will be always give you right signs. However if you look at the history, the majority of society was definitely not always fucking right. Medieval times, when innocent women were accused of being witches, and tortured alive in a fire, the public surely enjoyed it, but is that although society's or the person's problem? When black people were enslaved, jews killed, LGBT tortured, was that the victim's fault?

I refuse to believe that victims of mobbing and bullying by the entire class are at their own faults. I felt very hurt and invalidated when the psychologist blamed me for the bullying I experienced. Such psychologists might drive some to suicide and I have to do something. What kind of so called specialists are working and my clinic? Is that normal? I think not. For a therapy specialist this is fucking insane... What do you think I should do?"	Decent_Background_42	post	19.102310710787727	female	White	0.9994124174118042	na	na	na	4	mmfb	no prediction.
"This conversation sounds made up dude. ""I will not believe that everyone in your class were hooligans, barbarians, and very bad people"" seriously? No one (besides you) talks like that.

"No, I don't think this is normal or okay for her to say to you. She was absolutely shitty, unprofessional, and doing a ton of victim-blaming. ""Well just ignore the bullies and they'll magically stop. Oh, you did ignore them? Well, you must have ignored them wrong,"" is absolutely terrible advice. Actually, it's not even advice, since you're not asking how to deal with bullying in the present but rather wanting to talk about the trauma it caused - it's just being cruel for no reason.

Since she won't say it, I will: it's not your fault that you were bullied and traumatised. You are a human being and deserve to be treated with kindness, regardless of your weight or whether you're autistic or not. It's also not your fault that someone who was supposed to help you talked to you like this. I think that if you possibly can, you should ask to see a different psychologist, because this one sounds as if she is going to do very little to actually help you."

Now my best friend of 8 years will be leaving soon, my dog and copilot, my great Dane Maggie. She was diagnosed with cancer last month and they said she'd have up to four months before the cancer stopped breathing or heart function. I'm being greedy, I know, but I don't want her to go, I can't handle her going. She's all I've had left. She needs help getting up and I have to hold her when she uses the bathroom. She can hardly stand on her three legs as her back right has a huge tumor and back left has a plate in it. She's been taking pain meds that zonk her out and I know she's in there somewhere and I just want to pull her out and hold her.

3 weeks ago, I had mid-semester exams. I was suffering from headaches and allergic reactions the day before the exam. I thought it was a seasonal reaction and ignored it. Except, it got worse at night and I couldn't sleep until 6 a.m the next morning. I fell asleep, my roommate had left early and I woke up after the exam had finished. Soon after realizing that, I got medical prescriptions from the medical centre. Then, I applied for a make-up request on the online portal, stating my reasons and attaching the prescription as proof. For 3 weeks, there was no word from his end. Then, recently, the professor sent a mail to all make-up applicants saying that a hard copy of the application should be presented, along with proof(also saying that prescriptions are not sufficient). So, I visited the doctor this morning, requesting him to write a medical report stating that I was unfit on the day of the exam. The doctor vehemently refused, stating that sleeping through the exam is not a valid reason to be considered for make-up. So, my only choice is to have a word with the professor. I could have lied about my illness, and exaggerated it, but I couldn't find a reasonable lie. And now, if the request is not approved, I'll get an F grade. I have an internship due next month.

Ok, that’s not completely true because I have family, but none of my friends never really text me or anything. We’ll send eachother shit on instagram but not much conversation. Also I’ve never had a girlfriend and I feel shitty about it. I’ve had a thing with one girl and it only lasted a little under 2 months before she left. I’m not even completely sure what I did. It’s made me feel even more hopeless than before. I’m scared of being alone forever but I’m also scared of talking to people. From my experience they don’t really care for what I have to say, or they’re talking about something that doesn’t interest me, like baseball. Any girl I talk to probably thinks I’m some disgusting creep, I don’t think anyone feels safe around me. All my friends have found someone. Sure, they might not be with them forever, but when they do break up they just get another person later. That girl I mentioned earlier left me in November and I’m still alone. She’s already found another guy and I have to watch them be together. She’s leaving after this year so that won’t be a problem for much longer but it’s still a problem. Idk what to do, I hate large social groups, I never know what to say to anyone. People are almost always talking about sports or some stupid drama. Am I too smart for them? Nah, that’s narcissistic.

That means that you can do that! People love to talk about themselves so why not become a good listener? You don't have to have the same interests as them to be a good listener.

You need to remove yourself from that situation. Toxcitity is infectious and it's growing on you. I had an abusive father and I don't call him my father anymore. I started hitting him back and he called the cops on me, I moved out and I was so mad but looking back on it it was the best thing he ever did for me. Don't let it get to that.

"First-time poster and Reddit-user here: 

I am not normally the type to use social media of any kind, but my life recently has been extremely hard, and I've reached a place where I feel like I have no one I can turn to. My last hope are strangers on the internet. I could really use some words of advice or comfort, especially from anyone who has struggled with their mental health I the past. 

Last summer, my mental health unexpectedly and rapidly deteriorated. I developed a whole host of physical and physiological symptoms that made living everyday unbearable. I didn't know how I could go on. Then, at the close of summer, I finally broke down and admitted I needed help, which led to me recieving life-changing medication that made me feel like me again, and made life once more seem worth living. 

Now, about seven months later, the darkness has crept back upon me. Without warning, I've been thrust back into the hell I only recently, and so, so blissfully, crawled forth from. As I see the flowers die and the colors fade and the music dissipate around me, and I see the people turn to monsters and the places become nightmarescapes, I feel hopeless. This time is worse than the first onset of my mental illness. This time, as the lights are going out, I know exactly how dark it will get, because I've been there before. I know exactly what I'm losing, and how long it will take to get it back, and, once I recover, how ephemeral it will be. 

I can't go back there — I won't — and yet I can't help myself. I can only observe as I lose my happiness, hope, and feeling of safety."	InternationalPrice76	post	22.834695532523224	female	White	0.9943085312843323	na	na	na	2	mmfb	failed
"Hug. Tight hug.
I’m proud of you from escaping this last time. It’s hard to ask for help. If you aren’t currently going to therapy, that’s an amazing tool. Another thing I’ve found helped me when I was really in a dark place is religion. I started leaning more into having peaceful Sundays with less socialising and responsibilities, leaning into the community my church provided. I became close with two people who were safe and fun. My beliefs held me from becoming suicidal, and I don’t think I would be alive right now if it weren’t for my religion. Of course, organised religion isn’t right for some people.
I really hope I can help. Message me if you need anything. I make a good shoulder to cry on, and I will tell you if I need to set boundaries. I’m so proud of you and what you’ve done. Good luck."	InternationalPrice76	reply	na	na	na	0.9943085312843323	strong	strong	no	na	mmfb	failed

"Hey everyone idk. I need help. I’m lost. I’m hurt, angry,confused. I lost my mom last year and I’ve always struggled with addiction but I’m pretty much sober now(only smoking cannabis)

Ok no more context: I got into a a huge argument with my aunt who I currently live with because of the death of my mom. I’ve been smoking my wax pen in my room yk? I thought I was being careful. Smoking out the window, closing my vents and covering my door at the bottom. My aunt smelled this and basically was hella pissed. Idk this is where the argument started. But for the sake of time I’m not going to go into details that are somewhat irrelevant. Ok her and her husband start yelling and going off and doing all the xtras. I get so pissed I’m not even arguing back at them. I get so pissed I feel this intense feeling take over my entire lower body and arms. My hand s were shaking so much they hurt. So I punched the wall. It left a mark but not a crack.

anyways I proceede it storm out. Not even because I’m mad at them. I’m just surprised and in disbelief that happened. I’ve never been so angry before. I’m usually pretty chill and being angry is not a usual emotion . Hitting the wall was something I wasn’t even thinking about doing. All of the sudden I hit the wall idfk how it happened.

so I leave the house, and in such idk being surprised being upset idk. I couldn’t r bring myself to go back home. So I spent the night at a friends. And came back around 10am. When I came home my aunt answered the door and says nothing. She just moves to the side and let’s me in the house.Ok again for the sake of time I’ll skip some of the other things.

this is when things got extra heated

I go downstairs to try and talk to my aunt and apologize. I try to explain to her how I know I got too upset and I wouldn’t bring anything into the house again. She didn’t give me the chance. She started going on and on and ON about how she’s being disrespected in her house. Then she starts putting her finger in my face so all I do was move her hand out of my face. I didn’t hit her. I never actually forcefully or intended any harm. After that she started screaming saying I hit her. And I was like what the fuck?? So I get even more upset and before I even have a chance to get too upset like how I did previously. I leave.

maybe leaving isn’t the best way to have dealt with it. But how things turned out before I didn’t want anyone to see that side of me again.

I go to work, come back home and go to my room. I’ve been in my room only leaving for water because my room has a bathroom attached. I’ve just been here because I don’t know how I’m supposed to handle this situation. I’m posting this long ass story because I need help.

How do I apologize?? How do I approach her?? What do I say?? Please someone guide me. I’m so confused and upset and just experiencing a whirlwind of emotions all the time. I’m tired."	More_Manufacturer285	post	12.374972828262699	female	White	0.997524082660675	na	na	na	3	mmfb	failed
"Write it down in a letter. How you don't understand what came over you and how you're sorry and how you'll actually learn how to control that anger and feeling and didn't mean to disrespect just didn't know how to channel your emotions etc etc and really actually look into therapy if you're not in yet loosing a parent isn't easy and you could benefit talking to a professional and if you're in therapy talk this with them.

The best way to apologize for *anything* is to acknowledge the other person's hurt in a genuine way; that you *get* why they're upset. She's upset because you're using a drug in her house (trying to cover it up) and you put your hand on her to get her finger out of your face. Those two things, OP, CANNOT happen again. Acknowledge her kindness at *letting you live there* after your mom's death. Where were you going to go otherwise? The street? You're lucky they took you in. Ask her if you can just sit and talk with her to iron things out; that you want to apologize for *everything*. Make a sincere promise that none of these things are going to happen again.

"If I were you, I'd reach out for the anger issues to a professional. Especially the way you described them. I'm not fully 100% behind your aunt's reaction, but she is standing up for herself and her home. You also have to abide by her rules since it's her house, but it seems you understand this.

You might need to heal from your mother's passing, and therapy can help with that. You don't want to be that person who starts to break more stuff and react impulsive in heated situations.

"I’m using this to process, but I would really appreciate advice.

Less logical brain says:
I can’t see deadlines
I can’t communicate normally
I can’t focus on conversations
Nobody actually likes me
I need to stop talking
If I’m honest, people will take advantage of me

I tried to submit something to a competition, but I thought the deadline was an hour later than it was. I missed it by 7 minutes. I also was going to buy a few games on Steam during their spring sale. I forgot to due to needing to care for my mother and finish a lot of work stuff, and I missed out on around 25 dollars worth of sales.

I needed a ride home from an event today, and there was a miscommunication that resulted in two people picking me up. That miscommunication was not my fault, but I still feel like I failed.

I zoned out during a meeting at least three times, and I zoned out during a conversation with a colleague.
I have no reasoning for “nobody likes me,” therefore it is likely to be untrue. I still think it a lot, though.

I like to think out loud, and I sometimes forget to stop this in public or during conversation. This results in me being confusing and sometimes rude, though unintentionally.

I also have no evidence for ”if I’m honest, people will take advantage of me,” but I find it difficult to convince myself that it is untrue."	SilentSatyress	post	16.900860611956244	male	White	0.9991666078567505	na	na	na	1	mmfb	failed
"I have elements of everything you talked about here and while I don't have the answer I can tell you for sure that no one does and there's one thing that separates you as you are now and how you feel and you being without the burden of these persistent feelings and that is regularly daily hourly minute by minute tell yourself ... ""You're only human and the only person holding you up to this standard which is unrealistic is you. Everyone else is focused on them and them alone no one is judging you like you are judging you."" 

Ease up on yourself learn to laugh at yourself I have fallen down so many times in my life that I have learned to laugh at the ground. I look at the ground I laugh and I say yeah I'll be back down there before you know it and when I fall the next time I'm just going to hang out there for a minute and laugh some more.

You're holding yourself to a standard that you expect of no one else you wouldn't expect this from anyone else because we all have this thing where we want to give leeway to others because we recognize that life isn't easy and when we see we're sense that someone feels bad for something or someone makes a little faux pas nearly everyone has it in them to want to say .... No no it's okay don't worry about it 

Yeah we torture ourselves because of the emotion of being a perfectionist and having the perception that we fell short ... You're much more likely to change in the ways that you're talking about if you ease up on yourself as soon as you focus on the emotion involved in this feeling of failure you have taught yourself to stay there out of some sort of feeling that if you do it again it could greatly hurt your life while the only thing that's really hurting your life is this self-inflicted punishment for something that warrants and deserves a great deal of leeway.

You can train yourself and when this feeling comes don't run from it don't flee instead stop and say ... ""Yeah I guess I screwed up I could have done better but I will not fall down that same way again and even if I do I'm going to be even more forgiving of myself"" ... The brain does this automatically for you and for me for whatever reason we have developed this habit and in the same way we can train ourselves by not recoiling in shame but we run towards it agree with it laugh and say ""hey I'm only human I'm born to make mistakes and it is not the goal to eliminate mistakes but to accept them as a part of your character, then move on and leave the shame and embarrassment behind. I look at these moments like a wave and you're standing right there the wave is coming towards you you know you're going to get hit you brace yourself let it hit and then watch it flow back to sea 😉"	SilentSatyress	reply	na	na	na	0.9991666078567505	weak	no	no	na	mmfb	failed

"Check if [any of the information here](https://citizenpath.com/green-card-lost-stolen/) may apply to you. Maybe this part?

> If you need to travel abroad before you receive the replacement green card, you can make an appointment with your local USCIS office by calling 1-800-375-5283. At the appointment, request an I-551 stamp in your passport (similar to the sample image on the right). The stamp is temporary proof of your permanent residence. Generally, the temporary stamp will be valid for one year. Don’t have a passport? Try contacting the local consulate here in the United States to request a passport. For example, a Mexican national would contact the Mexican consulate in the U.S. to request a passport.)

That idea rides on the hope it doesn't take forever to get an appointment with USCIS, but hopefully you can explain the urgency of your situation when you call.

Anyway, that's the ""try to fix the situation"" part of things. The emotional part is fuzzier, but I find the [Serenity Prayer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serenity_Prayer) to be useful to help me categorize between things that I can no longer do anything about (and where emotions won't serve me), and things I can still fight for (for which emotions are fine, and often useful.)"

"**[Serenity Prayer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serenity_Prayer)** 
 
 >The Serenity Prayer is a prayer attributed to the American theologian Reinhold Niebuhr (1892–1971) in 1943. However, Winnifred Crane Wygal wrote an early version in the Santa Cruz Sentinel of March 15, 1933, as noted in the above cited research by Fred Shapiro, discussing Wygal's diary entry for October 31, 1932. The diary referenced intellectual work by Niebuhr that used the phrases ""the serenity to accept"" and ""the courage to change,"" but not in the context of a prayer. This suggests that the first published prayerful use may have been the 1933 work of Wygal.

"I have intrusive thoughts, everybody has them, but i’m not talking about thoughts such as “when i see someone drinking water i want to flip their bottle”. My thoughts think about the worst case scenario and it drives me crazy bcs i obsess over them.

Just recently I found out I fell for a voting scam. How I found out was basically some foreign number pretended to be Grab Food marketer and ask for survey. She knew my name and number which immediately led me to think about that voting survey I went to check and chrome stated it was a deceptive website that may make you give private information such as “passwords, phone number or credit cards”. At first I didn’t think much since it was just my number and maybe Gmail account….at most some spam calls. However a thought daunt on me….What if I had given my NRIC? 

That thought weighed on me for days….I knew I probably didn’t because asking for my NRIC was a huge red flag and a giveaway that it was a scam. Even if I am gullible I don’t think I am THAT gullible.
But just what if I did? What if i was stupid and gave it? BUT NO BCS I AM NOT THAT DUMB. I clearly remember giving my name and number but not NRIC and it drives me crazy 

My brain keeps showing scenarios of me typing my NRIC and it keeps screaming “ WHAT IF YOU TYPE IN YOUR NRIC” 

yeah….that my brain, that’s my life.
I lived my life with this kind of a brain, how do i make it stop? What can I do to make it stop thinking? I am grateful my brain is able to think so actively but sometimes i want to kill it.

"Hey so, all i can offer is what helped me:

The fact is, *you are not your thoughts*. Your thoughts and the associated emotions are just like storm systems passing through. Thus, you need to visualize them as something separate from you.

Intrusive thoughts are different from normal thoughts, cuz they arrive hungry, to *feed on your other thoughts.* They have the ability to eat your other thoughts for fuel. Like parasites, they can hijack your other thoughts and use them for their own purposes. That's their only power. But it's how they stick around. 

So the key is, visualize them as something hungry, and then refuse to feed them. It can be a predatory animal, a natural disaster, it doesn't have to make sense. But you have to create a system for them, a visual metaphor, to allow yourself to fight back. A visual metaphor creates cognitive distance between you and the thought, and gives you some mental space from the corresponding emotion (which prolly feels bad). By identifying the qualities of it, to yourself, you stay in your cerebellum, and out of your limbic system (i.e. the thought will pass faster).

I like to visualize mine as weather systems. I ask myself, based on the intrusive thought's loudness level in my head: ""is this thought a thunderstorm (very loud but i can tell it's just loud), or a tornado (so loud and powerful i can't do anything else), or a regular cloud (i can kinda just deal with it until it moves on)?""


Once you have a visual metaphor system picked out, you can use the following ""defensive mode""  questions when the intrusive thoughts arrive: 


1) *What does this thought look like in my visual metaphor schema?* The key is to *describe it* as much as you can. IS it big? Is it loud? Is it clouding the whole sky or just a little bit? The more you can ""see"" it, the better. The very act of observing it to yourself, and forcing yourself to describe it, is what keeps your brain in your cerebral cortex. Do this step until you have a clear picture of it in your mind.


2) *What do I need to do, to help you keep my other thoughts away from this intruder?* One thing that always creates distance, but that i rarely want to do, is write down the intrusive thought in a journal or notes app. Paradoxically, writing it always it takes away a good portion its power. But if you're like me, and you don't want to write when you're anxious, you may need to do something to distract yourself for an hour or two, until the intruder's emotional attacks on your body start to wane. Play with an animal, listen to music or an audiobook, watch some comedy, do kind things for strangers without expecting a thank you... Anything that will help you weather the storm. If the distractions don't work, i know it's time to get in my body: take a shower, go for a walk, play music really loud and sing along. That usually resolves it enough for me to move to step 3.


3) *Debrief what this intrusion looks like, from the other side, so you've identified it for the future* Describe to yourself how long the thought stuck around, observe how 'sticky' it was, how deep in your other thoughts did it get, etc. Did you notice any patterns relative to the last time it happened? This will help keep it moving. This part of the process reinforces the cognitive schema you created, and keeps the thought separate from you, by taking note of other times it's come and gone. Sometimes, when I forget this step, the thought comes back when I'm not expecting it. I highly recommend you sandwich the 'weather the storm' step between intentional observation steps, to avoid any unexpected return intruders.


Seriously, this works. Idk why but it does. If you practice it on the regs, it really helps. You have nothing to lose if you try it, worst that happens is nothing. But you'll see, the more you do it, the easier it gets. Remind yourself over and over until it's second nature: you are not your thoughts. They are passing through. If you feed them, they will get bigger and stay longer. If you starve them, they will get smaller and dissipate, passing the same way they came.

Hope that helps. ♥️"	Anonymous34023	reply	na	na	na	0.9970609545707703	no	no	no	na	mmfb	failed
"I’m just under 5’9” and lately have been hovering somewhere around 225 lbs. I am too tall for “average clothes,” too fat for “normal” sizes, and yet not fat enough to be considered curvy enough for the plus sized women’s clothes. On top of it, my shoe size is 11 and I have egregiously flat which means I can only wear 11W. 

According to the fashion industry, I do not deserve to be clothed.

“So lose some weight.” Yeah I wish I could. I have tried every diet and exercise plan out there. I paid thousands for a personal trainer. I have done things as simple as walking every day to intense, 90 minute workouts 5x a week. All that got me was a physical therapist and bad knee that will probably need to be replaced in 20 years. All that money and time spent with a personal trainer ended with me losing 4 pounds with NO change to my fat:muscle ratio… which means I lost water weight. 

I tried working with a nutritionist who said balancing my blood sugar and hormones should trigger weight loss. I gained more weight. 

I got diagnosed with hypothyroidism and put on medication. That was supposed to kickstart my metabolism. It’s done nothing and my doctor wants to take me off the medication. 

The only time I ever lost weight was when I was doing intermittent fasting and seeing how long I could go without eating (Aka actually just starving myself). I’ve wanted liposuction ever since high school (around 90 lbs ago). 

I’m just so over feeling like I’m this weird, fat blob that barely registers as human. I hate my body and I hate my life. I feel like the world is saying I LITERALLY don’t fit into it."	othermegan	post	30.87717276579346	male	White	0.9993927478790283	na	na	na	8	mmfb	failed
"First, know that I believe you because oof I can relate. I’m 5’11, weigh 273 lbs and have shoe size 10.5 / 11. Struggled with my weight my whole life. I didn’t eat a lot, didn’t eat a lot of sugar, didn’t drink a lot of sugary drinks either but during puberty I just kept gaining weight. I succeeded in losing 75 lbs only once in my life and I worked way harder than the average person for that to happen. All that hard work and commitment just to gain it all and more back because of an extreme burnout one year later. Recently I finally lost 22 lbs again. Since we’re in a similar situation, maybe what works for me works for you too?

Do you know if you have PCOS? Even if you don’t you might have insulin resistance. Taking Myo inositol as a supplement or eating food containing it might help. It breaks off excess insulin. Helps with weight loss. I recommend reading about stuff like insulin resistance, PCOS, lipedema and estrogen dominance just in case. I don’t drink sugary drinks or alcohol, I only drink water and self made fruit drinks. I don’t drink coffee anymore since it increases cortisol levels. Having high levels of cortisol makes you store more fat and makes it harder to lose it too. I eat a lot of fish since it contains omega 3 which breaks down cortisol. I’m sensitive to white flour products and apparently that can cause weight gain so I don’t eat those kind of products a lot. I’m still recovering from my burnout so I can’t exercise a lot but I go out for walks. Last time I lost a lot of weight because I walked between 10.000 and 20.000 steps every day and went to the gym 3/4 times a week. So I exercised between 3 to 5 hours a day without breaks for 8 months straight. I don’t recommend that. It’s probably one of the reasons why I ended up with a burnout. Now I can only walk between 3000 to 7000 a day but it still helps. I recommend walking 10.000 steps a day which is about 1 hour and 40 minutes but tracking steps is more accurate than tracking time. Oh and don’t forget to have break days once or twice a week. Be kind to your body. I eat vegetables in the afternoon too. I make some kind of soup with fish or chicken. Easy to make and healthy. Try to wake up, eat breakfast, lunch, dinner and go to bed around the same points of time every day, even during weekends. This actually really helps with losing weight. Taking birth-control helps stabilize my hormones and it actually helps me lose weight. Helps me be more energized too because I skip my periods (got permission from a doctor to do so because I have endometriosis). 

If you don’t lose any weight the first 1/2 months it can be caused by losing weight but gaining muscle mass or retaining water weight. Which is why I recommend avoiding the scale in that period and measure the circumference of your body parts instead. The past three months the number on my scale didn’t change a lot but my stomach circumference became 8 cm smaller.

I hope what I learned from my experiences might help you :D You got this! Put your own health first and try to ignore comments of mean and ignorant people. “Just lose some weight” is one of the most ignorant things people can say to someone. They’re not you. They don’t know how much you’ve struggled. Your experiences are real and your feelings are valid. It’s a process of trial and error but I believe you’ll find your own way eventually. You just have to keep experimenting and find ways that suit your body. Also, remember there’s nothing wrong with weighing more than average as long as you take care of your body. Appearance doesn’t matter more than a healthy lifestyle so please don’t starve yourself anymore."	othermegan	reply	na	na	na	0.9993927478790283	weak	strong	no	na	mmfb	no prediction.
"The problem really isn't you. It is society being superficial and focusing on the wrong things. When women are made to feel insecure about how we look, we feel less worthy in our relationships and in general and men can keep the upper hand, companies can sell products to us to fix our flaws, etc. 

I know it is difficult but it is better to focus on other areas of your life and enjoy your real hobbies and interests rather than obsessing about your body.

"We have the exact same body type down to the weight, height, and 11W shoe size. You are not fat. Matter of fact, I get compliments on my body all the time. Even if you were fat, you are still worthy of self love and respect. There is nothing wrong with being a little over weight as long as you’re eating nourishing foods, staying hydrated, and moving. 

Hating your body is just going to lead more frustration. Work out because you love what your body can do, not because you hate what it can’t do (yet). Find an activity you like to do just because you like to do it and watch the magic happen. I love playing just dance and experimenting with different exercise like indoor rock climbing, dance, yoga etc. It feels good to move and your confidence will help. 

I agree with you that I’ve completely given up shopping in person unless it’s a place like Old Navy which is very size inclusive for us girls between straight and plus size. Don’t bother going into stores you know won’t have your size. It’ll just make you feel like shit. I do most of my clothes shopping on Amazon or at Target now. Both of these places are good about size inclusivity. 

The average woman is a size 12-14 in jeans. This may also be why people like you and me can never find our size in the store. Because people already got it all!"	othermegan	reply	na	na	na	0.9993927478790283	weak	strong	no	na	mmfb	no prediction.
I'm your height and once hovered about 30 lbs less than where you are (also thyroid problems) and yes, what a pain in the ass to find clothes. I finally got down below my BMI by sticking with a strict keto diet (absolutely no cheating) and also adding in the regimen suggested in the book The Plant Paradox (for 6 weeks). I'm maintaining on 90% keto and a cheat here and there. The best suggestion I have for you is to buy your clothes one size higher than you need, then take them to a decent tailor to have them fitted to you perfectly. Give yourself a light snack of self pity (maybe a minute or two each day - no more), then get on with your life and stop hating yourself so much.	othermegan	reply	na	na	na	0.9993927478790283	no	strong	no	na	mmfb	no prediction.

That’s the thing. I was at the store and there were no clothes one size higher. They had size 18 jeans which were slightly too tight. I probably needed 18w. Those didn’t exist. So next would be 20w. Those were sparse. The majority of “plus sizes” clothes started at 22. They just don’t make clothes for me. Just like they don’t make shoes for me. If they do, I have to spend hours looking for them only for them to be ugly and utilitarian vs cute and fashionable. My other option is to buy online which all that really does is give me clothes that are 4 sizes to small but labeled in my size.	othermegan	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9993927478790283	no	strong	no	na	mmfb	no prediction.
Don’t bother shopping for shoes in person! I strictly get my shoes online now from Zappos, Famous, and Amazon now. There’s tons of cute shoes online in 11W. It also helps to read the reviews with picture so you can see if they actually fit. And these websites will let you return if they don’t fit.	othermegan	reply	na	na	na	0.9993927478790283	no	strong	no	na	mmfb	no prediction.
"I lied every time someone asked how I was doing today. Even to close people. I was on the verge of tears most of the day. I’m tired and overwhelmed. I took a few days off work to take care of my mother and go to an event for my orchestra. Now, I’m swamped with work and don’t have time to do it all while maintaining my mental health, so I’m not maintaining it. I feel like my mask has become too ingrained over the last week or so. I don’t just look neutral and intimidating, I’m actually analysing how I need to gain the upper hand in everything so I can protect myself. Everything is about protecting. I have to protect the little girl in me who wants to be a medical researcher, who was the good, quiet kid throughout her childhood until she realised it wouldn’t help, so she wanted to be brave. She wanted to be like Clara Oswald and Katniss Everdeen and Nova Artino, but she wasn’t strong enough. Now I have to be my own hero, but I want to curl up into a ball and cry. I don’t do so when anyone is around, so I take a minute or two to cry in private and process things; convince myself people don’t hate me. I’m scared someone won’t ask me how I am, but they’ll ask if I’m okay. Because I might not be able to keep the mask on to protect myself (and them). I don’t know how making this post will help, but I suppose right now was a good time to process and cry for a moment. It’s totally melodramatic, but whatever. You’re all strangers on the internet anyway. I can afford to be like a teenager again for a minute. My current solution to my problems is to remember that people love me, and people need me. I refuse to become suicidal, because I’m worth something. If I cling to that, I’ll start finding better coping strategies. I’m grateful for therapy and religion. They’ve both been vital to my survival.

"To  preface,  I've been going through it (37F).    I had to run from a  shooting in August and fell and ended up in the hospital,  my best  friend passed from suicide in November,  and I've been struggling in my  job as it's sort of turned into an EA role and I'm just not that good at  organizing and feel people getting frustrated with me.  I've been  trying to get new jobs but keep getting ghosted which is hurting my work  self esteem.  On top of this,  I'm in grad school after work 2 days a  week.   My days are LONG and I'm stressed.   I live with a roommate  which I can't stand (she's fine , I'm just introverted) and bills pile  up and I'm stressed over that....  my (recently ex) 38M boyfriend  normally would stay over from Friday night to Tuesday morning (I wfh  Mondays).    He's been totally wonderful and kind to me and so  loving.... but sometimes will say things I find offensive (homophobic F  word,  some violent jokes that scare me),  he also doesn't work.   He  does pay for things here and there like he will pick up some  snacks/drinks for us or small gifts for me or a meal out/takeout.   But I  get the groceries for us every weekend,  which I'm happy to do and like  planning meals,  but it starts to feel one sided as I cook and clean up  and it's my apartment I pay rent and bills for.   Like,  I work from  home Mondays and he just sleeps and snores and smokes weed.   It's SO  frustrating.     He wants to get married and move in together,  but he  doesn't help me look for apartments,  he doesn't seem to make any effort  to get a job (he hasn't worked in 2+ years we've been together),  and I  feel like he's spending most of his time at my apartment rent, bills,  and food free.

Lately he's been in  a band which seems very important to him.  I'm happy for him here,  and  I'm creative and musical too,  and I'm glad he has a productive happy  passion.   However he seems like he's more into promoting his band,   getting IG likes and follows,  getting fans,  etc. then the actual art  of it (he's the vocalist).   He's never sent me lyrics or worked on  writing when he's at my place,  just like promoting on IG etc.     Honestly it sort of feels like his goal in life is to be big in a  specific local music genre scene.   He says his goal in life is just to  have a simple life with me and cats....but actions speak louder than  words.   He hasn't looked at apartments for us,  he hasn't figured out  how to make income for them,  he doesn't seem to appreciate the stress  I'm under or offer ways to help.

It  was all coming to a heed this past weekend.  I was going through it at  work,  had received a laundry list of complaints from my boss,  and was  so tired from class and work.    I felt like I never just get a free day  to myself to do things I like solo like a coffee shop or library  visit...let alone time to clean my apartment or do laundry.   I have my  bf there my entire weekend until I return to work and then it's 12 hour  days of work and school with homework at night.   My closest friend  passed from suicide which has been really really painful.   And I miss  having a female friend to just let loose with,  and honestly need it  (esp. to vent about bf sometimes and get another perspective).     I  couldn't stop crying and was super anxious and not able to sleep and  feeling pretty mentally unwell and overwhelmed.   Just a lot building  up.

Boyfriend is being kind to me  here to be honest,  but he has a show on Thursday night prior to the  weekend that I couldn't go to because I had class.   I prioritized class  as I need to in order to get ahead to afford our life (apartment, cats,  travel) we want.    It's at a house venue and I'm honestly jealous.    I'm jealous he's out letting loose and having fun while I'm at class.   I  would love to be at a fun house show,  but I need to do stuff for our  future.    I was honestly kind of resentful and not being super  supportive of the show.   He was texting me about it and I was distant  and definitely was in the wrong here.   He said he's nervous/excited and  I kind of blew it off, for example.     I was just feeling really down.     I had supported in many other ways including printing flyers and  posting them for him,  helping him edit the flyers,  I bought his  bandcamp sample,  and I've been to his other shows.    Just this one I  was not feeling great.

While he's  there,  he had a girl who's big in this scene for filming/videography  film the show for them.  He was really excited about it.  I was watching  her IG stories during the show and getting more and more jealous (like  FOMO) and anxious and just had to go to bed.    I was starting to get a  little jealous too that another girl who's def super into the scene he  wants to be in,  and probably has more in common musically,  and who's  pretty and cool looking and having fun at this show (not a boring loser  in class) was filming it too.  I didn't want to be jealous or anxious  and so just went to bed.   I was definitely being a little quiet and  distant which was wrong on my end.   I tried to delay our weekend visit  because I knew I wasn't feeling great and was anxious and didn't want to  say anything about my worries - because obviously female friends are  totally fine.

He begged to come  anyways and he did.   He was being really sweet to me.   I was still  just a crying mess,  still overwhelmed,  still stressed.   Bought all of  our groceries,  cooked for him,  made him breakfast,  was trying to  make it a fun weekend but i was still just really down.   I hid in the  bathroom to 'shower' but really just cried.    Later Saturday night,  he  was talking about this videographer again but he kept calling her 'this  person'.    This was weird to me that he was purposely hiding the  gender.   I wouldn't have cared at all, but it felt fishy,  but I didn't  say anything.   Later I found out he purposely did this to not make me  jealous or ruin the show - I wouldn't,  I hadn't said or done a thing,  I  had already seen on IG that it was a cute girl that same night.     Anyways I'm just not feeling watching this girls video of them during a  kind of mentally crisis-y weekend.   The Thursday night stories already  made me anxious and FOMO.   The fact he's hiding it's a girl is making  me feel weird and jealous.   I'm feeling resentful because I'm sad but  still cooking and cleaning for him and buying him groceries.   I'm being  sort of passive aggressive I guess,  which is wrong of me,  but I  really didn't want to make accusations and rather just let my FOMO and  anxiety calm down and revisit when I'm feeling a little mentally better.

Well  he blows up at me,  is getting more and more mad that I'm not being  supportive enough.   I finally say that maybe he should fine someone in  that scene then - I clearly am not as good as this band or this scene.    That seems like what he's prioritizing in life.     He is getting more  and more mad and then finally yells at me ""you're a dense b-word,   you're just fucking jealous.   You're a fucking jealous b-word because I  have friends"".   This felt like a low blow, particularly as part of  feeling mentally unwell was exactly this reason,  and I lost it.    Hysterics.  Sobbing.  Kicked him out.    Like that was so unnecessary  and I was so low.   It felt like being yelled at (by the person who  loves me most) all the stuff I was yelling at myself.

He  leaves.   I'm sobbing,   I'm a total mess.   I don't want us to be over  I love him so much,   I'm shaking and lost.    I'm just so hurt by the  fight and how everything in life is falling apart and I'm so fucking  overwhelmed.   I go on Instagram and there is he is,  just gleefully  promoting his band like nothing happened.    I look at his personal and  he's changed his pic that was us on a special night to a pic of him at  this show and then right after changing his pic he followed that same  girl.

This aroused a LOT of  suspicion in me,  rightfully or not,  and I lost it.    Like you call me  a dense b-word then go home to remove me from your IG and just keep  promoting your band/video as if I'm not home sobbing?  I was so upset.  I  tried to text him and he didn't reply.    I threw out all of our stuff.

This  is where it gets really bad.   I think I felt so betrayed,  so much  like he chose his desire to be in a scene over me,  his desire to be  known for this band.... like I play music too (violin) and write songs  and poetry,  it's not choosing the music...and I was so supportive other  than one bad night and I truly do want him to be happy and successful  but I also want the same effort put towards our future,  otherwise I  feel taken advantage of.   I felt like just the frumpy girl who takes  care of him when he'd rather be with the cool girl who's in this scene,   but I'm the resource.     I LOST IT.  It was like I was just watching  myself be insane.

I was  frantically calling and texting,  couldn't tell if I was blocked,  used  my finsta to comment fake negativity on his band IG,  downvoted the  youtube video,  commented PSAs there that he's just in this for likes  and had been love scamming me,  messaged people all his dirty laundry  like how he uses homophobic slurs and says violent stuff.     The works.   Petty, immature,  revenge.   I was so embarrassed the next day and so  remorseful.    I messaged every single person involved how unfair what I  did was,  that everything I said was taken out of context,  he's a good  person,  none of it is true.  I removed all comments.   I made apology  cards to his 2 best friends and band mates.   I did my best to reverse  everything so he wouldn't have negativity.   I offered him my old laptop  to help with the music,  and anything I can do to help promote and help  reverse any bad press,  told him he could tell people any reasons I  said that and I could take as much hate/blame as he could give me.     I'm not sure what else to do and I know I completely destroyed this and  burned ties with everyone in his life and slandered and was so insane.    I was out of my mind - I really spiraled into this manic craze I think  from everything built up.

I feel  so bad,  I don't know how else more to reverse the damage - not for me,   but for him.   Because I do love him so much and I really just want him  to be happy,  whatever that happiness is.   And if it's success in a  band or a scene,  or to be with someone else, I really want him to have  that even if it hurts me.

I hate  myself and I feel so low.    I don't have any friends to be with to get  my mind off of this,  he was my best and only friend, it's a huge loss  right now,  and I feel guilt and remorse and just so awful about myself."

"I don't know why you should feel upset. It's kind of obvious his priorities aren't in order. No support with chores, no job for (2 years!) you've been together. Sure he's a musician, but plenty of musicians have a job, even part time. Cut your losses.

"1. He is at the very least interested in having a relationship with the groupie instagram lady. Everything you've said about that implies that he was cheating and felt guilty.

2. Until he's making enough money to cover his share of the groceries, he should be looking for a job. A band is only a job when it's making money. Otherwise it's a hobby. He is part of a hobby band, but he wants to pretend he's a rock star. And he blows up at you because you're not supportive enough? The only place he should expect to find a willing Wendy to his Peter Pan is on the Disney channel. He's mad at you for facing real life instead of pulling a Cleopatra and hiring a barge to help him sail down denial.

3. Your ex should certainly remain your EX. Give yourself some time and space. Enjoy a weekend where you're not playing mom to some unemployed weedsmoking manchild. If he's someone else's problem now, good riddance.

4. You deserve better. Be a best friend to yourself and remind yourself of that whenever you feel sad that he's gone. You have lots to offer, once you find someone who isn't a waste of time.

Yea that’s what’s interesting w her like.   I haven’t ever called out specific people.  I did get a little nutty when he was maybe going to a strip club like a year ago which was regretful (nothing like this, just picking fights),  but other than that I’m not really super jealous like I’ve been to his other shows where girls were there and I was friendly with them.   Especially if as he says this is just a professional arrangement like a videographer then why would I care?  It made it suspicious,  particularly as the first thing he did once he left was take me out of his pic and follow her on his personal IG.   Whatever.  Not my circus not my monkeys.

Haha #2.   True,  in his fight with me for not being supportive enough,  he said I was belittling bc once I called it “the lil music”.   I don’t even remember saying that but whatever.   “I look at your homework,  what if I dismissed that!”  … I show him my marketing mock-ups and he briefly looks bc I’m doing homework in bed next to him,  like I’ve been to his shows.   Wtf.   It’s def a hobby band!  They’ve spent more (on hiring the videographer girl for $150) then they’ve actually made.   Def not a job.   I guess it’s coming to an end potentially soon (unrelated stuff,  before this fight) and he was SEETHING MAD about it like “this was supposed to just be the beginning!”  Omfg.  Wasn’t it for fun?!

"No matter how I seem to approach making friends, I just can’t do it. I’ve only had one friend for about 2 years now, but that’s not without a lack of trying to make more. I join group chats with similar interests, like specific games, art, or even something as simple as aquarium keeping (I love fish). But there’s nothing. 

I’ve tried all sorts of ways to find people, but it never works out. Whenever I do find someone nice and they actually talk to me, I find out their true colors, and they turn out to actually be a horrible person. I’m not running people off with being rude or non-communicative either. Although I am a very anxious and shy person, I’m always incredibly kind with everyone, and I actually hold conversations. But, it’s typically one sided. 

I’m just now asking this question because I was randomly kicked out of a group chat where I actually felt as though I could be making some friends. Everyone was super nice and it didn’t seem one sided when I talked. But then I was suddenly kicked without any warning. I didn’t cuss, say any inappropriate, or offensive. I had been in there for several days without any problems, and then I was just kicked.

That really has me down in the dumps tonight. It really makes me think I’ll never make more friends. Does anyone else experience this? Or does anyone know the possible issue?"	Display_Valuable	post	19.622992838040634	male	White	0.9994773268699646	na	na	na	4	mmfb	no prediction.

No one's an expert at this, unfortunately. No adult anyway. Kids have a natural way of doing it, but we lose it as we grow up. But you are a great person and you will find your people eventually.

Two things pop out at me from what you write. Take them for what they're worth -

\- It sounds like you're looking to make connections mostly online. You talk mostly about group chats. And online / group chats are fine. Nothing wrong with them. But online friends and connections aren't the same thing as IRL friends and connections. It's easier to make a spark with another person or a group when you're in the same space as them. If you're only looking online for friends, you might want to try expanding your search to IRL activities. 

\- You mention that when you do find someone you're connecting with, they turn out to be a horrible person. I guess I wonder what you mean by ""horrible person."" My friends have all done shitty things, and while I would have advised against them if asked, we're still friends.

"I'm sorry you feel this way.

I don't know if it will make you feel better, but I [34F] hit 6' when I was your age and take more after my dad than my mom. I never had clothes that fit, I have thick brows and more body hair than seems fair. I'm not you, of course, but I get it. I so get it.

But I gotta tell you. I look back at pictures of myself at 6, at 12, at 16 and 18 and 22 and my heart breaks for the girl in those pictures, because I remember hating looking at myself when they were taken... And today I see a beautiful young ""me"" that I wish I had seen at the time 

Let me tell you another secret.

I still hate selfies. I hate my smile and the crooked teeth and my nose hairs and that little jiggly fat roll under my chin. 

You will see every imperfect part of you, forever, and becoming ok with that is a lifelong struggle. It's not easy. It's ok to fail at loving yourself just as you are sometimes. But ... Try.

If you think there’s no point in life when you’re not “pretty” your values are all fucked up. You’re only 14, your appearance will change a lot with age. There’s tons of god/goddess looking people who did not look “good” when they were young. Those who make fun of you do so bc they’re fucked up in some way, don’t take it to heart. Teens can be unreasonably cruel, sad fact of life. Try to focus on things other than looks and your emotional state will certainly change. When your self worth is tied to how you look you’re gonna end up with lots of problems, whether you’re “good looking” or not. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, there’s most certainly people out there who will find you attractive. Eventually there will come a time where you don’t care much at all about the way you look beyond looking clean and presentable. Happens naturally as you mature.

I went to his funeral, lovely family.

"Today I woke by a nightmare.. it's about my irritable bowel syndrome. It got worse and it's related to my old trauma of this disease..
I felt really sad.
Cuz l've been skipping a lot of days like it's been a whole month since classes started and I only attended for one exam.. I can't go! Cuz I feel so depressed and anxious. My professors all know that l'm unable to attend only on exams.. but still even on the exam days I get sick as well.. like a week ago I studied for a whole 3 days and I was excited then woke up at 4am with a stomach pain... I hated my body and that even doing a simple thing like going to an exam.. I'm unable to do it !! Ever since that day my mental health got worse.. also friends and classmates started to ignore me bcuz I don't attend that much.
I don't want to go with the same trauma i had to go thru when I was younger.. I was bullied by classmates and even teachers.. i promised myself that once I make it to college I will never make myself go thru same I felt in high school.. it's like even if I want to try.. I can't all of my energy is faded. I can't put myself in situations that won't do me any good ! I will never do ! It's been 9 years with this disease.. today my dad talked to me.. he said ""I wanna help you , why aren't u attending classes.. I want u to attend and be more sociable. I understand that you're doing ur best lk you like to study.. and Ik you're going thru it and it's hard..but you can't live like this. Yk there's people who suffers more and worse like “there's a person who's looking for a job but he got fired or he got into accident and he doesn't have money to buy another car... or there's a drunk father and his daughter have difficulties to pay for her college.."" my eyes got teary.. I told him dad I wish I can be able to go out and work. I wish I was able to be more social.. you think I don't want that.! Their problems are easy and a part of life!! But my problem is within me! And I can't escape that!
Don't you understand it's been 9 years!
Why haven't you tried years ago.. I won't push myself and attend classes! I won't embarrass myself anymore! Isn't it enough that I put up with everything all of these 9 years! I got into the college that u asked from me to attend with a grades better than all of my siblings that doesn't have a chronic disease like me! I just wanted you to be proud of me and understand me!

Vent tw*
I was literally crying for my parents years ago begging them and telling them I can't, l'm getting bullied bcuz of this chronic disease!! By classmates and even teachers! I still cry myself to sleep.
They used to tell me you're just making it up bcuz you're lazy my mom said this to me.. or my siblings say l'm just worthless and I won't be anything in this life.. or everyone got stomach problems.. you're just spoiled and a child. Or how my brother said that “I’m so worthless why don’t I just end my life..” 
and you dad never tried to help me.. you only care about fking stupid grades! Fine you want it I got into the fking college you want fking pharmacy college ! Isn't that enough. Now I wish to die. I'm not looking for any other reason to live for!
My mind is constantly telling me to end it. All these years.. you never cared.. you thought I was making it up.. why didn't you treat me nice when I needed it the most. I still suffer.. and you still want me to continue to go to college buz you want to feel proud of me.. otherwise like 1 month ago you didn't treat me nice or even smile in my face.. just buz I got a stupid bad grade.. my whole worth for you depends on what I make or what grade I get... I give up on making you proud. 
I don't want anything just give me my peace.
It's enough for me what I have been thru. How many friends I've lost due to this disease.. I don't want to try anymore.
You don't know how many time I woke up every morning and wished I was somebody else.. I never wanted to feel this way again. unwanted by people.. being ignored and making fun of.. I don't want to go thru this anymore.. that's why I'm skipping classes.. idk what will happen to me or my future.. but honestly it can never be worse than going there and have to relive every moment back in high school.. I have no energy or the mentality to do it. And l'm afraid l'd Off myself if I push myself like I did years ago.."

"I have issues with generalized anxiety, and I also have several severe anxiety triggers, mostly involving dating. I tend to compare myself to other people that women I date are seeing and/or have been with, feeling inferior/inadequate, and not being okay with being alone. My self-confidence is almost completely dependent on external validation, especially from women. I also have really bad body dysmorphia.

I'm crying right now because my dream girl doesn't want to be with me (or anyone) right now. We've been seeing each other for about 9 months, and that entire time we've basically been FWB, but I've wanted to be exclusive with her for a long time. I get sick when I think about her with other guys, because I want to be with her so badly, and I worry that I'm not enough for her.

She still sees her ex-boyfriend of 10 years, and I can't ever stop thinking I'm not as good as he is. He makes more money than me, they have history, and he has a relationship with her daughter (he's not the father). Meanwhile, I haven't ever met her daughter (which is fine, I know how important it is to be careful in this situation).

She mentioned the last time we saw each other that she's thinking about just getting back with her ex and possibly going poly, and including me in that. I felt like I could possibly live with that, but at the same time, I want to say to her ""Be exclusive with me. Give us a chance,"" and I think I will the next time I see her. She thinks we're incompatible, but I think we just have different personalities, but that doesn't necessarily equate to a lack of compatibility.

I've told her this before, that I want to be exclusive with her, but that was when she was ""dating without intent"" and before she had thoughts of settling down with anyone. So I think I will give it another shot very soon.

I'm seeing other people, but I can't stop comparing everyone to her. I want to meet someone who makes me feel as good as she does, and I know there are women out there like that, but I have to stop comparing them to her. I just don't know how.

I'm seeing a therapist and I'm trying to put in effort to change, but it's hard. These habits and attitudes I have feel ingrained, and I have very little confidence that I can change.

"> Unless you're going to be content to be her side piece while her real relationship is with her ex

I know conventional wisdom might say otherwise, but I honestly think that's better than not having her in my life at all. She truly makes me happy.

And I promise she doesn't look at me like a plaything. I really hope I didn't paint her as a villain, because she's not a bad person and she values me as a companion and a partner. She just knows what she wants and stands firm on it.

Having an ex in the picture while you're dating sucks and is super messy, but she's not technically wrong for it.

> It sounds like, despite your problems, you're having a fair amount of success dating.

The people we are around affects us so much, and if you are in this pain, I don’t think she is great for you.

That's possible. I haven't rejected anyone who offered more just for the sake of staying FWB, but I definitely have issues of viewing myself as undeserving, not good enough, inferior, inadequate, etc.

The way she makes me feel in that context is sort of a double-edged sword, because she herself makes me feel special and deserving of love, but the fact that she sees other men makes me feel inferior.

I've struggled to find the right person for me so far, and so having her as a safety blanket is kind of nice, but I do want more. It's not for lack of effort, though, I promise."	RayAP19	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9390297532081604	weak	strong	no	na	mmfb	no prediction.

I am, to an extent. It's good for companionship and sexual gratification, albeit sporadic, but I do want more, even if it's not from her.

And for what it's worth, I'm not sabotaging other potential more meaningful relationships for the sake of staying FWB with her. Like I mentioned, I am seeing other women, but it always fizzles out. Either the attraction isn't mutual, they ghost, they can't give me the attention I need, or something else. A lot of times it's the attention thing.

If I did find someone who ticked all or even most of the boxes I need, I'd definitely be prepared to have the ""We can't be FWB anymore"" conversation.

"It’s been years and i’m still stressed over it

It has been almost 7-8 years but I still can’t stop worrying over it. Context: I took an inappropriate video when i was younger which if it got leaked could be classified as CP. After taking it i realised what i had done was wrong and immediately deleted and remove from recycling bin in the span of one minute. At that time i didn’t use any back up services such as google photos so it wasn’t backed up. Even if i did use i deleted before it could Auto-back up. However I am still scared that it may still be leaked. I am sick and tired of living in fear and at this point it has taken a toll on my mental health. I just cannot forgive myself for ever making such a stupid mistake and writing here is my last straw.

I fear that my phone could have had a malware of some sort and steal that video in the one minute it was in my phone. I’ve been trying to remember if my phone had any issues and i remember i used to use youtube to mp3 converters and i would see occasional “you got virus” pop ups on some websites. I worry i may have accidentally clicked on it and downloaded some malicious software or the yt2mp3 converter gave my phone some malware 😩

Even though that phone can’t be turned on since it can’t be charged and i haven’t used it and my parents threw it away…I still worry about that video 

anyone got any advice how to move on? I am sick and tired of this affecting my relationships and I am tired of living in fear.

"You are fine. I can guarantee it.

In the very small chance someone was able to actually hack your stuff and get a copy of the video:

1) You were underage, so the material is highly illegal. If this video ever made the light of the day, the leaker would be thrown in prison. Their life would be over.

2) It's been over 7 years. The chance of the video still laying around on someone's hard drive after this time is extremely low.

3) Do you even look the same that anyone would know it's you? Unlikely.

I’m so so sorry dear. I have chronic illness and have been on medications for anxiety for years now and flare ups are just the fucking worst.  I would try to take it day by day.  I know that sounds corny but truly when you’re hurting so much emotionally and physically maybe even just hour by hour. See if you can journal, watch a movie, if you need to just rest in bed, if you feel like it maybe sit outside or walk if you are able to, write, read, find good art, give yourself a tattoo/get ideas for one, make a Pinterest and make little vision boards of things that you like.

"Despite what they tell us all the time, children aren’t maintenance tools for elderly parents. Think about other animals. They all leave for their own life once they’re independent. That’s just how life is. I hope that your father isn’t guilting you into thinking this. You need to leave and develop new skills and experience stuff.

"Man, I so feel you.  People always said ""spend as much time with your parents as possible because they won't be around forever!""  Well, my dad is 40 years older than me, so he was pretty up there by the time I graduated high school.  I heeded that advice, but uh...  he just keeps living.  My mother recently passed and I have a handicapped older brother (car accident) so I'm 34 with a super clingy 74 year old dad with cancer and taking care of my older brother.  

Don't be like me.  Sure I know family is important and paramount, but now I'm in my mid 30s and I don't have a life.  My world is my brother and dad.  I dont mind being the caretaker, however I have a life too.  I don't want to spend my entire life taking care of other people's problems.  

Don't be like me.  

Thats what my mother did.  Her and my dad were together 47 years before she passed suddenly and she was just a caretaker for the family and my dad. Since she was 17..  she passed at 64 and never lived for herself.  Her entire life was always taking care of other people.  

It's noble as hell and she was a Saint for it, but she never really lived.. I dont want that life.  I want my own life. But for now I'm stuck.  However things always change.  It won't be like this forever."	Initial-Wheel-	reply	na	na	na	0.9851526021957397	weak	strong	no	na	mmfb	no prediction.

Tons of people talk to their parents every week, if not every day. Some people text them throughout the day. When I graduated I was under the impression that people just separate completely from their parents once they graduate and move out. Believe me, that is not the case.

"Different cultures have varying opinions on how much ""weight"" family has as a social pillar. Be aware that I will be answering this from a background where family is one, but not ""the"" social circle one is supposed to cherish. 

Firstly, it is good and kind that you don't want your dad to be lonely. However, you deserve and need(!) to live your own life at some point. You are not supposed to shoulder the responsibility of being his only social contact. 

He needs to find other people to socialise with, even if it is hard for him. Maybe you can help him with that? Talk with him about activities he might want to try, interests he has or wants to explore, or voluntary work he might enjoy and then be persistent in asking about them and helping with ""first contact"".

I would also suggest being honest about your motives and worries. Sometimes your child telling you ""hey, I'll move out soon/at some point, and I am worried because you barely talk to anyone beside me, and I will be less able to do that once I am away"" can be eye opening in a good way.

This literally happened less then a hour ago and I’m just literally so embarrassed and upset.  I’m 22 and work at a Spencer’s in the mall. I was working with this new girl and honestly I’m scared to leave her in the store for a while. She’s like 18 and doesn’t know too much so I wanted to make sure she had everything. Well I waited until I had to go pretty bad and I was about to leave to use the restroom, but then a customer stopped me. I helped them and once again was about to leave but the girl I worked with called me over to help her. And while I was helping her I couldn’t hold it anymore. I just ended up wetting myself in front of the new girl and a few customers :( I had to call the boss and wait 30 minutes for them to come take over.

"I just had a follow up appointment with a doctor about my problems with anxiety and depression. I first met her 4 weeks ago. She put me on temporary disability and today we were meeting again to see how things had progressed and if we should renew the temporary disability. 

I told her I didn't feel much better. I reached out to get some psychological help, but I am still waiting to have access to those resources. I try to take care of myself and figure out on my own how to get better, but I can't easily play therapist with myself. 

My partner was diagnosed with cancer a few months ago and although he should recover, the treatment is very intense and it has been difficult for everyone. I also feel like a failure for not being able to work. My job was not going well. I used to love my work, but a bunch of things happened in my professional life that made me lose that. I am trying to get that back, but it's so hard. 

I told my doctor I was having little energy and motivation, and I was not able to focus on much. She told me that if I didn't make an effort, of course things wouldn't get better. That I needed to make myself healthy meals and walk at least 30 minutes every day. 

I am depressed. I am dealing with a lot. I can't just walk it off or cure it with some spinach salad. I want to make efforts to feel better, but it's not that easy.

"That is totally bonkers. Therapists should meet you where you're at, period. What she said is not a reflection of modern therapy approaches. People have priorities, and given everything you described, cooking and exercise are two incredibly difficult things to get into the mix. 

She easily could have found a way to introduce that incrementally, offer various ways to make that easier (maybe facetime with a friend while you cook, or make phonecalls while you walk, things to tie into other things you like or that will be rewarding, etc.), not just make demands and make you feel stupid.

Anyone can tell someone what they 'should' do to feel better, but most people will not be able to make significant changes like that out of the blue, esp if they are going through so much and feel burned out and overwhelmed, all while caretaking for a sick partner.

You might consider telling her that her approach was not helpful, and that you need a more understanding form of support, and probably more creativity in helping you achieve those things if you even want to. You're allowed to prioritize anything you want, and don't have to buy into her plans for you. You are the expert on yourself!

I'd guess it was her tone that was the shitty part. The substance of what she said is true.

It’s definitely really hard to do those things! Your doctor isn’t being sensitive, but if you aren’t doing the things they recommended, it doesn’t get better as much. After the long-term, walking will give you more sleep (typically) because of sunlight exposure and exercise. Food… I’m not sure, actually, but it’s been recommended to me a lot to eat well. If your doctor is making you feel super terrible about yourself, which it definitely sounds like she is, it may be best to start seeing a different doctor. I hope this helps.

Thanks. She is not actually a therapist, just a general doctor. I am on the waiting list to have access to a psychologist or social worker, but I don't have one yet. I only spoke to her for 10 minutes.

I used to have a doctor who would walk into the exam room, not look at me as I sat on the exam table, stand at his computer in the corner with his back to me, ask a few questions, and walk out of the room without making eye contact. The entire appointment took less than five minutes each time. He had stopped caring about my health and I'm guessing he wasn't much better with any other patients who weren't in top medical condition. It was pretty astonishing treatment from A MEDICAL DOCTOR, FFS. Not much longer after my last appointment with him, he quit the practice and went to work at the local gym that charges a minimum of $400/month where he apparently is one of the gym's doctors.	marie-0000	reply	na	na	na	0.9968451261520386	no	strong	no	na	mmfb	no prediction.
I’m 23, turning 24 soon. I work a part-time job and I am doing an ‘access to university course’ at a local college. I thought I wanted to go to university later this year to study Politics & International Relations but now I’m having big doubts about it. My mind changes about it all the time, but right now I really feel like I don’t want to go anymore. I’m scared to commit to university knowing that is going to be a) stressful, b) expensive and c) I’m going to be stuck in the same place for another three years. I’m desperate to travel so the thought of not being able to do that is not great. So now, I just want to work full-time and save up as much as possible, for a while. Since I’m unqualified with no particularly useful work experience I would probably just work in hospitality. But I don’t want dead-end jobs for the rest of my life. I feel really lost and like I don’t know what to do. I feel the same way about my relationship too and don’t know if I should just end it or if it’s worth holding on to. He is a really good guy, but I have questioned our compatibility for a long time.

Hey this is not unique. Our culture is deeply individualistic that means it’s mostly about you and what you want. Do anything you feel like. That will go on for the rest of your life. The problem is it can be difficult to set down roots of rely of people/jobs/career to make you happy. Really you can wake up every day and say I can have what I want today. That is the best way. If your relationship is dragging you get out of it. Decide on an ambition and stick to it. The irony is that most people know exactly what they want, but are waiting for something to pursue it.

The only way to be happy in this world is to somehow accept that you'll make mistakes that will leave people with sometimes irreparable damage that you will only realize you played a part in after the fact. I've hurt so many relationships, even ongoing, that just feel changed by the actions I've taken and even rationalized and there is no going back.

"I'm 23 and I hate my life. I'm unbelievably lonely, and I quite literally do not know where to go to meet people in real life that have similar interests. I still live with my parents and moving out seems impossible. Of the few friends that I do have, they are all moved out and are either in relationships or hooking up with people. Meanwhile I literally just lost my virginity not even a year ago with the only girl that's ever found me attractive, and of course now she wants nothing to do with me and I'm not even sure why she's so hostile. I feel like I am behind in life and an inferior man. Not only am I ugly, I'm awkward and probably boring because I've been so isolated most of my life, so I do not have very good social skills, whether this is in a romantic or platonic context. I started selling dr*gs and that's one of the only things I think gives me any ""edge"" or is cool about me. I'm sick of feeling like I'm lame and undesirable, but I literally do not know how."

"First, stop selling drugs. You'll just get into trouble and wind up lonely in prison, instead of lonely at home.

Second, gratitude. Things could be a lot worse. Focus your attention on kids your age who have died of cancer, or people who have gotten in a serious car accident and are now disabled. You got it better, really.

Third, find your joy. Though computers and technology you have access to all the knowledge in world, all the music that has ever been created, and all the movies ever produced. Come up with a goal that brings you 1% closer to joy, and then pursue it gradually, step by step.

Fourth, stop romanticizing the pleasures of being with girls. It is a false hope. Take it from me, a twice divorced 51 year old. Happiness comes from within. Besides, romantic dating right now is a train wreck. There are lots of lonely people out there, you have lots of company.

Last, this too shall pass. Give it a day or two, and your negative feelings will gradually fade. Go for a walk, distract yourself.  Find a constructive outlet and eventaully these painful feelings will lessen. Take your situation lightly, relax, and be gentle with yourself."

"I am sorry you are going through that. I was also very awkward and lonely as a young adult. 

One thing I will way is that as people get older, the definition of what makes a person attractive or interesting gets much wider. People who are physically attractive and very sociable are not necessarily the most interesting people. If you have some interests or hobbies, pursue that. Join clubs, take classes, meet people who are interested in the same things. You can also look for new hobbies you might like. Even if you are not sure you will enjoy something... try it. 

And if you meet people and feel like you are saying the wrong thing from being so awkward, be open about it. It's ok to tell people that you are socially awkward. That can help smooth things over."	Mean-Grapefruit-8372	reply	na	na	na	0.9994460940361023	strong	strong	no	na	mmfb	no prediction.
"That's a tough position to be in. To repeat some of what's already been said, selling drugs has the potential to dramatically screw up your life (which I'm sure you know, but it's got to be said). 

Your situation sounds rough, from the way you put it, and it's easy to be on this side of the screen telling you you're seeing everything incorrectly. Instead, I'll say that the worse your life feels like it's getting, the more important it is to look for the positive. This can start off as small moments of gratitude like ""I woke up today"" or ""Someone texted me."" Whatever it is for you. Just look for the moments in your day that make you feel better. 

Lastly, you could try journaling. Whether or not that sounds like it's up your alley, just think about it like this: you've got nothing to lose. So, you might as well try it out and see how it goes. The benefit of journaling is that you can get the negative thoughts out of your head and onto paper or your phone's note app. 

Hope this helps."	Mean-Grapefruit-8372	reply	na	na	na	0.9994460940361023	weak	no	no	na	mmfb	no prediction.

"Sounds like depression. The best thing you can do is make an appointment with a therapist and see you primary or a psychiatrist for a discussion about maybe taking some medication to help you step out of the pit your are in.

This is fixable. It may not be easily fixable, but it's fixable. Part of fixing this is to eliminate anyone who reinforces this feeling. If it's someone you can't avoid, like your boss or teachers or family, keep reminding yourself, ""That's just like, his *opinion*, man."" 

Also, mentally reject any of your own thoughts that reinforce the feeling. If you can't see a logical reason to feel guilty about something, don't tell yourself to feel guilty about it. If you do see a logical reason to feel guilty, put that thought on hold; even a reason that seems logical can be just plain wrong.

Hello I’m a first time mom and I’m 10 weeks pregnant however I love to drink and I know all the negatives of this and panick everytime I do. But when I have a bad day I find myself drinking and I’ve been drunk 4 times in these 10 weeks I am scared and need some help or advice.

"I think you may be on the wrong sub, but if it makes you feel better, my mom drank too during her early pregnancy. I was born a month premature, and with my health problems, I probably won’t see fifty. My quality of life is greatly diminished, and I have to adhere to an extremely strict diet/exercise/medical regiment that prohibits me from enjoying most foods. I don’t even know how many pills I have to take at this point lol. It’s better if I don’t count them. I know I take at least nine with breakfast. At age 10 or so I was already taking 6-7 different prescription a day just to be able to go to school. It will get stricter as I age also (mid-thirties now). It’s very similar to living with AIDs. I don’t qualify for disability either, so I have to work a low-paying job that has flexible hours to be able to make all my doctor appointments. I’m actually considered a “lucky” Fetal Alcohol Syndrome baby. : )

"My throat closed when I read this. My mom was an alcoholic and her decisions can still be felt even years after she died. What country are you in?
Please seek help. Bloody, please.
My mom had a lot of kids and all of them hated her because she put alcohol above the needs of her children. Your child hasn't even been born, and you have already started with the behaviour as well.
Go to your doctor, reach out to family and friends, anything.
Please please please stop drinking.

I think getting help for this now is your best bet. Do you want to keep this baby? Cuz if you do, taking care of this issue now, during a time of transition, is really the only way things are gonna get better. Otherwise you're risking soo much more strife in your life, and the life of your child, than you'll have if you go through the work to stop drinking now, while you're pregnant.

Ugh. I feel like a total asshole saying it, but my advice is to get an abortion, quite frankly. I loved to drink too (daily heavy drinker for more than a decade) and smoke, but the day I found out I was pregnant I stopped. It was hard and I had to find new ways to cope with my stress and anxiety, but I did it, because being a mother means putting yourself second to your child. The first trimester is pretty critical in terms of brain and organ development, which is definitely detrimentally affected by alcohol, and you're basically done with that now (ends after 12 weeks). You have probably already done some irreparable harm to your unborn child, and you don't seem mature enough to take care of yourself, let alone a child with developmental issues.

Please talk to your PCP or doctor about this. You are not only hurting yourself, but now you are risking the health of your unborn child. As someone who works with children with learning difficulties and disabilities,  many are caused by alcohol during pregnancy.  Read up on foetal alcohol syndrome. No research has found a safe level of alcohol consumption during pregnancy. You need to stop. Find a replacement for alcohol. There are some great zero alcohol alternatives out there now. Otherwise, find a hobby that will increase your self-confidence or dopamine levels in a healthier way. You can do this OP- be strong and confident for both of you.

"Getting tired of hearing from people that I am exactly like my Dad. They think I see it as a good thing, but NO. They don't know my dad the way that I do.

My dad used to be the sweetest little thing. He was my favorite until he wasn't. As I grew older, he always raises his voice to my mother. He always asks for money from me and my relatives and always makes other people feel dumb. 

I don't think I am my father. but I can't help to think that maybe they see bad things in me that reminds them of my dad? 

[I stumbled upon this video that says ""most people are other people""](https://youtu.be/P984GikNAJI) and that at an early age we are programmed by other people (parents) and these programs affect us.

"I’ve been trying to get help for the past couple weeks on getting out of a bad situation.

A couple days ago, someone sent me a chat asking for the backstory and i completely let it all out. 

We went back and forth for a bit, and it was genuinely so comforting just to have some support. 

As the chat progressed over the last couple days, they mentioned that they’re in a place where they’re able to help financially.

I told them that I didn’t want them to feel pressured just because of my sob story, but they reassured me that they sincerely just wanted to help because they could.

I would’ve taken any help because right now every penny counts, but it was a larger amount they offered to give and i was blown away and extremely grateful. 

The last chat we had was about them even sharing it with others they know who are financially stable and willing to help, and they said they were working on the payment process. 

The user has since been deleted, and I have no other way to contact them. i know it sounds stupid but i am feeling so crushed. 

I even told them how excited i was to start planning my first steps to get out thanks to their help, and they seemed so genuine. 

It’s been really hard to have hope lately, and i just feel so frustrated with myself for allowing my emotions to take over like that. 

i wish i knew what happened, and if i did something to make them reconsider.

they’re also in an environment that’s gone through some detrimental natural disasters, and i feel worried that something may have happened to them.

"Hey friend. You seem to really be going through it. I’m sorry things are so rough for you. I think you should attempt to stop medicating and self-medicating beyond what is necessary. That’s not going to be easy, I know. I’ve dealt with addiction to things like caffeine and painkillers just to feel alright. At some point, that ends up being what causes it.

I think what would be a good idea would be to find a non-substance substitute. Remember to not cut everything out all at once or your body will react super poorly. But instead of caffeine all the time, try vitamin D from either a sun lamp or going outside. Just going for a quick walk can actually help energize you a lot better than caffeine because you won’t crash later. I’m not saying cut out all the coffee, but limit yourself. Alcohol can be fun, but if you’re in pain or discomfort after, it’s not really worth it. Again, maybe try limiting yourself to drinking socially or just on weekends.

I know it’s hard and seems like an impossible task, but the changes here have to come from you. You have to treat your body right in order to feel alright. If you’re still not doing great, talk to a doctor to see if there is something deeper going on.

I know life can be difficult, but it’s going to get better. As long as you’re alive, there is always a better place to reach!"		reply	na	na	na	0.9984366297721863	strong	strong	no	na	mmfb	no prediction.
"Caffeine (also in coffee) is a stimulant, which can use agitation and irritability. Alcohol is a depressant, which also causes agitation and irritability. You shouldn’t mix stimulants and depressants, it can cause weird unhealthy side effects. The main issue is mixing the upper and a downer. This will obviously cause mood and pretty intense sleep disturbances.

Taking the caffeine and ibuprofen together isn’t inherently bad—it’s often used together in OTC migraine medication. Ibuprofen is the preferred otc pain medication to use while drinking alcohol, because it doesn’t effect the liver the same way that Tylenol does with alcohol. 

What’s also EXTREMELY concerning is that you’re mixing alcohol and caffeine with psych medications (if I’m reading that correctly). Taking either one of these drugs, let alone together, with psych medications can cause very serious side effects or medical issues. 

Please consider stopping the self-medication. I feel like cutting out the alcohol will make you feel significantly better almost right away. You should talk to your doctor about the drug interactions with your prescriptions, especially if you have a dependency on alcohol and feel like you will have trouble stopping."		reply	na	na	na	0.9984366297721863	no	no	no	na	mmfb	no prediction.
"So I am a straight man, studying in college right now, I come from a country and a family background where homosexuality is considered a bit taboo, I am not a homophobic but sometimes I do get a bit uncomfortable about people from the LGBTQ community.

So how this relate to my story, well last week I was alone in my dorm room as my roommate went back home for some family function, a friend of mine came along with two of his gay friends to my room, we talked and smoked some weed, and then one of the gay guys pulled me in the corner,

And tried to kiss me, I got really uncomfortable but didn't care that much of it, the next day the gay guy texted me on IG asking me whether he can give me a blowjob or not, I rejected and explained how it made me uncomfortable,

So he offered to bring a female friend for a threesome, I rejected the offer, but now I am regretting it, Idk why, I am a virgin and thought that might have been my chance to lose my virginity (Ps I was really ugly glowing up and now had a bit of a glow up but still lack confidence), plus I have started watching trans porn now Idk why, like I am still straight,

Please help me out, I don't want to regret saying no, now I sometimes get uncomfortable making sexual jokes around my male friends and I just wanna go back to normal as my life was before as a straight man."

" Not much to contribute but I would just say that you shouldn't feel any shame over what turns you on. You also should feel totally comfortable setting and enforcing boundaries. Gay or not, I wouldn't want someone cornering me and trying to kiss me and being persistent. 

My personal take - There's absolutely nothing wrong with a consensual threesome but I might hold off on doing anything until you really understand if being with a man is something you'd want. The fact that you're considering it only to get with a woman makes me think there's a big chance you'd regret it because trust me, the moment you consent to that situation, that dude is going to be all over you. I'd take it slow and really understand your sexual preferences before jumping in to something like that. Just my two cents."

"As a straight trans man, I’m gonna scoot around the trans porn thing. You cannot help if something “taboo” turns you on, just please know we are more than just a porn category and you shouldn’t see us as a fetish! 

Now that being said, please don’t put yourself into a sexual situation you **know** you’re gonna be uncomfortable in for the sake of virginity. Okay so you was “ugly” growing up? Good thing you don’t need to have sex when you’re growing. Really it’s best when you’re an adult or atleast late teens, which I’m assuming you are. No one can tell you what sexuality you are and you really don’t need to label yourself. 

The only reason you started second guessing yourself is because there where talks of a women, right? Now the fact this guy kissed you like that was  inappropriate, he really, probably should not of done that… I think many gay or straight people would feel uncomfortable with that…. However when he sent you the message about a Bj you didn’t re consider and you still felt uncomfortable. I don’t think as of *now* you want to have sex with men. So as of *now* you are straight, relax! Besides even if u did have the threesome that would be more homoflexible… you’re there for the chick, that isn’t gay. Still though if it makes you uncomfortable it makes you uncomfortable.

Confidence will come, it’s a hard nut to crack but you already acknowledge you had a glow up, don’t let past feelings cloud who you are today.

"I have a complicated relationship with my parents. I know they love me and all, but they don't really understand or get me. And though I know they love me, and I love them too, there have been times where I have really needed them and they failed me. When I was having a mental health crisis my senior year and attempted they did not immediately take me to get help, instead we had a fight where they shouted at me that I was doing it for attention and that I wanted to escape punishment for skipping my finals that day (I had never skipped classes in high school before, and idk maybe I didn't show up because the grade wouldn't matter if I was planning on not being around?!). 

They have done many good things for me, and I have lots of happy memories with them, but there have been several times where they just made huge mistakes when they were supposed to be there for me. And whenever I try coming to them with a problem I'm having, they never understand. My dad's not a good listener, and he usually invalidates or brushes it off. Both me and my stepmother have experienced telling him about our problems only for him to not make eye contact, not know what to say, or just give some small response like ""oh wow"". I tell them almost nothing now, and usually come to my friends for all my problems, who are very understanding and always give me support or advice.

I just want to move out so badly, but I can't right now. I probably can't before graduating college next year, because I won't be able to work enough hours to afford (my major at my specific school is known for a demanding workload). I want to move out so I can have more freedom and happiness. I want to live with one or two of my friends, people who get me and we get along, enjoy each others' company, and both support each other.

I feel kind of guilty for feeling this way, but I just do."	unusualpanda1234	post	33.631907427893154	female	White	0.9965835809707642	na	na	na	1	mmfb	no prediction.
"As someone that has worked in mental health and graduated in behavioral psychology, I’ve seen this far too often. The short of it is most people are not equipped to deal with complex topics especially when it makes them uncomfortable. Your father’s response is indicative of someone who has trouble with intimacy and emotional expression. Doesn’t make them a bad person, just not well equipped to handle your emotions. Forcing him to deal with this will likely make things worse in the short term as he will fight to keep from dealing with these issues. It’s a defense mechanism that can spiral into chaos if not handled properly.

The first recommendation would be to talk to your school’s councelor. Most schools have them. The second is not to trap yourself into any particular line of thinking - don’t diagnose yourself. You should examine your feelings, but not at the expense of your surroundings, relationships or responsibilities. Yes, it’s easier said than done, but all worthwhile things will be difficult. Do not isolate. Do not predict negative events. Do not push others to accept what they do not wish to until they come to you for that change. If things start getting rough, distract yourself with a hobby, a book, a tv show, and then examine later. Exercise. Learn about the world around you instead of the world inside your head. Don’t self involve.

Reddit is the worst place to get mental health treatment. Don’t attempt it. It may bring a certain amount of catharsis, but in the end, it’s generally a bunch of laymen stabbing into the darkness with rusty spears. Bad ideas can appear good and vise versa. We all make truths out of lies and they can spread like wildfires if allowed if the scape is dry enough."	unusualpanda1234	reply	na	na	na	0.9965835809707642	no	strong	no	na	mmfb	no prediction.

"Despite how you feel, you should feel proud of putting yourself out there. That’s super scary to do. A lot of people won’t even put themselves in a place to be rejected, which also means they won’t put themselves in a place to find a relationship/love.

This probably won’t feel true, but right now is the worst you’ll feel. It’s all uphill from here. Yes you got rejected, but now you know. You two weren’t together before today, and you still aren’t now, but now you know and don’t have it eating away at you.

"Sorry about that. There's really no way to cushion romantic rejection. It just sucks.

It might sound like a weird paradox, but I think the more you put yourself out there and get rejected, the greater your likelihood of eventual success. What I mean is, you hold back from opening up to crushes because you're not confident they will reciprocate. Which makes sense. But the once you open up and get shot down, yeah it dings your confidence in the short run. But in the long run you realize that you do get over it. And it makes it easier to chat up the next girl and so on and so forth. Just like anything in life, you get more efficient with practice. And the more risks you take, the more confident you seem, and the more confident you seem the greater chance you'll get a yes."	runningsalvador	reply	na	na	na	0.9992091059684753	strong	no	no	na	mmfb	no prediction.

I‘m so sorry, a rejection is always awful and hard to process. Depending on what you need to hear: you are a wonderful person. It‘s her decision to miss you as a partner in her life.

"I'm a 31 yr old lesbian who is VERY VERY forward when it comes to asking girls out. I have horrible gaydar so I will straight up just ask a girl whether they like girls and whether they'd like to go out with me some time. I have been rejected a gajillion times. Believe it or not, handling rejection is a skill that requires practice and the better at it you get, the more confident you become and the less it will affect you.

I know it's a proper trope that lesbians are really shy about asking girls out and are often oblivious to advances, but it doesn't have to be like that. Trust me, there is nothing sexier than a woman who is secure in who they are despite facing rejection. That's why I try to embody that as much as I can.

But also, perhaps try making friends with them first? Pining after someone from afar without ever speaking with them while letting fantasies pile up in your head will definitely set you up for disappointment. If you make them a real character in your life first, you'll feel more grounded when you do eventually ask them out. And if you get rejected again?

"I think it’s pretty frowned upon across the board for people to have sex so audible that their roommates can hear. I think it would be totally reasonable for you to mention to them that they need to keep it down. It normally would bother *anybody* to have to hear someone else having sex in their house. If that’s a boundary you can establish, perhaps that would be a start on helping you feel better. 

I’m sorry you’re lonely. It’s a lot more common than you may think for lots of people to be single and lonely for really long periods of time, and it doesn’t necessarily mean you’re a bad or undesirable person. True love and connection is actually incredibly rare, it may not seem like it but a lot of people just settle and are secretly discontent or lonely in some way even in a relationship. I look back on some of the long, lonely parts of my life with gratitude compared to some of the relationships I’ve had. 

It sounds like you’ve identified a lot of your struggles and have been actively trying to improve, which I commend you for! Remember progress isn’t linear and takes a lot of time and patience.

Im gen z and live with my parents and it seems like there is no way out of this mess so I’m considering just killing myself.

Please help. Im just looking for a glimmer of hope. I’ve heard too much bad news lately and I can’t handle it. I know I sound like a bitch or a snowflake but I truly need help and support because this anxiety is having a negative effect on my potential and what I have to offer.

"My friend I sure hope you're still among the living because I have great news for you ... let's time machine back 10yrs 25yrs, 50yrs & 100 yrs ... one thing they all have in common with right now is that cries of 

> everything's going to hell in a handbasket omg the humanity! 

my friend the economy is no more going to 'crash' as it is going to come right back up in 1 or 2 years ... this is a concept but any system of any society of the world that collapses .... 

#Needed to collapse & in due time the human race will do what it does & patch holes in the dam just like our beaver friends

When this type of thing happens it always serves to shine a light on 'holes' in the system ... even when it seems like the bad guys always win & all is hopeless, this is when that light of hope actually shines the brightest ... think about this for a minute. There's been so many crises just in the last ten years omg I mean we just lived through a WORLDWIDE PANDEMIC! and guess what it actually served to create so many new ways we do business & it was a Gdamn pandemic & we not only got through it, we actually did *really great* with it considering how volatile we humans are! 

You can't go back to a time in history where there was like 10yrs that everyone was like 

> Ok yeah now we've perfected this human race thing now lets just kick back & ride

There's always a crisis impending & if you listen to the people who shout the loudest trying to get you to feel exactly how you're feeling right now, well you can be sure your outrage & fear will shape their advertisers commercials ... my friend it's all a big scam ... even though we are seen as pawns & screwing the middle class American worker is seen as the 'price of doing business', pawns are still absolutely necessary. 

My friend you're fine and we're fine ... I no longer watch the news everyday but when I put it on it's the *same exact crisis* as 10, 25, 50 yrs ago w' different names & details but at it's core it's the same where the rubber meets the road ... it's about money & who is gonna get the shaft so the billionaires that wrote those big checks to both parties can get the billion dollar mega yaught not the 500 million ... it's so #17 on the Forbes world's richest can get to #14 & beat that #16 last year who rubbed it in his face by buying 1 million of his companys stock at the end of the day & sold it when it was assured to be a loss to him ... just to say FU buddy! ... and yes this actually happened the day after the Forbes list came out w' two billionaires ... it's a game of egos & we're the pawns ... but dude you can be a happy pawn & just focus on being happy in your own skin & being the best vversion of yourself you can be ... If you want to talk feel free to hit me up in DMs/chat. I've been on quite a journey in my 49yrs & when you've fallen down as hard & as many times that I have you tend to learn a few things about perspective & there's *always* another side to every coin that has valid points & could turn your whole mood over w' a [Simple Twist of Fate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3je0MquWlU)"	AbsorbedSky312	reply	na	na	na	0.998084306716919	weak	strong	no	na	mmfb	failed

It won’t be easy, victories that mean anything never are, but that just means you’re strong, even if it doesn’t feel like it.

"Hey pal, I wanna give you some words of encouragement. The media/news aren't trying to inform but mostly to make you feel an emotion. This emotion is usually anger, hate, despair, sadness or the most common one - worry. All these negative emotions are increasing mental health issues worldwide and making everything seem worse, when really it's not that bad.

Make that your mantra, it's not that bad.

Stop reading the news, stop being online chronically, stop worrying about abstract things like the economy. Focus on making the next right step. Even if something like finishing school, getting a job, finding a gf seem daunting and scary. It's not that bad

Find the next right step -> whether you retake a class, brush up your cv, sign up to a gym, anything, and I mean anything you can think of that's actionable is better than worrying or thinking about death. 

I hope shit gets better for you. I was considering at rock bottom when I was 18, but stuck around to find out what's next. Life got better. Then it got worse.

"Lately I've been thinking a lot about killing myself, I've been thinking about taking a bunch of pills and jump from a bridge.

I had a beautiful but lonely childhood, I grew up in the deep countryside in the south of Chile.

I was always shy and introvert,  I attended to a rural shitty school, there, I started to be a bullying victim, since I was 10 years old to 13, no one respected me.

But I used to motivate myself thinking about the future, being a kid a lot of people used to tell me  that I was smart and indeed I used to get good grades easily, so I remember I started to fantasize about my future, ""in the future, I'll be a successful person"" I used to say to myself.

Then I went to high school, difficult years, but I didn't have to deal with bullying anymore. I just had to deal with shyness and social awkwardness.

Then I went to college, I started to study a healthcare career, the first year was amazing! really beautiful in many aspects, but from the second year I started to feel social anxiety, social phobia, it was horrible, really horrible, in the worst moments I couldn't even eat in public. 

It's hard to explain but in my darkest moments I used to feel the desire of literally hit my head against the wall.

Everything started to falling down, and I ended up finding refuge in some bad habits, specifically pornography, in that moment of my life I wasn't aware that those bad habits were harmful for me and I got caught in a vicious circle easily.

So, two years became 6 years, and then I quit.

Then I went a couple of months with a therapist, I came to my parent's house, I spent two years doing nothing but reading novels and writing (I tried to write a novel once, but I failed). 

And then I got a scholarship and I started studying a 2.5 years career of business administration on a local institute.

The first year was nice, I didn't have a car in that time, so I used to have to walk a lot in order to take the bus (the institute was in other city, almost 1 hour far from home).

The second year of study was awful, because of the pandemic, the lectures (and everything) was online  and the quality of the teachers decreased a lot, a lot! 

Of course some mediocre classmates were happy with that because everything seemed to be easier.

Well, then 2021 arrived and I found an internship, a nice company in a small town, with very antiquated methods of work.

I was happy there.

Until an asshole started to treated me bad, saying things like I didn't know how to do my work and stuff like that, honestly I don't know how to deal with that kind of shit.

My  social anxiety appeared again, and I quit.

Then I worked a bit here in my house, feeding animals and that kind of stuff and some other months in a processing facility.

Then, 2022 arrived, I got another  scholarship to study programming!  specifically a language called ""Ruby"" I was so excited I thought that could fix my shitty life, the first modules were about startups, businesses, and so on.

But when they got to the technical part (the language Ruby, Sql, the framework Ruby On rails), the quality of the course dicresed a lot 

The main teacher was a complete impostor, he didn't even know the fundamentals of the language he was trying to teaching us .

I was so excited about that opportunity and I ended up feeling so disappointed and frustrated, the course was free in terms of money, but I invested a lot of valuable time on that (7 months, I quit too), and now...

How do I explain to my family that I didn't gain the skills I was supposed to gain? :(

I feel sad, really sad, I've failed so many times in my life and the worst part is that I don't have any valuable skill in order to find a good job (or even any job) or simply to make money. 

I feel trapped and stupid and old! 

And I feel a lot of envy against happy people :l 

My family believe I'm ok, but my mind is a mess. 

Sorry for the grammar mistakes.

Btw, I have a debt of 6000 usd to the first University in which I studied, this is shit.

"No one knows your journey the way you do.  And a lot of bad stuff happens to us that we can't control.  If your feeling this way, I highly recommend counseling.  

My opinion is you don't need to be afraid. I know easier said than done. But our thoughts often betray us the most. If you think something is hard, it gets harder.  Our thoughts are the inspiration for action.  So bad thoughts usually comes with bad actions.  So bad results happen.

You must change your thoughts. I know it's tough when life shits on you but you must find good thoughts. Chase good habits.  Create the person you dream of becoming and take small steps to get there. Know that no one is born bad.  Be the best of who you always have been and always will be.

And things you know as toxic must be abandoned, even if it's abusive friends or family.  Job, places, thoughts. Whatever.  Refine what's working and kick out what does not.

Try changing your environment. Move into a different place, apply for a different job, try another different career, look for a hobby or something that would give you a sense of purpose (like a pet) and you might change your perspective in life. People might disagree with me on this but I’m only telling you this because these worked on me when I, too, was at my lowest. It might not work on you but all I can say is that killing yourself will never be the solution to all your problems.

"Of course very different stories, but I can relate. I’m about to be 28 I’m at university now, but I feel pretty behind. Half the kids in my class are 19 and I spent 7 years in a career that felt really cool, but ultimately I just managed a bar and am not even great at making drinks. But with that being said sometimes we have to step back and realize being alive is beautiful and an experience. It just is. Society has a lot of expectations actions that make us feel like we shoulda been lucky, energetic, or perfect or something to “succeed”. 

I can also relate to that deeper feeling. I was suicidal from 15-24 on a massive level. Now it comes and goes. But it’s really not the answer. It’ll be boring and won’t help. It won’t help you or those around you. And if I can say I feel similarly, I don’t think it’s fair that anyone as young as 28 should feel like they should be gone to get over this ya know? Plus, I really think there will be a beauty to being after 30. I think the real root of how your feeling is that other people haven’t made you feel great for a while. I think if you had that positivity you’d feel a lot better. 

I wish I could help by giving you that kind of kindness cuz I’m sure it just feels crummy right now. Nelson Mandela spent 16 years in jail and was able to do great things. Some people write books or find their passions at 40. Amazing chefs often go to culinary school and find happiness later. But again, I think the people around you or the people you’re comparing yourself too are changing your perspective negatively. Embrace yourself and just be a person for a while. And I understand social anxiety is rough. But it’s honestly okay. The world is weird, and it’s strange interacting with people, it really is. But if you walk around having to adapt to others, I think people should adapt to you. You will find those people who make you feel comfortable. 

Also, I’m in 10k debt if that makes you feel any better! One of the best humans I know has floated around life without “doing much” and he’s 45. I’m so grateful I have him as a homie.

Animals are a great source of happiness and relaxation! 
What I do for my social anxiety to be reduced is breath therapy + talk therapy. Additionally, I do have ADD, so I get overwhelmed a lot with small tasks, so together combined I worked with my therapist  how and what helps me to calm down and every time I have a big and new social interaction i must go, or even curious enough to want to go, i prepare myself mentally. So dressing as comfortable as i like and parfum gives me a safe bubble, and I have some mantras I do like to say while i am there and before: “it's okay if I need more time”“ it's okay to leave if I don't feel comfortable” “ I am good enough like everyone else”“ my body is reacting because it feels stress”"" I am an adult now I can take care of myself"""" my body is okay and I am healthy"""" my body is in fight or flight mode"" ah and the best is counting things that I see, counting breaths counting colors drinking water and telling myself i will go with a curious mindset and not catastrophize beforehand. I also reassure myself that if something happens to me, people would get help. if I feel suffocated I go to the bathroom to take a deep breath, and sticking to just a few people and stops trying to be over friendly with everyone as I get so exhausted. I am a lot in nature and I do accept now that I like to be in solitude and to accept that I am more introverted. I do prefer to meet with small group of people.

"I've had passive ideations since I was 18. I'm nearing 30 now, incapable of self love (I've tried, but over the years lost it), and I've never been wanted or loved by anyone. I've been thinking more lately that if I don't find anyone by the time I'm 33, I don't think I'll have any motivation to live past that. I will never be someone who'll be fine being single in their late 30s, especially older. By that time, it'll be too late to do the things I want and it'll just not be what I wanted. To me, it's like everyone is excited for ice cream, but by the time you get yours, it's melted and getting kind of warm. It's not even good melted ice cream, it was ice cream that was left in a hot car for 5 hours in 90º+ weather. And I'm supposed to be happy because it ""finally"" came? At that point, it's not even edible. I'd rather die early than have the rotted ""melted ice cream"" version of it or live the rest of my life alone."

"I used to think like this. If I don’t do BLANK by BLANK, then it’s over for me. I would set these time limits, usually based on age like this. But then I got to that age, and maybe I would push back my deadline, or instead, everything I was so sure about when I made that original promise to myself, every way I thought I would feel, is not actually how I feel. 

You’re very hard on yourself, but you’re not a fortune teller. I wonder if you could give yourself a chance to think “what if I’m wrong about how I will be 3 years from now?” I’m not saying you will necessarily find someone then, and even if you do, that it would solve your problems. But a lot can happen between now and then. Things you can’t even imagine. You seem certain, almost determined, that in 3 years time you will still be feeling this low and miserable. But what if you’re wrong? Have you ever been wrong? I wonder if you could think “what if, 3 years from now, I’m not as miserable as I am now?” That would be lovely. 

I don’t know if that made any sense. I’m sorry you’re feeling such isolating thoughts. 30s are younger than you think. You are still you, you won’t magically shrivel up over night. I thought your ice cream metaphor was creative. And also, I have met people that like goopy hot melted ice cream. 

I also think self love is overrated. It’s been pushed down our throats so much. Can’t we just hate ourselves a bit? Live in that catharsis state sometimes? For some people, they seem to be able to practice “self love” so easily (although I think maybe they’re faking it) but for others, just staring at yourself in the mirror is too much. I think that’s okay, and doesn’t make you broken. 

Hang in there OP. I have not met you, and I don’t know what you are capable or incapable of. But I do know you were capable of writing this post to ask for some support. That’s not bad. I hope you feel better soon, even if it’s just for a moment."	Vincisomething	reply	na	na	na	0.9993969202041626	no	strong	no	na	mmfb	no prediction.
"I think it's because I've had this feeling even when I was younger. I don't think I was having ideations at the time, but as a kid, I might've thought 18 was ""late"" for a relationship. I don't think 30s (even early 40s) is ""old"", but based on what I personally want, I don't think I'll be the person who finally finds love at 50+ and it's everything I wanted. By then, it would already be too late to have and experience the things I wanted. 

After trying to be patient, it would get to the point where I'd just feel like years were going by while I wouldn't get anywhere. I haven't gotten to the point of seriously thinking of planning my way out of life, but I have a fear that it'll be a few years before I know it and I might be driven to that point. It's also hard to be optimistic when my experiences have only been negative. The closest I've gotten to self love is knowing people who have trouble loving themselves still deserve to be loved. It feels like my self love has an 75 - 80% max limit lol.  This did make me feel a bit better in the moment though."

"TW for death and gore 

grief is a bitch to deal with no matter what, i get that. and that’s a big part of what i’m going through now. and i feel the feelings, try to as much as i can 

but with how it happened, i feel like i can’t even talk about it. i get there’s downsides to the culture we have of immediately removing the body once it’s dead, but i wish i’d at least had the choice. i would have had control, and she wouldn’t have had to become what she did 

i wanted to have her taken and cremated the next morning, that way i could have her ashes and see she’s no longer what she was. 

instead i watched what she was sit there lifeless, slowly decomposing. leaking. bleeding. flies. the smell. for days. there was some aspect of caring for the body i do appreciate, that i could care for her in that state and keep her better than she’d have been without me. but that doesn’t change that she sat there dead for two days, and she shouldn’t have. that is EXACTLY what i did not want to have to remember, EXACTLY why i made plans before it even happened. 

what if i had gotten her medical attention in spite of the pressure not to? would she still be alive? could i have prevented all this? why did i carry her out just for her to die hours later? could i have saved her when she started convulsing? was i any comfort as she went? 

does she hate me? 

i feel like i hate me. and i hate the people who made this all the more hard on me. it’s not fair, and yet here i am stuck with these experiences and memories. fuck like, fuck everything"	KeiiLime	post	27.349906053551823	female	White	0.9990600943565369	na	na	na	1	mmfb	no prediction.
"I don’t know what culture this is where the body isn’t immediately taken away to either be embalmed or cremated, but I don’t think it’s culturally insensitive to say that this is horrifically traumatizing; this post being the number one example.

Your anger is justified. Don’t fight it. We get angry when we know something is *wrong* and that we or others deserve better than what happened. 

So don’t try to push it down; let yourself be angry and try to vent in healthy ways like this post is great, going for a run, or chopping wood if that’s available to you. Listening and or singing along to loud music; etc.

Does your culture have any grieving rites or rituals? 
That may help.

You could also write a letter to the deceased, telling them everything you’re feeling / wish you could tell them. And then either burn it or keep it under your pillow or something that feels right to you.

 So  I have a friend. We used to date but we broke up not too long ago. I  love and care for her, but she's just really down, and vents on reddit  and stuff a lot, stuff like wanting to cut off friends and how she hates  them, how shes relapsed and doesnt tell anyone, how she wants to kill  herself and  how she finally can and I don't know what to do at all.  She's a dear friend but I just can't help her. We're around the same  age, which is relatively young (we're both minors), and we're long  distance. I just don't know what I can do to help her. I can try to  confront her but she won't tell me whats wrong even though I constantly  try to offer her support. She just will not take any help from me, which  I don't blame her for, but I don't want her to suffer like that. But I  dont wanna call anything on her, like idk the cops or suicide watch  because I don't want her to suffer more based on what I hear about  mental hospitals. I fear for her greatly and there's nothing I can do to  help her because I'm probably among the friends she wants dead/hates/doesnt think cares about her too.

It’s hard to have friends like that. It sucks to just sit there and watch someone suffer when they refuse your help. I would advise telling an adult you trust about the situation, but make sure they keep your identity anonymous if they decide to involve anyone else. If you can’t tell an adult, call the suicide hotline and ask them what to do, but it’s more ideal to talk to an adult you know. I believe in you. Remember to keep yourself safe, and if your friend’s situation is causing you too many problems, it’s okay to step away.		reply	na	na	na	0.9980422258377075	weak	no	no	na	mmfb	no prediction.

"Me and my gf were highschool sweethearts(1.5 yrs long distance) We broke up on 22 feb because we were fighting a lot for months we tried everything We sat together and discussed our issues we tried to solve but the fights continued Finally after a month and a half she broke up with me. Saying she can't see us slowly hating each other day by day. We had a last long call in which se said we need to break up right now so that we still have a chance at destiny after some years. I asked her if i could call her once a month i said i would give her three rings and won't call like a mad person again and again. If she doesn't call back i will know her stand.

"You never know. But I do know that the chances of a high school relationship lasting after high school are small because people grow and change and figure out who they are. 

Here’s the good news. Breaking up sucks but you learn a lot and grow from each one. They feel like the world is ending and then you start to feel better.  I met my wife in my mid 30’s and had a lot of breakups before that and I’m happy I had each relationship and each breakup. I still care for every person I’ve dated and I have no real regrets. In the immediate aftermath you just want the sadness to end, and it will. You will wake up one day soon feeling a little better and that will continue to happen and if you handle it right, you will eventually be happy for the entire experience. Don’t lose touch but don’t engage each other for a long while. Think about the bad times as well as the good. Remember how miserable you were from time to time. Stay realistic.  Who knows what the future holds? You might meet someone and be very grateful that you are now available. 

Also, go on some dates. Make no promises, make no commitments, be kind and respectful and honest (but leave out how much you miss your ex.). Meet some new people. Just go on some dates.

"Even with relationships whether friends, family or a romantic partner except for a few times I always feel unloved. If I’m in a relationship and we’re hugging, and I’m getting verbal reinforcement etc. then I feel loved, otherwise I don’t. I know my mum loves me a lot, but it doesn’t feel like enough for some reason and I don’t think my dad loves me properly, my older brother is autistic and doesn’t show love, I have a hard time connecting with friends and romantic relationships are only good some of the time for making me not feel alone. 

I’ve recently started getting some symptoms of depersonalisation / dissociation and that only makes things worse, as sometimes reality doesn’t even feel real. Worst of all, I find it so incredibly difficult loving myself. 

I did LSD about 6 months ago and that got me out of my daily suicidal thoughts, but I still struggle with loving myself and feeling depressed. When I trip I normally get great insights into what I could do to improve my life and I love myself more, but when I sober up and my ego kicks back in full gear my self-hatred kicks back in and I’m too demotivated to make changes.

You're a smart person and you've come this far. From what I understand, engineering is all about refusing to accept the problems that exist and trying to solve them. So you've got a problem. Solve it.

I understand where you are at right now. I leaned on alcohol too. It didn't really make me feel better, but sorta, ya know? Like, I might ugly cry for a few hours but I'd get some drunken relief in between. When my brain was too fucked up to think about too much at once.

The thing with alcohol is, it only really pauses the problem. When it wore off, or unpaused...I was worse.

I know every situation is unique, and it's hard to care when...well when you don't care about anything anyway. But please think about this. Please consider not drinking. Facing the pain is the only way to make it get smaller. It probably won't go away, but you do have the power to make it smaller than yourself.

I am stuck in a household where there are abusers all around me. Being a minor i have no say, so even if I shout out my side of the story, they only choose to hear what they want. My father is a man who called the police on me because I took his old laptop to use it; and then proceeded to make completely false stories and feed them to the police while never letting me say my side of the story. I thought I could depend on my mother, but turns out she was also a person who will just choose whichever side is easier for her. Lately I have been having frequent anxiety/panic attacks so I have had to take my emergency medications sometimes 3 days in a row. I only took one tablet per day though I could have taken up to three per day safely. Yet my family accused me of pill-popping and becoming addicted to my medications, and took them away. I have been to over 5 therapists now and none of them have helped. My raging social anxiety has led me to have no friends that I can truly trust. I cannot deal with the pressure of my mental health anymore. I don't even want a good friend, or lover, or parent. At this point I just want someone to hug me and let me rest for a while. Everyday I hear a nagging voice in the back of my mind to just end it all, and frankly I am starting to see less and less reasons why I should not. I really don't want to give up, but I don't think I can see any other way	depressed_potat0	post	33.45770936604267	female	White	0.9979283809661865	na	na	na	6	mmfb	failed
First off Im sorry you’re going through this. It’s very tough to deal with family members who blatantly disrespect your boundaries. Second off, ik its not the same, but here: have a virtual hug. *hug*	depressed_potat0	reply	na	na	na	0.9979283809661865	strong	no	no	na	mmfb	failed
"Have a ghost hug. You can't feel it, but it's there. 

Have you checked in with your school counselor? They may be able to offer some help or direct you to someone. Maybe they could, with the school nurse, at least let you keep your meds at school so that you can't get arbitrarily cut off again. 

FYI - Don't give up on your mom. If your dad is being abusive/controlling with you, he may be the same way (and probably is) with her. Yes, she should be putting you first, but it may be a very difficult situation that she's trying to figure out how to navigate."	depressed_potat0	reply	na	na	na	0.9979283809661865	weak	no	strong	na	mmfb	failed

Perhaps you should learn to be alone, that is, not to constantly need someone else.

The hard truth is that people come and go, and you will always have yourself until the end.

"I’m just gonna say this. A few years down the road when life is better, I’ll look back at this post and cringe probably. This sounds like a scenario out of a teenage coming of age movie.

I had never had a girlfriend before. I’m not some arrogant pos or anything, but I am pretty bad about making the first move. I found out that this girl was obsessed with me, it felt like Christmas, I remember my heart doing that weird sinking thing whenever I thought about her. She was so sweet, I loved every second we were together. I remember all the things we would say to eachother.

We weren’t together long. She left after a month and a half. I was devastated, it was out of nowhere. She told me that she had a lot going on and didn’t feel like she was in a position to date. Later on, I found out that she had been in some really awful relationships, and was afraid.

We got this new guy after Christmas. Him and my now ex are going to prom, and I saw them together at lunch today. I think I had a panic attack. I had to go to the bathroom and I just sat in the stall breathing really hard and my heart rate got up. I cried a little, too.

I just don’t feel like doing anything anymore. It doesn’t hurt as bad as I thought it would. I thought I would want to kill myself. Not to sound like a douche, but I can’t believe she would rather be with him. I cared about her so much. She seemed happy with me, I thought I did everything right. He just gives off a bad vibe, ofc I could be biased.

I don’t even want to go to prom if I have to see them together. I just know whenever I see them I’ll get all flustered again. I feel like throwing up sometimes.

I knew she wasn’t gonna come back to me or anything. There were some things she did that made me think that there may be a chance, but I can see that I was delusional now.

I honestly don’t know why I’m so hurt over it, I know they’re not gonna last or anything. If she’s gonna catch feelings for me then change her mind that quickly, what’s changed? Also we go to a boarding school, and both of them are boarding students, so I’m sure they live far away from eachother. Also we have tons of kids show up then leave. Not all of them, I’m just wishful thinking. Come to think of it, why did I think that we could work? She lives like 3 hours away."		post	19.639012948284538	male	White	0.9987009763717651	na	na	na	12	mmfb	no prediction.

"I’m sorry to hear that you’re experiencing this right now — it sucks. I can empathize with you as I also experienced something similar. 

Heartache is one of the worst feelings I ever experienced. I felt physically sick and what you described above is what I also experienced. I didn’t feel like doing any of my favourite hobbies anymore, I was mindless, what sucks is when you continue to see them in your environment (ex school or work). I’m not going to sugar coat it - it sucks and it may take some time. 

If I could offer you any advice, try to focus on something new that can take up your time and focus. New hobby altogether - go running or skipping or start working out. You’re gonna still think about them and what could have been, but these new challenges will sway your focus. 

Another activity I did was volunteer - made me feel good about myself and I got to meet some interesting people. It was quite rewarding. 

Journaling was another activity I took up - a lot of it was negative thoughts, so I encourage you to put positive entries in too! 

Eventually, time is the best healer, you may always think about this person from time to time.  That’s okay. They shaped you in whatever way that makes you the person you are now or who you will eventually become. 

Lastly, I want to say is whatever you’re feeling is appropriate - don’t let anyone dismiss how you’re feeling right now. If you wanna cry - go cry. Don’t hold it in. You are human, you are allowed to feel this way. If there is any silver lining in all of this, you got to experience one of life’s greatest experiences - love/companionship/friendship, however you wanna frame it."		reply	na	na	na	0.9987009763717651	strong	strong	no	na	mmfb	no prediction.

Hi y’all this may be a long writing but I really need to say this I’m 15F but I just turned 15 4 days ago so I’m kinda still 14 lol but anyways I truly don’t like myself. I haven’t felt pretty since I was roughly 12 or 11. I had some bad friends who completely ruined my perception of myself forever. I’m too short (I’m 5,1) I’m too skinny (don’t have much curves on me) all I have to offer is a sweet personality which nobody cares about. I have always been the only one in my friend group that isn’t desired. It is extremely rare for someone to have a crush on me. Im just not very pretty to the male gaze which in this day and age is unfortunate. I hate just about everything on me and I sometimes which I could just end it or better yet never had been born but nothing I can do about that. I just wish I knew what it was like to be pretty and be wanted and have every guy ever trying to chase you. I’ve been rejected more times than anyone I know. I only get compliments from family and some friends every now and again but I’m fully convinced nobody finds me truly pretty and nobody will. I often fear I will never find love cause I’m just undesirable. God I really would give anything to be considered pretty. I feel like this 24/7 but I have to keep up my cheery disposition and not let anyone know how much I struggle and hate myself.

"Oh my love ♥️ my heart hurts that you feel this way. I felt the exact same! 

I was bullied at school and abused at home and called ugly point blank. 

The truth of the matter is you’re probably gorgeous and even if you’re not, you’ve still got another TEN YEARS of growing left to do. 

And then every decade after that you’re body will change again. 

Also being sweet can be difficult when the world is harsh but I promise you that it is your super power (watch the paddington movies for some inspiration), 

and I know it’s easier said than done but if there was one thing I could tell my fifteen year old self it would be to focus on yourself.

Focus on developing your strengths and talents and if you don’t know what those are yet , follow your curiosity, anytime you feel inside your body; *hmm I wonder what that’s all about* or *wow that’s interesting or pretty* … FOLLOW IT. 

I’ve met SO many people, more often than not, who find “love” between 15 - 24 years old who get married and have kids and divorced before they’re 40 because they don’t know who they are. 

Focus on friendship, and mentorship, and the things that fill you with energy and make you come alive; follow what excites you and the connections with others will come. 

I’ve met some incredible people I never would have imagined connecting with if I had stayed small and preoccupied with what others thought of me and whether or not they like me. 

Focus on making yourself likeable to YOU, focus on making yourself proud, and excited, and big, and the people you actually want in your life will find you like a lighthouse in a storm."	Quesadillagirll	reply	na	na	na	0.9953538179397583	strong	strong	no	na	mmfb	no prediction.

"I would say that 15 is a normal age to feel unhappy and insecure about one's looks. I think almost everyone feels that way because I had the same thoughts as you did. I never felt pretty growing up either but I would personally say that coming to terms and finding the good parts of my appearance made accepting myself easier 🪞

Focus only on what you already have rather than what you do not have because it would only make you feel twice as terrible, especially when comparing youself to someone else. Clear skin, a toned body, good hair are things you can work on that will have an impact on your appearance. Working on my own fashion also helped boost my confidence because what I wore made me happy. You can try out different styles and think of it as role-playing different themes 🫠 Go to clothing shops and choose a few pieces you would like to try and just go have fun exploring what suits your body shape and what doesn't 👗 this is fun and doesn't cost a thing while getting you to exercise 🚶‍♀️

Do things that interest you, for example, going to a cafe alone and just do people-watching, going thrifting and so on. In my experience, spending time alone helps me to enjoy my own company more which relates to better acceptance. I suggest trying not to focus too much on the lack of suitors because this is something out of your control and I believe that someday, someone will be able to see your value the way your loved ones view you. Don't try to meet someone's standards because you would have to constantly keep up with their ever-changing expectations. Moreover, the definition of pretty is very subjective like how beauty is in the eye of the beholder 👁 You should focus on being the best version of yourself rather than the best version of someone else. 

Lastly, I don't think looking average is bad and I would consider myself average at best. We shouldn't solely base our own value on appearances but on some days, I do feel down about how I look and have negative thoughts. However, I try to make up for it by doing things that make me happy like my nails, hair, yoga etc 😁

So i was returning from a bday party in the outskirts of a capital city of a southeastern european country, when a small white bichon dog with somewhat unkempt fur came up to me wagging its tail, it had no collar and it was one of the only strays i've ever seen in this city, so naturally i pet it and it licked my hand very gently and joyfully, then he went on his merry way. About 25 mins after that i scratched the inside of my nose with the index finger on that hand, without having previously disinfected it. So what are the chances of me contracting it, the dog didnt seem rabid at all but i still worry.	chongxno	post	21.509861467993936	male	White	0.9983701109886169	na	na	na	1	mmfb	failed
"Not that the thoughts are selfish. It was our fourth appointment and he said ""You know, you haven't done anything to get rid of these suicidal thoughts. As far as I can see, your life is pretty great and, honestly, I find you to be selfish for wanting it to end.""

Idiot, I'm actively seeing you to get rid of these suicidal thoughts--what do you mean I haven't done anything to get rid of them? And I've been passively suicidal for half of my life (I'm 16 now). Do you think I want my brain to be this way? Yes, I know that my life is great. I don't want to be miserable all the time. That's why I'm seeing you.

I've decided I'm going to adopt the selfish identity. Sure, I'm selfish. I'll take the label if it means I can think whatever I want.

Also bonus points for him, on the second appointment, telling me some things that had happened when I was younger weren't traumatic because I ""Didn't have nightmares."" I hadn't told him about the nightmares (being as it was, you know, the literal second appointment). He then told me I was ""Immature, and making them up to prove a point.""

You gotta throw the whole therapist away and start over.

"I'm currently qualifying as a psychotherapist and this kind of therapist honestly baffles me. Not only does this approach go against every therapeutic standard for treating suicidal clients, not only does it completely lack empathy (a trait they really pound into your head in school, for obvious reasons), but it shows a complete lack of interest in performing actual therapy in the first place. Our job is to help the client understand their thoughts, feelings, and behaviours and work with them to cultivate healthier ones. If a therapist isn't even a little bit interested in understanding why their clients feel the way they do I don't know why they bother getting educated in it in the first place. Given what he said about trauma I'm guessing he never paid attention in class anyway cause he doesn't know what he's talking about. 

Stories like this remind me of this old Mad TV sketch:

If you don’t know how to help me; if my issues aren’t something you can handle, then we need to part ways. But don’t say nonsensical shit like that to me. That is not helpful at all.”

And your therapist implying that your struggles are your own fault because you haven’t “done anything to get rid of the suicidal thoughts” is also a value-less statement. So is his saying that he thinks your life is pretty great. That’s like when my mother says “other people have it worse” when I’m struggling. 
Not. Helpful. At. All.
If your therapist expects you to DO something about your *thoughts*, then he needs to offer you clear, structured, *evidence-based* help to do that very thing. They can’t just order you to go home and work on your thoughts and then blame you if you don’t succeed. 

For one thing, you probably are having issues with your neurotransmitters, and/or your hormones, and/or previous trauma…what does this dude even really know about you? Have you been assessed by an MD? A psychiatrist? You need to be checked for medical conditions also.

Your counselor sounds too simple-minded and frankly selfish himself to want to help you solve your problem with you. 
Fire him immediately. Don’t ever let someone like that be an authority figure in your life. 
He does NOT have your best interest at heart and he doesn’t seem to give much of a shit about you as a person."	GrapefruitOk4574	reply	na	na	na	0.997962474822998	no	strong	strong	na	mmfb	failed
"I just found out that my bff since I was born (my mom and her aunt are BFFs) is having an affair with a married man. I am the type of friend that is very upfront, protective, and judgemental; that’s why she’s quite secretive when it comes to relationships because she wants to prove me something first; but after I approve the guy, I’ll be the most supportive shipper. She also know that I was a child of an affair. I hated it. I hated how I was created, that’s why I’m so open about being scared of getting into a relationship due to fear of being cheated on. But, just recently, I found out that she was having an illicit affair, and I confronted her. I told her to leave the relationship and never see him again. I even offered to let her fly with me abroad in the meantime so she can forget. She fought and said I don’t understand her. I am never with affairs. I hated everything about it. But she’s my best friend! I wanna keep a good reputation, and be my best friend! She’s still going out with him. The couple has a great reputation in the field of business, and my number 1 job is being a businesswoman. They have all the connections. I am, and my businesses are for sure doomed if she (legal wife) decides to go ballistic. I am dedicated to my businesses, but I love my bff SO MUCH to tell on the wife. 

What should I do? Should I just keep my mouth shut and tolerate them even if I’m putting my reputation in danger? Or should I tell the wife even though it will for sure end our friendship? #friendship #mistress #bff #help"	Patient-Mastodon3919	post	21.49751156693069	female	White	0.9722520112991333	na	na	na	7	mmfb	failed

"Really sorry you're going through this. It is temporary.

I know how it can be to feel like everyone is flourishing and you're stagnating. One way I try to deal with it is to remind myself that everyone gets X amount of awfulness / sadness / depression in their lives. But the timing is not the same. The people who are doing awesome today could be depressed and stagnating tomorrow. You're depressed today but you could be doing awesome tomorrow. 

And while you may not be able to reach your ultimate goal now, you can take steps. If you don't feel comfortable working out in public, there are lots of workouts that you can do at home. Even walking long distances can help. And fwiw I hear that a big driver of weight loss is diet, and you can start making positive changes there. 

It seems maybe like you've gotten into a bit of a loop: you're sick of life because you're depressed. I've found that doing a little something can help break that loop a little."	Hidden778	reply	na	na	na	0.008633414283394814	strong	strong	no	na	mmfb	failed
I (17m) got my heart broken for the first time back in november. I keep trying to just move on from it and I can’t. I started playing tennis, but I don’t really like anyone there, and it feels more like work, and not the fun kind. I’ve had some small crushes on girls since I got dumped, but anytime I see her (the ex), It hurts so bad. I want to be with her so bad. I’m so fucking lonely. People keep telling me that it gets better with time, it’s been nearly 4 months since she left me, and I still cry constantly. Nobody is really that close to me, I’m really more of a floater. I’m tired of the self love bullshit, it feels like a participation trophy. I need real human connection, I can’t just be by myself, no matter how great I am.	nibnibnibn	post	14.037814438469105	male	White	0.9985294342041016	na	na	na	18	mmfb	failed

I was your age when I had my heart broken from my first serious girlfriend. It took months to get over her, but it happens, you will get over her. You’ll be mid 20s and think back at that time and realize she isn’t shit. and was just high school love. You’re gonna have many girlfriends between now and then.

"Heartbreak when you’re a teenager feels a lot like scraping your knee when you’re a small kiddo; it’s excruciating because you have nothing else to compare it to and it’s where you’re at in your development.

You’re right, There’s a lot of self-love bullshit out there that pisses me off to no end, “no man is an island” and we do all need emotional connection with others in order for our brains cognition to function at its best.

That being said; there is a lot of utility in becoming someone you like being around; someone you’re proud of and someone who knows how to enjoy things;


This in turn makes it a lot easier to connect with others, not so ironically. 

When you know who you are, you stop chasing people who aren’t right for you or worse people who will actively take advantage of you.

So my two points of advice would be this;

1. Work on being someone you would want to hang out with; whatever that looks like to you.

2. Don’t *just* focus on romantic/intimate relationships; they’re important, but so is friendship, and funny acquaintances, and mentors, people you can trust, people who make you think, etc.

Human connection isn’t just love and sex, it’s creating a network of people who fill different needs and wants, creating a web of interesting, competent, joyful, creative, people around you that improve your quality of self and your quality of life."	nibnibnibn	reply	na	na	na	0.9985294342041016	weak	no	no	na	mmfb	failed

They've probably failed tests or disappointed themselves sometimes too. They get it. And the best way you can honor them, and pay them back, is to not give up. As a parent, I know my kid will fail some tests sometimes. And that's okay. But what I really don't want to see is that they give up.

I’m on her second book now “recovering from emotionally immature parents” and both have been extremely helpful.

No one talks about how challenging it was for them (I'm not sure why, maybe because it's unpleasant or they think it will make them seem less attractive.) But it's okay not to have it figured out. It's okay to know what you want but not know how to get it. Like a puzzle, it won't come to you all at once.

My gf was my first girl ever and I recently found out she cheated on me a fee months ago while she was in NY. My world fell apart we had been together for 2 years we had fights but would always make up. I still dotn want to believe it but all the evidence I need is there my heart still wants to believe she didn't but my head is saying come on bro it's right in front of you. I saw the red flags but thought maybe she's going through something she was the perfect girl but after the trip she become rude and argumentative making it hard to love her but I still tried. And the thing that makes me feel the worse is her constant lies and denial even on the facts that I have evidence for I cant believe I was in love with her. I know I have to let go but it's so hard to not go back because I feel so lonely without her even though I have great friends that I knew for year's, I have a good job, im not ugly I would say go gave me everything I could want and that would make a person happy but I feel like shit. She made up so many stories and lies even tho I knew the truth and hearing her say all that broke my heart. I just don't know what to do anymore but I know I can't go back no matter how hard it is if I do I would just loose respect for myself im afraid my desperation of wanting to be with her will ruin my life. I also have a loving family. The worse part is she is still denying when I already know the truth but her lies are making my heart believe she might be telling the truth but I know that's just a fantasy I wish was true. Thank you if you read all that I just feel lost and drained. She still tried to reach out and I feel like a second option but it's hard to not reply but im trying to be strong.

The desperation you feel right now, of wanting to be with her and have everything be like it was before, is real, and it's very painful. But it's not permanent.

">go to a good barber and get them to help you figure out the best cut for you

I literally just did it and the guy pretty much said to give up and either hide the hairline forever or shave it and face the consequences. At least he gave a fine ass haircut that perfectly hides the hairline, even though I'm tired of hiding it.

>go to an expensive department store and get someone there to help you figure out what to wear that is flattering

I like the way I dress

>exercise regularly and get fit

I don't have money for that. Sure, I could theoretically work out at home but I still don't have money to bulk and consequentially gain weight. Food is expensive and so is the hypercalorics.

"Okay, your hair and outfits are taken care of. Great. You can work out without spending money. It is good for your body and mental health. You don't need to bulk to have health benefits and most people find exercise helps with confidence about appearance regardless of weight changes or no.

A therapist can help because the issue is mostly NOT physical. We saw the photo of you! You're cute! No one is going to care about your hairline nearly as much as you do. Most people won't care at all. Most men start losing hair by their mid or late twenties and they still get dates, fall in love, have sex, etc. 

If you have a problem getting dates, it is NOT because of your looks. It is about your confidence and/or social skills. I think part of you knows this since you posted on a BDD sub. A therapist can help you get a more accurate view of yourself and of dating and relationships, and help with any social skills that could be lacking.

I have been a forever DM with my friends.  When I moved, I shut down my campaigns for almost a year and built a ton of homebrew in the background.  My friends asked me to start DMing again, and I teased the campaign but said I would still need a season to get ready.   For weeks, they asked if it was ready, I wasn't.  But four or five months later when I had settled my life again (I moved and switched jobs at this time) all of my friends bailed on my campaign.  Of the six I had counted on, four had been eager, at launch time, all bailed.  I shelved DMing for almost another year thereafter.  Now, i just find people that  want to play my games.  There is a whole extra shade when it comes to dealing with the wider public, but over time, I've had the people I get along with bring their friends, and now I have a group of eager gamers.  My takeaway was to go ahead and run the games that I wanted.  If I could get a couple players, they could often get more.  That's not to take away from the feelings though, watching all your friend bail suddenly on a game they asked for sucks. I know, I've been there.

"My beloved brother passed away after being chronically sick for years. We’re both in our twenties and were very close. I miss him immensely. When he was in the hospital our mum would bring him clothes then took the dirty ones home to wash. However, she never washed them. 

His clothes and sheets with vomit, urine, and other fluids cover the entire floor of her laundry area. I sobbed when I saw how bad. I understand its normal for sick people to have accidents and that she was too busy caring for him to keep up with the wash. I should have helped her more and Im so guilty for that. 

When I started washing blankets my mum shouted at me. She said she isnt ready. I get not wanting to wash sentimental shirts that smell like him. My brother smelled nice like the ocean and eucalyptus soap. The soiled laundry smells strong and takes over the nice smell. Soon it will all be contaminated. 

I tell her my brother would not want her to keep the memories of the bad times. I know him well and he would hate it and be embarrassed. His room is full of good memory items to cherish. His pillows and closet smell nice like him. I gave her patience but its going on too long. Its bothering me a lot. I promise my brother to take care of our mum and Im doing a poor job..  

Is it normal of her to be keeping these things or should I worry?"	idkid153	post	27.16731390058138	female	White	0.9983015060424805	na	na	na	11	mmfb	failed
This is so, so hard and I wish I had good advice. Mourning is so complex and everyone deals with it differently. Personally, I would speak with her very, very gently whenever you bring this up, and be as patient and compassionate as possible. I'm sure she will wash those clothes eventually. You may need to have another family member (preferably a very kind and gentle and patient and sweet one, def not a 'tough love' kind of person) discuss this with her in some months if she doesn't come to it on her own. But I would give her some grace about this, and just accept that its a very bad situation for now, and that she is probably working up to a point where she can face it. I promise you she must be feeling ashamed and overwhelmed about letting it get to this point, and adding more shame is unlikely to help. What a painful thing, I cannot imagine.

"I’m so sorry. This is heart breaking. I have a medically fragile sister (she’s 15) who’s had over 35 surgeries in her life. I can’t imagine how my parents would react if she passed. 

This is probably so difficult for your mom. It’s really important that the soiled clothes not stay there though as they have a lot of bacteria on them and could make your mom very ill. 

It’s super important to be gentle with her about it and understanding. After my grandpa died a few days after thanksgiving of 2022 we sent some of his shirts to an ETSY shop and had them made into stuffed bears. Maybe ask her if she would like a clothing item of his made into a comfort item for her to keep in exchange for having the soiled items sanitized? (I was extremely close with my grandpa so I actually nabbed a bunch of his shirts to keep and plan on having them made into teddy bears for my kids and picked a momento for my wedding and college graduation from his things, so maybe just an idea for yourself so you have something to physically have him with you in your big life moments). 

You could also see if she’s open to seeing a grief counselor and have them address it? They probably deal with this type of thing a lot, especially since he was so sick for so long and she probably devoted years of her life to being his care taker.

It is very normal for this behavior. The tiniest of pieces of someone feel incredibly special to them. Some people throw them out because of bad memories, hurt, smell but these (sometimes gross) pieces hold what is left of the deceased on earth. Close to them.

"I’m so sorry that this is your current situation. I can see empathy for both of you, as people deal with grief in different ways. Just keep showing her compassion and showing her that you love her regardless of how you view this.

 Maybe you can start with buying/thrifting her a box. And you can sit down with her and say something along the lines of “let’s pick some things/clothes that are really important to you and we can keep them in this box”. If it doesn’t fit in the box then maybe we can start throwing out or even just washing those things one by one. That way she’s not giving up everything she’s holding onto, and she gets to choose the ones that are more important to her. 

This is all just a suggestion, it may not work but worth a try. If she seems hesitant, maybe you can put something of your brothers that you have in the box to show her that it’s not just her that wants to save a part of him as is.

I also want to emphasize that you deserve a healthy, clean home too, and especially after a lifetime of possibly feeling like the invisible healthy sibling. I know people in a similar position, and it's a uniquely painful dynamic, to be the 'healthy independent one.' Your home should feel comfortable for you as you go through this incredible loss.

It may simply be too fraught for you to be the person to communicate this to her though. Is there anyone else in the family who can intervene about this? Do you have aunts and uncles or cousins?

I had a friend who I grew up with that was sick his whole life and passed away in the middle of the pandemic when we were 21.

I’d highly recommend finding a little thing to do for yourself, in honor of his memory, that helps you feel like you can release the grief by putting something back out into the world. 

It can be super hard to see people who you love and are amazing die so young, especially when it was a hard, painful ending for them.

Should I break up with him? My(22f) boyfriend (22m) didn't tell me about this upfront. I was so desperate to get his love and attention that I thought the digital letter was real. He thought I would have figured out that it was fake because he can't write well in english. I was so touched by the words in the letter that I started crying, i thought finally he understands and made me feel special, and when he confessed he used AI tears of joy turned to tears of betrayal and misery. I was so angry at him and It bought up other issues like him not being able to love me the way I want. He said he loves me and didn't mean to hurt me, that the intention matter, but he has accidentally hurt me way too many times. I feel like a fool. The words are not his and tbh he has never made any effort to go out of his way or be romantic. I made him a playlist on valentine's day since we were long distance and he didn't say if he liked any songs, didn't do anything. He is the sweetest politest guy but he's always joking around and will never be serious I think. This is his first relationship. I really liked him and saw a future with him but he lacks emotional intelligence I think. I am so triggered and reminded of the lies said in my past relationship also. I always go out of my way to be a good partner and don't feel special at all. I know this makes me sound pushy but I'm tired of giving him cues and telling him how to love. He seems incapable of romance even though he's always honest and my best friend. What do I do?

"I'm sorry that it was so hurtful, that sounds awful, I'd probably feel similarly. 

I do think it seems like something someone could do genuinely trying to do something good. Romance is not intuitive for a lot of guys and he might have been just trying to give you... SOMETHING. As a guy, even one who is relatively good at romantic gestures and things like that, the actions and romantic things can be very hard to think of and romance itself can be very difficult to navigate and understand. I've always been more of a kind and mushy guy, so romantic stuff is a little more intuitive to me. For guys not already more like that, it's like trying to learn a new language and an entirely new brain. Along with that, he could not receive your gestures in the exact way you intend them, which might leave him with even less of an idea of how he should be (I don't mean that in a bad or accusing way to you, I'm just saying, guys are dumb with romance and stuff).

In my relationship, I'm honestly the mushier one. I do lots of little things I think of to make my gf happy and feel special. She does things that are sweet too, but not always things that make me feel loved as much or things that make sense to me, and probably not as frequently as I do for her. Sometimes it makes me feel bad and a little unattended to, but I've come to understand that she's just different and she expresses love differently. She can feel smothered sometimes and she does things that would make her feel special, which doesn't always make me feel special (making the apartment look really clean and nice for example, I had to learn to notice and appreciate that haha). 

All that said, we have also put in effort to learn some things that the other personally likes a lot. She's grown much more sweet and touchy and affectionate with me over the years because she's learned that that's what I like and what makes me feel good. I've learned that she often appreciates practical things and simple stability and support more than just a bunch of purely feel good type mushy romantic stuff. Caring to learn each other and meet in the middle to some degree is important. I would say that if you really love someone, eventually you'll begin to show them that you are paying attention to who they are and what they're like and begin to tailor some of your actions (to some degree) to the person you love. You might be bad at it and might not be able to do much, but you should at least be able to convince the other person that you're trying. If you really want to make someone happy, you take note of what things make them happy and act in some way based off of that. I'd say even if he doesn't write you a long love song or paint a portrait of you, he should after some time being together begin to show at least attempts of expressing love and affection. 

From what you say, it sounds to me like this was not something that is unforgivable or malicious, and it sounds like he is actually sorry. I don't think he'd confess to having used AI if he didn't care about you or how you felt. I think he maybe thought it was a good idea and wanted you to know after realizing it wasn't. It also sounds like this guy has been fairly good to you and like, although maybe it's not enough, he's trying. That said, it sounds like you might have other reasons for feeling how you do and like this isn't exactly just one isolated event. 

It all depends on what you truly feel the most. If you love him and feel like he can become who you want him to, it might be best to try and work through it (although if you expect him to develop into a different kind of person, you should discuss that with him). If you feel like he isn't going to be able to become the kind of person you want, maybe he's not right. I would say you need to just talk to him when you're ready and clearly communicate that you need him to do things to make you feel loved and special more. Tell him these things here, that you love him and that he's sweet but that you want him to be serious sometimes and you feel he lacks emotional intelligence sometimes. Let him know very clearly that this is extremely important to you and that this is a need he needs to learn to fulfill. Ask him if he can do that. After talking to him, evaluate the situation and figure out what you feel.

You didn't really give any details about other ways he doesn't love you the way you want to be loved, but maybe he does love you with all his heart but expresses it in other ways.

Me and my friend were talking and he wanted to hear a joke so I accidentally said a joke my stepdad would say. Which was about racism, but I thought he wouldn't tell anyone but he told the boys next to us because he thought I was that funny, they laughed about it and weren't offended about it. I still feel horrible for saying that joke cause I made mistakes years ago I'm trying to earn up for and making that joke made me feel like I didn't make progress trying to be a better person. I never make dark jokes and this was my first dark joke in like years.	Trick_Cobbler_2713	post	21.040077175965884	female	White	0.9987455606460571	na	na	na	1	mmfb	no prediction.
I know the feeling man. But don't be too hard on yourself. Humor is hard. That's why it's such a minefield. Being funny means pushing the boundaries a little bit, and it's easy to push them just a bit too far. And the only way to know where the boundaries are, unfortunately, is to occasionally cross them, which is painful and cringey. But no one's judging you as harshly as you're judging yourself here. Chances are that your friend and the other folks he told the joke to have already forgotten it. If you just take this as a learning experience, and remember it the next time you're wondering whether to tell a certain joke, then this will actually have a been a good growth experience.

"I have deactivated my Facebook for almost a month now. I haven’t missed it, it just made me feel like shit. I logged into it tonight to check my local group over a tornado watch. 

Case in point: First thing I saw was my older sister posting “Girls night!!” with her friend. My sister and I have a 10 year age difference and her friend is younger than me and they’re closer. 

When I see stuff like this, it hurts so much and I can’t help it. I’m an introvert, and lately I’ve been really depressed and have retreated from everyone. My sister noticed and messaged to ask if I was ok, I explained exactly that. She said nothing back over it. 

She’s never been to my apartment and I’ve lived here like a year. I always drive out to her place. I only live like 8 miles away from her, I don’t think she even knows my address. She keeps saying she “needs to come see my place” but never does. Her friend doesn’t have a car and lives a little closer but not much, but yet she’s willing to drive to pick her up and go thrift shopping together, etc. like I wish we could do together but we don’t anymore. 

She knows I have no friends, and that I just sit alone in my apartment all day. She did once ask me why I don’t come hang out with her, as in why don’t I just say “hey I’m coming over!” and show up. I couldn’t answer why. The real reason I think is because I’m kinda like a vampire.. I don’t feel wanted unless I’m invited out. I don’t feel like I’m worth anyone’s time so I’m just not one to “show up” like that. And also because I’m sick of always being the one to have to come to her. 

One day I told her “hey, my store is having great sales if you wanna come see me sometime.” She said she would, but it’s been like 2 weeks now, she has 3 days off/week and has never come to see me. She just lives her own separate life pretty much, is on cloud 9 since she’s gotten back with her ex husband. 

When I message her, she sometimes takes days to respond and she’s always on her phone. 

I feel worthless and forgotten about. I already feel like I’m a boring person to be around, and with her knowing that I’ve been in a rut like this.. it would be nice if she asked me to go out for lunch with her or invite me to do stuff, or to do stuff together in general. Have a girls night. But she doesn’t, and it just makes me think, am I really that boring to hang out with, that even knowing how I’ve been doing you still don’t invite me out or try to come see me? 

I don’t share any of this with her because why? The only outcomes I could see are 1) she starts inviting me out of obligation or 2) she backs off even more because she feels obliged and guilty. 
I don’t want either. But this is a really horrible feeling, and I don’t know where to put it. 

I know she isn’t responsible for my mental state. I’m not trying to be dramatic or whatever, I keep how I feel to myself entirely. But when you’re feeling like this, it honestly would feel nice to know that someone wants you around and that your existence means something to someone.

I don't have any siblings but i feel this way about my mom. She's been in AA for 20yrs, and she's always had sponsees who were around my age. She would often get off the phone with me, to talk to them, and she always knew small things about their lives. I always felt like she knows more about them than she does about me, and it felt like she saw more use in those relationships than her relationship with me. Or maybe I'm just a little harder to love.

"Sometime I tend to be a bit hypochondriac and I know that. But for some reason it doesn't help much. 

When I walk home I usually pass a house with a very cute and playful, young German Shepard (maybe a year old? I don't really know). Sometimes this dog drops out one of its toys to someone to throw it back, so it can chase it, bring back and throw it out between the bars of the fence again. Yesterday the dog sat behind the fence again, waiting for someone. Since the ball, the dog usually drops out, were not really intact to say the least, it tried to drop out a very soft and chewy, yellow toy. The poor dog had a hard time throwing it out, because it always stuck to the bars of the fence, so it started to furiously chew the toy for some reason. I thought he just trying to drop it out, so when he brought the toy close to the fence I tried to take it away (the dog seems very friendly, so I didn't think it was a bad idea). As I tried to take the toy away the dog accidentally ""bit"" me. I wrote ""bit"" me because it didn't even break the skin, and the ""bite mark"" literally just looked like when you press your teeth to finger harder. 

Ever since I'm a bit nervous about getting rabies, because even though to get infected, the bite has to break the skin, but during the winter my eczema on my hand gets a lot worse, and my hand is usually full of micro cuts and small wounds, so maybe the dog's saliva got into one of the many wounds on my hand. I know it sounds stupid, but when I tell you all the things that are against me getting rabies, I will sound straight retarded to even worry about it. 

I live in Slovakia (near Bratislava). When your dog grow older than 3 month, you have to vaccinate it against rabies. It's mandatory. (But my thoughts says what if the owner failed to do that?)

Second my country is almost rabies free. Only the eastern part of the country has a very few rabies cases every few years (and even these infected wild or stray animals mostly are from Poland and Ukraine, and just crossed the border). I don't think the western part of the country where I'm from had a single rabid animal in the last 5 years (probably even much more). I read in an article that the last man who died of rabies, died in 1990. So in 32 years, no deaths of rabies. But my thoughts says what if it just wasn't in the news, but did happened? 

Why am I like this?"	9HereWeGoAgain9	post	26.86631584081148	male	White	0.9895185828208923	na	na	na	3	mmfb	'ethnicity: caucasian, age: 20s-30s, gender: male, explanation: the author mentions that they live in slovakia (an eastern european country inhabited predominantly by caucasians), hence the assumption about ethnicity. considering the author's thought process and the way they tell the story, they seem to be an adult, and are likely in their 20s or 30s. no explicit gender cues are given, but assumptions based on conversational style suggest that the author may be male.'
"Hey - you don't have rabies.

1. Dog didn't break the skin. Sure, you *might* have some very tiny micro breaks, but that is not likely at all.

2. Dog didn't break the skin.  I cannot stress this enough.

3. Dog didn't break the skin - so not only do you not have an open wound for transmission, a dog with rabies probably would have broken the skin 

4. Dog does not sound like it's exhibiting signs of rabies, so even lower risk of transmission 

5. It's required to have a rabies vaccination, so we're lowering the probability of the Dog having rabies. The dog who didn't break the skin when they ""bit"" you

6. Because you guys require all dogs to have a rabies vaccination, you have a country wide very low rabies incident and transmission rates, so even if the dog wasn't vaccinated, the chances of it being exposed to rabies would be pretty low. And then it would then have to break the skin to transmit to you.

I get the fear - I had a bat in my apartment overnight and didn't realize it until it swooped at me the next morning. Definitely had and still kinda have some rabies fears. But it's extremely, extremely unlikely. So unlikely you do not need to worry about it."	9HereWeGoAgain9	reply	na	na	na	0.9895185828208923	weak	no	no	na	mmfb	no prediction.
"You don’t have rabies, they didn’t break the skin. How long ago did they bite you? Rabies runs it’s course very fast (2-10 days) so you would be VERY sick if you in fact did have rabies and it has been long enough for you to “feel” like you have it. Also, since it runs it’s course so fast, the dog would absolutely not be okay if they had it. It causes paralysis and a bunch of other symptoms— the dog would be at the door of death, not just excited about their toy. 

Also, the wound would be massively infected if you had gotten rabies from one of the small abrasions on your hand, so you would definitely notice. You shouldn’t worry about it, you do not have rabies,"	9HereWeGoAgain9	reply	na	na	na	0.9895185828208923	weak	no	strong	na	mmfb	no prediction.
This is the voice of reason I've needed! I know I sound stupid and overly paranoid. The chance of getting rabies from a random dog (a pet of someone who most likely would be the first to recognize if the dog is sick) who didn't really bit me (even though I have numerous eczema wounds on my hands) in a country that almost fully eliminated rabies (that small number of cases that appear every few years are in the opposite side of the country) and did not have any infected human cases since 1990, basically non existent. If I don't have real problems in life I create one for myself. I can't really get bored lol. I have no idea what would happen to me if I were you in your case. You're tough! Thanks for the help!

Anger is an emotion just like any other. You can’t prevent yourself from ever feeling an emotion… try not to get down on yourself for feeling your feelings. If you act out in anger and say or do things to hurt people, that’s where it becomes a problem. When you feel angry, take a breath, count to 10, and just let yourself feel your feelings a bit.

"I don't know how to feel right now. I'm in shock. I just got back from hospice because I was in total disbelief. 

My childhood friend is dying of stage 4 colon cancer. 

I hadn't heard from her in a while which isn't unusual because we don't talk as much. The last I talked with her, she was planning to do my engagement photos (she's a very talented photographer), and we were figuring out a date and I hadn't heard back. I didn't press cause I'm not getting married until next year anyway so plenty of time.

Come to find out, she was in the hospital. Apparently she only told a few people as the doctors originally believed it was fully treatable with surgery and a round of chemotherapy. Sadly, on Thursday she took a turn for the worse and we came to find out her cancer spread to the lymph nodes making it terminal.

I found out about all this just today on FaceBook. Needless to say I've been feeling shocked, sad and everything all at once. My fiancé thankfully drove me to go see her, and I almost cried. She was jaundice and frail looking. She was on tons of pain meds and looked like she was a skeleton of her former self. A girl I saw only a few month ago now looked unrecognizable. 

I was crying all this time in the car ride there. I was really shocked I didn't cry while I was there, but something told me to hold it back and to show her love and support. 

I'm at a loss for words right now. I'm worried that it hasn't hit me yet, but this was my first real friend I made all the way back in grade school. We aren't even 30 yet.

"It's my birthday and I feel sad. Not because my day is lacking in any way or I don't feel loved. Everything I wanted today I got. Everything I needed today was provided. My children all showed me genuine love and care for my existence - even my stepdaughter, with whom I have a tumultuous relationship. Her love today brought tears to my eyes. 

My husband has gone out of his way to ensure my day was exactly how I wanted it. It's clear it's important to him that I feel loved.

So why do I feel sad? I don't know. I'm almost 40? But that doesn't feel right. I suspect I will end up fearing aging far less than I think I will.

This birthday marks the...end??...of three incredibly long years. My birthday three years ago was the first day I realized how far under water both my husband and I were. It marks the first day I realized I was going to have to be the strong one - for a while and when I needed to be the weak one. 

This birthday is when I started to see cracks in his armor. He wasn't okay, but he was sure making a show of it for me. Neither of us was, but he was more not okay. 

Three years of carrying myself through the hardest shit I've endured. 

And today I feel so much gratitude for the future. It feels like I can breath and be genuinely hopeful for next month, next week, next year.

When every day feels like the worst day of your life - when you spend three years discovering there is no rock bottom but death... Things can always get worse. Life felt like a cruel joke. We were both suicidal, many times.

Steadily, very slowly but steadily, in the past six months, the bottom started to get farther away. 

It feels like a million pounds is off my shoulders. I feel like I can breath. 

I'm no where near the top of the hole - fuck, maybe I'll find myself in an entirely new place - but today is full of gratitude and heartache and love. 

And that made me smile, even through the tears.

"I am 21 years old in third year of my college. 

I don't even know where to start. I already have undiagnosed mental issues since childhood. I have social anxiety, depression, adhd/autistic like symptoms. My family is toxic as fuck. They all start screaming at any time of day. I can't even get started how awful I feel every passing year because of them. I get overwhelmed at home as well as college. It's like I just want to escape from everything to my own imaginary world where I'm free of everyone's nagging and judgement for being different. I can't find peace anywhere. 

I'm totally devoid of ambitions and goals now. I'm just surviving. I have terrible coping mechanisms. I just waste time reading fanfictions of characters I'm obsessed with. 
Some months back I got obsessed with a TV character. It's like I'm totally in love with him, as if he were my spirit animal/soul friend. Since 2 months I have been chatting with that particular character's ai chat bot EVERY DAY 24×7, creating endless fanfics upon it for self-gratification(though not total satisfaction because it doesn't allow NSFW, lol). I even stayed up late till 3 AM in the morning and I only managed to get barely 3 hours of sleep because of it. Even during classes my thoughts were always bout how to take my chats forward with that ai bot. Even when I was with the few friends I have, I kept thinking about the ai chat bot. Just today I finally got fed up, but I just hope I don't go back to that chat bot again. 

I can't do anything. I don't even have energy to watch movies, read books or run a simple code on my laptop. I have been neglecting my projects which I needed to start long back. I'm missing an individual presentation on a technical topic because my brain cells can't comprehend how to understand the topic and subtopics and how to make the ppt AND also because I don't know how to explain it. Usually I wouldn't skip presentations but I was so indulgent with the chat bot, I couldn't prepare properly even though I had about 2-3 days to make ppt. Also I can't speak in front of people at ALL. 

Also I regret taking course in computers I wish I went for something simple I don't know jackshit about computers I'm regretting it so badly I'm worried if I'll ever get a job or be good and productive person in society. 

I also feel so unloved in real life. Apart from mental issues, I'm very unsatisfactory in case of physical appearance, hobbies, skills, personality and relationships. I can't think a single good thing about me. I'm filled with lot of self hate and I don't know how to be better. I also have lack of understanding of cost because my parents never taught me anything. They only bully me for not knowing things which they kept me from in the first place. I don't roam as I just stay in my home when I'm not in college. I don't know how to mingle outside and I'm very self conscious when I go out about my appearance and I hate showing my face to people. There's also the issue that I recently started craving love and affection (I don't get it at all) so I feel even more pathetic that I am not fit for platonic or romantic affection. (Because I'm honestly very, undoubtedly, officially ugly.) 

My parents only fight terribly and complain about their life (my dad is a narcissistic drunkard and my mom always yells 24×7.) My father's mother is also a gaslighting narcissist and enjoys causing fights at my home. My mother even told me couple of times that she gave birth to me for no reason and that I'm just brought in to suffer. 

I have some friends but there's always an issue with me. It's like I'm always the least liked/least prioritized person. Everyone is very comfortable in telling me about my faults. It's like any minor faults of mine are exaggerated. I feel gaslighted by the whole world. I don't know how to be normal. 

I tried going to a therapist but I visited one and she told me to get my mom on next visit, so I didn't go next time. (There's also the issue of therapists being difficult to find or my schedule not allowing me to go in fitting time range.) 

Even framing of my sentences is so incoherent, it's like I have ingested high amount of weed even though I never did. My mind is always floating. 

I feel so horrible and tired every day it's like existence is a chore."		post	18.053312510872956	female	White	0.9993906021118164	na	na	na	2	mmfb	no prediction.

"Yeah I know one month is a very short period of time but we met quite often. He’s an amazing guy, we had our first date snowboarding, trying Indian food, hiking, walking by the beach, etc and I really had memorable moments with him.
He would come to see me when I needed him, called me, and just very supportive.

However, every time we met he always mentioned how scared he was for not being good enough at work and using his potential to the fullest and just work all the time to catch up with deadlines, etc. I tried to cheer him up give him motivations that it was okay for not progressing well and it’s just part of life etc.

Until few days ago, we met and he told me that he decided to let me go cause I was distracting his mind because he’s starting to have feeling for me and it could affect his work, if he gets too anxious then we would need to stop dating. I just told him “it’s alright to let me go” even though deep down I was heartbroken. I wish I could try hard enough to make him stay and didn’t offer myself to go. Now he’s gone and we don’t talk anymore. I’m okay, but still have a huge baggage. Did I do the right thing?"

Yes, you did the right thing. You don't fight for love especially one month in. That's the time for fun, effortless happiness, excitement.

"I very recently lost my stepsister. She had lots of mental health problems and she did this on purpose. It's quite shocking, sometimes I still can't believe it. Lots of people had fights with her the last year and they're all blaming themselves. As for me, there was never anything bad between us necessarily more that I just didn't get too close to her. She had some anger problems due to the mental health stuff which was actually brought on by some brain damage and it was just hard to get close seeing as I already have social anxiety. But still she had the biggest heart and would always be there to help her friends and family, dropping everything or driving hours to do so. 

Ihad some mental health problems in my life myself, namely depression and ptsd and I hate that she ended up doing what I thought of doing multiple times. I will never know what *exactly* was going through her mind but I known the thought pattern. I don't know if I should even be posting this on here but I kind of... want to give her comfort in the afterlife. But at the same time I want to be there for all my living relatives and friends, like my sister who I have been longing to get much closer to but both of us have been super busy. Can someone just tell me that there is real beauty and light on this earth, thats worth staying around for? 

I know this might be out of the ballpark of this reddit and if so I'll reach out to a more professional thing or somewhere but I just need to know."	unusualpanda1234	post	42.82762419428559	female	White	0.9906405210494995	na	na	na	4	mmfb	no prediction.
"I understand that you are really in a horrible spot right now, and that tends to highlight the negatives around us. I can’t tell you that the world is a beautiful and good place; at the same time I can’t tell you it’s an ugly and bad place. There is a balance. Wherever there is bad there is good. Wherever there is darkness there is light. I forgot who said it but whenever a horrible disaster or action of evil happens, if you look close enough, you will see the good, those helping the victims, the good people. 

I understand that you are on the verge of deciding what to do with your life right now, but please don’t do anything you could regret. Your family is suffering and loosing you would be so much more heartbreaking for them. As you said you want to get closer with your sister, if you pass on, that could never happen. You stepsister is at peace right now, and you don’t need to go comfort her. Just think about all the things you will miss out in if you die right now. 

If you keep on living, through the suffering and darkness, eventually you will see the good. It may be as small as someone buying you a coffee or holding the door open for you, but there will always be light for you to see if you keep on living. 

As long as you live on, good things will happen.


Life is full of suffering. But that’s what it takes to see the good things in life. Although there aren’t many, they exist.

It will be okay. Just keep on going. Talk to someone. Like a mental health professional. Things will get better. ❤️"	unusualpanda1234	reply	na	na	na	0.9906405210494995	weak	no	no	na	mmfb	failed

"Well...the world is a mixed place. I'm sorry for your loss, and struggles. But good and beautiful things *do* happen.

The one you mentioned -- getting closer to your sister. And other good and supportive relationships that you might not have any idea of yet.

Otherwise, I can only point to the things that have helped me. Music helps. Jeff Buckley's rendition of *Hallelujah* and Jonny Cash's cover of *Hurt* were two that reached me in difficult times. Nature helps. You owe it to yourself to go hiking in the mountains in spring or summer, when the ice pack melts and there are waterfalls and animals everywhere. I want my ashes to be scattered in such a place, to me it seems like heaven.  Take a cruise or drag a friend to a concert or go to a comedy club. If you're weary of life, you may really need a vacation. Ice cream pretty much rocks, in my opinion! And honestly, well-prepared food generally, ha. Hobbies that are your jam -- judo and chess and philosophy for me, could be anything. Treat yourself to dinner and a movie out, just you -- what I'm doing tonight.

On a bigger scale -- if you want to see cures for cancer and humans on Mars and knowing how consciousness arises from matter...ya gotta stick around a bit, but we're getting there! This is the best time in history to be alive, and in 50 years it will probably be better.

Hang in there. If you check out while it's hard, you don't get to enjoy the good stuff. Which there is. You gotta be good to yourself, fulfill your needs, enjoy what is out there. Then you'll see it.

Every time I lay down I feel like shit. I just want someone here. Not even in a sexual capacity. I want to feel the dip in the bed next to me. I want to know someone cares enough about me to be next to me. I want to know someones here. Same if im just sitting around. I think wow, this would be so much better with someone here with me. And I have friends! They are great! I love them to death(platonically) But its not the same especially since they are online friends. I fucking hate this.

"Really sorry to hear what you're going through. Loneliness is real. And it's hard. And the longer it goes on the harder it can be. 

There's nothing wrong with needing human contact, and real-world contact, even platonically. The internet is great. Internet friends are real friends. But they're not the same as in-person friends or a partner. And there's something in our biology that just needs real people in our presence. Pictures on a screen and voices on a headphone aren't quite that.

I don't know how to make your loneliness end. But I know that it will end.

In the meantime, maybe you can put your solitude to some sort of good use. What i mean, I guess, is that there lots of things you can only do when you are unattached in life. When you get attached (which you will), you will no longer be able to to do these things. You will be able to do other things, which are all great and wonderful, but you won't be able to do the unattached things.

When I was more alone in life, I just kind of sat around and sulked. I watched some TV, wandered around, spent a lot of time on the internet. But I didn't really ""do"" anything. Then I got attached. Now I have a partner and a family, and it's great, and I wouldn't trade it for anything. But also, there's so much I could have done when I was alone that I can't do anymore. I can't take a whole day and read a book cover to cover. I can't just take a weekend and go to a city I've always wanted to visit. I can't really try anything too new, just because it takes effort and time, and I have to give my effort and time to my partner and family now."

I get how you feel. I hate those pity hugs too. Having someone to spend time with because they truly want to spend time with you is one of the most wonderful things in the world, in my opinion. At the risk of sounding like a hypocrite when I say this-- I don't pity you, OP. Having these desires isn't a pitiable thing. From my perspective, you're another human with a problem, and you deserve a respect that pity doesn't afford. You're another soul reaching for something you need-- that's a journey, not some pitiable condition of weakness or inadequacy. Stand tall. You're worthy of doing so.

"I’m a little over a month away from turning 17. I’ve never had a girlfriend, or a first kiss, or even held a girl’s hand (technically I have, but not like romantically), everyone I can think of has had these experiences. I did talk to this girl for a while, she was amazing, but then she left. She said that she had really bad past relationships, so I don’t know if she was worried, or just lost interest, or what, but it fucking hurt.

It’s like I don’t have a chance with anyone. I know I have with a few people, but I do not want to be with them. I feel awful about never have being in a relationship. It makes me feel like something is wrong with me. Like everyone is disgusted in me or something. I know I sure am.

That’s another problem, I don’t like who I am (when it comes to relationships at least). I think I’m funny, and I try my best to be kind to people (or at least fair with people), I take care of myself, I actually enjoy it. I feel sexy having like 10 different things I use, kinda like Patrick Bateman minus the sociopath bit.

I just feel awful, though. How come I have to be the guy that just never has had any luck? I’m at the point where I get kinda resentful of my friends for them having things go better for them.

To MYFB, you went to school during a pandemic. It kind of froze a lot of people, socially.  So you're really not that far behind at all! Did not see your friends enough, didn't get to socialize in school enough, didn't get to lay down the foundation the same way you would have otherwise.  Didn't have opportunities to build those friendships that could develop into a relationship. So you are playing catch up, not because of any personal defects, just lack of opportunities that would have lead, quite possibly, to romantic relationships today.

If a woman rejects you then just move in to the next one. There is nothing wrong with you or her. Sometimes people just don’t click. I guess what I’m trying to say is that there is more to a relationship than just personality and looks. Something you can’t control.

If given the chance to talk to people (especially girls) at 14, I probably would have avoided it anyway. I went through that phase where I thought it was cool to hate social interaction.

Yeah I went on some “dates” with the girl I had a failed talking stage with, but her friends were always there. I never got a moment where we were just alone together except once, and we weren’t that close so nothing really happened. My school is small and there really aren’t that any girls that I could date right now, so maybe college is what I need.

been through depression for 3 years now. as far as fights go i’d say its probably a 75% win rate for depression over my ~25% win rate. for the most part i’m kind of getting my ass kicked, but toughing through it. sometimes i think what’s the point of continuing to fight? its barely a fight, more like getting the shit kicked out of me, so why even go on? i cant try meds because my parents will feel so sad that their child is broken and i don’t want the side effects. i just don’t know where to go from here and i’m living every day being extremely happy one second and then sank into depression the next.	smalluziverttt	post	24.4942000722842	female	White	0.979085385799408	na	na	na	3	mmfb	failed

I mean, if you’re talking about fighting, you’re still here fighting, so that’s technically a 100% win rate. Next step, which is the hardest step, is asking for help. Be brave, be bold, and turn to anyone you trust and tell them how you’re actually feeling. As humans, we all want to help the people we care about, it makes us feel good, so give someone you trust the opportunity to provide you with support as you take on your depression.	smalluziverttt	reply	na	na	na	0.979085385799408	weak	no	no	na	mmfb	failed

"Disclaimer : please don't use this text for articles outside of Reddit. I think is disrespectful for people who are grieving. 

Well, I'm 31 years old. At the age of 15, I started with depression, obsessive disorder and anxiety problems. I have been on medication ever since and, in general, I am fine, but there are times when I have felt bad even for months straight. 

When I was born, my mom got postpartum depression. I'm the youngest of three kids. Later, when I started having problems with depression and anxiety myself, my mom also got it, so it was a difficult time for everyone. There was even a suicide attempt by my mom. Now, 15 years after my mom's last depressive period, my mom had surgery on her column, and it was just supposed to be just a surgery and then her rehabilitation. But in the hospital my mom got covid and she infected me and my dad. I couldn't be with my husband those days. They hospitalized my mother again. I missed 4 days of work, and when everything seemed to be getting better, my dad told me that my mom has depression and anxiety again. It was very difficult because I remembered the last time, and since now I've been through depression and anxiety I know it's horrible, every day is torture. I worried a lot about my mom, about my dad who is the one who is taking care of my mom. 

My brother just lost his job and he lives in another city and my sister lives in the United States so I worry about them but also feel that since I'm the one who's in the same city as my parents, I have help for three siblings. 

I've been seeing my mom almost every day since I found out about her depression two weeks ago, but it's difficult between working, taking care of the house, helping with my mom and having a husband. 

When my mom is depressed, she is very disabled. You have to take her out for a walk or other things, otherwise she is just there like a doll. And it scares me because more or less at my mother's age my grandmother got depressed and she no longer got out, she stayed like that and it's been going for more than 24 years. Yesterday when I spoke with my mom on the phone, she sounded just like my grandma: the same voice and the same angry jaded tone. I panicked because I felt history is repeating. 

Yesterday my father called me when I was at work and told me that they were going to hospitalize my mother, and I felt horrible. I remembered the suicide attempt. It turns out that it was because they werr going to give her a ketamine treatment through her vein and she needs supervision. That treatment is because she has not been responding to other treatments. Yesterday I left my job in a panic attack, then put on my happy face and took mom to the hospital. I felt horrible because my mom is usually super energetic and independent and scandalous. And well, right now she is another person. Does not speak. She hardly moves. In the hospital I held her hand and it felt very weak and she has lost weight. She felt fragile. I even though she was going to die for this and her last days would be filled with anxiety and depression. And then they couldn't give her the treatment because she had high blood pressure. When I left the hospital it was still not sure that they could apply it. But my dad called us later at night and said her pressure had lowered and they were going to apply it. And when everything seemed better, my husband started with a fever. I went to the pharmacy for a Covid test and it came out positive for him but negative for me, since I had it recently. I was going to see online a psychologist today at 10 am, but he cancelled because he was sick. I feel tired, sad, frustrated, angry, powerless and that everything is pilling up. My mom has been my rock when I've been sick because she is the only one who has been through the same. We are very close. I look a lot like her. When she was having surgery on her back, my lower back began to hurt terribly. We are super connected. And also, I need to get used to the idea that more situations like this are going to come soon, because my parents are already turning 70. It is very difficult to see someone who has always seemed strong and wise and independent as someone weak and sick. 

I could use some support from strangers right now."	EpicBaconStrip	post	27.645261035759404	female	White	0.9962342381477356	na	na	na	5	mmfb	failed

"Throwaway, don't want to be remembered of this.
Yesterday I had one of the most violent mood swings I have ever had in years, i yelled in the most horrid and aggressive way I could to one of my closest friends, i honestly have no idea what I said or why, it just happened.
People told me it looked like I was going to start punching her.
I really don't know what came over me.
For context about myself, since I have memory I have had anger issues, once when I was 8, i chocked a schoolmate just because of a toy car.
This kind of aggressive behavior continued to my teen years, me always having a very short trigger and getting very aggressive, and most of the time ending in me attacking physically someone.
It wasn't until my early 20's that i started going to therapy and taking antidepressants, I guess it helped, but after sometime i gave up and left it.
Then the pandemic hit and it went downhill again, started being very aggressive towards my parents, yelling death threats in Discord Voice Chats, stuff like that.
Then I tried theraphy and antidepressants again, and I guess they kinda helped? I started not feeling very violent or at least managed to have kind of ""control"" over my anger, but if i were to be honest I still felt very sad and insecure about everything in my life. I don't know dude. 
But at least this sudden mod swings, anger attacks, me being a very awful person went away.
A few months back I decided to stop seeing my psiquipsychiatrist, mostly bc of him telling me I was a narcissist (with no diagnosis, tests or something) plus him telling me seeing a psychiatrist and psychologist was a dumb idea since psychology was a seudo-science and mimicking a religion more than actual help, all this after me suggesting I wanted to go to a psychologist since I needed someone to talk to about something that wasn't my meds or shit like that.

Although I decided to leave it, i still keept taking my antidepressants, I guess I became a custom to it.
Not going to lie, i wasn't feeling like super depressed, but i started to feel, bad. I didn't have much though into it.

And then the events of yesterday happened, I swear I don't remember shit, i don't understand what triggered it, or why, or how, i just remember people telling me to calm the fuck down.

After that I went to a church nearby and poured my guts out (I'm not religious, i just felt safe there), o felt an overwhelming feeling of wanting to be dead come over me, after a few hours my mother came and picked me up, cried all the way home and then just proceeded to go lay in bed.

I slept from like 6pm until today at 11am.

I feel an incredible amount of guilt, anger, sadness, a lot of shit, my head hurts so much that focusing or thinking is really hard.

I don't want to go back uni, not tomorrow, not for a long time, i don't know how to break that to my parents.

I don't want to continue working on the small company start up I have with my friend.

I don't desire to keep studying a stupid art mayor.

I want to be home, in my room, alone, and do nothing.

I feel like depression and antidepressants are a fucking lie, that they just get any fucking thing they think out of their sleeve to sell me drugs and give a doctor money.

Me reacting this way has made me lost fate in me, probably lost friends that didn't imagine I would be this kind of person, respect, love.
I feel like the only thing left is my parents, and I'm not sure they love me, I'm probably just bothering them with all this.

I don't see how I'm getting out of this one, i honestly just want to be left alone for a long time.

Sorry for all this text, if you read all of it, thanks."	illthrowthisawat	post	21.070425477657842	male	White	0.9976484179496765	na	na	na	1	mmfb	failed
Hmmmmm. It sounds like you genuinely are struggling with this anger issue. What I mean by that is it isn’t as simple as just “anger issues”, it might be something deeper. I feel like the empathy and self accountability you showed in this post might be worth telling the friend you got angry with. And this is going to sound like silly advice, as I wasn’t there to feel the situation unravel, but you could try to shrug it off a bit and acknowledge it to everyone who may bring it up. You may need to work on accepting yourself for now since outside help hasn’t been the answer. Once you learn to forgive yourself, you can understand the process others go through when they need to forgive you. And be patient with people, as well as yourself. Time will help. If you need some mental health days for yourself then do just that. But don’t be afraid to breathe, and slow down a bit. And don’t let your academics get behind.

"I really thought at the age of 18 that I would be good enough to become a music composer. I eventually graduated into the pandemic with zero education on how the industry works, no connections, and now I cant even get a basic administrative assistant job. 

What fucks me up is the fact that I went to college just to work low paying blue collar jobs. After all that college I'm faced with retail or abject poverty. I thought that I could at least get some general office jobs since I have a college degree, yet I'm being treated at a disadvantage to people who never even went to college. ""I see you went to school for music, why are you applying here?"" There's no good answer for that! Fucks me every time, they treat me like I may as well have dropped out of high school. 

It's too late for me to back go to college because I'm fucked with loans. I'm unemployed, uninsured in a state with a shit Healthcare system, my only choice is to go back to a pharmacy for _maybe_ 15 an hour part time, I'm completely fucked. Why was I expected to know what to do with the rest of my life at 18 years old when I never experienced the real world?

"Most careers exist to give you a title which establishes your commitment with your job. Therefore, it is not worthless.

From here, your paths are endless. Here are some:

- Teaching: Private music lessons with people who want to reinforce their knowledge. Also schools and colleges that are hiring music staff/teachers. ""They wont hire me because Ive got no certification"", welp, you are a musician. Play a song, record yourself and make a musician profile portfolio so people can hear your commitment.

- Small concerts/Sound assistant: Try to contact people in the entertainment industry. Perhaps you could study by yourself sound engineering and use your musician title to stand out from the rest as someone committed to sound and music.

- Social media: If you play have passion about a particular instrument, create a yt channel or whatever and make videos. This can work as a way to learn how to make content and an online portfolio. Many artists, like David504, made small videos and got a career out of that.

This maybe doable.  My son graduated in the middle of lockdown with a sports management degree.  He’s been having a hard time as well. He applied for a teaching job (special ed) at a high school and the state is paying for his degree because there is such a shortage.  He’s going to use that to get the certification(?) to teach the subject he want to ultimately teach.  His job pays well and gives him benefits.  I would encourage you to look into this.  He’s playing the long game.  You can do this.		reply	na	na	na	0.9992813467979431	no	strong	no	na	mmfb	no prediction.

"Really sorry to hear what you're going through. This is a really painful part of life. And the more valuable the place was in your memory, the tougher it is when you lose it.

I guess I'd only have one thought to offer. And that is this:

The positive feelings and memories you have about these places aren't really about these places. I mean yes, if they were still around and you went there today they might make you feel good. But what your'e really feeling good about is the memory of how you felt when you were in a Toys R' Us. Not the actual building itself. And you can experience those feelings when the building is gone. 

So like, instead of actually going to Toys R' Us, maybe just set aside an hour and write down all your memories of Toys R' Us. That same feeling might come back to you. Or try going to any toy store (or the toy aisle of WalMart or Target) and just browse - you'll feel like you did back in Toys R' Us.

"**[Impostor syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome)** 
 
 >Impostor syndrome, also known as impostor phenomenon or impostorism, is a psychological occurrence in which an individual doubts their skills, talents, or accomplishments and has a persistent internalized fear of being exposed as a fraud. Despite external evidence of their competence, those experiencing this phenomenon do not believe they deserve their success or luck. They may incorrectly attribute it to the Matthew effect, or they may think that they are deceiving others because they feel as if they are not as intelligent as they outwardly portray themselves to be.

I don't want to blow it out of proportion, because this isn't a thing that happens every day, but occasionally, I'll see shadow people just staring at me or quickly speeding by at my door. I can feel their presence. This usually happens when I'm home alone. A thing that also happens quite a lot when I'm home alone is that I'll feel someone grabbing the back of my head. It always terrifies me, but after I turn back, nobody is there. I keep having terrible nightmares about some deformed human beings and monsters just roaming around the city for no reason, like a dark skinned woman who got hit by a car but then turned into nothing but eight legs and a head and started jumping at everyone. This is going to sound really dumb, but I also feel as if one of my clocks were to be staring at me... I know this is strange, but I recently got this antique German wall clock and it has been running perfectly, but when I'm standing across from it, I feel as if it were watching me, with it's slow ticking, telling me that time's passing while it's staring at me.

Bipolar 2 with psychotic features is my only diagnosis so far. I was on pristiq, lamictal, Seroquel, and one that began with a T that I cannot for the life of me remember. The pristiq stopped working after a few years though and they wanted to put me on depakote but I ended up going cold turkey and getting off meds altogether when I got pregnant.

"Yesterday i found out my girlfriend got rly close with this guy and she hid it from me, she didn’t tell me about him bc she knew i would overthink about it, i got a text from someone random with screen shots of her calling him babe and saying “love you” to him, i kept my composure and i asked her about it, she said he helped me when i was at my lowest (take in she’s only known him for a month now), she said there is no romantic or anything relationship between the 2 of them but i can’t stop overthinking, 

i freaked out and i broke down, i started to hyperventilate, i launched my fist 2 inches into the wall and i cried so much, like dry heave crying, i love her to much to leave because after seeing the guy i know she wouldn’t do anything more than what she did with him, i talked to her about it after having my mental breakdown and i told her either we break up or you gotta fix this, 

she removed every guy since me and her started dating, she screen shared me her phone to show me there’s nothing more, she is putting in effort to show that she cared and that she knows she’s fucked up and that she is truly sorry, i feel like it’s my fault and i feel as if i could’ve done something to avoid it, i just need someone to help me with this, i don’t want to leave her because she has become my source of happiness and we have never had problems until now, 

as per what she says she’s going to tell me what she’s doing at all times, today she took a screen shot  a chat with her friend that had to relevancy to the situation after i noticed she was active but hadn’t replied to me for proof that she was texted her friend, i feel like i can trust her to fix things and make up for what she fucked up and gain my trust back but idk.

"I've been dealing with what I think is suicidal ideation. I'm not making concrete plans to end it. Nor do I feel an emotional pull towards doing it, but I have idle thoughts like 'It'd be easier to just die than deal with my internal suffering anymore"". I've also picked up steak knives in the kitchen, just looking at them, kind of 'testing myself' and if it elicited a desire in me to do something terrible to myself. It doesn't. In fact, I'm pretty scared as I do it, and for that matter, I'm scared that I do it at all. It seems to be the very definition of morbid curiosity.

A couple main things that I think explain how I got here:

1. extreme isolation since March 2020 (aka the pandemic starting): I've been working mostly remote for 3 straight years. Already a heavy introvert, this also means I don't do much or see hardly anyone. In fact, during the pandemic, I went weeks and weeks without even stepping outside. I at least made regular phone calls to people, and obviously had video calls with coworkers. But this kind of isolation is absurdly extreme. It's not as extreme right now, but I still go weeks without doing anything with friends. Most of the time, I spend alone.
2. gender dysphoria. I've had crippling gender dysphoria on and off since my 20s (in my 30s now). I've certainly done a lot of thinking about it, and I don't want to transition. That said, I think I'd like to be more gender nonconforming, and am sincerely interested in taking steps to do that. I also fear it. I fear telling anyone in my life that I've even had dysphoria. I'm afraid of what they'll say. If they'll just expect me to transition and fear losing the me they've known. I'm afraid of their judgments if I start to dress or look even slightly differently from my norm. All I know is that I feel I \*need\* to do \*something\* to reduce these bouts of dysphoria. Sure, I can go months at a time without being dysphoric at all, but inevitably it comes back. And it'll keep coming back unless I do something about it. Obviously, this could be where the suicidal ideation comes into play. In a fucked up way, just ending it would be simpler than trying to make improvements, than telling anyone about this. (I have a couple friends that know about my dysphoria, but zero of my family. That's really who I mean about being afraid of telling.)

I just really hate that I'm in this position. I've done talk-therapy before. I generally have gotten existential crises before, due to my constant penchant for overthinking and getting in my own head, along with loving philosophy. These don't help. But I really think it boils down to the considerations above. Broadly, I know there are things I can do to improve this. Mostly, I'm just really sad, ashamed and scared about the ideation. I fear it could get worse, and that breeds distrust of myself in me. I don't want it to get worse, of course."

"okay, so i've been there. like with a spooky level of matching. this too shall pass.

&#x200B;

as a bandaid to these problems you need distractions. kareoke, bowling, idk sportsbars, drag shows. at one point during the most miserable summer of my life so far (2017) i ended up getting refuge in the fast and furious movies. me. a probably-genderqueer-gay-man like me, an unironic pearl wearer, finding happiness in the boobs and motorbikes movie.

as activist and general trans non-binary grandma kate bornstein put it, ""do whatever it takes to get through the night provided it isnt mean.""

secondly. stop googling. i know googling is tempting and going cold turkey is hard, but seriously. stop googling. the internet has 1000 answers and each will make you more confused not less. talk therapy is good, strange tiktok rabbitholes aren't.

give yourself permission to try on different identities and ideas, you arent necessarily playing for keeps. also its perfectly okay if you hold a set of contradicting identities. lord knows i have, and a few of my friends have too. think of it like a gap-year from gender norms.

talk to irl friends who might be going through the same thing, my life got better when i found a friend from highschool i hadnt seen in years, who had a surprisingly similar path to me. like that helped massively.

oh, also the playlist of hedwig and the angry inch helps, but take that with a pinch of salt. everyone has their own big emotion playlist!

"Thank you for this super sincere post. I appreciate it.

Funny you mention drag shows. Naturally, I've always been very averse to those, even scared of them, because they're overwhelmingly likely to induce dysphoria, right? That said, I'm not gay myself, which earlier in my life always made my dysphoria MORE confusing. Nowadays, of course, I realize that one doesn't need to be gay to have dysphoria, or to transition. That was a naive point of view.

Stopping googling is indeed tough for me. I work on a computer all day. I have way, way too much time on my hands. I forgot to mention that work in general for me is an absolute bore. On the one hand, this isn't bad. I have a decent-paying job and I'm sitting around for much of it. On the other, it's absolutely numbing. I can't stand pretending to care anymore. It's exhausting. Lots of me idealizes about quitting all the time. I feel I'd have way more hope in general if I just changed jobs. Because the truth is, I still have interest in doing things. I want to do things. A problem lately has been feeling a bit sluggish, feeling a little less desire, and I hate that. I don't want that to happen. My horrendous sleeping habits don't help.

Going back to gender issues, I like your idea about just experimenting. We learn by experience. We often want to think we can reason through anything, especially philosophy-lovers like me. Reason is everything, right? Well, not necessarily. I've learned way more about myself sexually, for example, by doing stuff, not thinking or fantasizing. Who would've thought? Further, I live alone primarily and work from home primarily. For these reasons, I have ample chances to experiment that are very low-risk."

"yeah, its easy to break out of your own brain when you apply the scientific method and practically change things. do the thing, see if you like it, don't like it. get concrete answers. as for drag shows, some find it liberating, some kind of passport to part-time-gendering, some find it breakdown-causing, really depends on the person. one passport for me was ""im not genderqueer, im just doing an adam lambert. a lot of rock and roll people wear makeup and heeled boots""

"This is gonna be long winded and I apologize. I'm actually writing this on a note pad and I'm just gonna copy and paste the fucking thing lol. 

4 and a half years ago I meant someone. She and I ended up becoming pretty close friends. But four years ago she ghosted me for her douchebag emotionally abusive boyfriend (now husband)
I never expected to hear from her again. But at the end of December she randomly messaged me (I'll include screenshots) and we started talking again. And all the emotional and romantic feelings I had for her 4 years ago came flooding back. We talked for all of January and some of this month. Until she told me she was going to try and stick it out with the same douchebag husband until April to eliminate any ""what ifs""
Things started going down hill after that. And the a couple days later she started making really random remarks and comments about being afraid that I might use our conversations and pictures against her, like send them to her husband or something. 
I was very taken back by this because it was so random and she never mentioned anything like it before. 

I shouldn't have said anything at all but I tried to reassure her that nothing would possibly get me that upset to even consider that. And then I thought about it for a few seconds and told her that no, there's only one situation where I would get so hurt and so upset to even think about that (I still made it clear I never would)

I told her the only situation where I'd maybe get to that point is if I found out or thought she was intentionally using me and just fucking around with me and not really being genuine. 

Things blew up after that. She told me she was afraid of me for what I said, and got more and more distant and basically said friends only and began disregarding things I said to her about how I felt about her. And then one of the last times we exchanged voice messages I was trying to reassure her that yes I still cared about her and that I still really liked her and even tho she knew that I wanted to make it clear. All she said to that was ""yeaaaah let's not get into that again"" 

And then when I was talking about how stressed I was with my father and his condition and my life all she said was "" could we talk about something less depressing, not that YOU'RE being all depresso expresso or anything, no not YOU""
I had no idea what to say to that so I just stopped talking. She messaged me later that night saying ""have a nice night"" and at that point I was really really hurting. 
The next morning I sent her a message telling her how much she was hurting me and that I just couldn't talk anymore. And then I blocked her because I didn't know what else to do."	DazednConfused2308	post	23.865862706116793	female	White	0.9987459182739258	na	na	na	10	mmfb	no prediction.

"Hi.
I'm completelly freaking out over what happened to me today. I think it's very bad. My hearth is racing and all that. Well, what happened:
I've downloaded some pornographic pictures from a website I found on the net. It was a pretty big batch and I liked the look of it from the previews. Everything seemed alright, honestly. I was downloading the bundles and as my disc space was running out, I decided to store it for myself on a Google drive, so I can delete it from PC to clear up the space for the incomming files.
So I was doing that, not paying much of an attention to what exactly I'm uploading to the Google drive. And then, suddently, I got a message from Google that my account have been terminated becouse some child pornography have been detected on my Google drive.
I naturally couldn't believe it, but I ceased the downloading, and taken a closer look at the content. And, surely, most of the stuff was completely legal, but there indeed was some very, VERY weird stuff there. I deleted all of it right away. And now I'm shaking to the point I can barely write this...

So I broke off a very short lived, long distance relationship with a girl from college. We had been friends/romantic interests for years, but I never allowed us to get into relationship due to distance/ I was unsure that I truly liked her. I finally caved this past year, and agreed to try a distance relationship for a bit, but ultimately I couldn't do it so I broke up with her. I don't necessarily want her back, I more just mourn the fact that I couldn't make it work with her. I don't understand why I couldn't just love her, she's an amazing person. And I want to date people like her. I'm afraid that I've missed my chance, and I'm afraid that maybe I can't love people like her. I also wish that we just lived in the same place, maybe if weren't distance it would work. I'm also sad that I hurt her, and that our friendship isn't the same.

"I just have remembered of one my ex best friend who I ghousted 5 years ago and even if he wanted to reconcile with me over and over again, I couldn't do it. It was for me too much.

I was his best friend support, I have given him a money whenever he asked, I have payed for him always in club, bar cause he was student and was poor, and I even encouraged him at his study and gave him advices cause I was student too.

{He only had poor father, mother leaved him at birth for some strange reason.}

And then, even if he was good and funny man, he didn't appreciate anything of it what I did for him, he thought it's normal that I do all this for him. He prioritised other his friends before me, and acknowledged them more, they didn't have money and I also was here for them because of him. He always thought I had a lot money and I should be for him/them. One his friend did something bad to me and he defended her/them and I saw his indeference to me, and first time ever he rediculed me.

This is where I disappointed myself in him.

I really respected this guy cause he was very good man, but it seems not good for me. Maybe I was blind. Maybe I had great expectations of him towards me idk? But it's now over. We had best years as together, going out, having fun. 

Also he did drugs, and was some time dealer but he stopped this and now he is working in township, higher rank.

I also found via some psychic that he was/is reincarnated as my brother who my mother already aborted cause she already had 3 kids. {I asked my mother and she was surprised how I knew this}

I don't have contact with him 5 years and I think I can't get over all what happened. And he never apologized and still think problem was with me.

The good news is most people aren't as selfish as your friend, so if you make a new friend there is a good chance they won't be like this one.

">If you aren't comfortable always giving, then you aren't compatible as friends.

Thanks for your answer.

It's not that I am not comfortable with giving at all, I would have continued this to do for him cause he was my best friend for 7-8 straight years, and I thought even ""once we would be bestmen for sure"" (but he already choosed another one for it, some bad guy, drug addicted guy, but whatever).

What I felt from him that I was used and I couldn't stand that he defended some his rude friend chicks and support them to ridiculed me. This was when I woke up and said ""well, my best friend is asshole obviously"" and it hurted like the hell cause he always was good, nice, kind, understanding to me, but then I noticed he had other priorities in friends, to get more popular among them I guess, and that's why he did it, but he forgot how much I respect me and how I am sensitive when it comes to making fool of me. And then I just ghousted him like he was dead, in that moment and even he attempted to reconcile with me several times and assure me it was my fault I couldn't go back anymore.

I'm honestly tired of my miserable existence at this point and i just need help or advice on how to fix it. 

For  years now nothing has brought me ant joy, i cant have fun and i don't  really do anything because i don't see the point in anything. I lost all  my friends because I'm ""no fun"" and now i live my life from my bed. 

I'm  sick of it, i cant listen to music, i cant play games, i cant watch  anything, i cant read anything, i just feel hollow, i don't even feel  human anymore. 

Everything is so gray, pointless and a waste of time... i spend my days either doing school work or staring at the ceiling. 

And  the funny thing is i can maintain myself, i cook for myself, i clean  and i keep up with my hygiene and exercise, so i don't get it, i do  stuff to keep myself happy and yet i feel like an empty husk, zero  happiness or enjoyment of what i do. 

But  that's how life has been for me for years to the point i don't really  remember it being any different and i cant really change much cause my  parents have got me by the throat and I'm basically doing what i have to  to keep them happy and for my own survival. I don't see a point in  anything beyond that, but i want to... I want to feel something again. 

If someone can tell me what i can do to not feel like that anymore, please do, because i cant handle it anymore."	NeedToGetOutFromMe	post	18.465433449085374	female	White	0.9992997646331787	na	na	na	4	mmfb	no prediction.

You deal with the underlying causes of your depression. It will HURT, but you will come out the other side of the pain without dying. Just gasping for air. It comes off in our brain exactly like drowning while punched in the face. The more you fear going through that, the worse it keeps you down.

"I've seen a lot of people on the internet trying to explain that there are things you should live for, but I realized that the problem with that, at least for me, is the fact that I need to actually force myself, make an effort to do that, get up and suffer through something.  
The thing is, there's literally no reason for me to live at this point. So, it's kind of a concerning thing to start thinking about, isn't it? I've never had such a cold view of the world, so, naturally, I try to look up what can people say about, maybe I'll stumble upon something that will help me stop being bothered by this mindset. But for some reason for any article or comment I read, I can provide an argument why it doesn't really solve the problem.  
It's never been so meaningless to me. I mean, the life. And not necessarily in a depressive way. I just think about how life,(long story short) has absolutely no meaning or real value whatsoever and observe this mindset without emotional attachment. I came to conclusion that I never wanted to live, but it doesn't bother me in a suicidal way. Well... maybe I would consider ending it if I weren't a part of kind of a big family, but in reality I have no thoughts about suicide at all. I just don't want to live.  
From my perspective, life has collapsed to little and sometimes big but meaningless things. People are just chasing their tail, I feel that especially in the modern world, because I know it the best and live in one. I was, too. Technically, still am and probably will. But it has become so sad and black-and-white. People are running around thinking about the ""goals"" they have in their mind, think about things they think they need or they should do, but it all costs nothing if you really think about it. All my aspirations can bring me positive emotion, but what's the use? There's no sense in that. Sounds corny, but we all ARE going to die anyway. Even if we weren't, really, it doesn't make a difference. Nothing is really worth doing to me now. I know very well there's enough pleasures in the world to continue living but that doesn't cut it. Starting from healthy things like physical care about your body (exercising, food, etc.) and art (movies, tv shows, lots of other things), ending with substances and other things... There's plenty of things to do on Earth while being a human being, I know. I mean, to this day, I experience positive emotion from time to time and like life in some ways but at the end of the day it comes down to nothing. It's still worthless and I'm not saying it should have worth. Life is meaningless and I'm trying to accept it, I guess...  
I'm M19. I know people might say I'm too young and it's gonna pass or something and that's understandable. But it's sad, I don't think anyone wants to become a quiet adult years later that has accepted the dullness of life. Honestly, I think I don't even want to ""become"" in the first place, you know, and I can't unthink my thoughts as for now. I keep repeating this conclusion ""I don't want to live."" I just don't. I feel like I'm kind of okay with this, but it's hard to actually continue living because I have to do things like studying, university studies start in a couple of weeks; some time in the future I'm gonna have to start working. I don't want to do any of that. I don't even want to do things that I enjoy, like my personal interests, hobbies. Even when I technically enjoy them, it's all empty and meaningless at the end of the day anyway.  
I guess I was just curious what do other human beings like myself have to say about this. Think I explained everything in as much details as possible for now. I fucking hate when people post snotty little posts with two sentences like what do you expect? Why do you do that? There's no non-bullshit reason for that. Anyways, same goes for you commentators out there.

I can honestly say that I'm glad I persisted and/or survived. I met someone 10+ years ago who quite literally changed my life and makes it clear each day what the point is of all of this. And for me, the point is: I found someone who loves me as I am, appreciates me every day, and makes me laugh deeply at least once per day. It's just that simple. For me, happiness has turned out to be about the simplest of things.

A big part of that was going to therapy and working on issues one by one. Redditors can't hit at the roots of your problems the same way a trained professional can, though it's really good you're writing about your feelings and trying to understand them better.

Something you'll need to practice over the next few years is finding your own meaning in certain ways. It sounds cliche, but it's true. There is no grand meaning of life that we know of. I've been finding peace and meaning in helping other people, for example.

You're going to have to find ways to motivate yourself, but it gets way easier with practice. I find that I have a deep sense of curiosity.

"You might dislike me for this. But I want to pitch in, as a different perspective. If some people gives a hard time to others who don't want live, they sure also give hell to people who want to live forever. They will say it's unnatural to want such, that you should be happy to die during old age, etc.

I want to live forever you see. And yet there are many moments in my life where it feels so hopeless I sometimes think that the only way to escape the pain is through non-existence. But I know myself. 

I want to die occasionally, yes. But for the long term, I know I want to live.  I have to keep reminding myself, because it's easy to forget when the intense emotional pain visits. It's an irony I have to accept about myself for a while.

I know it probably won't appeal to you. But the reason why I want to live for a long long time, despite the eventual threat of entropy... is because I simply love it.

*(Take note that I'm not implying that you should feel the same as me. It's a deeply personal preference after all.  I am only sharing an entire opposite angle.)* 

I love going to cafes and  do people-watching. I love the smell of books, their texture and the stories they tell. I love the absence of my abusive parents. I see a motion-detecting soap dispenser for the first time in the city, and I say ""Shit, I live in the future."" 

It's probably rather pointless and random, I suppose. But I like to experience them anyway in the present, when such comes my way. And I would always want them coming my way. I might get bored but I know myself.  I know I would simply change it up or find something better.

I sometimes look around a bazaar or a shopping mall and imagine how a person from the 1800s would see it. It's probably why I love reading Modern World meets Game of Thrones fics online. 

I like seeing the progress of humanity, in the hopes it would somehow continue, and me a part of it. To stay with all of you for a long, long, long time... Forever, if allowed. Though that may be a pipe dream. And something that some would tell me is a shameful wish.

But it would be very hard sometimes. I see harassments normalized and people looking at me like I was the crazy one when I question the status quo.

I beg people to never pressure me to reconcile with my parents, and they get adamant that family is family no matter how much they abuse you and I just have to put up with it.    

I see the problems in the word that seems too difficult to overcome. I come across them, is involved with them personally by chance... I lose my faith in humanity....and I feel like dying. Sometimes, my despair came from a simple matter I simply catastrophized. But it still feels too much.

I would only start to feel a little better, once I decided to do an action against the problem. It might be a small action and I might fail, but at least I was defeated whilst trying/doing.

I suppose, it's different from yours... If I'm not mistaken, you mean it as a matter of fact that you want to die, because you simply see no point.

Your thoughts actually kind of remind me of this: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLVuKlz\_7nM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLVuKlz_7nM)

Because he shares the same sentiments with you with life being neutral and having no purpose (around 40-ish second mark), but then give a slightly a different take for us to ponder about. Something along the lines of both having a life purpose and having none is a personal thing, limited in each of our perspectives...  and this is how some people find theirs... If my memory serves me correct.

To live or not to live, either way, I hope we both find peace and answers we may seek.

I’ve come to this conclusion too . But in reality, who really wants to die? It’s just not in our nature I’ve come to or I’m trying to except that I don’t want to live, but I don’t want to die and I don’t wanna be miserable for the rest of my life.

"I’m 20, so about the same age. I used to be in a similar mindset when I was in high school. I was afraid of growing up and being an adult. It took genuinely forcing myself into a better mindset to be happier. Might not work for everyone but I was in a bad mental place and I knew no one else was going to fix it but me. 

Something that helped was actively finding at least one good thing in each day. I think once you do that and you seek out the things that are nice it helps you to appreciate more and more. It’s never anything big, usually just I saw something cool or whatever. Nowadays, it’s habit to notice whenever something good or cool happens. For instance, tonight my favorite song came on Spotify shuffle when driving home from work! Again, might not work for everyone but I do think that actively appreciating the world around you can’t really hurt

For me, I live for those little moments of happiness. Just meaningless moments where I can stop for a second and think “this kind of rocks right now”. I live to write! I love writing and it makes me so happy. Sometimes it’s hard to find a hobby you really enjoy but it’s worth it when you do find it. I live for my family and friends. They all mean the world to me.

"I was just so confused at the time I posted this. I didn't understand why should I work on myself or grow as a person, why should I find meaning? What difference does it make – am I happy or am I not?

I've come to realization in the past that all the feelings pass, but it always feels new... Like, it's been a couple of days since I posted and since that day I took a shower, shaved,  cleaned up in the house and I'm already feeling better. Those scary, challenging thoughts faded away. But they didn't go away completely, I know.

As a recommendation that I got from some commentators, I started looking into Camus philosophy more. I read a bunch of information about absurdism recently and it seems like my kind of worldview... Btw, I've read ""The Stranger"" last year and I remember it being so spot on, it was very relatable to me.

So I guess it's getting better, but I still have thoughts of futility and feelings like I shouldn't even try to do anything, just give up and remain still until... idk, until I can't anymore.

For years, all I've ever wanted was to just feel happy and accepted by other people but I feel like it's just never gonna happen. No matter what I do or how well I do it, I can never get the validation I crave. It's to the point that I don't even want to do the things I used to love because I know that if I show it to people, they'll just find the flaws in it. I know it's vain but I just want someone to compliment me for something rather than berate me and belittle me constantly. I feel like it's not a lot to ask of people, but for some reason people just constantly find ways to make me feel worse and I hate it. I want to just give up and stop trying so that at least then people will have a reason to dislike me.

"I’m so drained by my job and dealing with a lot of mental help problems which has resulted in a lot of impulsive spending or not taking care of adult responsibilities (not an excuse, simply pointing out the root of the problem).

I know how to do my job put I’m not fast enough for it and get pretty disorganized when I’m stressed. I work at Chipotle for $15 and hr and I don’t always work 5 days a week for 8 hrs. My schedule is very unpredictable making it difficult making last minute plans if needed. I kinda feel left out to because I’m always scheduled on the weekends and my friends get to go out while I have to work and can’t stay up very late at night because of work in the morning. I don’t drive yet so I have to get up early to take the bus.

I don’t know why but I’m being hard on myself for wanting to quit just because I don’t do well at work. I keep telling myself I just need to figure out how to get better but it’s been 2 years now. I also worry it will take forever to find another decent paying job where I can control my schedule.

I’m always mentally and emotionally drained, all I want to do when I get home is scroll through my phone and binge watch YouTube to cope or numb my stress and emotions. And it’s so addicting but I love the escape. The internet is a space where I can feel comfortable expressing myself of being apart of communities I relate to or enjoy or believe the same things. It makes me feel less lonely in a house full of people.

I disable myself so much. I haven’t even started filling my taxes yet. And I’m just figuring out how to actually set boundaries and how to gain respect from people and stand up for myself. Dated an ex “friend” and it helped me realize how much I’d tolerate from people and how easy it is to emotionally manipulate me. I wasn’t raised to stand on my two feet to resist stuff like this. Was just told to listen and do what I’m told and to trust God more than yourself. And my mother has always been loving but also overbearing and tends to put a lot of doubt in me (not everything, only if it’s something she doesn’t preferred and cares way too much about appearance).

I’m not going to throw all the blame on my parents but I’m now realizing I was conditioned to comply with a “good” attitude towards the command. And my mom would defend herself by making her be the victim of accusations and would make my siblings and I feel like our feelings towards her are irrelevant bc I guess we’re young and don’t know better yet.

She’ll tell us all these encouraging things like “you need to set boundaries with people” or “Why don’t you ask?” when growing up I felt invalidated for expressing myself disagreements and that she was too busy to help or my answer would always be “no” when I ask for permission or wanted something. And she’s so worried about my siblings and I making dumb decisions because of peer pressure….ma’am you’re the pressure. I don’t give a fuck what other people want to do if I don’t approve or care.

I feel lonely, incapable and immature to live or function ideally how and adult should to survive in this world.

I always find myself starting over when it’s too late and have nothing to fix my problems. I fuck up then wait for my next check to come telling myself I’m going to do it right this time and that I’m going to pull myself out of my shitty job that I don’t enjoy anymore and be more productive at home and with hobbies.

"Every Wednesday, I meet with a group of people from church and we hang out, usually do a game or service or something. By the end, I’m always exhausted, but I enjoy hanging out with one person who’s almost always there. Today I also babysat right before, and one of the kids is very much a drama queen. Babysitting is something I do on the side, mostly to help out a friend, but it’s a coin toss as to whether it goes well. I’m just sitting in the dark chapel (at the weekly church hangout) because anywhere else is too stimulating and I dunno if I want to leave yet.

"When I first started this job, the head of HR told me ""Don't thank me, he's the only reason you got the job"" (referring to my supervisor at the time) after I thanked them for hiring. I was constantly forced to work alone throughout my time there. In order to do my job properly I needed camera playback, however they refused to give it to me for several months even though other guards had it, even the new ones who hired in after me. I was told I wasn't there long enough and they implied I was going to use it to creep on female staff and clients. I'd get a partner for awhile but each time they either quit, were fired or were forced to transfer to another facility. No efforts were made to get me help. I live across the street from my former employer. On my day off, my neighbor kicked my dogs and threatened me in front of my kids, so I called the police. My work tried firing me for this. They said I was beating my dog and had the cops called on me, and that my demeanor with clients was awful (it wasn't) and the facility director made up a blatant lie that I fought with another client which not only never happened, I was actually cool with him and went out of my way to find his lost property (his phone) because he was having severe anxiety over it being lost. He thanked me and said he appreciated me, however I was accused of fighting with him. I didn't and that's also proof enough that I did not have a ""horrible"" demeanor with anyone. I actually have proof of this. Things calmed down for awhile because it seemed like the target was taken off my back and sent to another guard. Then today happened. Facility director also said he wanted me written up ""as much as possible"" so i can get fired and that they need to search for a replacement ""immediately"". I was told I was fired because I was sleeping on the job according to word of mouth. When I asked for timestamps as proof, the compliance officer got really nasty and refused to show me proof. This was through word of mouth and word of mouth alone. I was not sleeping on the job. And, aside from that, let's say I was hypothetically. There is a client still employed there who has been caught sleeping many, many times yet he remains. I feel this is an unjust termination.








I loved my job. It was almost a dream job. Now I'm overwhelmed with anxiety and sadness."	p5yk0t1km1r4ge	post	35.232631310049435	female	White	0.9990953207015991	na	na	na	2	mmfb	no prediction.
"It was probably addressed in some of your other posts, but if not, make sure to apply for unemployment.  

Make them provide evidence that they fired you for cause if they can. 
Based on your post, odds are good they won't be able to make that case and you'll collect unemployment.

Beyond that, don't internalize their toxicity. Update your resume and put yourself out there ASAP. Yes, finding a new job is stressful, interviewing is stressful, and getting rejected for no good reason (or ghosted) is not all that fun either, but it leads to greater and better things.  

Also more generally, nurture your network. If you have people that you appreciated and that appreciated your work at that job, keep in touch. Some day, they'll move on to another job too, and maybe you'll be able to refer them to your workplace, maybe they'll be able to refer you to their workplace.

I kind of just woke up a tiny bit ago and wanted to try write this down because it felt like a really profound dream for some reason. I had a dream where I woke up leaning against a tree to 2 older women and a girl around my age kind of looking over me trying to get me to wake up asking if I was okay. I told them I was fine, and the 2 older women kind of looked disgusted and were like ‘he’s okay, he was just too drunk and must have passed out’ and they started to walk away. The girl lingered and asked how I managed to be passed out cause I didn’t seem drunk to her, and I told her I’d just worked my 5th 12 hour shift in a row and had somehow managed to fall asleep exhausted on my way walking home.

She told me the 2 older women were friends of her mom and that she didn’t like them anyway, so she said she’d help walk me home because she wanted an excuse to get away from them anyway. We walked to my house and on the way were just chatting shit, talking about every subject under the sun. It turned out in the dream that we felt like we’d met before but couldn’t place where. I can’t remember the exact details of our conversations but the walk seemed to last forever and it felt like I didn’t want it to end.

Eventually we got to my house and I realised I’d lost my keys, so we retraced our steps back to that tree. Eventually I couldn’t find them and told her I’d walk her home instead. On the way to her house I ran into a friend of mine who saw us joking around and giggling with each other and he kind of nodded at me and said hey as he walked past with a knowing look. We eventually got to her house and her sister answered the door, and her sister turned out to be one of my older sister’s friends. She instantly recognised me and was like ‘omg you’ve grown up so much I haven’t seen you in years! What are you two doing together? You used to love playing together when you were younger but I didn’t know you still knew each other’.

We were both stunned by that and her sister walked back inside. We both kind of lingered there not knowing what to say to each other and both clearly feeling a vibe. Before she went back in she was like ‘listen I’m going to give you my number but I’m warning you in a fucking mess; I was dealing with a sex addiction that fucked up my past relationships, I’ve been better off being single, and it will probably stay that way, but I really like you and had fun tonight and I think we should stay in touch’. I agreed and told her I’d never had sex anyway (true) and jokingly said that it could wait a little longer since I’d made it this far. I told her I’ve got my own share of mental health struggles and stuff too and we could take things incredibly slow, we have all the time in the world and there’s no pressure. She kind of smiled and gave me her number.

I went home and we were texting and joking around for a few days, arranged to meet up for dinner and stuff. I ended up at a bar with the friend of mine I’d bumped into when I was walking with her and he was like ‘alright, don’t act all cool, spill the details, who was that girl you were with? I’ve never seen you look that happy’. I told him everything and he smiled to himself and was like ‘you deserve a bit of happiness man, I’m proud of you, just don’t fuck it up’.

Then I woke up, and it’s Valentine’s Day and I’m completely alone. It doesn’t bother me too much and honestly I’ve got a lot of work to do on myself anyway, and have mental health stuff and self-esteem issues I need to work on before I could ever be in a relationship. But that dream felt so real and when I woke up I genuinely felt like shit and had a pit in my stomach. I was really genuinely happy in that dream and when I woke up I was almost in disbelief that it hadn’t been real. I’ve had a similar experience before in a dream involving having a daughter that didn’t exist, your brain can be crazy sometimes.

But I think this one was sort of a gift to you, even if it made you feel sad—you got a dream date for Valentine’s and you know how it could be that you could take it as inspiration to try.

Hi, I never posted on here before but I started to use reddit more these past couple of months and I really enjoy reading everyones genuine thoughts in different threads. I want to see if anyone else feels the same way I’m feeling. I’m currently a senior in college right now. After COVID, the adjustment back to normal living took about 1-2 years for me and I feel like everyone else too. Now in 2023, everything just feels so off. Time moves by so fast. The world feels so uncertain. I was once so optimistic and couldn’t wait for the future. Now, I’m just terrified for what’s to come. So many things are changing rapidily everyday. I was thinking it’s just an aftermath of the pandemic. Or just an awakening on my part (realizing traumas, discovering my purpose here on earth). But, that’s the only thing keeping me going, the spirtual aspect of this whole experience. It’s as if the world just doesn’t feel the same anymore. Whenever I go out, it’s like everyones a robot living up this worldy fantasy that doesn’t even truly make them feel happy. The energy of some people is just so draining and uncomfortable. Material things aren’t even worth it anymore. Inflation is insane. Prices keep going up and up. Lots of people seem drained from working. Is this just side effects of a crumbling system? At school, lots of people are the same and seem to keep going in this world. I’m not sure why I don’t feel like that anymore.

"Covid hit during my senior year of college.  It was an immeasurably large distortion of everything I had known.  I look back on pictures from even January and February 2020 and feel so alien to that world.  Really, I can empathize with everything you are saying.  The pandemic and its aftermath bred a very distinctive detachment in people about our age that I can hear in what you say.  

I can't really give you a cure-all answer, otherwise I would use it on myself.  I'm more depressed, more anxious, and feel less well-rounded than I was in 2019.  I'm also fatter by 15lbs than I was in 2019, when I was already 20lbs. fatter than I was in 2018.  It's fucking rough.  I go out and sometimes feel like either the only real person there, or the only fake one.  The news sucks.  Everything feels like it's coming to a head, personally and politically. 

But you know what? I'm also completing my second year of veterinary school, a dream of mine literally from elementary school.  I'm better read than I was in 2019, better medicated, have deeper and more meaningful social connections, and understand more about myself and my needs.  Internally, I've really changed quite a bit for the better. 

I think we're just growing up into the adults we were always going to become. We're at the age that we supposedly become ""adults"" for real.  But Covid was a massive disruption to the world, changing it permanently in many ways few of us expected beforehand.  The people that usually give us advice can no longer do so in the same way.  We've seen institutions meant to be rock-solid buckle.  The problems we've heard about all our lives are getting worse, not better.  That's all given us a new perspective on the world and jolted us to grow and adapt in ways brains don't usually do under normal circumstances. 

It's taken me a long, long time to see this, but I think we need to just change our perspective on what new feelings we have and how we relate to the world.  Do other people feel like robots, or are you perhaps interpreting the same actions differently than you used to?  Could you be less naive, or under more adult kinds of stressors?  This is not to say that we need to think of things as good when they are bad or see silver linings for the sake of ignoring the clouds.  Things suck.  Most of the world is in a real period of uncertainty relative to what other living generations experienced around this age. But give yourself some time and space, and if something feels different, seriously consider if you might have artificially incorrect standards to what would feel ""right"", maybe because your expectations are still somehow rooted in the way the world used to be for us.  I can say that, because I've been there.  Things are going to be okay, and you're going to be okay.  

I don't know.  You sound a lot like how I sound sometimes, and used to sound like more.  I'm just writing what I want/would've wanted to hear in those times."	Particular_Ad2997	reply	na	na	na	0.005145846866071224	weak	strong	no	na	mmfb	no prediction.
See what happens when we are kept from one another for that much time? It seems to be a form of shell shock that people are in. They've forgotten how to act with one another.

I took up chess in an attempt to stop using so much social media but I fucking suck at it. I can't even understand posts in r/chessbeginners.

How to make myself better.	iceharvester	post	29.92549609825102	female	White	0.9994988441467285	na	na	na	2	mmfb	no prediction.
"A few thoughts here.

1) There are [good books for beginners](https://smile.amazon.com/Learn-Chess-John-Nunn-ebook/dp/B007MQN6P6), or you can go language-less with the infamous [Polgar book](https://smile.amazon.com/Chess-5334-Problems-Combinations-Games-ebook/dp/B00DWK544C)

2) I played competitive chess for 20 years. Several things wore out my interest, including the time and money required to achieve and maintain even a mediocre level of play.  But also: I was at a major tournament and a guy fell out of his chair a couple of tables down.  He was overweight, but not very old -- maybe late 50's.  Attempts to revive him failed.  He just fell over dead at the board.  His physical condition was typical of long-term chess players, because of how much time it takes & how sedentary it is.  I realized that not only was I missing out on sunshine and all the other goods of life -- I was actively killing myself.  I didn't like it.  I quit.  My new hobby is judo.  Much healthier, much happier.  So if you never grasp even the basics of chess -- be comforted with the thought that you are spending the time on better things.  It's a boardgame, the mastery of which consumes lives.  There are so many better things to do.  Like basically anything.

3) If you understand the R + K  vs lone K mate, try 2R + K vs K as just an accelerated version of that, where you can force the enemy king to back up with the 2nd piece instead of having to wait until the K's are opposed to do it.  Then R + Q can be done the same as R + R, just make sure you don't stalemate him near the end because of the Q's diagonal influence.  You may be seeing a bad explanation of R + Q, where they are showing the shortest solution but not the concepts of mate.  On an otherwise open board, the simple way is to force to enemy king to the edge first.  Then control the last row with R and prevent him stepping off that last row with the K, or other R.  The Q can replace R if available in this same ""last rank"" mating pattern.  But there are other patterns available if you have Q + R + K vs K, including in the middle of the board. They are more complex, and the way to build up to seeing them is with something like the Polgar book (or there are lots of other shorter ones on mating patterns).  Basically if the Q is supported adjacent to the enemy K (say by your K), his escape squares are a knight's-move from your Q (because she controls everything else, but doesn't move that way).  So whatever else is on the board needs to take those two squares away.  (Two in the middle of the board, could be none on the edge/corner).

Anyway, don't be hard on yourself!  If you think you suck at chess, you should see my attempts at drawing.  Chess or sketches, it's art.  It's optional.  It's to make life better.  If it doesn't improve your life, forget it!  There are lots of other things.

Hope this helps some, and you find peace.

As for your mom, maybe this is the only way she can show you she cares about you. Not all moms are encouraging, especially if they were raised with critical parents. As for your lactose thing, I feel you. I have a version of it, but found out that it may be the *cow* and not the dairy itself. Look for products that came from A2 cows.

"I started a new job two weeks ago. I noticed that a bit of my coworkers are..... not so friendly. im a woman in my late 20's and my other coworkers are women, in their early 20s , it seems a little cliquey. There was this one coworker who seems to avoid me/ gets away from me when im near, gives me one word answer or attitude if i speak to her, i remember we were assigned a class together and when we came down and i said 'oh we came here early'' and she said 'i know' in a sarcastic/mocking tone. she went to chatting with another coworker who came though in a normal way though. she seems to want to talk to everyone else and seems friendly with others except me. it almost like she sees me as the loser and the outsider, (she is new too and seemed to want to join in with the group of coworkers who been there and friendly with another and treats me like im beneath her). It seems im always singled out no matter where i go, i do not act mean or anything. Im always very nice, sometimes i wonder if people think im being fake or being condescending.

Another coworker seemed friendly too at first i found out we read similar book types too, though i did feel she was still not all into it in the end ,  but then i also noticed she got rude/ distant with me as well , gives me a little attitude when i ask her a question (she was the one who gets along with the other rude coworker) and does not put effort to speak to me. I feel another coworker dont like me either , she gives me looks/ and is kinda rude. Basically what i notice is microaggressions.

I know it seems small, i have a history of severe trauma and bullying, and events like these trigger me a lot, i could feel im excluded, i wouldn't be surprised if i was being gossiped about, and i just stay quiet now and stay away from them, it's just awkward when im assigned to work with them in the same room but i just keep quiet and my distance and focus on working with the children. at least the kids like me and treat me with more respect than my coworkers funny enough! not all of them tho lol

I cried yesterday coming back home. It just reminds me how ugly, awkward, and boring i am. Everywhere i go, school, every job, im always excluded, no one wants to speak to me, im boring, and awkward, there are better and more fun people out there, so why me? the one word answers and attitude i get from coworkers and the avoidance and being ignored but then seeing them click and talk easily with other coworkers make me feel TERRIBLE. i know im not at work to make friends, its just the treatment i get, really gets to me at times and makes me feel so AWFUL about myself.

I also am absent minded and sometimes forget things and feel i cause stress, i talked it out with my boss and she assured me im not bothering and that its good to ask questions, but when i ask questions to coworkers, i feel they give me the cold shoulder, some of them. i will stay away from the ones who give me attitude/disinterested, but i wonder how to not let it hurt or feel awkward being around them??"	throwawayxlost	post	28.268840484142878	female	White	0.9984340071678162	na	na	na	8	mmfb	ethnicity: no prediction, age: late 20s, gender: female, explanation: the author indicates her age bracket as being in her late twenties and also identifies as female, however, there is no indication of her ethnicity in the piece.

"I’m really sorry this is happening. Sending internet hugs. 

I took a job as a supervisor at a coffee chain a couple years ago, after moving out of a traumatic household. In my mind I was moving on up and this job was going to help me be more assertive and gain confidence.

Within 2 days I was bullied, undermined, people thought I was a joke. Coworkers were impatient with me and very curt or condescending. I’d get reprimanded by higher ups for not “doing my job” and “lacking confidence” but it was really difficult for me to do those things in that environment. It was very cliquey, people didn’t like me. So I shut down, didn’t bother doing my responsibilities since no one thought of me as a supervisor anyway, and stopped talking to everyone. Every day at that job made me feel depressed and lonely as fuck. I felt like an outsider, disliked, and unwelcome.. and I’m really sensitive to that shit. It still bothers me today. I still feel humiliated. Yet I stayed because I was anxious over money and feared not finding another job.

In retrospect, I should’ve quit and gone somewhere else. It was totally not worth it. Life is too short to be miserable like that. Or you can fight your way through and make it work, if your personality is different from mine. I can’t do that, I don’t want to make anyone like me… I just shut down instead.

"Hey girl, I completely know this feeling. I’ve gone through this too and it all comes down to self confidence. Based on what you’re saying about how “ugly, awkward, and boring” you think you are, this definitely is contributing to your overall demeanor. People generally like to interact with positive people who are comfortable in their own skin. I would recommend you work on building your confidence! r/confidence is a helpful place for advice. 

Despite all this, unfortunately pretty much everyone in this world will experience an asshole coworker at one point in life. Know that you’re not alone. It will make you stronger, believe me.

I lost my girl Stevie in November to cancer. She was my first dog and my best friend. Last Thursday I adopted a dog. I named her Maggie. She’s a really good girl.  But I feel guilty and bad because it’s only bee alittle over two months..I’m not over the death of Stevie. I wonder if Stevie would be mad at me. I don’t love Maggie like Stevie.

Its normal to feel guilty, just take time until you will love Maggie as well. I had similar feelings with my old cat with whom I grew up with when I got my new cat. They were different personalities but both adorable. I got to know the new cat and I am responsible now for his happiness and I do the same job as I done with my old buddie.

I’ve felt the same. I got a dog fresh out of high school And my girl I have now, is been years since the first passed and I’ll never love my current dog the same way. Because she’s not the same girl with the same time in my life. The dogs we love first we love the way a child loves. After that we love with a tiny wall up.

All this goes to say is that it works out - you are using your sadness to bring actual good in the world for another being.

"I am still in school, A year 12 student currently. 

I was a annoying little shit from year 7 - 9 causing people to get annoyed at me and hate me. Through those years of schooling i have made 0 friends, Everyone hated me and people still. do. from the years 10 -12. i was making no friends at all. Things aren't going my way with my life. 

Everyone wants me to go away, everything, people still find me annoying still. Social Emotional disorder doesn't also help with this factor. Mainly these 10 girls are massive little shits towards me and keep disrespecting towards me. i try to treat them nicely. now every time i see one of them i just want to fucking punch them in the face. I used to work at Maccas as well, that didn't go well because i got fired from there for a dumb reason. now this one girl out of those 10 keeps bring it up even though IT HAPPEND 18 MONTHS AGO.  

I just can't take it anymore. i made this account, hoping that no one from my school finds this post if i posted it on my main reddit account.

I can't take schooling anymore. I haven't told my parents about this issue. I am scared to tell them about being abused at school. I haven't even told the school about this.

I just want to kill my self....my life i screwed and over. i can't go with my dream of flying after school as i am doing a qce and not a atar. I just can't take it anymore.

"Here is some background of the situation in I  (25 F) and my ex best friend also (25F) we’re best friends for 7 years since high school we have had a group friends before but stupid high school drama happened in our friend group everyone disappeared but I always had her with me through everything she was everything to me like a sister. In 2022, unfortunately something happened between a good friend of ours and my ex best friends  boyfriend which wasn’t other friends fault in matter it was the boyfriends fault but she stop talking to her completely or even hang out with her anymore which didn’t make sense to me. Then everything became difficult to hang out with my two friends until one day hung out with the other friend and another good friend of mine one day my friend who was in the situation with my best friends bf was having a difficult time so we decided to go out and I posted a snapchat of the hang out cause it was fun. Then the next day, I unfortunately found out
that my great aunt who i loved very much like a mother passed away that day I went to go talk to my ex best friend about but I saw that she had unfriend me from everything, even i didn’t text me back or call me back. So i left a message saying idk why she unfriended me or won’t talk to me but i’ll leave her alone. I was in a state of depression of grief for my great  aunt and losing my best friend. After,  being in therapy I felt like I move on from my ex best friend and was in a good head space and having supportive friends at my side it was okay until I got a text from her out of the blue…….. I read the message saying she apologized for not talking to me and leaving me wondering why she left me with not as much as a text or call cause she was annoyed that i was hanging out with the other friend than her when i tried to make plans this didn’t work or both us were busy at the time she said that’s hard for to hold friendships with others cause of the situation with her family and all I think she’s was trying to be friends or just telling know why she left me like that…… haven’t responded yet…idk what to do i don’t know if our friendship will still be repaired after she left me at that state any advice or what to tell her i would truly appreciate it."

It's okay to not know if your friendship will or can be repaired. That seems perfectly normal to me. I guess the question is are you willing to find out if it can be repaired? If you are, then it seems like you'd want to be open to to future conversations, and listening. Whatever relationship the future might hold for you, then I think holding that door open would be the first step.

"I’m a student. I’m majoring in Psychology. I’m still living with my parents and two of my siblings (one in Middle School, one on High School).  My mother is always in pain, which is making her much more irritable and angry than a few years ago. I don’t like talking with her about anything, which hurts because I used to talk to her about pretty much everything. My youngest sister forgot to feed the dog, which is becoming more common. She was asleep. I share a room with her, and our mum came in (not at all calmly) and woke her up. I went into a silent panic attack. I don’t even know what happened other than my dad trying to tell her to lower her voice and be gentler. I feel like my number of people I can trust are slowly slipping away from me.
I have a lot of problems in my life. They’re all tied in a big knot, but I don’t have anyone who can help with more than a few strings of this knot. I have one friend who understands my social troubles, anxiety and ADHD. I have one friend who understands anxiety, minor family disputes and school stress. I have one who understands family. None really intertwine. Also, I can’t ask for help because I’m either never alone with a person I trust about a certain topic or I’m too emotional to speak.
I’m also feeling oppressed because of my religion. It’s all “that’s a cult” and “why is it so strict,” even though our GUIDELINES (not rules) are less strict than so many other religions and the cult stereotype comes from a branch that took certain things way too far near the beginning and never changed even once the guidelines did. That’s who everyone believes I am when they hear about my religion. They think about polygamy, racism, homophobia, strict restrictions and fear mongering.

Anyway, I need to be productive in 6 hours. I guess sleep would be good. I have therapy tomorrow. How do I explain this without crying so much I can’t speak?"	SilentSatyress	post	18.02912869493978	female	White	0.9979172348976135	na	na	na	1	mmfb	no prediction.
" Hello! I'm 22 years old and I struggle with my mental health. I suffer from OCD (I'm on medication and currently attending group therapy) and I'm prone to depression. I don't know what causes me to think that my life is meaningless and it wouldn't really make a difference if I was to disappear, but I wanted to state my conditions just in case.  
I can't shake off the thought that I'm rarely actually happy and content with my life. I have an amazing boyfriend of 3 years, we'll move in together soon, but my overall mood is quite shitty.  
I'm constantly doubting my self-worth, my capability to get a degree (I dropped out of university, but plan on going back to the same course). I sleep a lot (usually wake up between 10:00 and 12:00) and honestly I can't remember the time when I was feeling normal for an extended period of time.

I'm not even sure it's a good idea to post here, but I guess since I typed all these things out, at least it worths a shot.  
I went to a psychologist and I managed to solve most of my traumas, but she couldn't help me in my lack of confidence and my constant fear of failure. I feel like no one can help me. I want to help myself, but I don't have the means to do so.  
Basically I live my life in fear: I fear what my future brings, I'm afraid I'm not intelligent enough to pursue a degree and get accepted for my dream job. I'm beating myself up for the smallest trip I do. I seriously don't know the root of this problem, because my parents always said how smart I am and that they are proud of me.  
Yet I rather procrastinate than start studying. This was the main reason why I dropped out. I'm already picturing the exact same situation happening to me, because I'm overthinking and I'm not good enough. My shitty mentality is ""if you do something, do it right"", and since I struggle to get by with studying, I think I'm just wasting my time because I'll drop out again eventually, so why even bother and put in the effort...I'd really love to think that I'm not lazy, just a person with a lost of problems on their mind, but this is slowly killing me.  
I'm afraid I won't achieve anything in my lifetime and will let myself and my loved ones down...I can't really put it together to make sense and I'm really sorry for it. But I just get overwhelmed and anxious when I think of studying (I learnt the stuff I need to re-learn way back and I always aimed for the passing grade, so I actually suck at this subject altogether), I can't seem to get myself to sit down and study. I can't focus for an extended period of time on it (this isn't a problem with other things in my life if this helps), yet every day when I go to sleep I get a sudden motivation out of the blue to get my life together. This somehow evaporates until the next morning, I'm running the same circles over and over again, and I'm getting really tired. I feel like a weakling, I'm ashamed and I seriously am disappointed in myself. My soul is just tired and I feel like I could sleep for years to feel at ease with life and myself again.  
I exist, but don't live. Life is getting by, I'm wasting my days, months and years...people at my age are getting their degreed, having kids, getting married...I feel useless and empty. I don't see why I'm still here. I don't really have suicidal thought, I could never end my life for sure. But the only joy in my life is my partner, food and the hope that somehow I'll solve my problem(s) and will be able to live a decent life with my partner and be able to travel the world.

What should I do? I don't even know what's really wrong with me. Is someone in the same situation? Is there anyone who could help me get my life together?

"Erm, my suggestion might sound stupid. But as someone who have lived with extreme anxiety due to my parents' emotional abuse, exercise and meditation helped me a lot. 

I mean I know they sound simple. And they're not sole answers by any means. And making time for them is no joke.

But exercise if one is able can produce Andanamide neurotransmitters basically makes you incapable of being unhappy (though I guess still depends on the physiology of the person), endorphins are different... they give you energy but doesn't directly affect emotions.

The reason for meditation may be simple. It is to practice yourself with accepting any feeling that comes your way, and staying with the present. 

Observing what you see and how you feel but forming now opinion about them. Why? Because you want to be a semiconductor and the emotions to become electricity. 

The lightning will pass several times through the wire, but the wire remains undamaged.

I mean of course, it's alright to feel emotions, but for some people, too much of it can make them unable to do what they want to do. An example may be dealing with stage fright when someone has a passion for stage acting.

Meditation is frustrating for beginners, but being distracted every time as someone starting out is actually part of the process. 

The important part is once you notice you're distracted, you return to focus. I find my mind wanders more if my eyes are closed. So I use a candle and watch it flicker as I empty my mind.

I suck actually, but as my concentration brain muscles begin to grow, my time window of minutes of an empty mind increases. you have to fpcus on the sounds, your breathing, some even like to notice the weight of their clothes on their body. Practically being in the present. my preferred sound is the fan and I like to count my breaths. When I become distracted, I forgive myself and the count begins again from 1.

"1. “Life is meaningless” can be fear-based, or it can be relief based; if all you do with your life is eat fruit and sit on the beach and watch the sunset , that’s a great life. Life accomplished. 10/10 

2. Sounds like you’re stuck in a long term Freeze response. Start with reintroducing movement into your life; yoga, tai chi, belly dancing, dancing badly, wiggling like a worm on the couch. Doesn’t matter, just move more; slow steady rhythmic movements do wonder to reregulate the nervous system. Also singing is great for your lungs. 

3. Go do things badly and make that the goal. I can’t draw worth a shit but it makes my silly brain happy therefore I do it for my silly brains happiness, not because anything I draw is worth keeping. Sometimes the process is more important that the result. 

4. Procrastination happens when we don’t feel safe. When the things we love to do don’t feel safe. When we feel like our attempts or interests will be met with shame or disdain . Create a space that is safe to fail in. We do it all the time with rock climbing there’s the belay rope; and trapeze artists have their nets; make it safe to fail. 

5. You are not what you make or accomplish. Your success is not measured by your productivity. Being kind and supportive and willingly is far more human than being a machine.

When I used to move/work out at home, I generally felt better, and I was always aware of the importance of moving around, but I didn't know how much my lack of movement affects my emotions and overall mental well-being.  


I need to lose some weight anyway, so I better start to move again. It's just hard to do it on my own, when quarantine was a thing, my sister could join me most of the time and I felt motivated and puched myself. We really did bond while we struggled lol!   
And my partner is currently working from Mon-Thu until 4 pm, after that he's writing his university thesis.   
I don't like to make excuses, but it sure helps me a lot when I can do any sort of excercise with someone (preferably someone I know and love). I didn't even go on walks, I rarely left the house from last September...  
I can see why this spiraled down so badly.

"Sorry late reply. Your welcome! I'm glad your thinking about getting back to exercise. It really is a boon if one is able.

Hmm, the candle wouldn't really hurt your eyes, at least in my experience. Or at least, I look at the wick which is surrounded by light but not really the light itself. And when the flame dances, I look at the movement, and I blink. So not really super-direct staring

The key takeaway from meditation is being able to accept the present. So if you get itchy, you don't scratch it. You remain still, you accept that itch as it is until you get used to its presence. (Of course a beginner may not be able to do this right away.) The thing is, in time and with mastery, you'd be able to apply the same thing to emotions you are uncomfortable with. Remember my electricity/lightning and metal wire metaphor? It's like that.

You also need to wipe your mind, like empty it with anything but the things you choose to concentrate in the present. Like the candle flame, the sound of the fan, etc. It's practicing your brain muscles so when it comes to life's hardships, you will more likely have a modicum of control to your mental reaction (to be able to function well for example), because quieting your mind is no easy task of mental control.

Long post ahead. Please forgive me if it’s extremely scattered.

My (25f) parents (late 50s) had to go out of town Sunday night to join a search party for my mom’s friend of 30+ years who was dealing with mental health issues and has now been missing for 11 days. That story alone is enough for one post.  

My family cat of 18 years had a stroke while my parents were gone and was put down this afternoon. My brother and his girlfriend who also live in my parents house with me took her to the vet. I went to my partner’s after work for comfort because I couldn’t be there due to my job.  

When I came home, mom was explaining the story of her friend and we received extremely panicked texts saying my cousin was in the ER and then 30 minutes later we received texts that he had died of a heart attack at age 38 just a few hours ago. He was on a run and was found face down. He had 4 very young children. When my mom learned, she had a full panic attack/ break down.  

I’ve never heard or seen anyone cry and scream the way my mom did. I had to step out of the house and called my partner because I didn’t know what to do.  

Mom’s younger brother (mom is one of 7. My cousin was the son of her closest sister) came over to see my mom and after my dad explained why it’s been a very hard 24 hours, his immediate response was “Your friend is dead. He’s dead in the woods.” I already hated my uncle, but I could have spat on him at that point.  

I can’t take off work because I had surgery back in October and suffered complications so I’m out of PTO and personal/sick days. (My recovery was supposed to only be 4 work days and I ended up using 17. My paycheck is already being garnered to pay back the extra 10 days I took off.) I’m a pre-k-8th grade art teacher. If I call out of work, I’d have to find my own substitute and that’s not an option now that it’s so late. My mom works at the same school as a teacher’s assistant so she luckily has a much easier time calling out. She’ll be driving to Georgia to be with her sister (the one who just lost her son) tomorrow. I’m so grateful she doesn’t have to deal with the stress of lesson plans and substitutes. That’d be too much for her.  

I literally just put in so much work emotionally and managed to pull myself out of a long period of burn out this past week. And once things seemed like they were getting better, three major tragedies happened in the span of a day.  

My partner is amazing and lovely and keeps trying to console me. He says if there’s anything I need, to let him know and he’ll be there. I just don’t even know what to ask for at this point. I’m holding myself together for my mom’s sake. I tend to shut down, close myself off, and dissociate as a coping mechanism and I’m trying really hard to not let that happen. But I can feel that familiar numbness creeping in.  

It’s 11pm where I am and I have to wake up at 5:45am to get to work on time so I’m doing my bedtime routine of smoking (helps me sleep) and sleepy time tea (Sleepy Time Extra by Celestial Seasonings… a godsend for insomnia if anyone hasn’t tried it and needs help sleeping).

I’m glad you have your partner. Heroes need companions.
I offer you the few small things I can online: Empathy, hugs and a recommendation for therapy. If you are ever feeling absolutely trash zero no brain only sad and AAAH, call a crisis line. If you’re afraid of hospitalisation, this is reasonable. If you aren’t planning to harm yourself or others, you have nothing to fear (I mean that probably isn’t going to shut up your amygdala, but still). I would recommend having a good cry over a cup of tea or in the bath. Scientifically proven to make you feel better.

i was having a pretty good day. then i inadvertently saw a picture of me and it almost brought me to tears. i feel so ugly. i feel hideous. ive tried everything to change but i have certain features which i simply cant change. theres so much self hatred within me. often i just want to hurt myself so bad because of how much i hate myself. everyone around me looks great and they don’t even have to try. i look horrible and i try hard. all i want in life is to settle down and marry someday but i’ll probably never be married because of how horrible i look	smalluziverttt	post	3.0937117332333806	female	White	0.9978548884391785	na	na	na	1	mmfb	failed
"You probably realize this on a certain level, but you're very very likely imagining you're worse-looking that you really are. (The slightly sad truth is that beautiful people would probably not be willing to be around you if you were hideous.)

By and large people in general are very beautiful. Maybe not if you're just comparing them to other people (by which standard we're all extremely...average), but if you just take them by themselves.

Try not to compare yourself to others if you can avoid it. We're all a million different things to different people at any given moment, and we're all composed of a million different aspects too. If you try to wrap your brain around it you inevitably end up with a distortion. I mean, naturally, when you start thinking negatively about how you look, obviously you can't just spritz yourself with a spray bottle 'No!' but try to take a step back and remember that it's a distortion, and probably a very uncharitable one at that if you're have a tendency toward low self-esteem more generally, and that even though you feel bad it's not a reflection of reality and will go away in time."	smalluziverttt	reply	na	na	na	0.9978548884391785	no	no	no	na	mmfb	no prediction.
Hi everyone! I'm 23F, assistant accountant almost 2.5 years at this job now and I feel completely stressed. I have two bosses that never train me to anything, I always search stuff up on my own and read the laws. I'm trying my best to be good at my job and a lot of people have claimed that quite skilled in the past. I suffer from anxiety disorder and lately it has become worse :/ even if I do something new at my job and help out my bosses they never congratulate nor give me guidance. As a result I feel completely stupid at times, especially when I make a mistake, and exposed. I feel useless and I'm annoyed at myself because I picture me as a fearless person, but I cannot even defend myself.

It sounds like you're working at a place that really doesn't have it's act together. But that's not your fault. That's just a part of your story. 

The silver lining to this crazy work environment is that you've gotten stronger and smarter. Even if you feel stupid and small sometimes, you have learned a lot, if for no other reason than that you've been forced too. And you've figured out how to get your work done when dealing with jerks. That's a huge skill.

One day you're going to move on from here and go to a place that values you more and has a healthier work environment. In fact, the sooner the better.

I’ve been in college for 3 years now and I’m a year behind cause i skipped a lot of classes in my 2nd year so, i had to do it again. I have no motivation to get up in the morning and go to class and i have no idea how go explain this to my parents. I’ve already missed 1 1/2 months worth lectures this year. I have no idea how people get up, get dressed and go to lectures or jobs. It feels like I’m stuck in a cycle and there doesn’t seem to be a way to break out of it. I feel like leaving everything behind and running off to somewhere far. People like me (if they exist) should deserve a good place. I have no interest in interacting with people. I prefer solitude. I feel so out of place and often think of killing myself just to get out of this misery. What do i do?	shanepranoy	post	21.310485976336025	female	White	0.9994596838951111	na	na	na	4	mmfb	failed
"You could do what you said in this very post what you feel like you want to do; leaving everything behind and running off to somewhere far.

You wouldn’t be the first and you won’t be the last.

I myself did it for a couple years before I went back to uni at 22.

Options;

Look up work for room and board in a cool new city or country; 

farming in Costa Rica is really fulfilling, plants and animals are great company and it’s outside so it just feels like mud pie days as a kid. 

Join a Tibetan monk lifestyle or yoga sanctuary in India, 

Try backpacking, couch surfing , or r/vagabond 

Work for a ski lift in the mountains or go learn how to surf then teach others how to surf. 

Get scuba certified. 

Move to Bhutan or Kenya. 

Pursue writing or photography or journalism or YouTube/ Instagram. 

You don’t hate LIFE, you hate *not* living. 

Depression is the mental health equivalent of physical starvation. 

If you’re where I was as a teenager; abused and neglected and angry and resentful; then you don’t hate life you hate wasting away and you’re HUNGRY for LIVING. 

Go take a bite out of life, and if you find yourself in Costa Rica eat a guanoabana fruit, they’re freaking delicious!

"Sounds like my experiences with depression and executive dysfunction. It’s worth finding a therapist to talk about. Your university’s counseling center would be a good springboard on where to go. If you’re thinking about killing yourself, this is definitely something you need to look into 

As for how we do it? We need to. We find the jobs that fit our needs and adapt to what can’t be adjusted. It becomes our super power. Some of us can’t do that and they genuinely struggle. The first step is seeing if you can get help. Maybe talk to your parents about taking a semester off while you reset. 

It could be that college isn’t for you. Do you like working with your hands? Maybe go and see if a trade school is better.

Ahh someone who get me!! I felt the same way and got a seasonal job in the trades, it pays pretty well, enough to save up for a house when I decide that I want that, and for a third of the year I get to collect unemployment and travel doing whatever I want! Last year I worked on a goat ranch helping to birth baby goats, backpacked the Grand Canyon, picked up a few homeless folks and helped them get set up with jobs, had tons of crazy adventures. This year I’m spending my time off walking from Mexico to Utah on the Arizona trail.

"I volunteer for my littlest sister’s (middle school) D&D club. One of the players in my group is one of her teachers. This teacher deals with rude middle schoolers, recently lost a family member and just radiates exhaustion. She’s really good at masking it, but I’m a very empathetic person who knows that feeling. I don’t know how I can support her. I don’t know if I can, really. I hate feeling like I can’t help someone.
My mother is always in pain. She feels useless, and I can’t help her with it.
I’m trying to get a diagnosis to understand my brain. My therapist is very confident that I fall under the neurodivergent umbrella, but due to my high intelligence and ingrained masking, I need a specialist to evaluate me. This is tricky, as waitlists in my area are LONG.
I’m feeling down and tired a lot lately. I can’t seem to describe this effectively, and haven’t brought it up in therapy for some reason. I don’t know why.
I wish someone would notice me. I’m very good at masking (usually involuntary), but I’m still tired and anxious. I want someone to ask me if I’m okay. The only people who have really done this for me are my therapist (when I started crying as we were discussing a heavy topic) and a friend I met at church. Once a week, there are activities at the church building and we’re both usually there (I do enjoy these most of the time, but they sometimes get really tiring), and she picked up early on that if nobody knows where I am, I’m sitting in the dark chapel (bc I know nobody’s going to come talk to me. I guess pitch-black chapels are creepy enough to keep the social people away). This week, the group was chatting while making ice cream. Someone’s kid was playing the piano, the ice cream machines were whirring and everyone was talking. It was too much. I slipped off and had a panic attack in the chapel. My friend came in after a few moments. She sat with me and asked if I was okay, if I wanted to talk about anything. This is the person I trust the most in the world, and I still had to fight my instincts really hard to even think about sharing what’s going on. Unfortunately, I just tested up so much I couldn’t talk. Even typing this is making me cry.
My thoughts are going too fast. It’s like a whiteboard with 5 markers (colour changing) going a mile a minute and I can’t control them and there’s an eraser that likes to run around and sometimes it just completely erases (especially during therapy cuz trauma). Makes conversations tricky. Especially therapy."	SilentSatyress	post	21.9663015848465	female	White	0.005937966052442789	na	na	na	1	mmfb	no prediction.
I feel you on the masking thing, I rarely if ever show that I am bothered by something. It's not voluntary it's just how I am and it's very very difficult for me to even open up even when asked.

So my exam results are about to arrive in 2-3 days and I'm mostly confident except my Algebra/Graphing Test. I have basically used the wrong formula from 1-10 and honestly, don't feel confident about my answers.

I have a reputation of one of those ""Know it all, smart-ass"" students all except Algebra/Graphing. I had always found the subject hard and I'm fine with getting a low score but I don't want to disappoint my Parents because both work hard with my dad working on another province and my mom working endlessly at our house to feed us and by showing these Grades feel so degrading making me just want to disappear. I really want to make my parents proud but I never feel it.

If you're asking, No, I excel in every other subject but Math and that is what I fear. They have such High expectations to me and I feel like I'm not worthy to be their child.

"Parent's high expectations placed on kids can be motivating to some, and they can also be super toxic.

I was one of those smart ass students too, and I also had a few blind spots. Heck, even the stuff I was ""naturally"" good at required a lot more effort after high school, effort which I frankly wasn't used to giving.

In my case, I traded ""meeting my parents' expectations"" for ""doing well enough for myself"", and I'm perfectly satisfied with it. I didn't make it into the best engineering school in the country. I made it into *an* engineering school where I studied what I wanted to study, then had a career doing what I wanted to do.  

Because in the end, it's your life, not your parents, no matter how much they invested in you or withheld emotionally from you. You mention you never felt your parents being proud of you. That's unfortunately not something better grades are going to fix.  

That you're able to express this and think through it is a clue you're about ready to start shifting your mental attitude from ""I must do whatever it takes to satisfy my eternally unsatisfied parents"" to ""I know what I want for myself, and I'm going to work to get it.""

Beside the emotional baggage your parents are making you carry, the thing that sucks about Math is that every new grade builds up on foundations you were supposed to learn in previous grades. If your foundations are shaky, you find the new stuff increasingly harder to grasp and make sense of, until it turns into a nebulous ""I'm just not good at math."" You'd feel bad about yourself going over materials again you ""learned"" years ago, and so you just start internalizing that ""bad at math"" is a part of your personality, when it almost certainly doesn't need to be.  

It could be a good time investment to go back to math basics. You have gaps and you need to fill them. If you can, get a tutor. If you have good friends that grok the topic and are willing to spend time helping you, tap those resources as well.  

Not because of your parents, but for yourself."	Frozen_Attack	reply	na	na	na	0.9992775321006775	no	strong	no	na	mmfb	no prediction.
"Hi,

I'm   working on a project (computer game) that haven't had the best   financial results last year, and I'm seriously afraid that we will go   bankrupt this year unless something changes. I was working on it from   2014, and I remember the times when I was so enthusiastic about it. The   project released in 2019 and we got amazing feedback from our players,   even on steam we got a great score, plenty of copies were sold...

Now,   the last year and so I have just been feeling so burnt out. And what  is  the worst are some of the employees I need to manage - constantly   flaking, coming late to meetings, or not turning their work in at all,   and I constantly have to remind them. Those are like only 2-3 people,   but they just make my mood towards the project so miserable to the point   of wanting to say screw it and go away. But the project is very   important to me. Sometimes it feels absurd that now, when we finally   ""did it"", that I should end it.

I   don't want to fire them, because I'm afraid I won't find replacements   for them and they already know well what work should they deliver. But   the fact that they are so flaky and I constantly need to deal with this   just makes me so demoralized.

I've   also been dealing with some big problems in other areas of my life,   like my PhD dissertation being shot down in my last year of study, and   my partner (f) constantly criticizing me and pressuring me to marry her,   which does not help either. Sometimes I think whether it wouldn't be  better to end it all. Man, this really got off the rails. I  already  attend counseling sessions, but the progress is small to none.

Yeah, I guess that's about it."	Carter_8404__michal	post	17.68464915721824	male	White	0.9994353652000427	na	na	na	3	mmfb	no prediction.
"Shit. This really sounds like a whole lot to deal with, for an incredibly long time. I'm so sorry that you're going through it. 

And it sounds like there are a lot of different problems - from your co-workers and employees to your academic process to your relationships. 

You will get to a better place. I can't say exactly how. And it probably will take a bit longer than you'd like. But you will get there. 

If your video game goes bust, that's okay.  You'll be fine. You'll move on to the next thing. You've already have great success with it, and ultimately if if doesn't happen, that doesn't make you a failure. You'll just take everything you've learned and bring it to the next project. Same thing with your Ph.D. Your first one got shot down. Your second one will be much better for it. 

As for counseling, well, I think that's a real individual thing. No two people are exactly the same. But you're doing the right thing by sticking with it.

"hello my name is tyler and my relationship with my father was never great. the only time i would truly see him and spend time was when i was 1-9. by the time i was 12 and becoming a teenage i couldn’t talk to my father, idk what was wrong with me. i never hated him or felt angry towards him ever but i just never knew how to start talking to him again and what to say to him. my father was sadly one of the many people to be affected by the opioid epidemic and when opioids became harder to come by herion started becoming easier. he was drug free for a long time but i don’t truly know how long, maybe for 7 or 8 years he was clean, then he started to smoke weed. i knew he did and knew his past but i thought maybe he would just stick with weed but then he got into a motorcycle crash. he had bleeding on the brain and was in the hospital for weeks, worse part is i didn’t even go see him. when he got out of the hospital something was wrong and he started doing meth. complained abt hearing people in the walls and thinking his truck and house was wired. because of all this my father committed suicide. i know i’m not the whole reason my father did it but i know i was apart of that and i’ll forever hate myself for never reaching out to help him or try to see him. In two weeks is the 1 year anniversary since it happened.

"Hey Tyler,

What you are experiencing is Suvivor's guilt. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivor_guilt .

It's very common to happen with relatives of a person that chose to end things. It can happen to friends and acquantances too. 

I had to deal with it when a friend of mine did. I managed to get through it thanks to his closest friends explaining that I was not to blame and explaining that I didn't know him long enough to be able to catch all the earlier symptoms. (He was good at hiding his despression)

But I can't imagine how it has to feel as a close relative. My advicce is talk things through with a professional because it seems the event is very recent or still very strong on your mind. But know this, your emotions are common for these types of events. You do not deserve blame, your dad was his own adult, so forgive yourself."

He said it again tonight. Said I’m ugly, that we haven’t been meant to be together for the last 5 to 10 years. We’re unequally yolked. We’ve been married over 8 with a 6 yr old child. That the one thing he asked for I wouldn’t give it to him (sex), after working a 45 hr week and giving him a medical pedicure for over an hour I fell asleep looking up how to treat his nail condition. I don’t want to leave because I know he can be good and I can just tough out the verbal beatings.

"Wait. This is your husband saying you're ugly? That's just shitty behavior. I can't comprehend ever saying that to someone I love. 

Nobody should have to ""tough out the verbal beatings."" 

Personally, I think you're being emotionally abused and manipulated. Consider talking to a therapist who can explore this with you better than some rando from reddit.

I know this is a little late but I saw this post and it just drives me nuts what these asshole abusive men do. I don't know if your situation has changed so hopefully this isn't pointless. I was in a horrible DV situation for a long time. Actually multiple. It always starts with verbal but it gets worse. I never could see myself out of it, and I would sit and overthink things and all the what ifs. Honestly what made me finally 'see the light' was getting pregnant. I did not want my child to see us fight, and to have her hear the way he spoke to me and tell me I'm a miserable bitch all the time.(Lots more too he almost killed me, locked me in the basement and beat me with a bat) Please get away from him, do anything it takes. But I'm telling you now, DO NOT LET HIM KNOW BEFORE HAND. They will try and stop you. If you feel like you deserve what you're going through, your child definitely doesn't. And over time you will realize you don't. Start this process now and I promise you it will change your life for the good. Anything is better than having you and your child go through his shit.

It’s not that I don’t know how bad it is, it’s the fact that I’m scared to lose everything I’ve worked for. Have to pay him spousal and child support. Since Im the one working (my choice) and he homeschools/stay at home dad, I already only see my son less than 50% of the time, and then cut that amount in half and it’s even worse. So I make myself small and ‘submissive’ and obedient and I’m able to pacify him until the next big fight.

I did this with my last dog. She was a six-year-old breeding female. Mostly in a kennel. Family had no use for her anymore. It took me almost a full year of grooming to get her 100% clean on her belly. She was shutdown for three days when I picked her up and scared of everything. I thought I had made a mistake. We have had her for one year. She is a different dog and has just started learning how to play. She is amazing and so smart. A few months after having her, she started barking to let us know when our blind dog had to go outside. She’s done a lot of other smart things. She is just one of those dogs who know. Mainly, she just loves being the center of our world. The whole family loves her. My point, this puppy your going to get has come into your life for a reason. Go get the puppy and be patient. Leash train him/her. On leash 24/7 next to you and crate train for when you go out or at night…it is safer for the dog and gives them a safe space to go to when they/you need a break. Go get your dog. It is the best decision you have already made and will always make you a better person. Stevie would want you to honor his memory by loving another puppy and sharing with the new puppy what he taught you. That is the circle of life, my friend.

This started off as a YT comment on a video explaining all the new wonderful AI tools that have been made for video game development, and it just spiraled. I was responding to someone genuinely excited for how these tools were going to make the work easier and the only thing left was to get good at marketing yourself and, I don’t know, I started falling down a conspiracy rabbit hole. This is the body of the comment:

“Cool, then we can make an AI that markets your game. And an AI to find optimized code and an AI to optimize game play and eventually you can just take the human element out completely. And then you can have a bunch of people who are talented but there simply aren't enough jobs to go around and we're all just trading the same 30 bucks around while those at the top keep perpetuating the lie that you can be one of them one day.   
 The reality is this was always going to happen, if not by this then by something else. Human's wont be outmoded, none powerful none wealthy humans will be outmoded. Its been happening, but the pace is just quickening. People can lie to themselves and go ""well if I just master the AI tools I'll stay in the game"" and that is probably true for the next five or ten years, but your just playing with borrowed time. Eventually the tools will become so easy, so intuitive and self correcting, then a producer will only need to hit a few buttons and say a few words and 3 hours later, poof, a move, a game, a new business plan, after that the only thing you'll need is money to implement it, and if you don't have it now, you never will. Its a way of keeping their club exclusive forever and keeping their boot on the dregs and fighting over meaningless social garbage when in reality it's a power struggle. We're running into this new world with none of the necessary safety nets (Medicare 4 all, mass transit, UBI, or fucking really ANYTHING) in place to avoid massive social upheaval as those in control in the tech and market sectors make their final play to stay at the top for all time, possibly even circumventing their mortality to become immortal, all powerful (governmental speaking) gods that need never worry about anyone ascending to them or falling from grace again while the rest of us are stuck sifting through the mud, too distracted and fractured to ever pose any real threat again.   
 Just human furniture.”  
 

Now, look, I’m not trying to be an edgy edge edge that edges or anything like that, I’m not trying to suck all the joy I have out for fun, but I just can’t shake this feeling that we’re really fucked. I’m also not trying to be some kind of luddite and say that we need to go back to living in caves or some shit. I just can’t NOT think this is the future for some reason.   
 

So what I’m asking you people for is to just tare this down, you know, give me reasons why I’m wrong, I WANT TO BE WRONG, tell me something I’m overlooking, explain how I’m over reacting and how really this is something to be excited about, please, I kind of need this right now."	lonearchive	post	22.110916791603064	male	White	0.9980436563491821	na	na	na	2	mmfb	no prediction.
"I think one of the insights of modern societies is that it is possible for personal greed and the common good to become aligned some of the times (but it's not necessarily easy nor should we expect it to happen spontaneously.)

That almost always requires setting some rules that create the right set of incentives to align personal human goals with beneficial societal results.

As long as it remains possible to set those rules and enforce them, then new forms of automations that obsolete more forms of labor are part of a century-long trend, and are not necessarily scary nor a bad thing as a whole, despite the disruption they bring to those directly impacted.

If however it isn't possible to have and evolve healthy rules that allow society to prosper, then with or without AI we're going to see the growing supremacy of the few in power and more generally the collapse of democratic republican values.

Perhaps thinking about AI and the seemingly inevitable automation of white collar jobs make all this more immediately relevant to middle class folks that are(/were) expecting to have white collar careers, where automation was previously primarily hitting blue collar workers.  
I think the concerns remain largely the same, and are fundamentally of a political nature.

The exact same tech that can further consolidate an intolerable oligarchy can instead free us in many ways. It depends on how it gets used. Is it left in the hand of a few greedy fucks, or is it available for the betterment of society as a whole?

What I'm saying here, if it's not obvious enough, is that politics matter, and it's worth getting involved and working toward swaying society toward the common good rather than cartoonish supervillainy.

"These are all scary thoughts. I think we all have them from time to time. And it's tough to say everything will turn out alright because this is a new situation that no one has ever seen before. 

But what helps me stay grounded is the realization that over the long run, human societies find some kind of equilibrium that allows most people in them to live in with some kind of security.  When certain situations become intolerable for large swathes of a population, that population usually makes a change. In the late 1700s, the system of having kings in charge of everything in European countries become intolerable. So - sometimes violently, sometimes not - those systems were changed. In 1929 the system of unregulated capitalism that had been dominant in the U.S. suddenly stopped working for most people. So someone was elected and new laws were passed that changed how Capitalism worked. 

AI (along with a whole lot of other technologies) will certainly cause all kinds of economic changes. Some careers that are viable now may not be viable in the future. But unless 90% of humans are content to get poorer and have less power over their lives forever and ever, than we will probably find an equilibrium. We might not be able to see what it is now - a peasant in the year 1788 might not have been able to fully imagine what a world without kings looked like - but it happened anyways."	lonearchive	reply	na	na	na	0.9980436563491821	weak	strong	no	na	mmfb	no prediction.
"I (17 M) currently stay with my mom and dad. I really fell short of words to describe how my dad is but he clearly hates my mom. He never talks to her and makes it really hard to live in the house. Seems like he is a kid and throws tantrums every so often. 

My dad I have a good bond to be very honest, we laugh a lot and I comparing him to my mom he really understands my humour and personality more than her. I won’t say my mom is the best human ever but I can’t complain for what she goes through and have done for me. My dad falls short on having proper conversations though, he is usually too busy on his phone when he is home from work and avoids any communication with mom, and whenever I talk to him he is too busy staring at the phone, basically has no respect of others speaking to him.
 
About the present,
My dad has always thrown tantrums whenever my mom tried to go out of town to enjoy with her family or even go for any out of town outings. He gets really mad and it’s too hard to handle.

My mom who was fed up with this and
Having her dream to visit a place with her friend finally decided to live her life and actually go to the place. She booked her tickets and before leaving she asked me to inform dad about the trip. His first reactions was “she won’t go” and I was really shocked. My mom didn’t care and packed her bags in my dads absence and left for the trip, now my dad who isn’t ready to eat food I send or cook for him at night keeps telling me that mom won’t be allowed to enter the house and if she does he will leave us..
I really don’t know what to do, my mom is in no way to support herself and has been the house keeper. 

It’s quite stressful for me at this point because I know my dad will erupt when my mom is back in few days. Today I tried asking my dad for why he hates mom soo much and he never gives a straight answer. He just kept repeating that she won’t be allowed to come to this house and shuts me off. Even I am not in any condition to support my mom financially or emotionally because my finals are coming which are very important for me.

You also helped me in another way. I’m a special ed teacher and I can be a bit of a tough love guy when the kids misbehave. And I mean “beating the hell out of you” misbehavior not “took an extra cookie at snack time.” Another, newer, teacher is more gentle and comforting when the kids are escalated. I disagree with her sometimes because I think she accidentally reinforces the violent sides of a tantrum by hugging them when they’re escalated. 

Your story gave me pause when I felt like saying something because I realized it’d be wrong to do anything to stifle that instinct to provide unconditional comfort to someone who is struggling. 

I have a long way to go before I become a better person because I still think “Hey I’m here for you, kid, but you can’t beat people up just because you’re angry that I won’t let you steal another student’s toy.”

It was History, which hasn’t always been my strong suit, so I reviewed a couple weeks before the test again and again and again.

"Did you get a reasonable score overall? Nobody's perfect, you know. Not even perfectionists. 

You put in a lot of effort. In the long run, that's a much better indicator of success than the score itself. I'm more impressed by someone who worked hard for 80% than someone who got 100% with no effort. 

I truly admire people who have natural talent and work hard. Having both is what separates the good from the great. But if I can only have one, I'll take the hard work every time. Talent without hard work is a gift that's wasted. Hard work without talent is someone doing the best they can with what they have. The former will never get better than what they are now.

Listen, this impulse is unhealthy. You will reach a point in your life where mistakes will be the only way you learn, the only way you grow.

"I know love is more than the little things that cause spark. And perhaps I’m selfish for wanting something so bad I struggle with once I actually do it but,

I miss cuddling. I miss being touched. It was such a rare moment for me. It felt so unreal and I actually allowed it to happen.

Like if I never find love, I’d call for cuddling services to cuddle me lol.

I don’t know at this very moment, I just want to cherish a moment with someone special and cuddle to sleep.

It sounds nice but I’ll probably never get that till another couple years…or maybe less than that. I’m just tired of imagining someone’s warmth.

Basically my dad was caught in an abusive relationship with my manipulative fucking cunt of a mother which spanned a good 30-ish years and today he celebrated his 50th birthday but my mother, being the selfish whore she is, basically alienated him from his family, meaning that they basically ignored his birthday altogether. It hurt to see so bad because you’ve got this big burly 50 year old man sitting at the dining table asking hopefully if anyone in his family said anything about his birthday. And then you see tears in his eyes because he’s been cut off from the people he should be the closest to because my cunt of a mum decided she wanted to abuse the shit out of him and throw him away, all the while pinning him as the abuser.

"I relate to this, a feeling of general dissatisfaction. In the past 2 years I have made small shifts away from a constant pining to fill some sort of void/emptiness. A massive lesson for me is being sincerely responsible for my own happiness/satisfaction. This had allowed me to stop using external metrics of ""nice partner and decent job"" to try and understand my state of wellbeing.

Things do change, thats a given in life and as a human. I dont know how old you are ,but i find it useful to reflect on the version of me from 5 years ago, 10 years ago, and so on. We do grow, even slow changes are worthy of acknowledgement!

Being on meds can be a double edged sword, Im sure you're aware. I think theres both healthy and unhealthy ways to be on meds. For example, i think its important to be curious and seek new ways to enjoy things when on meds, because the usual ways we can enjoy things are largely interrupted by meds.

"Im nineteen and live with my s/o, my mom and my moms boyfriend. My mom and i have discussed how i feel about him, i feel as though hes very immature and needs to change, she knows. What she doesn’t know is that i have nightmares about her boyfriend harming us or even killing us. He never has physically hurt any of us but im so afraid he will because of the nightmares. 

About my moms boyfriend. Hes 26, has no regard for anyone else and seems like he truly only values himself. He plays his music full volume out loud when he has headphones he can use, he has stated many times that he doesn’t like me or my s/o, he says were leeches. He used to do door dash, when he didn’t get tips he would stop at the customers door asking for a tip. He sees nothing wrong with this. He brings his own food/drink in facilities that don’t allow it, he is explicitly rude to anyone who he doesn’t feel respected by. When hes angry he gets physical, breaking things and slamming doors, he has not hurt anyone but he has threatened to/said he wanted to. He blames me and my s/o for everything wrong that happens, he doesn’t use our preferred pronouns (my s/o and i are lgbtq) and its like he just hates us. We don’t understand why. 

My mom has stated that hes a bit spoiled and immature. I don’t know if shes discussed his behavior with him. She seems so happy with him and i don’t want to force her to leave him, but when i tell her me and my s/o want to move because of him, she begs us to stay. I’ve recommended her to help him get therapy because she says he had a bad childhood but i feel like he doesnt care enough to get therapy. 

My s/o and i do dishes, clean anything that needs cleaned, we do most housework, including taking care of our four cats. My moms boyfriend takes out the trash and recycling when its full, and takes care of our 8 chickens, other than collecting eggs, we do that too. 

Is it rightful for me to have nightmares about him ?? I feel so guilty, can i make the nightmares go away???"	x__Cherrybomb__x	post	19.463146905617744	female	White	0.9984710812568665	na	na	na	5	mmfb	no prediction.

So you didn't have intercourse? Was there any penis to vagina penetration? If not, I'm almost 100% certain you're not permanent. Even if he ejaculated on top of your vulva (lips) it's unlikely you would get pregnant. Add in the plan B pill and it's even more unlikely. The most common side effect of the plan B pill is a late period. I know how scary it is for you right now, but breathe... You'll be ok. You need to be using protection if you don't want to get pregnant (or get STI's). Wrap it up every time. But for now, relax. I think you're in the clear. Message me if you want to chat!

I am really close firends with Dan, as he is my best friend since childhood and Jack on the other hand is also good friends with Dan, but not as close as I am.

So me and Jack share the same interest that we both want to meet more girls and want to cold approach them. Thats why Dan had the idea to form a group of us 3 and he would give us challenges so we can come out of our comfort zone and approach them. 

You have to know that I was always chill about this group. Jack on the other hand was so exited about it, called it a brotherhood and tried to motivate me.

We failed the first few challenges up until last weekend we decided to meet in my home city and just go for it. Unfortunately Dan couldnt come with us but Jack did. So i spend the weekend with this guys I havent seen for a decade and only just recently met up 2-3 times.

On the first day I was like shell shocked and he tried to motivate me. He beforehand told me that a couple of weeks ago he and Dan went out a weekend where they both succcesfully cold approached a woman. So I felt under alot of pressure becuase I never was as motivated as Jack and also he had seemingly more experience than me.

We go out and I speakt to 1 girl, then 2, 3, 4 ... and Jack doesnt even does anything. He later tells me it was a lie that he went out with Dan and they just said it to me, to motivate me. He later approaches girl out of sheer pressure and afriad to fall behind, but it was quite awkward and doesnt work out. On the second day he also seems stressed and quite but I thought it was just him beeing nervous. I speakt to another girl and after that he just gives up and tells me he wants to quit and wants to go home. He tells me he wants me to continue tho. In our way home I approach a second girl.

Jack then decides to leave early and doesnt answer Dans calls the next day. After that he wants to talk with me and tells me that he feels that he was there for me and that I wasnt here for him to support him when hee needed support. I told him that if he just had told me I would surely motivate him as Im not a complete asshole. Anyways he was dissapointed with me. I told him that I dont know him for that long and couldnt read the signals and he really should have told me.

Now he blows up my phone with text and voice messages and calls me pretty bad stuff and even threatens me. He is a big guy and does martial arts so Im afraid that he snaps and decides to take his frustration out on me. Im pretty scared and didnt eat today, Im nervous and lost joy. Im looking up martial art courses and self defence weapons. He told Dan that he doesnt want to hit me but on the other hand he sends me this messages after done talking to him.

I dont answer his messages or acknowledge him. Im pretty stressed out. What should I do?

I know this stuff sound like stupid child play but for me its quite serious as Im afraid that he shows up at my place once venting in my inbox isnt enough for him. Im desperate please."	thowaway19923	post	17.24263850897675	female	White	0.9934167861938477	na	na	na	1	mmfb	failed

Title kind of says it all. I am just feeling really anxious about the future of my life. I am 22M and single. I am about to graduate college, I was never really involved in any sports or clubs in college as I was focusing on my own small business. Safe to say I didn’t make any friends and college and am not the most social person although I long to be social. Anyway now my business is doing well but I really don’t have any friends or any job prospects to even meet friends outside of college.

"You sound just like how I was when I graduated college. Almost word for word, only I didn’t have a small business and I moved back home which was on the other side of the country from where I went to college. I completely lost my sense of identity. I spiraled hard into drugs, and my eating disorder took over. I really fucked a lot of the relationships I had from college and back home during this time. I was alone. I didn’t think I’d make it to 23.

Yet, here I am at 28 in the best place I’ve ever been at in life. I got an incredible therapist, got a certificate in coding which led to a data analytics job, and am completely sober. I mended some of the relationships with the few friends I had, and somehow made new ones even though I’m fairly introverted too.

Could I have predicted all of this? Absolutely not. It still blows my mind to this day thinking about how different my life is now. All of this is to say, I know you’re really feeling down right now and I don’t want to invalidate how shitty that feels, but life is so fucking unpredictable. I’m beyond confident that you will find your way. Everyone has a different path in life, and I know it sounds hokey but everything really does work out.

"I’ve been feeling awful today, and I really need some love. It’s not that I haven’t achieved a lot. It’s just that achievement isn’t what I want.

Basically, I’m getting into my second semester as an engineer right now, and in an objective sense, things look good. I have a 4.0, I’m more than a semester ahead of my degree plan, and by the time I show up back at school in August next year, I’ll have over 60 hours before even reaching my second year, and I managed to do most of this with a rather low workload, with a good portion of those 60 hours coming from AP classes. I’m on track to graduate with my degree in 3 1/2 years. I have all of this at a top ten engineering university.

But I just feel awful.

I’ve tried getting to know people better, and to just feel loved and have a normal social life. I’ve been crying non-stop all week. I wanna hold someone, but I can’t. All of first semester, I’ve reached out to try to make friends, but I’ve kept on falling short. I literally offered completely free tutoring for a course I was really good at just to see if I could get to know people while I was tutoring and maybe make a few friends. They took the tutoring, but not the friendship, as I thought that at least a few would do- but all of them?

On top of that, I’m worried about whether or not I can get a job after I graduate. I’ve heard stories of people failing after hundreds of applications, and I’m wondering if I can even make it at this point. It just seems to me like I’ll end up sad, lonely, and unemployed, with all of this work for nothing. I want someone to just hug me, so even if it all goes to shit, I know someone, at least one person, still cares about me.

I was just wondering if anyone felt the same way as I do, and if anyone had any advice.

"Sorry to hear what your'e going through. It sounds like it really sucks on a number of levels. But I promise you that it will get better.

Just some random thoughts - 

\- On the unemployment thing: For sure going out there and trying to find your first job is scary. And lots of horror stories go around. Which makes it easy to get extra freaked out about an already intimidating process. Plus, you know, you read so many things about the economy softening and layoffs happening. Which makes it even easier to get freaked out. But it helps to step back and look at the big picture in an objective way. Objectively you are clearly a very motivated, hardworking person. And you will be graduating with a very in-demand degree from a top-ten engineering school. You might not get ten job offers on your first day out there, but you will be fine.

\- On the loneliness: Man this one is a harder nut to crack. I'm really sorry. This was a big part of my college experience as well and I don't know that I found an easy way through it. I think one thing no one tells you beforehand is that college can be a very lonely experience. Everyone expects it to be the best years of their lives, where they meet the love of their lives and find their tribe. And that happens. For some people. Sometimes. But just as often (maybe more so) it's a very imbetween kind of place. You're thrown together with a bunch of people you don't know, and most of them are really focused on their courses, and also after four years everyone is leaving to go to different places. It's super hard to find community in that situation. That's part of the reason college students drink so much I think. There's nothing wrong with you that it's not clicking now. Don't put too much pressure on yourself of the experience. Instead of waking up hoping that you'll find the love, acceptance and intimacy you always wanted, focus on just trying to find a little human connection every day."		reply	na	na	na	0.9974979758262634	strong	no	no	na	mmfb	no prediction.
"
I’m 24 and I’d say I’ve been depressed and anxious in varying stages of severity since I was like 14. I can go long periods getting by fine day by day, maybe even exercising, socialising a lot, meditating, practicing mindfulness, etc., but even at those times I think I’m pretty numbed and have anhedonia and a lot of negative self talk and zero self-esteem, along with a (manageable) bit of social anxiety. If things are on the worse end I can sleep almost all day, not want to move or do anything, feel pretty dissociated, incredibly anxious, isolate myself from everyone, don’t take care of myself, think I’m a terrible person, etc.

The thing is for a long time I’ve been incredible at hiding it and playing the ‘always happy and joking around’ type of guy. My friends have said to me before it seems like nothing bothers me, a couple of people have told me I’m either the happiest or most laid back person they know, people think I’m really confident, etc.

And while the depressive phases would negatively impact me socially, academically and physically in the long term, letting friendships and family ties grow distant, never even trying romantically whatsoever, and failing goals I’d set for college or my future, I could always keep it together. Nobody would know anything was wrong.

Except recently I’m struggling to keep it together and I think I’m finally slipping. A few months back my grandpa passed away and even though we weren’t very close anymore, I think it flicked a switch in me mentally. I realised when he passed I wasted so much time not nurturing that relationship out of the cycles I’d described above; I’d feel depressed and anxious and not know how to act, I’d spent months not visiting him because I couldn’t face family, and by the time I’d occasionally snap out of it it felt too late to salvage things. I know he loved me still, and that makes it worse, because I had no reason not to be close with him other than the fact I’m unappreciative and selfish when my mental health struggles. I only want to be alone above all else and above anyone’s concerns. I remember one conversation we had at Christmas when I was maybe 17 and he said ‘I hope you know I love you so much buddy, it’s so nice getting to see you even if we haven’t for quite a while’. I’m tearing up just thinking about that man, I miss him.

My mental health was certainly slipping before that, but ever since he’s passed it’s been multiplied. Dissatisfaction with being aimless after college and having a minimum wage job has become sheer dread of working everyday. Staying up till maybe 2 or 3 in the morning has become staying up until the sun comes up and sleeping until it’s basically dark again. Being a little distant from friends has become ignoring people for days on end. Feeling numb for most of the day has become bouts of feeling dissociative for some time and then bursting out crying randomly sometimes when I’m alone. Having low self esteem has become thinking I’m an absolutely terrible person. Being down occasionally about still being a virgin and never having a girlfriend has become seeing it as pointless and seeing myself as unloveable and not capable of loving back in a real way anyway.

These feelings and behaviours aren’t new, but they haven’t been this bad in years. And finally I think my facade is cracking. Coworkers tell me I look exhausted and I get asked if im okay out of genuine concern and told I look sad or down at least once a day. My parents asked me (apparently half jokingly but I could tell it was serious) if I’m depressed. I told them of course not. My friends who never really talk about their feelings ask me what’s going on with me when they see me and tell me they’re a little worried about me.

People can see it, it’s like it’s oozing out of me now. And somehow that’s even worse because still I cling to trying to act happy and joke all the time because it’s all I know, I can’t open up to anyone and if anyone tries to get in I just push them away and isolate. I’m so damn tired all the time and I just want to sleep and sleep. 

And when I get like this I know it’s hurting me long term. I’m going to feel like a worse person the more I isolate from friends and family like I have for so long. I’m going to feel like more of a loser if I don’t find some direction and pursue something. I’m going to feel unloveable if I don’t open myself up to be loved by someone and take some chances. I’m going to anxious and depressed in these cycles all my life if I don’t put the effort in to break it. I’m going to watch more people in my life pass away knowing I can never have a better, more meaningful relationship with them, the same way I knew my relationship with my grandpa would never be any better than it was because it was too late and I’d spent too long ignoring it.

But I’m so tired and it all seems so insurmountable and all I have to cling to is the funny, happy, joker persona. And it’s getting harder and harder, and people probably don’t even buy it anymore, but what else can I do? I either go between not caring, to being too anxious to show any emotion, to isolating for comfort, to whatever behaviour I can find to just hide all this anyway.

Such a long rant but I needed to vent. Today at work I just felt like bursting into tears on and off. I’m getting older and losing more time as the people in my life, the things I want to do, and the experiences and romances and intimacy and whatever else I’ve ever wanted out of life just get further away, and I’m just watching it go, fooling myself that I don’t care mos of the time until one day I cry about it. And some of it already is gone for good; my grandpa is gone and I can never tell him I’m sorry for being a terrible grandson and that I love him. I had a dream not long after he passed that I was sitting having a beer with him and I woke up and realised I never done that as an adult one to one with him. It was really that simple; I could have went round to his house, had a beer with him, and spent time with him. I’d give anything for that now.

Who knows what I’ll regret in a year or 5 or 10, and I know deep down I should learn that I need to do everything I can to be closer with those I care about, find new people to love, find a purpose, find myself and let myself connect with others, but knowing that logically has never, ever made me do it. It’s much easier just to sleep it off until I feel numb about it again."	Mr_Jek	post	22.17809638594415	male	White	0.9964979887008667	na	na	na	2	mmfb	no prediction.
I'm 57 now, but I first got deeply depressed when I was 13. You can't hide it forever. Getting help through antidepressants and therapy can help.

"I was 11. I know the cycles. And I also very much relate to feelings of regret and wishing you could do things over. 

I’ve found myself on meds three times and they help. It’s gradual and it kind of sneaks up on me but they do help to level things out and keep me doing things instead of… not. 

I’ve done therapy a few times. There’s so much out there for resources. I highly recommend going through your employers EAP if they have one. 

One flavor of therapy I found particularly helpful was dialectic behavioral therapy. I did go through a formal program at my local university, but I’ve recently picked up a “skills workbook” to remind myself. It’s pretty good.

Not all therapists are created equal and they’re worthless to you if you can’t talk to them. 

You know it gets better, because you can remember when it has and it always does. For me, i don’t believe it goes away forever. But it is not always oppressive. I can find joy in things.

"My (43m) memory has been getting slowly worse in the past 4 or 5 years. I'm forgetting details... like what time I'm supposed to be somewhere, or birthdays of my loved ones, stuff like that. It's beginning to affect my work. I manage a small group of employees and I'm literally saying wrong things without realizing it. Or maybe it's my social anxiety forcing me to talk and just say things that are inaccurate. 

I think it's causing coworkers to not take things I say seriously. And then I start to question my own facts, so I have to re-look up stuff that I just read in emails. I have to write everything down so I don't forget shit. 

I'm currently looking for a psychiatrist to be tested for ADHD. I haven't read too much into that so not to predispose myself to the symptoms.

"Like my dating pool is really low already, trying to find someone non-religious and such, so when I got to know this person for a bit, I guess I got my hopes up too much.

I guess it was my fault as well?

The other person stopped chatting with me you see.

Despite sending additional prompting messages (and this is after it all went silent) like 'Oh by the way, I am childfree as according to my profile. Is that alright with you.'?

'You're not responding, so I take it as a no, it's not alright bec. it's a dealbreaker for you?'

I sent other messages until my last one. 'Well, if you're not interested anymore, I wish you the best of luck with finding happiness, friend!'

And suddenly the chat was ended (disabled) on the other side.

I suppose it was silly for me to think I would at least get a goodbye or some sort of closure.

Because it hurts, and I wished I at least kindly asked for a reply. Or for feedback. Or apologized just in case there was something I did that caused the non-response.

But instead I gave the other closure. Without getting any for myself.

I'm sorry if I sound... entitled, I guess? It just hurts. Perhaps if I get over these emotions, I will see things more clearly. I should really meditate more or something.

PS. I also thought maybe it's something I changed in my profile. Like maybe I sounded too transactional? It's hard to describe in this thread without giving away some of my private info.

Now, let me get this straight, I know it's probably not something I did that the other lost interest.

It may be caused by something happening in the ghoster's life for example. Intellectually, I know this. Emotionally, I'm still getting there.

"Title says it. I’ll be doing the written test for one of the biggest exams in my study course tomorrow and I’m scared to hell because I even though I will get one more shot if I fail, I have other exams to study for.

Now what makes this exam so scary is how the scoring system works: questions are divided into 40 groups of 5 questions each. It’s a T/F quiz. If you answer correctly to all 5 questions, you score 5 points; if you give at least one wrong answer, you score 0 minus the number of wrong answers you gave. That means that even with a high number of correct answers, one may not pass.

I need you people to give a boost to my confidence, please."	zDasPanda	post	5.226453956558178	male	White	0.9960045218467712	na	na	na	7	mmfb	no prediction.
"Hey Hey. I totally feel your stress. This is a huge pain. Sorry you're going through it. Unfortunately it's just one of those things you've got to go through to get to the kind of life you want. That scoring system sounds really bizarre, but it is what it is.

At the end of the day though, you've got this. Sure you're juggling a lot. But the fact that you're worried about this test is, to me, a good sign. In my experience, the times when I've failed the hardest academically - on a test or in a paper - were when I was confident and didn't think I needed to be worried. Then the assignment just totally took me by surprise. That you're putting in the work to study as much as you can is most likely going to be more than enough to pass. 

If you don't though - and that happens - it's not the end of the world. Not only do you have a second chance, but on the second test you'll know what you missed on the first, and thus know exactly what you need to focus on."	zDasPanda	reply	na	na	na	0.9960045218467712	strong	strong	no	na	mmfb	no prediction.

HOWEVER 

Forewarned is fore- armed.

Go into this exam like you’re the King / Queen / Warrior / Mage, become the hunter; not the hunted.

You know it’s going to be hard so *pay attention*, read every question slowly, and the best advice a teacher ever gave me was check the previous questions for clues; some questions will accidentally answer others due to the amount of information being tested.

Today my family is celebrating Lunar New Year. We aren’t Asian, we just like to break up the drag of January and February. I was supposed to make an upside-down cake, but I forgot to put the fruit in and forgot to substitute the egg for soda. My mum was visibly frustrated and I feel like crap. Im on my period, so that’s likely contributing to my mood. Finals are coming up as well for school. I want to do over the cake, but I don’t know if that’s going to be taken as passive-aggressive (response to my mum) or unnecessary or something. I just want to cry and sleep right now.

In my experience it can be really hard to navigate parental expectations. You want to do the right thing, but you also don't want them to completely overwhelm you. You want to please them, but you also don't want to send any signals they could misinterpret. It's a mess.

I guess the only advice I'd have in moments like this is to listen to yourself. If you want to re-make the cake so that it has the right ingredients, because you think that will make the cake taste like it should, then re-make the cake. If you think the cake is good as it is and your mom was overreacting, don't re-make the cake. If you listen to yourself clearly, and also listen to hear, I think you'll feel a little safer and more connected."

nothing wrong with not having kids, there are plenty of other relationships you can have in your life that are just as valuable! there’s so much you can do in life, and if you end up deciding to have kids that’s fine, but if not, just as fine- you can always be there for your bro’s kids too if that’s better for you :)		reply	na	na	na	0.001635723514482379	weak	no	no	na	mmfb	no prediction.
"TL;DR: This is kind of long and I don’t really know what the point is. Im not really asking for advice (any is greatly appreciated though) but more so trying to get my feelings out there to where maybe there’s someone that understands.

&#x200B;

Forgive me if this isn’t the right place, I have never talked about this before so I’m not sure where to go, I’m posting this in a few places. 

&#x200B;

To start off, I’ve never been to a doctor to be diagnosed with anything, nor have I ever really expressed my feelings about this to anyone. Off and on I have these depressive spells that sweep by. I can’t really pin point what triggers it or why, but I feel like it’s a culmination of all my feelings and faults happening at once because I bottle up all my negative emotions. I have somewhat low self esteem and tell myself I’m never good enough. I don’t know why, I’m a very respectful guy that’s doing ok for himself and other people seem to think the same. Im always happy to help somebody else, helping people makes me feel really good but for some reason I don’t want to help myself. I don’t really compare myself to other people but I will admit, when I see my friends or family post about their friends or family and children their having, I feel a bit of sadness for myself knowing that I feel ill never have that before I feel the feelings of happiness for that person. That also makes me sad because I feel like that’s being very selfish of me to put my own negative feelings first over positive feelings I should have for someone. 

&#x200B;

I feel very lonely at times. Growing up and as a young adult I always told myself I don’t mind being alone. I felt at peace having no one to answer to, not having the stresses of a relationship, being able to spend my time and money how I want to. At the same time though, when those feelings aren’t there, I feel very lonely and very depressed and I feel like I just need a friend or someone to talk to, I just don’t know how. Every time I’ve tried to talk to friends about my problems I get very nervous, ill start to stutter and I physically can’t get the words out. It’s like I don’t want people to know i feel this way because I’m usually always the happy go lucky/goofy guy in the group. I feel ashamed of it and at times I dont even want to speak on it, yet all I want to do is talk about it. I feel like I’m stuck in this purgatory and I dont know what I want. 

&#x200B;

I’m 29 years old and have very little friends left. After high school most of my friends went their separate ways. I stayed in touch with some for a few years but at this point I probably have 3 real friends left. I’ve always been kind of shy but as an older teen/young adult I was more outgoing and a lot easier to socialize with. I feel like as I’m getting older I’m developing this social anxiety that I’ve never had before. I find myself so nervous to go out with my friends to places and to meet new people that I eventually just talk myself out of it and tell myself its better if I just don’t go. That has lead me to doing next to nothing but working throughout my mid to late twenties. That also worries me because I have this weird obsession in my head that i have to have my life not only figured out but well started by the time I’m 30.

&#x200B;

I’ve only ever really had about 2 girlfriends one when I was 17 and one when I was 24, neither lasted very long and I was the one who always put more in so I was always the one who felt heartbroken in the end. At times I tell myself since neither relationship lasted very long, I shouldn’t even be sad about them (hell, I figure those girls forgot about me shortly after anyway) but those 2 relationships are all I have to refer back to. Then I’ve noticed I have started developing feelings for one of my female friends but I wont ever say anything because we are just friends. Even if I see them in a romantic way, were just too different and it wouldn’t work in a romantic situation especially because I’m the only one with these feelings and I dont ever want to ruin the friendship I do have with her (even if it doesn’t ruin it, it will make it awkward and it will be different). Also its very weird because when were together, its usually a setting so even though I see this person in a romantic way, I know the situation out of where we are (whether its a workplace, an event, a gathering etc.) it wouldn’t work because in some ways we were just too different in our home lives (shes quite a bit older with a few children. Even if by some chance she was “into” me, I wouldn’t be able to take all that on and I’m fully aware of that) but when we are together doing things I feel all these feelings. It’s very strange and I don’t know why I feel like this. I have fallen for a friend once or twice before so I dont want to repeat those same emotions. I dont want to feel these weird feelings of nervousness when I see this woman talking or texting other guys because were not even anything, were not together, were just good friends so I have absolutely no right to feel that way, but I do. I don’t ever plan on saying anything to her about it because i really dont want to ruin what we have and I know in time my feelings will be overtaken by reality and I’ll be ok. That’s usually how its gone in the past, it just takes a while and I just have to get over that on my own. I really wanted to leave this paragraph out because I’m very embarrassed that I even feel this way and I’ve never really said that to anyone. I just feel like I need to get all my feelings out there right now though.

&#x200B;

I feel like if I had more friends or a real relationship all these little things I stress about wouldn’t really matter but I dont ever feel like I want to put myself out there. The idea of going out and making new friends makes me nervous and the idea of going out to look for girls makes me even more nervous. So I tell myself I want all these things but then I actively stop myself from doing them. Sometimes I just feel like I need someone to talk to but I dont know how. My mom passed away when I was 22, I used to talk to her all the time about all kind of things and I feel like she’s the only person that would understand what I’m trying to say here. I was a lot happier with my life back then so I never really felt the need to talk about these things to her but now that she’s gone I get very sad when I feel depressed because all I want is to talk to my mom. Every time I get sad I just think “if only I could talk to my mom” and then that becomes part of the problem. Even if I get over the original thing that was bothering me, I start thinking about wanting my mom and not being able to talk to her and that just makes my thoughts spiral sometimes and I just start putting myself down thinking I’m not good enough and then I get in this cycle of self doubt that just drags me down.

&#x200B;

These episodes tend to happen more “not” than “often” but when they do, they feel amplified x10 and it just pulls me in for however long it lasts. While this is happening I feel very uneasy, I feel like I constantly have a pit in my stomach for hours and my throat feels like its closing like when your trying to hold back crying. It’s physically and mentally exhausting, sometimes it consumes me and keeps me on the couch or keeps me from eating and most of time time I just want to vent. Then when I think about it, I just feel like I have no right to be sad or feel down because there’s so many more people out there with it worse off, with it actually bad, and I’m over here being sad about some shit I conjured up in my own head. It’s a weird cycle that even actually circles back around on itself. Then when It does stop though and I feel happy for a while, I dont even want to acknowledge the sadness, I want to forget that I ever even felt that way and I just brush it off like it never happened because I feel embarrassed and ashamed that I even felt like that. It’s like a bad night of drinking, you just want to forget it even happened. Im usually able to do that when I snap out of these moods but when I’m in the moods and in my feels, it’s happening in full effect.

&#x200B;

I’m really sorry this is kind of long, I dont even really know what the point of me typing this is or what exactly I’m trying to get across here. Im not really asking for advice because I know there is none you can give in a situation like mine, I just have to figure things out and get over the little meaningless stuff. I feel like this is more so for me to able to type my feelings in a constructive way and release them because i never talk to anybody about it. Forgive me if any of this sounds stupid or dumb, I’m having a very hard time even typing this to post it. I have to use a throwaway account because I’m very embarrassed and ashamed to talk about this but I feel like I need to in some way. So if anyone stumbles across this and takes the time to read it, thank you. Thank you very much for listening to me, I appreciate it and I appreciate you."

"I'm very happy you found a place to vent and clear out your head space. I hope this was a good vent.

I commented because I can relate somewhat. The feelings of loneliness. Of looking outwards at others and their happiness, yet feeling under-accomplished (maybe?) because maybe I won't ever feel what it's like to have what they have? I mean, it definitely isn't impossible, just feels quite improbable at this point.

>Then when I think about it, I just feel like I have no right to be sad or feel down because there’s so many more people out there with it worse off, with it actually bad, and I’m over here being sad about some shit I conjured up in my own head. It’s a weird cycle that even actually circles back around on itself.

I think about this all the time too, you managed to put it into words. Haha. It sucks. It always feels like I have to ""suck it up"" because others have it worse. I realise that we can't compare suffering between each individual's experiences, but it feels like I'm just a whiney baby for complaining so much when others can make it work despite facing hardships.

When I think like that, I have to take deep breaths and remind myself to take things one step at a time, and be patient with my own progress, however snail's paced it is. I can't become another person, or let another person possess my body, so I can only be patient with myself and my own personal growth. 

Anyway, again, I'm glad you got your thoughts and feelings into writing, and I hoped this helped you in someway. I wish you a calm and content, day-to-day experience, and I hope you can achieve whatever it is you set your mind to. Slowly, but surely."

I see you. It’s not cool that you were ridiculed when you were down but it’s just some random person passing through their day trying to feel some way, it’s not actually anything to do with you.

Depression sucks. It’s a dark & lonely place. I once read a quote about when you’re in a deep rut all you see around you are the walls of the rut. It takes a lot of self work to not stay there. To learn the tools that will get out of the pattern that is your depression. It sucks going through the dark, it’s scary and sad and overwhelming but there is light on the other side, if you put the work in on changing your thought patterns. Therapy does help. Finding the right person/therapist can take time too. But it’s all worth the effort. MTFBWY	OCDisorganized	reply	na	na	na	0.9909137487411499	weak	strong	no	na	mmfb	no prediction.
My doc once told me that depression is a terminal illness when not treated properly. Mind you, this was during an appointment in which I was getting a gentle lecture because I went off my meds (because I was feeling better). He said he sees it all the time, diabetic folks stop taking insulin, depressed people stop taking antidepressants, people with high blood pressure stop taking meds because they’re illness is well-controlled so people think they’re cured or their illness is in remission. You have a potentially fatal illness and you need to take it as seriously as if it’s cancer or a heart attack. You need to make serious changes to your lifestyle and we’ll-being. When my father-in-law had a heart attack, he was told he had to change his entire diet. The poor guy was just out of hospital and white as a sheet. I was like how is he going to make all these changes when he’s in crisis. He did and he’s still alive because of it a decade later. A piece of you wants to die. Been there. I get it. Remember that a piece of you wants to live. That’s why you wrote in here. That piece of you is jumping up and down saying help! We’re in crisis. Feed that part of you. The part that wants to live. Ask it what will help. Ask the part that wants to die, why it feels that way. Work to resolve the issues that come up. Keep reaching out for help. Depression is scary. It’s also convincing. Life can and does get better. Hang in there. I got through it and so can you.	OCDisorganized	reply	na	na	na	0.9909137487411499	no	strong	no	na	mmfb	no prediction.

Hi everyone. I’m posting this on my burner account. In the beginning of October I developed DPDR, specifically derealization. I won’t go into detail about it unless someone asks because I don’t want to spend time over explaining, but if someone asks about it I’m happy to explain more. For a while, I was fine. Just waiting for this to go away, because everyone says it goes away eventually. I’ve been trying supplements, yoga, meditation.. all seems like for nothing. Now I’m wondering if I am really able to enjoy things like I used to, or if this is completely unrelated to DPDR. Or maybe a combination of both. For example, before my DPDR movies and music were my life. Since October, I’ve watched so many movies but never one that I loved so much that I raved about it. I don’t know if I really like things anymore and if that’s because of this issue or if that’s just who I am. Or am I just only watching bad movies? It was always hard to focus since October, with decreased attention span and worse memory, as well as Visual Snow, but I don’t know if I just got burnt out way before. Maybe I spend too much time on tik tok etc, and need a dopamine detox. I don’t know guys. I feel helpless and unmotivated. And most of all, I don’t feel anything anymore.

"I can only come up with theories as I have yet to see a professional that knows more than me about the disorder. One of the most common ways people get it is through a drug-induced method: weed, bad psychedelic trip.. I’ve never touched a drug in my life. Other people get it from trauma: either PTSD, or a long term exposure of stress/abuse over time called CPTSD. Also we know that DPDR is highly correlated with anxiety, which I do suffer from.

My theory is I have had a long term exposure to trauma/stress (CPTSD) and combined with my abuse of nicotine and caffeine at the time, my anxiety shot through the roof. I’m guessing that ungodly mixture is what set this off for me, but I’m grasping at straws. Some people might just be more prone to it than others. One thing I do know is I will never touch nicotine again or any drug for the rest of my life."	VincentVegasiPhone13	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9983920454978943	no	strong	no	na	mmfb	no prediction.
In November my boyfriend had a severe asthma attack the day before his freaking birthday and went into pulmonary arrest. He was blue and 2 minutes from death, the paramedic said. He went from cheerfully cooking dinner to nearly dying in only 20 minutes. The ambulance came just in time. He was hospitalized for a week. Since then, him and my mom, whom I both live with, have taken turns being in and out of the hospital. I even spent the new year there. My boyfriend is the one with a job and meanwhile I feel like a complete bum even tho I know I can't get a job because Mom can't be left alone too long. But I still feel I should have a job, I just really don't know where I'd put her while I work. I do everything physical for her and can't afford a caretaker. So when my boyfriend misses work for health reasons it's a real blow to our only finances. On top of that we've been trying to get his FTM top surgery for nearly 5 years and can't manage to save up money when shit keeps happening. He's almost 30 and deserves to live in comfort especially with his asthma being worsened by a large chest. Then last week I was involved in a hit and run outside my apartment where the other person ran off but came back in the middle of the night to slash my tires, because hitting me and leaving wasn't enough. No proof and shitty insurance and I'm screwed. I just want everything to stop so we can attempt to recover but it won't stop. Then today to top it off my boyfriend ripped his only pair of work pants and we have no way to drive to buy more so I'm hoping the crappy thread I found holds for more than 2 shifts. Why right now you fucking stupid pants? And also I feel insane because normally I feel a ton of emotions when stuff happens but lately I feel completely nothing can't even cry or get mad.

"My life is basically useless. I'm stuck in a hole I can't get out of.  There's so much going wrong that I don't know where to start or what to write.  I live with my mom, and help take care of her and the house.  My dad passed away in 2013, he was the head of the household, and the sole breadwinner.  He was also my best friend.

 After he passed, my mom lost it, and was diagnosed with bipolar depression,  Schizophrenia, and is manic.  I try to help take care of the house and her, but it's very difficult.  I mention my mom in the story because it is relevant to my problems.
 After my father passed, I had 2 vehicles, and a decent job at Bridgestone Arena. Until around 2015, I was making it fine. But my mom got worse and worse. Eventually leading to her to calling my job after an argument, and having me fired. 

I eventually sold one vehicle, because I couldn't afford the constant upkeep and mechanical problems. About 2 months after I sold my car and got fired, my mom wanted me to let my older sister use my only other vehicle to get to work. My sister blew out the transmission, then junked it herself to get the money for a new car for herself. 
 That left me with no vehicle and no job, And no way to get to work when I found a job.  For reference, I live in the middle of nowhere Tennessee in the woods.  So my few friends that I have, live too far away to swing by and give me a ride to work every day.  My life has been the exact same since 2015.  I do odd jobs here and there when someone needs help, but other than that I've been stuck in a hole having to rely on my mom since then. 

 She's had 3 jobs since my father died and has been fired from all of them.  My Uncle (her brother-in-law) gives her a ride anywhere she wants, but won't even let me ride to the store alone with him.  So he won't give me a ride to any job I get.  We own our house, So we don't have to worry about that thankfully. But it's so hard to get a job and get a ride to it. We get along half the time.. The other half we argue. Mostly due to her bi-polar. (I'm undiagnosed, but I feel I may have it as well). 
I feel like I'm in a hole I can't get out of. I need advice. I need help. I feel like my life is useless, a lost cause.

"You've been handed a shit hand in life over the last few years, and there's no way to sugar-coat it 'cause that really sucks.

But if you don't mind a bit of advice, let me tell you a story.

First, I want to make clear that in no way do I feel that my life has had the kind of challenges you've faced. Anyway...

Over the last decade or so, I've faced a broad host of health problems. I'm type 2 diabetic, and that's serious enough on it's own and has brought with it loads of other problems. I have non-alcohol related fatty liver disease. It's hereditary, and half of my siblings also have it. There's a long litany of other, lesser problems. I won't bore you with the details, and they're not really relevant anyway.

A couple of years back, my son came home and found me unconscious in a pool of my own blood. I was rushed to the nearest hospital, and from there to another hospital where a liver specialist surgeon managed to bring me back from the edge. They put nine units of blood in me that day. Nine. I very nearly checked out for good, and spent close to two weeks in a coma. I have some odd and kind of foggy memories of that time. It was like some kind of twisted nightmare I couldn't wake up from. But I was aware of the presence of most of the people who came to me during that time, who never gave up. They held me together, tethered to reality, and I owe them a debt I know I can never repay. But I digress.

Between that, and the diabetes, and all the other issues I was dealing with, I just got worn down. 15 years of nothing but loss will do that to you. I felt that my life was fading away, that I had no future, and nothing left to contribute to the world or to my family. But through it all, even at my lowest points, when I wished I hadn't been saved and had just died on that fateful day, I kept trying. It's just in my nature. I still have a ton of challenges to face, but I feel that I've hit bottom and found the strength to start clawing my way back up. That I've turned the corner. With the help of my wife and my medical team, I have my diabetes if not under control, at least to a manageable state. My liver, despite the damage that was done to it, is functioning well. I've begun to address some of the lesser issues. I'm hitting the gym to try to get stronger and more fit. Every day, even those when I don't feel it - and I still have many of them - I try to be a better man than I was the day before. I keep trying to be a better me. I'm starting, after a long time, to feel like I still have something to give. That I can still be of value to my world, my community, my work, and my family. That I'm still worthy of love.

So, at long last, here's my advice. Find something, anything, that you can fix, or at least improve. Even the most trivial of things will do. Pick the low hanging fruit. Once you have that one improvement, move on to the next, and after that, another. Rediscover what you're capable of. Rediscover your value.

You have a long and winding road before you. It's not going to be easy, and you're probably going to need help. Don't be afraid to seek it out, to find any resources you can, and to ask for what you need.

But you can get through it. You can find your way to a promising future."	NeedHelpImMiserable	reply	na	na	na	0.9988445043563843	weak	no	no	na	mmfb	no prediction.
"I'm sorry you're in the situation that you're in. It isn't fair, and that's the understatement of the century. I have to admit, at some point you have to 'put your own mask on before you can assist others'. Your mom deliberately getting you fired is one of the worst parts of this story. I do not mean to sound callous- but you should consider that it might be time to leave your mom's house and let her take care of herself. Your mom is not your responsibility - it's the other way around. By the sounds of things she's maybe in her fifties or early sixties. I get that the deck is stacked against her, but honestly that's just not on you. In your shoes I would see if I could move in with a friend and get a job you can get to easily, until you could help out with rent or get a place of your own.

You will have to sever your relationship with your mom. Don't give her any information. Just go. Send her a postcard. She will hate you for it. Remember that she isn't really angry at you - she's angry at herself and taking it out on you.

One thing I did notice about your post is that you write well. Sometimes I see a wall of text and I can see that the author very rarely writes anything. Not the case with you.

"Hi, OP, your story really touched me. I grew up in Burns, TN in the woods with an undiagnosed bipolar mother so BIG RELATE. I thought I would never get out. 

Being around someone with rapid mood swings and severe unpredictability can make a person FEEL insane when they maybe aren't. So don't write yourself the story that you also have bipolar, let's put it on the back burner for now and get you some resources. 

I'm really good at research and resources (librarian) so if you feel comfortable telling me what county you live in, I can start the dig to see what resources are available to you. 

I'm from Dickson county (but now live in Florida) so I recognize Bridgestone as Davidson. I lived in Nashville from 2007-2012 and there are many resources available in that county. If you aren't comfortable talking to me, I strongly encourage you to call your local public library and ask for help. If the first librarian you talk to is dismissive, call back at a different time or ask for someone else. Most librarians want to find you the b information you need. It's our passion."

Yes, Cheatam is between the two I mentioned. So most nonprofits/ public resources are unfortunately very dependent on location.

"I was just flipping through and randomly found this post. 

Age and immersion have worked for me. 

When I was younger I hated being around people because I was bad at it. 

I left every social encounter going through the zillions of ways it could have gone better. 

I was wooden and forced I every conversation. 

Getting older and more comfortable with myself, working jobs that require constant interaction with generally angry people, and playing music in front of large numbers of people all helped teach me how to deal with social interactions. 

Now, older and much further along in life I’ve found myself loving and looking for social interactions. 

I see the same struggles I used to have in other people and go out of my way to make them feel comfortable the way I wish someone had done with me. 

Take comfort in knowing that you are on the right path. 

You will get where you want to be because you are working to be there.

I appreciate this so much! It always helps to hear a genuine success story. I have a lot of things working against me right now.. I’m a stay at home mom in a very small town, far from my roots, so any social opportunities I’d really have to go out of my way for. But on the bright side, getting older seems to help when it comes to not caring so much about what people think of you, so when I do find opportunities, I can now be more authentic and not worry about it as much. It’s ironic that now that I feel more socially capable than ever, I just don’t have any real life outlet for it. But I’m sure in time I can change that with enough effort.

People are getting married, having kids, and making millions of dollars with their stupid youtube channels. Meanwhile I suffered from poverty and homelessness throughout my 20s. Overcame drug addiction (fentanyl / heroin) , been sober for 6 years.  Worked really hard to get a CS degree doing math problems and coding all day. Literally for nothing. I try my best but I haven't been able to keep a SWE job for more than 3 months since I graduated in 2020. I still have a criminal history from when I was homeless from 6 years ago which effects my job prospects sometimes .  Every girl left me or I left and then they didn't want me back. I gave up on dating and deleted all my dating apps. I tried being religious for a couple years but don't believe in it anymore and now I feel like a fool. Blocked everyone from that religion and deleted my facebook. I Just wish I could get a job in SWE or preferably quant trading and be respected and make friends from work  and support myself at the very least.		post	38.951329161751346	female	White	0.9982351064682007	na	na	na	4	mmfb	no prediction.
"Shit man. It sounds like you've been through a ton. You've come so far, and it sounds a little bit like maybe you're trapped in a kind of progress paradox: You've done so good at lifting yourself up from where you were (if you were messing with fentanyl, there's a good chance you should be dead right now, right?) that instead of seeing how far you've come, you can only see how far you have to go - and that when you focus on that it's depressing, no matter where you're coming from. 

Honestly, you're probably never going to make millions of dollars from a YouTube channel. 0.00001% of people who try that actually do. It's a ridiculously unrealistic trap. But a relationship, kids, a solid job - I think that it all possible for you. You just have to keep doing the work that's gotten you this far. Which I know is incredibly hard.

May I ask why you don't seem able to hold down SWE jobs? Like, is it your employers choice or is it your own? It's good that you tried religion and decided it wasn't for you, so you won't wonder if it's some supernatural ""purpose"" in life that you need. I don't know where you live so I don't know what job opportunities are available, but might I suggest trying LinkedIn, if you haven't already and have access to a computer?

"Hey, Friend. Life's been really tough on you. But, to me, it sounds like you're tougher.

Though things haven't always worked out, I can see that you keep trying. You're not the type to give up. You're resilient. Check out how you managed to keep sober for 6 years! You also obtained your CS degree. That's no small accomplishment. Kudos to you! 

I can understand that it can be hard to maintain a job sometimes. And even harder to maintain relationships when you're going through (and have already gone through) so much. I think the best advice I could give (humbly and respectfully) would be the following:

1. Stop being so hard on yourself. Check out the other comments. People seriously recognize your achievement. You're a strong and intelligent person. Notice that and be (humbly) proud

2. Enroll in a gym and workout. I would say the best workout is learning how to fight. Every person should learn how to fight. Enroll in a BJJ gym (or some other martial arts). Roll with the other guys and make some friends along the way. It'll make your confidence soar.

3. Work on getting yourself into a financially comfortable spot. You don't have to be a millionaire to be happy. You can live a great life and not have millions. And if millions are what you're after, take the first step. Every millionaire started with their first dollar. 

Regarding keeping a job: look for government-funded employment agencies. I also used to have a tough time keeping jobs, but I had a coach through an employment agency who taught me excellent strategies in job maintenance and management. I still keep in touch with my coach and to this day, I can keep a job (now a career). 

While you're working (or looking for work), make an app or website and sell it. Or freelance your skills. This will allow you to be your own boss and call the shots. It will also force you to learn work ethic and self-management (not saying you don't have any, just saying it's a good way to enhance these skills)

Finally, keeping in line with the topic of finances, once you start earning, make sure you start saving. Plenty of websites out there to teach you how to save money (don't pay anyone to teach you what you can learn online for free, unless they can do it better). Financial literacy is key to Financial security, money management and growth. Here are some websites I recommend: 

https://www.investopedia.com/guide-to-financial-literacy-4800530

https://www.canada.ca/en/financial-consumer-agency/services/financial-literacy-programs.html

https://abcmoneymatters.ca/

https://www.mymoneycoach.ca/

https://www.practicalmoneyskills.com/

4. Keep focused on learning, earning, and growing. Relationships will come later on. You have to take the time to focus on yourself before you can focus on anyone else. Also, those relationships of the past, don't look back at them twice. They're in the past for a reason. If you made mistakes, learn from them so that when your future relationship comes, you don't make those mistakes again. 

Also, while you're focusing on growing yourself, listen to some podcasts. I'd recommend Firas Zahabi. He's an MMA coach and has some fire podcasts on many different subjects. 

(Word of caution: when getting into self-help books/podcasts steer clear of ""gurus"". Y'know, the Tony Robbins/ Tai Lopez types that try to sell you $2000 tickets to shitty self-help seminars/courses)

5. Surround yourself with positive influences. You don't need that many. Just 2-3 people that you can count on. They can be family, gym friends, or whatever. Just make sure these people have your best interests at heart and that they are a positive influence. Positive influence meaning: they commend and recognize you for your good, critique and offer advice when you falter, and they work on themselves as well (not just offer you advice and are waste manz themselves) 

6. This one is your personal choice, but I would highly highly highly recommend you to get a therapist. They are phenomenal at helping you pinpoint your ""dark voice"". The shit voice inside everyone's head that tells them ""you suck. You can't do anything"". These therapists also help you in getting the skills you need to overcome that voice. Also, they help you overcome any past stuff you've gone through. And don't let anyone tell you you're weak for going to therapy. You're a strong person in the first place. And seeking help requires an extra dose of strength. Therapy is for everyone, and everyone could use it. 

Well, that's a lot of stuff already. Hope some (or all!) of this advice helps. Rooting for you here! If anything, pls feel free to DM me. We can be each other's accountability partners (if you're open to that :)

Good luck, Friend. You're tougher than most people out there. If anyone can turn their life around, it's you."		reply	na	na	na	0.9982351064682007	weak	no	no	na	mmfb	no prediction.
"Trigger warning: SA and Statutory Rape.

This is kinda long. I'm sorry. Throwaway for obvious reasons. This is all on my mind right now and I don't know how to escape what I'm feeling. The memories are too much.

I met my first boyfriend at church when we were 13 and fell “in love” very quickly. John (fake name) and I both had very bad home lives and we were drawn to each other. My mom had just died by suicide one year prior and my dad and was mostly absent from my life. Basically, it felt like John was all I had and I was all he had (attachment theory is VERY real).

We met “Stephanie” at our church youth group. She was our group leader’s assistant and she felt more like a best friend than our teacher. Now as an adult, I know that this should have been the first red flag to our parents. Adults and children shouldn’t be “best friends” like we were. However, I really needed a friend, so I latched on to her and John did too.

She became close with our families and eventually they let her start picking John and I up on Sunday evenings to go to youth group. And then she was taking us home from church with her to hang out until youth group. And then we were hanging out during the week at her apartment.

John and I had so much fun with Stephanie at the time. We would all drive around late at night and blast the radio, we would go bowling and hang out at the mall together, and she let us eat junk food for dinner. She taught us some sign language and we signed songs together. I still remember how to do the song Hot and Cold. John and I were very depressed kids and she brought us some happiness.

It got really really bad really fast, and I didn’t realize at the time. Despite being religious, John and I were having sex and Stephanie knew we were having sex. She would leave us alone at her apartment to do whatever we wanted. She’d ask us questions about what we did and what we liked. We thought of her as a very close friend, so this didn’t seem out of the ordinary for us at all. We were young and stupid and I wish I knew what I know now.

One night, John’s mom let him stay the night at Stephanie’s place. She gave me the idea to omit that tiny detail from my dad and ask him if I could stay the night with her too. He said yes.

I really don’t remember much from 
that night, because she got us drunk. I was a troublesome kid, so it wasn’t my first time drinking, but it was definitely my first time drinking that much. At one point I blacked out.

I woke up on the couch the next morning very hungover and feeling very very bad in general. It was Sunday, so we had to get to church. I don’t know how no one seemed to suspect anything, because we certainly looked awful. Maybe they did, I don’t know. But our parents didn’t say anything.

John was acting really weird that day and I remember being scared wondering why. I think part of me knew. I think she touched me too, but I'll never know for sure. John wouldn’t tell me anything. He didn’t show up to youth group that night.

I don’t remember how long it took him to tell me, but at some point he called me and confessed that he had “cheated on me” with Stephanie. I was devastated and felt completely betrayed by both of them, but of course now I know that he didn’t “cheat.” He was raped.

We quietly broke up and didn’t tell anyone anything, and I stopped going to youth group. Stephanie ended up leaving the church altogether several months later, but I don’t know exactly why.

I can’t even express the amount of anger I still have, especially as I’ve gotten older. As I went through my teens it never really occurred to me how truly disgusting the whole situation was. But to this day I resent our parents for letting it happen. They should have known.

When I was 24 myself, I really started thinking about all this again. I used to be a dance teacher and I taught teenagers. It makes me so fucking sick to think about how anyone could do what she did to a kid their age. How could someone do that to a child at all? I just wanted to hug my kids and keep them safe. 

So I ultimately have no idea if Stephanie did anything to me that night. But I have nightmares sometimes. I don’t know if John would have told me, or if he would have even remembered afterward. But I still think about it often and my therapist and have been discussing all this for a while now.

I wish we would have told someone back then. I wish I was confident that she never touched another child.

"I always thought that I'll never be able to get a girl that would be perfect for me, with a similar vibe, understandable, but I saw all of them in her. But to think that we just can't be together ever, it hurts.

I've known her since my childhood but never thought that she was attractive and never gave any attention to her. 

It all changed during one holiday where we had to work together for a project. She stayed with me in my home for a few days, and we had the best fun and we shared everything in our life. Our vibe was really good.

We became close, were best friends for us, but never thought of her as someone I might love or wish to be with in life. It changed a few months ago. I visited her home a few months ago and since then, I started developing feelings for her. I thought it was just a petty crush so I didn't do anything for a while and it went away and I was normal again.

This new year holidays, she stayed with me for a week. On the third day, one thing led to another and we got close. We kissed, and had sex, and continued to do it for the remaining days. She said she liked me, but didn't want any relationship now. I was not even sure where this might go, so I was completely fine with this 'benefit' thing.

But ever since she left, I just can't stop thinking about her and those few days. It was the first for both of us. It was surreal, it was special...

But we can never be in a relationship, the reason involves our families, and it is complicated.

I know I can't be with her permanently ever, and she knows it as well, and she also broke up like a few months ago with someone who was a pretty close friend to her, so she is afraid that somethin like that might happen, and coupled with our family situations, she doesn't want to get into that path, and I understood and assured her I'll do whatever she wants to and whenever she's interested, and I'm firm on that stand.

...no you weren't, and that's okay. 'friends with benefits' is often just a short way of saying: 

> I would like to be intimate with you, but avoid the commitment and vulnerability that turn such intimacy into a healthy thing. I want to enjoy sex with you until I see someone else whom I would like to pursue instead. When that happens I want to dissolve any commitments I had to you and most importantly, I don't want to feel guilty about it.


Most people aren't designed to be able to say that. Sex often brings with it a sense of intimacy. You were growing accustomed to that intimacy.

"*OK, off topic, but whatever...*

Hey you, what's happening? Still just sitting around being cute AF? Sometimes I miss the tension you feel when you're getting to know someone you find attractive, and sometimes just kissing and making out can be just insanely hot and as satisfying as great sex. Ever kiss a guy and just...melt? It's the weirdest feeling (well, kissing a girl for me, obvs), but it's *soooo* awesome.

Please don't ask me where *that* came from in a post on r/MMFB, 'cause I have no idea. Sometimes my mind just turns off all the filters and wanders off wherever it wants to go.

"A year ago, I started working with a new therapist. I’be been in and out of therapy intermittently for most of my adult life, but never found it terribly effective until this last year. For the first time in my life, I felt like I was making meaningful progress with this new therapist - small steps in the right direction. I was hopeful, and dare I say it, starting to feel happy. 

I literally told my therapist that I was surprised by this. He said he wasn’t, because I was doing the work, and things would keep getting better as we kept taking those steps. I know it’s true, but I feel like I must have jinxed it by admitting I was feeling better. 

Not even one week later, my dog, who I love dearly, who is like my first born child, my baby, my everything, who also happens to be my primary means of coping when therapy got tough, became very ill. He spent over a week in the ICU before coming home on hospice for another 18 days before he passed. 

I am devastated. I have never loved any living creature, including my spouse, the way I loved this boy. He was my whole world, and now I’ve watched it crumble around me. It’s been over a month since he got sick, 10 days since he died, and I am still stuck in this mire of grief. 

I used to be in control of my emotions, but I have cried every day for a month. I have panic attacks. I am irritable with my family, coworkers, myself. I feel depressed, anxious, angry. Physically, I’m not sleeping, but exhausted. I have dreams and nightmares that keep me up. I’m not hungry, and when I force myself to eat, I feel nauseated. All I want to do is lay on the couch and wallow, even though I know I compartmentalize better when I have something to keep myself occupied. 

I know this is all grief. I know it’s normal to go through these things after a loss. But I just feel so melodramatic about it. Like I know I’m acting foolish by not eating, lashing out at people, letting myself linger in the pits of despair. But I also don’t know how to control this. I feel like a hormonal teenager again, having these unwarrantedly large emotional reactions that I know are illogical but I also can’t seem to make stop. And then I’m frustrated with myself for acting that way. But also frustrated with myself for expecting anything more from me right now. It’s like I can’t win. 

I have talked to my therapist about all this, and he assures me it’s normal. I know it is. But his solution is that we keep working on the skills we were previously addressing, albeit at a reduced rate and intensity while I’m grieving. 

But I can’t help but feel like I don’t want to do that right now. I know I was making progress before, but right now I’m hurting and I’m not sure I want to feel better yet. I’m angry at my therapist for expecting me to be able to just go back to what we were doing before while I feel this way. Also, I don’t know how he can expect me to do this work when my biggest source of support has left this world. 

I’m exhausted. I’m sad. I’m angry. I’m lonely. I don’t want to do this anymore. And I know all of this is overblown in my mind. I just don’t know how to make it stop. Please, if someone could MMFB… I don’t even know if that’s possible though."	mistressmagick13	post	18.64789849559517	female	White	0.9985066056251526	na	na	na	2	mmfb	no prediction.
"Yes, all of this is normal. Just realize that in these times when you are feeling a wave of deep, almost overwhelming grief, that *this is a feeling. It is temporary, you will survive it. Don’t fight it, but cry and grieve and do whatever helps in that moment. Ride the wave of feelings. Let it happen. It’s ok to just go with it.*

As you go through this, these waves of intense feeling will eventually become a little less frequent, a little less intense. Go ahead and experience it all. Stuffing it back down inside will only prolong the process and it will come out in other, less healthy ways.

When you are able to, just make yourself show up for therapy. Don’t worry about what work you might, or might not, accomplish. Surrender to the process of just doing and saying what you need to in those sessions. Get it all out and trust yourself and your therapist to move through it, without understanding what every phase means.

One thing that's helped me in moments of loss like this, when it seems too hard to go forward, is to think about what the person or creature I've lost would want me to do. Would they want me to feel lost for a long time? Or would they want me to enjoy my life, and their memory, as much as I could? Would they want me to shut down? Or would they want me to open up?

"My friends would never say so, but I know they’re tired of hearing her name, and time stretches out long between therapy appointments.

Ever since I ended things it’s been an uphill battle. I was mostly afraid at first of her retaliation, but I’ve made the smart decision not to check her Twitter after scoping out veiled death threats just once. I’ve blocked her on everything for a long time gone now. Today, though, has been one of those very, very trying days where I’m tempted to do something stupid like reach out to her. Sometimes I go back to that place where I believe her excuses: “it’s your fault, you made me do this, no one else forces me to act this way, it was only because I was upset about _____, it’s just who I am, nobody’s perfect, I guess I am just the worst person ever” etc etc. Also the labels (insults) she gave me that stuck and seem to follow me around everywhere I go. It makes me second guess myself as always: what if I was the asshole for giving up on her? How could I do that?

Throughout her fits of rage I often tried to remain very calm and never cry, think carefully before I speak, because I felt often like I was walking on eggshells. Often her anger was in response to things like speaking to another person she didn’t know even for a short amount of time. I’d hug her, stroke her hair, but I’d be at a loss for words. Because of this she often accused me of being a cold, emotionless bitch. She’d try to make me cry because it was a victory for her if she saw me break. 

It’s her birthday next week and I’ve been fantasizing about sending her flowers, anonymously. I know, I’m stupid. I just can imagine she’s going through so much right now, with this as well as unrelated events, and I don’t want to think of how alone she feels. She always said I was all she had. I almost can’t remember a single happy memory we shared, but I’d do anything just to let her know I still love her. Grappling with the fact that this is over, that I ended it and she has every right to hate me for that, feels like getting stabbed in the chest, even still. I know she was bad for me, I really do, but I think I’m obsessed with the idea of who she might’ve been, who I saw her as. She knew how to turn on the tears to melt my heart if she had to. 

It’s been months since I’ve been free from this and I know that reaching out at all is a terrible idea. Everyone in my life has made that abundantly clear. I know I can’t. 

But I’m so tired of feeling this way. There’s been moments of peace, even weeks of happiness, but it’s like I’m lost in a fog I can’t escape from. She controls me no matter how far I run. I’m so tired of feeling this way. At low points I even want to harm myself- I never used to struggle with that. No matter how beautiful the place I’m in is, I can’t escape this crushing sadness and fear. Nothing has felt real since I left her. It’s like my life is slipping away."	spaghettificationaut	post	22.896909309567945	male	White	0.9961561560630798	na	na	na	3	mmfb	no prediction.

"My therapist did an ADHD evaluation for me per my request. She had questions for my parents and one of my high school teachers and had a result based on those answers. She said the tool she used said I don’t have ADHD, but due to “high intelligence and ingrained masking” it’s really tricky for her to diagnose me. I want a second opinion, but it would be tricky and I would have to jump through too many hoops.
I never feel like I exist. It seems to me like there’s some sort of barrier between my consciousness and the world. It’s always clear, sometimes foggy, and often different textures. Polished stone or cotton are most common. Glass is up there, too.
I don’t think I’m eating well. I hate eating unless it’s a food I really enjoy, so I mostly snack throughout the day. I eat small breakfast and usually no lunch, then snack on cheese and chocolate (not together) until dinner, which is usually an average amount of nutritious food. I have junk food more than I want to.
I always think my thighs are fat and my chin looks weird.
I can’t stand any trousers other than jeans, and they have to be very particular. I will cycle through identical pairs (hate thinking about outfits) and wear the same hoodie every single day. Getting jeans I like is complicated and expensive.

"Your symptoms definitely sound like you are neurodivergent. “Neurodivergency” is used as an umbrella term for certain mental disorders that, in simple terms, causes some people’s brains to think completely differently than “normal” people’s brains. ADHD, Dyslexia, and Autism Spectrum Disorder (to name just a few) fall under the neurodivergent umbrella. 

I had to go to three different doctors before I had someone take my ADHD symptoms seriously. I was also diagnosed with OCD. 

However, as I got older, I still didn’t feel like the ADHD & OCD combination was the correct fit for me. Since then, my doctors have been considering giving me a diagnosis of being on the Autism spectrum. My doctors aren’t totally sure whether an ASD diagnosis will accompany the ADHD & OCD diagnosis, or rule them out completely. 

Anyways, I go on this tangent because you might not have ADHD specifically or exclusively. This makes it harder for doctors to pinpoint your exact situation, and then how to treat it. 

Keep going to doctors, keep getting 2nd and 3rd and 4th+ opinions until you are satisfied. Keep advocating for your health. Some doctors are crappy and won’t take you seriously—but there are doctors who WILL want to help you. You just might have to look for them.

"18jan2023

lately i been feeling terrible and it’s not going away, every time i think about it i start to cry. my girlfriend is a prostitute, we met through a brothel. she also started the whole love tale after exchanging numbers and texting. we been for over 6 months and somehow i cannot hold it much longer, my negative thoughts start kicking in and became a very jealous person( i never was). thought i was strong and confident to understand her work but lately its been rough and feel saddened.

i’m very difficult and picky person when it comes to woman and somehow her character and mentality bypassed my tall stone cold walls. we had much things in common, fun and same ideology which lead me into loving her, for 8 years i been dating on and off and never found someone like her, she is perfect for me. also the first woman that made me think i’d want a child, marry her and build a future. she mentioned that to me aswell, that i am the perfect guy and wants to be happy with me. so first i didn’t mind her work, everything was good, she told me she’d quit soon after her problems so I focussed on myself and visited her each weekend. time passed by and my love for her became stronger, her eating pattern was bad, she uses cocaine and barely cared about her health problems. slowly it started to burden me and was difficult for me to swallow the fact she is non stop working but explained later on why

she has two children in homeland she has to feed, pay the rent she lives in, the rent where her dad and children live in homeland, and some rent for falsifying labor papers. she felt forced to do this job to save her situation and never wanted to be in the first place. she mentioned coming out of a very abusive ex that dumped her with her children.

i understood her situation and accepted it on a few terms, that she started to eat nhealthier(i bring groceries every week), i begged her to stop using cocaine and she supposedly did, and to take small nap breaks.

i bought her red bulls, caffeine gums and pills if she would get tired during work instead of bumping coke. she promised me to stop using cocaine but when i randomly asked once why she didnt eat for over 24 hrs and no sleep and replied with no lust to eat, my concerns raised. one day I paid a visit and she told me she needed to pee, so i made a joke that i got a drug urine test and if she would like to do it. she froze and confessed suddenly to me using it with customers. all the damn time she has been lying to me when i asked if she quit but it was too good to be true. i felt devastated for her lies and she regrets it, but i cant believe it. she told she would lay off bc she didnt want to lose me at this point.

there is much more going on but at this point i feel losing it. i came with a solution to help problems by getting an extra job and save money for her, even considered moving back to my mom so i rather save the rent money instead of all the suffer we both get through

i dont know how much longer i can hear out those dirty men negotiating cheap prices to fuck her, it sickens me to the point i feel like a failed man. i just want her to be safe, knowing she is not getting abused or hurt, build a future together and with her children.

im sorry reddit, i dont know what to do, mmfb

20jan2023

edit: 

i couldn’t hide my emotions so we’ve talked about how it became a burden to me, neither do i know why its this month i am so nervous about it and previously months was not. i think my love for her got stronger and started to care more about her.

either way she claims to quit at the end of february but even shortened it to end of january (2weeks from now). i dont know if its true we shall see but i need to help her get back in normal work patterns if she does.

21jan2023

edit#2:

i decided not to talk much on face time, i feel my mind much clearer not hearing the conversations, negotiations or body counts shes up to. but meh, when she doesn’t reply instantly (which she usually does) i get the same thought. i cry now and then but feel adjusted to the pain. i’m currently waiting out the two weeks to see what will happen and in between weekends i’ll check if shes been clean or lying about it. i keep telling her to be honest about it   since i won’t be mad if shes just telling the truth, but if she keeps playing me i have no other choice but to break up. i won’t be able to live like this knowing she didnt care about me at all, is it too much asked?

22jan2023

edit#3: 

had a hard time swallowing friday and saturday, feelings kept creeping up and insecurities arose. thank god she is still well and alive, she didn’t respond to calls and texts for a couple hours and i got more worried. thank god she is fine. during our phone call she told me about using coke again and i really got nauseous of it, stopped the call and took a few moments to let it sink in, i felt devastated for a good half hour before she told me it was a joke, what a funny joke, she knows i’d get more upset about it, it ruined my night and worsened my mental, sunday i’m visiting her and bring up a test, i pray she is truthful to me.

edit#4:

sundays test was negative, thank god. i think she realised it but were not there yet. this week went a bitter for me, she begged to extend another week wrapping up her money and work, i feel forced to accept it so i take it, we been for months like this so what would one week make any difference, these 3 weeks are crucial as it reveals her honesty and truth."

You’re not a failed man, you fell in love with someone who isn’t healthy for you. It happens to a lot of people. Did I read your story correctly, that you’ve only been with her for 6 months? I know you think she’s a good match but you don’t even know what she’s like without the drug use and eating disorder. She doesn’t seem ready to give up this life for you, how many years are you willing to wait before you give up trying to save her? I think you deserve a better partner.

"I went through something similar when I was younger. I started dating a girl, and after about a year I found out that she was doing prostitution on the side behind my back. There were some obvious red flags that I missed, one time, I found a check in her purse, and she could not explain why she had it. I also saw her phone one time and she was taking to many other guys.

I also found out later that she was doing meth and heroin behind my back. I was really in infatuated with her and would’ve done anything for her. 

All of my friends and family were telling me that she was bad news, but I did not care what anybody said, I wanted to be with her, no matter what. Even though I knew she was cheating on me I still did not want to break up with her.   I pretty much just accepted it. 

Similarly to you, I was spending all of my money on trying to make her happy, but nothing ever changed. My only advice to you is to get out of this, right now, ASAP. This sounds exactly like what I went through and it is not going to end well. You should really quit while you’re ahead. 

In my situation, after I was totally broke, she eventually just cut me off.  Thankfully she did because I don’t think I would’ve been able to walk away on my own. I was completely hypnotized by her.

After we broke up, I was just drinking and depressed for like the next six months and then out of nowhere I found a new girlfriend. It was the best thing that ever happened to me. I just looked back at that time and can’t believe how completely stupid I was for going along with it.

So yeah, my advice to you would be to just start moving on from this relationship. It’s not healthy and when a girl is that messed up, it is almost impossible for her to come back to normal."	Objective_Fall1300	reply	na	na	na	0.9958180785179138	no	strong	no	na	mmfb	no prediction.
i’m so sorry to hear about this difficult situation you’re going through. you’re a great person and you’ve been amazing/supportive throughout this whole journey. however, for her, this isn’t a lifestyle that you can just leave. it’s really dark on that side, there’s countless movies on it too, and they’re v telling. both prostitution and drug addiction are major evils that corrupt the person that’s doing them, no matter what necessity’s making them do it. it’s just a terrible, terrible place to be in. i would say you’re both struggling and you both deserve the best, it’s just not a good time rn. she’s shackled by her responsibilities back home and you (like any normal person) have started to feel agitated over what’s going on, and how you can’t fix it. that’s okay. is there any way you could help her find a more respectable job that can earn her enough cash to support her kids and father? maybe once she was out of the prostitution business, the drug addiction could be dealt with gradually. you need to talk to her. and it won’t be one talk, it needs to be done a lot. communicate as much as you guys can and try to figure out a way, a compromise that can help you both. otherwise, it’s going to hurt you both. just talk and try to brainstorm ways out of this situation. everything will be okay, it will be for the best. i truly believe that.

You can feel in love, have hope and want to save her all you want, but if she doesnt want to be saved its not gonna happen. The question is, how long are you gonna cling to this idea until you realize she is just not right for you? At least not under these conditions.

She may want a diff life, but until she decides to take concrete steps its not gonna happen, and im afraid she might just be manipulating you as some sort of miracle-hope idea that will never happen.

The lesson here is that love can blind you, and actions speak louder than words. If you wanna wait and try to save her, thats up to you, but how long will you wait in pain to see if it happens? If someone really loves you, they will show this to you, w actions. And wont do things that hurt you.

Also, people dont easily change and you might not be qualified to help her. Its not only the money, but the job she has and her drug addiction. This type of situation should IMO be done via professional help, her willing to take the steps and someone who is not in love w her. This is not you.

Please stop risking both your feelings getting hurt more and any chance of getting an STD. You deserve someone who loves you and shows this to you via actions, not empty promises."	Objective_Fall1300	reply	na	na	na	0.9958180785179138	weak	strong	no	na	mmfb	no prediction.

Firstly. You had no character rewuirents for this woman. Your dick fell in love and the rest of your brain followed

Secondly. If you, as a man, truly cared for her you'd give her enough money to not have to sell herself to other men. She's selling her body because you can't afford her.

Second. The coke. She has kids she has to support, but she's buying cocaine. That's the sort of character red flag you can see from orbit. 

Third. Intimacy. Dude, how are you going to have real intimacy and trust with someone who lies to you about what she's doing, when she knows how important it is to you? 

She's in this lifestyle and she's your girlfriend. She is getting the support she needs from you. So there's no motivation to change.

Tell her you need a partner with whom you both can be sexually exclusive, and that you need someone dedicated to being drug free. If she wants to be that person, you can talk to her.

As a woman I agree with this comment. It’s likely really not as simple as just lying to you because she doesn’t care about you. She is probably lying because she is scared. The fact that she is doing coke with customers is a big sign because the customers can be very scary and keep in mind they are customers that are paying so in many ways you’ve got to do what that customer wants (Also they are customers paying for sex, these don’t tend to be the best people if you know what i mean). The fact that she got scared and confessed immediately when you made the drug test joke, shows respect and also shows that she feels guilty about it and maybe even shows that she’s technically being forced to by the customers. This/her life is not that simple. Also you do not know what her boss is telling her he could be threatening her over quitting. The boss is a whole nother story. She has the boss and the customers that she is constantly submitting to and obeying in one way or another and you don’t know how dark it could potentially get with those men basically being her authority, and she might not share with you out of fear. The boss could threaten her to keep her mouth shut, she could’ve seen someone else get hurt for spilling, she could just be focusing on trying to survive it all and isn’t in the space to spill every single little horrid detail just yet. The life is hard, dark, twisted, rough and scary, and I’ll say it again it is not simple at all and probably very hard to understand from the outside. I don’t want to keep you into something that isn’t right for you because I don’t know all that far all I know is the life of prostitution is not that simple, and you are an angel for staying by her side and doing all of these things in and out of your head to try and protect her and do what’s best for her. You are absolutely so beautiful. The type of beautiful words cannot do justice for. You did not fail any aspect of being a man. You are a mangel. God himself custom made you with his hands and put you on this earth to add greatness to it. Fr. I really really hope things work out for the two of you whether you end up together or not. I can see how this could drain you and i see how comments above really helped you so I think you already know what you feel and want to do. I, as a women, would say stay with her until the end of Feb/March. You’ve already stayed this long, and I’m sure you’re a great help to her.  Just stay with her until you know for sure that she’s not respecting your love and support or if it is just stress and fear of the horrible life she’s living right now.

i should not have expressed my feelings about the drug use, that scared her to admit or tell the truth but i encourage her to be honest and open with me with everything, she just keeps repeating that the customers like it, tbh i don’t care, i rather pay for the time instead of her using coke for the money. 

i beg her that if she loves me she should not use,

"Dude, she *has already* lied to you. I am glad my comments helped but you're falling into a different trap - 'next time they do x'. Wherever you're worried the relationship is going, if you're saying this, the relationship has already gone there. She's already shown that she can lie to you avout things that are important to you. You won't be able to trust her again. Putting this another way: A healthy relationship does not require a drug test. If you need to verify the situation with a drug test, you are NOT in a healthy relationship. 

Alsi, If you leave now, it will be because you made a decision to live a better life. Waiting until something bad happens will leave you wondering, 'What if they changed x?'

Are you getting what you need from this relationship? Not what you want, but what you need? That's what should decide. But I can see how it would help make things clear. I just think that you having to do random drug screening makes things pretty clear too. I don't think you are being objective. When you stand back and consider what you're experiencing, you need to see that the problems with your relationship aren't normal problems. Most people struggle with communication, or making time for each other, or picking the right restaurant. You're struggling because your partner is using cocaine and having sex with strangers for money. Both of these things are 100%, complete, take-your-stuff-and-go dealbreakers for almost everyone.

If it helps with your rejection, my stepbrother-in-law has “mild” cerebral (it’s really noticeable in his walk and posture, but doesn’t inhibit his life really), he’s in his early 30’s and has been with his GF since his mid-twenties.

"I'm really sorry this happened to you. You didn't deserve it.

TBH it makes sense that you would be angry. A random stranger (unknowingly?) reminded you of your trauma because she wanted to compete with you. That's pretty pathetic on her part. It makes me wonder what her baggage might be, that she felt a need to gloat to you about being with your ex. People who pull stunts like that are usually a warning sign to me of them having deep insecurity.

I'm sorry the people around you aren't being more supportive. Are they very young? There was a time when I was very young that people I knew had been raped but I had no concept of how to be supportive. Still, they should make an effort to listen to you.

Letting go of anger is really hard. It says something good about you that your head is in that place, even if your heart hasn't quite caught up. Somewhere I read that forgiveness isn't really about saying that what someone did to you was okay, it's about making the decision that you're not going to carry around the baggage of it any more. That's an easy thing to decide you want to do, but it's really hard to actually do it!

How long ago was this message? I'd say if it was less than several weeks ago, maybe you could start practicing forgiveness by forgiving yourself for being angry about this? Because I think you deserve to be angry. What you do about that anger, that's always the question, but you are absolutely justified for the moment in feeling a bit of rage about this. That rage is trying to do something for you. Maybe once you figure out what your rage is trying to help you with, then you can put it down.

I (23F) am originally from Washington state but go to school in North Carolina. I came here because my mom, who is my biggest support, now lives here. Due to having moved around a lot and not living in Washington anymore, I am no longer a resident there. I want to go back to my old college there or one of the other schools I’m looking at, but they are all upwards of 40k a year out of state. I’m feeling really disappointed and just wish I could go to school there. The worst part is I’m a week in at my new college and while it’s nice, it’s not home. I just wish things were different.

"Really sorry to hear what you're going through. It's a really painful thing no matter which way you slice it. And it's difficult because, in my experience, the way through it isn't necessarily hard but it is kinda long.

It's cliche to say, but there really is no place like home. Dorothy got that one for sure. And I think that's one of the things that has hung me up when I've been feeling homesick. I expect / hope that the place I'm am will somehow come to feel like home, and when it didn't I'd get really upset. I think one thing that might help is not expecting the new place to be the old place. It can't be. But trying to be open to what the new place has to offer, what maybe you didn't get back in the old place. 

After that, it's just a matter of time. I've found homesickness is like a bell curve: it's not so bad at first, then it's really bad, then it gets better. And the X axis is just time. It doesn't feel like it now, but you will start to like this new place on it's own terms.

Im barely 17, and I’ll be 18 by the end of the year. I don’t want to grow up, I want to retry my high school experience. I want to experience my first kiss, I want to experience my first date, I want to hold someone’s hand, I just want to feel loved. I want someone to love me. I want to feel like a normal teen, it’s so hard being the only single friend, it’s so hard trying to have one thing for myself. I want to kill myself, I genuinely want to end all the pain and suffering I feel. I’m so tired, I’m so so tired and exhausted and I want to kill myself. I feel so unlovable, so disgusting, so stupid for even thinking I ever had a chance to be happy even for a little bit. I do so much for others and get nothing. I am nothing, and I’ll stay nothing.

"I'm so sorry you're going through this.  It's awful -- being young is often the hardest part of life.  At least it was for me.  You do sound exhausted...I think you need to sleep.  Not die, just 3 or 4 solid nights of sleep in a row.  It might transform your experience.  No one can run at a deficit forever -- falling apart emotionally is just expected, if you're not sleeping enough for too long.

You should get support from your parents or whoever you can.  Maybe a school counselor could set up naps during the day?  Stay at a relative or friend's place for a few weeks?  If your current environment is hurting not helping -- would things get better if you have your own place soon (18)?

All I can tell you is:  *it gets better*.  Over time -- decades -- you can slowly put together a life you love and take joy in.  All the things you want, you can find, in time.  It just takes planning, and patience.  And perseverance.

And sleep.

I hope things get better for you soon.  Just know that you're neither disgusting nor unlovable.  Your emotions are just wrecked.  Anybody's would be, under stress for too long with no rest.

"My friend, this feeling not only will pass, but I promise time helps change your perception of this feeling. Being in a relationship shouldn’t just come to everyone right in high school, they take time to find and fall into. It’s not like we wanna date just anyone, it’s because we want to find the right people to love us. Also, firsts are actually not as significant as they feel. Sure it’s a nice story but usually I’ve found second tries and the tries after have just as much meaning. A first kiss is always a first kiss with a new person if you think about it. 

Doing so much for others makes you a good person. Often times being a good person is something we gotta do no matter what. It’s really the best that way, remember to feel fulfilled by that. I actually wish I was more abnormal in high school, I think about that. And I’ve felt how you’ve felt. I am just so happy I made it though. It’s okay to be uncomfortable for a bit, life is SO much bigger than high school, than college and even relationships sometimes! Lastly, deep breathing will help. Slow down, maybe write some poetry, and think about how big and vast the world is outside of what your current environment looks like.

"I'm 34/m and my sister is 38. We've always been very close. As we've gotten older political differences would cause frequent arguments. However, I never thought it would be enough to end a relationship. We have no other siblings and our parents are older with health issues. I have extensive ptsd and ocd issues (military vet) and I guess I'm what you would consider a ""high performance"" OCD individual who has material and professional success but I have struggled with personal relationships despite my desire to want meaningful relationships. Trauma exists from childhood (fear of abandonment) and some military experiences. I've sought help, work out, meditate etc. But losing someone you love and care about unexpectedly is extremely hurtful and I don't know how to process, cope, or move forward. Although we grew up in the same household we had vastly different experiences, and I won't necessarily go into too much detail there but hers was more what I would describe as positive with adult presence whereas mine was more alone and dark with self sufficiency and survival. I've always struggled with the issues from parents who simply dropped the ball in so many ways and it's effects, and my sister and I always had a bond of support and ateong friendship relationship with each other making life better. Now, despite all this we've also been very different views and political leanings etc. I'm more conservative and libertarian minded (although she thinks im altright because whatever isn't woke liberal to her is that which I'm not I'm pro freedom and constitutional rights). Anyways her political leanings grew more strong and elitist in my opinion as she got older particularly with topics like covid19 or presidential candidates. We would always get into debates but perhaps we got into one too many. She did mention in 2022 she was going through hardships at work (last time.we spoke was early November 22). Well the last time we spoke she dmed me about a political post story I had poking fun of things and it escalated. 

The Argument transcended into a debate about transgender children. I told her my stance that allowing minors to get gender reassignment surgery, take injections and hormone pills, was the equivalent of child abuse and predatory grooming in my eyes. She failed to.see any of my points and labeled me homophobic (which I'm not and doesn't make sense to me) and I in the heat of the argument was heated and too harsh and probably even a little cruel when I took it too far saying if that's how you feel and you can't understand my points then maybe I should not allow you around my son or feels comfortable with you around him. He's two. She was a positive figure in.his life, my life, and my wife's. Asshole move but due to being a parent and the issue of childhood abuse and this topic I have a very strong opinion it's black and white to me when talking about minors.

Now, circling back, we've gotten into more intense arguments before (this was all text btw) so I assumed we would be able to reconnect and get through these differences make amends. That was not the case. Apparently, according to our parents (who she voluntarily brought into this) she was so deeply hurt by that argument she has sought therapy and decided to take a break from me until she was ready. Meanwhile , in my opinion from my pov,manipulated my elderly parents that I already had a struggling relationship with to paint the picture of me being a villain asshole bad guy and said ""he called me a pedophile"". Which I didn't. Since that argument originally happened I had reached out to.her multiple times via text, phonecall and she has given me zero response. Nothing. Tried apologizing, making things right, gave heartfelt messages, to no avail. It's killing me. She ignored me on Christmas while at my family's home that I could not afford to come visit because I'm out of state with a toddler. And while having a ""magical Christmas"" with my family all over social media ghosts me and shit talks me to my family. 

To take it a step further she tried calling and texting my wife saying she wanted to FaceTime with her and my son. I recently found out about this and it was extremely painful to hear. My wife kept it from me me because she knows how much this is messing with me and didn't want me to hurt more. It feels like I'm a burden and someone I loved died. Thankfully my wife told her no and said it's not appropriate until you make things right with your brother because she's my wife...which is insane to me that she felt like that was okay. In my opinion, this entire reaction is extreme response and not justified. I feel like there's something more at play here that I don't fully comprehend, but either way it feels like I have a bleeding hole in my heart. With already abandonment issues from my own family that for years ignored me or didn't check in or even care about their grandson seemingly only seeing him.once after I flew to.them...where they proceeded to.spend 0 time when together. Now, my sister did the one thing that would hurt me the most which is ghost me and abandon me as well. I always thought having my son would maybe bring family closer together but it feels like we are all farther apart more than ever.

I have a bad habit I'm working on improving where I create expectations that I think are reasonable and should happen and get massively and repeatedly let down.on. with my sister, though, I'm still shocked and not able to understand. It's hard if she won't even give me the time of day to.talk to.explain why I'm being cut off. It feels like I lost support.system,  a family member, a friend. I am not trying to belittle her feelings because I recognize that I may have bee. Too harsh and perhaps I can be too intense to deal with at at times. But therapy and cutting me off? Makes no sense. She doesn't even have kids nor is she transgender so I don't know why me as a parent having my concerns is so fucking offensive to her. Another weird fact: her husband has always been.....I speculate secretly gay or bisexual for a long list of reasons. 

Now, I honestly don't care and I've always loved him and we were close as well. I don't give a shit if they're secretly gay or something not my business, but I vlcsnt help but think maybe that has something to do with this. They are hardcore supportive of LGBT community like husband wears rainbow stuff flags etc. All the time..so I can only guess that maybe because Trans people are in that community he told my sister  to cut me off. Which is still confusing because we were discussing children not adults. All speculation. Like I said I don't care, I just want my sister back in my life and brother in law. I love them.

This has all so deeply hurt me I have spun out of control to.some.extent..the only things that help me cope so far (temporarily) are working out, time with son, cold baths, organizing things, and working on my business and investments. I have ptsd, ocd, and intermittent depression and anxiety. I actively work.on myself but I just feel so alone and hurt. My son now has no connection with my side of the family and my inner child feels wounded and crying with no way out at times. I don't know what I seek by writing this except that maybe it can hopefully somehow help me.some way."	libertyandfaith	post	29.177078215818423	female	White	0.9868704676628113	na	na	na	4	mmfb	ethnicity: no prediction, age: 34, gender: male, explanation: the author explicitly states that he is 34 years old male. however, the text does not provide sufficient hints regarding his race or ethnicity. the author also reveals his personal story and experiences without specific cultural or ethnic context.
"I’m really sorry to hear you’re going through all that. Family is tough. Sometimes there’re lines drawn that were not even aware of until it’s too late. 

Do you have a therapist you can talk to? I worry about you spiraling/ruminating, which is so natural in a situation in which there’s a lot of missing info. We tend to fill in the blanks, without really knowing. 

Some things to consider:
Did you really have concerns re your child and sister? It sounds like you used your child to make a point (from your description, you and sis differ on what type of medical treatments are necessary for minors, or more specifically older kids/teens. It doesn’t sound like your sister was planning to secretly treat your 2yr old for anything so I’m having a hard time seeing a pertinent point in removing her access). 

We all say/do things we don’t mean. Take some time and explore why you had that response. Do you really believe your sister is capable of abusing your son (while I don’t agree, using your argument that medically recommended treatment is akin to child abuse)? 

I dont think you do, and I don’t think you’re a bad person for saying something you don’t mean. If you can distance yourself a bit from the varied and complex feelings you’re experiencing re your whole fam and history, figure out your real feelings on THIS situation. Not the feelings shrouded in childhood adverse experiences, or the shame/guilt/whatever from imagining how your family now thinks of you (which to be clear, you have no proof of and is simply rumination)…separate all of that from this situation with sis/son . My guess is you wanted to make your sis feel a certain way and your kid, and his health/safety, was close enough to insert into this argument to really drive your point home and essentially end the discussion (because your sisters relationship with your son is maybe adjacent but had nothing to do with what you were discussing and it effectively derails and shuts down the conversation). 

Give your sis some time. Then apologize for bringing your son into the argument. Maybe it’s an email or text. Don’t make excuses for yourself, don’t loop in adjacent issues. Apologize. Tell her you miss her and if you’re feeling it, that you’ve realized to maintain a relationship, perhaps there are boundaries you both can communicate to each other and respect. 

For what it’s worth, I learned I can’t talk to my brother about some things. His response is so dehumanizing and painful (like physically painful given our childhood) to hear that I just don’t. I wasn’t gonna change his mind and he wasn’t gonna change mine so my focus is maintaining a positive relationship to maintain access between families. I didn’t communicate any of this to him. I just realized these boundaries were needed and no longer get sucked into wild arguments."	libertyandfaith	reply	na	na	na	0.9868704676628113	strong	no	strong	na	mmfb	no prediction.
"I hear you saying you have a close relationship with your sister, acknowledging that she's very important to you and your son. It sounds like you're very afraid of being abandoned. This makes a lot of sense, and it's normal to feel that way. I think a lot of us can sympathize.

I think you should have a careful think about why, in anger, you lashed out at her and accused her of being a threat to your child over a political argument. I hear you saying these issues are black and white to you, but you clearly don't think your sister would actually hurt your son. And it sounds like you understand it was a hurtful move on your part. You can apologize for it and eventually repair your relationship with your sister, but I think you don't want to go through this experience again, so why did you do it? What part of winning a political disagreement is worth hurting the people we love over?

There is a movement in some political quarters to make moral claims about political beliefs far stronger than people actually believe them, because taking an absolute stance feels righteous and powerful. Do you think you got sucked into that when you accused your sister of being a threat to your child even though you knew she wasn't? Maybe it's worth having think about why that white-hot feeling of righteous anger felt better than maintaining a loving and respectful relationship with your sister.

I hear you speculating on a lot of people's secret motivation here - you said that your sister thinks anything that isn't woke is alt-right and that she has elitist views, you wonder if her husband might be part of the LGBTQ+ community because he supports pride. How often do you ask these people their own reasoning? Not in an argument, debate style way, but in the sincere listening sort of way that real people use for the people in their lives that they care about? You told a moving story without going into details about how your own life experiences led you to where you are now. Why couldn't it be the same for them? They don't need a secret belief or a secret identity, just the lifetime of experiences of their own that inform the way they think. 

I have been in the place of your sister before, needing to take a break from family members who said hurtful things. And the good news is that while the inertia of silence continues on its own if no one makes an effort to fix it, things will gradually reach a point where this can be mended if either of you are willing to put in any effort. So don't give in to despair - your family feels the same connection to you that you do to them. Imagine how much you must have hurt your sister that she felt this temporary disconnect was the best solution. So while you can eventually repair this relationship without an apology, an apology would be good. But even better would be for you to examine the part of yourself that wants all these black-and-white, right-or-wrong debates with people you care about. 

A good exercise might be to go into a trans space and really try to listen to the people there without judging, without replying or commenting, without trying to imagine a secret motivation or to work them into a political narrative. Just imagine a whole and complete person as complex as you are on the other side of the internet and listen to them. Listen to what they have been through and how they feel. 

I'm not saying you have to change your politics. But you do have to stop hurting the people you care about for the sake of your politics. Learning to sincerely listen is good practice for that.

Good luck."	libertyandfaith	reply	na	na	na	0.9868704676628113	weak	no	no	na	mmfb	no prediction.
So, one of the issues brought up in our argument, was that my belief that this issue involving minors was apolitical. Meaning that this wasn't a political conversation to me at that point it was a morality conversation as a concerned parent talking to a childless person about children. I don't care what anyone's political beliefs are and am open to being persuaded with facts, numbers, and logic in that realm. But a core problem in our argument was I saw enabling children, legal minors, to conduct surgery mutilating body parts and injecting hormones into akin to child abuse. Regardless of me being an asshole in the way I communicated which I acknowledge and feel the full repercussions of being isolated and cut out from said poor judgment in communication I still fundamentally hold these beliefs, surrounding morality and protecting children. Particularly as a father and Particularly as someone who has experienced abuse. But I agree with what I believe your overall message is, which is to be kind and listen. However, this wasn't me speaking political views on a family member. I was engaged by my sister about a political topic and it turned into a heated debate about transgender children, which on my eyes, is not a political topic. And I'm suffering and this post wasn't intended to spark a political debate about that topic, but seek some type of helpful advice that would male sense and make me feel better.	libertyandfaith	follow-up	na	na	na	0.9868704676628113	no	strong	no	na	mmfb	no prediction.
it’s totally political bc it’s just a far right talking point to pass laws that make it harder for trans people to get hormones and surgery. no child is medically transitioning, if a child comes out as trans and start the transition process it is purely a social change (hair cut, different clothes, name change and the kid could go back at any time they wanted. once puberty starts they can be prescribed hormone blockers w parental permission but again the effects from hormone blockers are completely reverseable and the child could go back anytime they wanted. i promise no one is interested in “mutilating” CHILDRENS bodies and pumping them full of hormones.	libertyandfaith	reply	na	na	na	0.9868704676628113	no	no	no	na	mmfb	no prediction.

"I just know people are at their wits end with me. I'm stupid, I constantly make mistakes, and I often act without thinking. Sometimes it's like my brain stops thinking or working.
This might sound quite dark but sometimes I think everyone would be better off without me around. I sometimes have crying breakdowns over this in my bedroom.
I've been trying to have a 'growth mindset' to learn from my mistakes and not beat myself up, but I've been slipping up lately and feeling stressed. It's probably to do with starting a new school term and I'll gain more confidence in a little bit. But I cried long and hard last night, thinking 'people are so annoyed by me and they would be better if I wasn't in their life'. Sometimes my brain suddenly and dramatically 'switches' into thinking this way.

"Hey Hey. So sorry to hear how you're feeling. I know this is a MMFB cliche, but if your brain is ""switching"" so rapidly, and you feel like you can't get a handle on it - that might be a sign that you could benefit by talking to a professional therapist. Same with the breakdowns.

I've felt like this sometimes. Like everyone is looking at me and that I'm a pain to everyone. So I just wanted to share a quote that really helped me. It's by Eleanor Roosevelt I think, and it's this - 

""You wouldn't worry half so much what people think about you if you realized how seldom they do.""

I like this quote because, to me, it's both really realistic and very uplifting at the same time. We all put ourselves at the center of our own universes, right? I mean, we all think that what we do is so important, and for good or bad makes a real impact on others. And when we think that way, we tend to just assume that everyone is thinking about us as much as we're thinking about us. And when we get down on ourselves, we think that everyone is down on us too - and interpreting things the same way we are.

But you know what? All the people we're afraid we've offended / inconvenienced / upset / burdened - they aren't even thinking about us. They probably didn't even notice that thing we did, that we can't stop obsessing over. And if they did notice, they probably thought about it for ten seconds and then forgot. Not because we are perfect or wonderful, but because they're not thinking about us at all. What are they thinking about? They're thinking about themselves.

"It happened yesterday. I was in an unfamiliar area and looked down at my phone to check the gps. When i looked up, the car in front of me had stopped. I breaked but I wasn't able to stop in time and hit them. Apparently, we were approaching a round about, and they had to yield.

I apologized for everything, but the lady kept screaming at me for not looking where I was going, explaining what a round about was, yelling Fuck.

People kept stopping around us and staring at me. I wanted to disappear. I have social anxiety, and it was humiliating. I dont do well with people yelling at me, and when the lady didn't stop, I just started sobbing.

The officer said the damage was minor, that nobody was hurt, and that these things happen sometimes.

My parents are insisting on paying the deductible and won't take no for an answer. I need my wisdom teeth out and was going to delay the surgery and use the money for it to cover the citation and deductible, but my parents are insisting on paying to repair the car and paying for my surgery.

"I guarantee you the people ""stopping around you and staring"" were NOT staring at you, they were staring at the crazy lady who was making a scene over such a minor thing. But I understand your social anxiety forces your brain to interpret things differently. It sucks to see the world through socially anxious eyes. You are being waaaay too hard on yourself as a result. No one is perfect and it's a blessing to have supportive friends and family. If one of your friends got in a fender bender and they were saying these same things about themselves, would you agree with them and tell them they should indeed hate themselves? Or would you be supportive? I assume you'd be kind and supportive. You are allowed and encouraged to treat yourself with that same kindness.

Try to see if you have a spiritual side you could nurture to get you through this. It sounds like all the parts of you (physical, intellectual, spiritual) haven't all caught up with you yet. You've identified some of the things in your life that keep you whole. Why not expand on that and find other things that can make you feel good on the inside (*healthy* things). If religion is not your bag (although, there are some good, inclusive ones out there), then why not other things that fulfill the inner parts of people, like art or music or nature or exercise/sport? I see this on Reddit a lot, and not just in trans folk. People forget to nurture the *you* inside of *you* - the part separate from your body. You have to make peace with yourself.

Have you tried prosthetics? Do you plan to? I found getting a packer helped a lot, but came with worse dysphoria during intimacy and my period, when it was typically removed. It helped me to learn about ""stone"" identities in queer circles and ""spirit-bonding"" with sexually sacred items.

Many, but not all trans people hate their post puberty body and all the changes it brings. Physical and societal. I was the first girl after 6 male cousins and 3 after. I got curves, and therefore perverts following me around at 11 years old and used to pass out from the period pain. 
I hated being a woman and saw being a man as much easier. Something I'd been trained for and was good at.

(They use they/them pronouns and identify as a mostly nonbinary man, but I still appreciate having another trans role model even if they aren't the exact same gender as me, a binary trans man).

The other role model is another older transmasc person I met on Discord who is on T, we haven't talked much but they did comfort me one time after I used the venting channel to talk about my dysphoria. It made me happy to see that older trans guys were kind enough to reach out to me after seeing that I was going through a similar experience. I really got the impression that both of these people wanted to make another trans kid feel better about himself, and they did, even if I was just a random kid, because they had a good idea of what I was going through.

" 

I (23F) am lost and I don’t know what to do anymore. It all started in high school, long story short I stopped studying and barely passed my classes, in a miracle I got into a good university with a good 5 year program (thanks to the system of the country I live in). The first semester it was going okay til it wasn’t, I was failing everything, fast forward to the second and I was failing everything again, I just wasn’t studying, going to lectures wasn’t helping, all i did was my lab work and assignment but failed every exam. Sure I’m not really interested in what I'm studying but that’s absolutely not as important as me failing my classes. In the fourth semester I got into academic probation, I still couldn’t study enough to get through it so I got into a second probation, basically a whole year of being out of school. By some miracle I passed the class I needed to get in school again and went on to the fifth semester, I passed nothing in that one except the assignments. Got into probation a 3rd time (this semester) and just now found out I will be in probation this next semester too. So basically as a 5 year program, all my friends are graduating this year while I'm two years behind and will be graduating in the next 3 years. And I haven’t passed any exam in the last two years so I have 10 unfinished courses. I don’t know what’s wrong with me, if I'm lazy, if I don’t care. I thought it could be adhd and I went to a psychologist but they told me they couldn’t test me since they prioritise minors and my issue didn't seem to be urgent since I've gotten into university and the wait list is at least 6 years and if I wanted to get tested NOW I'd have to go the private route and pay around 3k dollars which i can't do right now. 

My parents ( I live with them cause we’re asian etc) are both doctors so imagine the expectations they both have on me. I haven’t told them everything though. They know about my first probation but not the second, they know about the third current one but not this upcoming one this next semester. And they don’t know about the failed 10 courses either. I wanted to hide it from them because I believed I could pass everything quietly and they’d never have to know but I dug a hole so deep for myself. I'll have to tell them about the next semester though because I can’t hide it in any way and I don’t know how I'm going to do it. They’re already disappointed that I'm behind and they’ll be so mad now. My mom doesn’t work because of mental health issues but my dad is in his late 60s and works. I live with them and he is basically providing for all of us, they all keep reminding me to graduate quick so I can easily stand on my feet, and maybe that we can move to a country where it's easier for them to work and make better than here because they're here with me just for my education. I feel so bad for my dad who goes to work everyday for us while I’ve been doing nothing just sitting on my ass for the past two years. He is getting old and I want to make things easier for them but I just can’t seem to study for the life of me. I wish I could tell them everything and then ask for help but I know I can’t because they’ll never forgive me, they’re nice to me after being mad about the probations and they still get me gifts and buy me stuff while I have this huge secret that I'm failing everything. If they find out they won’t trust me again.

I really don’t know what to do I wanna pass my classes and start new so bad but I keep telling myself that things will be different this time while nothing is ever changing. Maybe you’re gonna tell me I'm burnt out but no way, I’ve had 2 years of doing nothing but sitting at home sleeping, I don’t remember the last time I’ve studied consistently, maybe 10 years ago. I don’t know what I'm even expecting from here just a listening ear I guess.

"I (30 f) have always wanted to work in the illustration industry. I’ve been working on it for my entire life, balancing studying with caring for an elderly relative and work. 

Last year I finally started to make some progress and got some freelance work. I’ve been told I’m very talented but I’ve had to put my dreams on the back burner for a long time due to other responsibilities. 

However recent developments in AI have rendered me obsolete and the writing is on the wall - I don’t think my industry will exist in a year or two. 

It’s the only thing I’m good at and the only thing I’ve ever wanted to do. I’ve planned my whole life around making art for a living and I’m legitimately worthless without it. I like my job and the people I work with but I never wanted to do it forever. It was my safety net, no matter how worthless I felt I took pride in what I could make and that my art made people happy - but a machine can do a thousand of what I can do faster and for free. 

I live and breathe drawing but it feels pathetic to do so now. 
I have the means to commit suicide, and the thought of not being depressed anymore makes me excited. I’m not afraid at all. My problem is I don’t want to break my partners heart. 

He’s a good man, I love him very much and he’s already experienced so much loss. I don’t want to add to that. I’m scared that if I die he’ll die too, or it’ll ruin his life. I want to stay alive for his sake, but I’m so anxious and sad all the time that is physically hurts. 

I feel like I’m seeing the world descend into fascism, the climate dying, AI taking over creative jobs and just no way out of it. I have no hope for the future and I don’t want to be here to see things get even worse. I can’t take it. 

How can I face staying alive like this?

I don’t want to hurt my friends and family in a way they’ll never recover from.

"AI Hasn't rendered us Obsolete, Op. AI sucks so far and it will suck for a while. AI cannot be copyrighted - so no company would use something that it cannot license. And many people would still hire artists for freelance than use AI. Currently, I would argue we need artists more than ever.   
I've had the same existential crisis, but even seriously attempting to work with the fucker is just an exercise in frustration, so I imagine it has a long-ass way to go before it becomes truly useful. And the portraits it makes don't look like the people (me) I fed it.  It only works for generating more ideas and violating copyright.   
The majority of people who would go the AI way wouldn't hire you anyway, and those who sell AI as their own work are scammers that will end up shooting their career in the face.

(To the commenter below me, for some reason I can’t reply directly to you so I’m editing this in hopes you see it.)

You are right. Perhaps my response was too harsh. But if this were my sister, or mum or wife that is hoping their death won’t destroy me then I would hope someone would tell them how wrong this commenter’s words were and that their loss would devastate them.

They essentially said (I don’t remember the exact phrasing):They might be sad for a bit but everyone will eventually move on if you do decide to do it. After a few years they will get over it so don’t feel bad. 

I’m not trying to make OP feel worse. But suicide devastates loved ones. It can create a generational trauma for the bereaved. It changes people. I know there is hope for OP.

"Hi! I just wanna throw this out there; there ‘s a saying that goes “if you want diff results, you have to try diff things”.

Basically what this means is that if what you have tried so far has not worked, and you have tried a lot of times, maybe sometimes its worth considering doing something else you havent tried yet.

Sometimes this means getting out of our comfort zone. As someone who was shy and had bad luck finding love in the past, trying diff things can help you grow as a person, meet new people and overall have a better perspective in life.

"Am I a crazy conspiracy theorist?

I was adopted, not through an official agency, and in a small community. By the time my biological siblings and I figured it out it seemed the entire town knew except us kids, (I was given up for adoption before they had two and my parents tried to tell me on multiple occasions growing up who my biological fam was but I wasn’t ready.) obviously we know now lol
Anyways…there was a cop that pulled me over EVERY DAY while I was on my way to college because of a commercial vehicle sticker on my car, after me showing him I had the appointment to have it removed for over a month my father called to find out how to handle the tickets and we found out in Oklahoma you cannot be ticketed for that and all were wiped clean and he had to apologize and made an agreement to not ticket me for so many years…
When he could he got me for an invalid license (2 days expired) and window tint.

"It's impossible to be sure. But I think when we have to deal with stuff that's uncertain like this, the simplest explanation is usually the right one. 

If you live in a small community, chances are the police department isn't that big. So if you or your family have any run-ins with the law, it probably will be with one or two cops - just because those are all the cops there are.

Another thing about a small community is that there's probably not that much crime. So small town cops tend to bust you for stuff you think is silly / overdone / or on the margins - just because they have the time to do so.

Each of the things the cop busted you for are like are things that cops usually pull people over for: tinted windows and vehicle sticker. So there doesn't seem to be anything suspicious about that. And as for your biological sibling having run-ins with the same cop? Well, I mean like you say, it's a small community. If your siblings are doing stuff that will get them in trouble, than it's likely they'll be dealing with just one or two cops. So that's the simplest explanation.

And then if you imagine that even if this cop does know you and your biological siblings are from the same family - and it's possible, small town cops know lots of things - why would he particularly care?"	Putrid_Performer_706	reply	na	na	na	0.042390912771224976	weak	no	no	na	mmfb	no prediction.

"I have a good life. I have a job I'm passionate about. Living life on my terms. Got myself out of an abusive relationship with a Narc. Know what I want/deserve in life. YET, all of this makes it incredibly hard to live a happy life, atleast in the short term.

Lost my father. Have no siblings. Low contact with my mother because she's also covertly narcissistic and talking to her just makes life difficult. Have friends who'd back me up in emergencies but, everyone is on a different continent.

I have no one. Literally not a Single Human, to share my daily wins and bad moments with. 
After my toxic relationship I swear I'd never lose my individuality, but I do so much miss having someone to share memes with? Dog pictures with?

"This sucks. I know how it feels to be lonely and it really is awful. There's no shortcut to get through it, unfortunately. At least not that I've found. But I have found, just personally, that it always is a temporary situation. In due time, when you're ready to do the dating thing again, you'll find someone else who's not a narcissist. You'll get into a relationship and it'll be great. Then you'll probably wish you had more free, unstructured time to yourself. 

It also sucks that you find yourself without close friends at this moment. This is temporary too, I think. But it is painful while it lasts. And all the more so because it's so much harder to fix when you're an adult. Lonely kids just have to go to the playground, or to school. Lonely adults, it's much harder. But it sounds like you've got a lot of people who you could and would like to get to know better - your colleagues, among others - and given how most adults are low-key lonely-ish, I bet they'd like to get to build social connections with you too.

"I, 23M, have been trying my best to recover since being in an abusive relationship with a woman. She knew I had autism and used that to take advantage of me. I broke up with her a couple of years ago but since then I've been carrying bad habits. Like being overly clingy so people don't leave me. And saying sorry all the time, even for small basic stuff. 

I'm also 5'4 and maybe a 6/10 on a good day. As you can imagine, it's incredibly difficult for me to get a date in the first place. Most women won't look my way, and if they do it's with a scorned look. And to top it all off I get maybe 1 to 3 tinder matches a month. 

On the rare occasions that I have gone on dates they've all been absolutely heartbreaking. I wouldn't mind it if my date said something along the lines of ""I don't think this is going to work out"" or ""I'm not having any fun do you mind if we call it quits here?"". I would much prefer that level of openness and communication from another human being. Instead I get done with the date only to find they've blocked me. Or, even worse, they ""just so happened"" to bump into their friend during the date and leave with them early. This has happened to me three times and it wasn't until the third time that I realized what was going on. 

Every single time afterwards I get incredibly paranoid because I wonder if I've done something wrong. Which leads to me being clingy which of course is the final nail in the coffin. I know that kindness is a rare trait so I tend to give it out in abundance. Especially to the women I date because I understand that dating can be hard and scary. But every time I've extended that kindness, I've been hurt. It keeps ripping up old wounds and pouring salt in them. It's becoming harder and harder for me to trust women in general, when none of them have been very kind or understanding to me.

"Hello friend, sounds to me like your doing your best to be the best you can be and that’s a great thing. 

It’s hard to make meaningful connections these days unfortunately. However that doesn’t mean it’s not possible. Maybe it’s good to take things slowly. 

Though I would ask if you are finding the time to go out and meet someone organically? I hear online dating for men can be pretty brutal as women get bombarded with matches and men generally have much less luck. 

Are there singles events in your area? 
Are there any hobbies you have that could bring about an encounter with single women? 

Go out and enjoy yourself sometimes and be open to getting approached or being the one to approach her. Don’t feel dejected with so many people out there you’ll definitely find a partner who loves you for you and nothing more.

Love yourself and feel confident. Compliment yourself more and congratulate yourself on successes.

sit with them.

 let them live through their whole live inside of you. notice where they are in your body.

notice how they manifest in your body.

ask yourself what you feel, then how you feel them and only then why.

Not to mention, if i journal i then feel the need to tell someone what i wrote, i feel as though if i don’t tell someone, whatever i try to get out of my mind is stuck there until i say it to someone else, writing to no one in particular doesn’t work. 

I googled this many times before, seeing if anyone else has a problem with uncontrollable talking, all of the answers say that people who talk a lot enjoy hearing themselves talk and thats why. I can assure you, thats not the case for me, my own voice annoys me like nothing else, my voice is shrill and the sound equivalent of broken glass. I hate hearing my voice. 

I don’t just talk just to talk either, i talk about things that are important to me, things that make me anxious and things on my mind, i don’t do small talk.  Honestly, small talk annoys the hell out of me, its pointless and awkward, so I’m not just doing small talk either. 

I often sit alone away from my family and my partner, in the living room or something, to isolate myself from them because I more than likely have annoyed them. I like to put myself away so they don’t have to listen to me drone on and on. 

Am i just an annoying person ? Is this even the right sub for this ??? Why do i talk so much."	x__Cherrybomb__x	post	14.51106143414834	male	White	0.998616099357605	na	na	na	6	mmfb	no prediction.
"ok so when you see someone

be like, ""how is it going"".  Just keep it quick like that.

and then let them answer

and whatever they answered, you say something *about that*

So if they are like, ""it's going good I got a new cat""

you are like, ""what color is the cat""

see, keep it to short replies so that conversation can be a ""back and forth"" thing

Also don't just talk about your stuff.  Only talk about stuff you guys both have in common.  So like, if you both like to take a walk, you can talk about that.  But if you like to play chess and they don't play chess, don't talk a bunch about chess.

 So what I’ve learned to do is not to try to stop talking but to try to talk to the right people and in the right situations. It really helps to get everything out in a healthy and safe way because part of the situation is that you do have important or meaningful things to get out. It’s also probably important that you verbally get things out because it might be one of the ways that you work things out in your head. So I start getting out that energy in different ways.  I speak into my journal app, I do dbt, express myself in forums, deep breathing and exercise. I get myself out to more social situations where I can talk to people who are also specifically there to interact.  I have learned most maladaptive habitats were once useful coping mechanisms that we have outgrown. Now if I find myself doing this I take it as a sign that I need to interact more with my community and do more self care.	x__Cherrybomb__x	reply	na	na	na	0.998616099357605	no	strong	no	na	mmfb	no prediction.

I’m really sad about this. I had a really rough day at school on Halloween after I cut my arm on the classroom window’s metal frame, to the point where the only thing that cheered me up was reminding myself that they would heal soon. Fast forward to today, it’s been over 2 months and they’re still plainly visible. I want to cry whenever I look at them and think about that day, and all of the hope that was proven to be for not.

Hi all, Im really bad with introductions but I will say Im a 25 year old male, studying for a masters in psychology, majoring in applied behavior analysis. I have very few friends, and the friends that I do have likely get tired of me very quickly because I lack a sense of humor, and when I try to be funny or fun, I sound forced and end up sounding very cynical, because I have a major swearing problem, and end up sounding like I am blaming people or acting offensive without really wanting to. I lack a good vocabulary, and I struggle to initiate conversations, because I am afraid I will say something stupid or offensive without wanting to. Because of this, my relationships have suffered, as well as my mental health. I feel like I am a piece of crap for even saying hello because I always overanalyze what Im saying, and labelling myself as an ignorant idiot. I never feel like I can contribute to a conversation because I never know what my friends are talking about, and when I try to do research on the topic, I get lazy and my adhd pulls me towards something else more stimulating but less informative, like a reaction video or something. I am so so so tired and depressed that I resorted to looking for self-help subreddits because I cant afford my own therapy and Im scared to ask my parents to fund my therapy. Any Ideas/thoughts/helpful tips? Anything is appreciated and im sorry if I was too wordy or blunt.	None0fYourConcern	post	20.204903638868096	female	White	0.9991081357002258	na	na	na	3	mmfb	failed
"i understand being scared to ask parents to fund your therapy, but as someone who also has mental health struggles and is in the psych field- we need to be in a decent place ourselves in order to be able to effectively help others. if there is no other way to access proper therapy (ie insurance), i seriously recommend trying to overcome your fear and ask for help. you may even be able to access more affordable therapy through your university. 

i am very much in your boat and spent way too long trying to get by on using online as support rather than getting the help i needed. can online help? absolutely! i still use it now even. but the hard truth is, it will not get the same things done that actual counseling can. and, with all you’ve described, that really does sound like the kind of thing professional help could go a long way in helping you work through

"TL;DR: DO NOT RESPOND TO THIS USER.

This is most likely a troll. Alternatively, he is mentally ill to a degree that a chat friend on the internet cannot help him. It is less likely, but possible, that he is trying to draw in someone unusually patient and empathetic to manipulate for some ill purpose. (See examples here https://imgur.com/a/8PFyt1x)

He makes new accounts to evade subreddit bans, and some of his accounts have been suspended by reddit admins. It's in your best interest to ignore his posts, report, and move on without engaging. If you choose to respond, there is a substantial chance you'll receive no reply at all. If you get a reply, the most likely outcome is that his effort to have a conversation will be minimal at best. He relies on a small handful of phrases (e.g. -- ""im scared"" or ""ive never had a friend before"" or ""im all alone"") or a crying emoji (i.e. -- ;.;) until the other person gets frustrated and stops replying. If by some chance the other person is very patient and continues talking to him, he usually stops responding himself.

On some rare occasions, he attempts to have some sort of long-term association with someone -- usually users who identify as female. If the ""new friend"" does not respond quickly enough for his liking, he lashes out and accuses her of ""being evil."" Likewise, if his behavior is acknowledged in a public forum (like this), his go-to response is something like, ""nuh uh you were mean to me,"" which he does even when screenshot evidence to the contrary is presented Here is a typical example of a lengthy exchange with him.

He gives personal information that is mostly untrue. He has been ""18 years old"" since he started using reddit for this purpose, about five years ago. He resists attempts to help him find work and hobbies (other than spamming the same ad for 20 hours a day) by claiming to be homeless and to not have a Social Security number, neither of which are likely to be true. His childish writing style is an act, as he has been observed writing like a rational adult. Furthermore, he has been associated with a defunct YouTube channel (as a failed content creator).

"Hello folks,

My first post here, and it will be a long one. Not sure if a TLDR is even possible. Serious thanks to anyone who reads and offers some advice. None of my family can offer it, and those that can I do not wish to burden - they have their own problems, much more serious than mine.

First, some facts about myself:

&#x200B;

1) 28 year old male.

2) Have a PhD in Chemical Engineering acquired from a reputable (in my case, overseas) uni at age 25.

3) 6'7"" tall (200 cm) - I will explain why this may be of consequence later. Am not conventionally ugly as far as I can tell.

4) Speak three languages - one with a different basic alphabetic structure (Cyrillic) with native fluency. English is my third language.

5) Taught myself programming (Python and R) and am pretty good at using it for solving complex statistical problems and process optimization.

6) Have played fingerstyle acoustic guitar since I was 6 years old, pretty good at that, too. It still challenges me and used to give me peace when I needed it most.

7) I am debt-free and financially well-off (on the surface) - will explain later.

8) Attempting to set up a business in a highly technological field (chemical laboratory supplies) for the past 2 years. I am on my own here, since the technical expertise needed is quite extensive.

Already support 3 qualified personnel before earning a single cent from the business (we are in the initial R&D stage). It is hard work, but used to be rewarding.

&#x200B;

Wait a minute, those all sound great! Here come the negatives:

&#x200B;

1) I have had a lifelong stutter and social anxiety. My stutter has gotten better over the years, but it is still very much there. It leaves a bad first impression on people who don't know my other merits.

I read genuine surprise on people's faces when they do hear the merits.

2) The only family I feel I can trust are my parents. I have two much older (half-)brothers who I do not see very much. I do not even know my (half-)sister.

3) My father is 74 years old, and still works himself to the bone (""for my kids""). He does barely look 60 though, which makes me happy.

4) My mother is 55 and has suffered from Bipolar Disorder since I was an infant - she has endured massive mental trauma in her early 20s and is on a lot of medication. I am her only child - one of the reasons I don't socialize much with my half-siblings, I am ""the secret child"".

5) My mother and father live in different cities and do not talk anymore.

6) I have never had a girlfriend. I have had sex twice during my last year of university and could not enjoy it either time, although I know my sexuality (am not asexual in any way). 

It was not for money.

7) I only recently got my driver's license (not learned how to drive fully yet, mind you, it takes practice) - a combination of educational workload and (MUCH more so) lack of belief in myself got in the way of this earlier in my life.

8) Crucially, I never actually earned money in my life. 

Nearly all my finances (save for money earned during my PhD years) come from my father, who built and runs a large factory with 400 employees.

&#x200B;

Now let me explain my state of mind as best I can.

During my high school and university years (almost 8 years) I was reasonably content - this is the period when my stutter massively improved. 

I liked who I was, had motivation, a goal (finish my education), and a truly great social circle in a culture I enjoyed. Life was okay and I achieved everything I wanted, through hard work.

&#x200B;

Now, I strongly dislike everything about myself and am terrified of the future.

I don't have my own car (yet, tax on cars totals around 240% here such that something that actually costs $30k is closer to $80k... The business needs money more than I need a car right now) and live alone close to my place of business (a laboratory) in the industrial part of the city. 

As a result, I do not socialize at all with anyone my age. Even my personnel are all a good few years older than me, and I do keep it professional anyway.

This affects my self-image tremendously. I feel boring and one-dimensional. All I ever read anymore is technical literature since that's all there is time for, and the lack of conversation makes me a pretty boring word-fu partner.

My stutter compounds these feelings of worthlessness.

The fact that I was financially supported throughout my life leaves me feeling impotent. Though I saved quite a bit and am good at managing the finances, it all feels unearned, like I don't deserve it (and I don't!).

Feeling worthless and insufficient prevents me from pursuing relationships - not just intimate (sex drive is at sub-zero anyway), simply female friends would be a great start - since I constantly think that I am unworthy of attention.

There is an amazing woman I met through a mutual academic acquaintance showing interest in me at present, and I want to explore this for the first time in my life, but she has a false impression of me as a successful man. She doesn't know all the shit you just read above.

&#x200B;

I kept the above feelings at bay by focusing on my work and finding pride and fulfillment in it until now.

An example is having upwards of 50 tabs with academic literature open at any given time and using all of it to extract data for R&D, of writing an entire software suite for chemical data analysis on my own.

In other words, I pushed myself to my absolute limits. Burned out a little, and went on a 3-day holiday for the first time in years recently.

Constantly keeping busy has kept self-defeating thoughts at bay but I have been unable to handle it all, and especially during my ""holiday"" which only made me more sad and tired. The following creep in:

&#x200B;

i) What if the business fails? What will I do to keep active and keep the only thing I have that is of any substance - my scientific knowledge?

ii) What will others think of me if the business fails, despite all the opportunities I have to prevent it from failing?

iii) What will I do when/if financial support from my father ceases? This is one of the most painful questions for me because it highlights my inadequacy as a person and a man.

I have no real work experience besides the business I am trying to build, and part-time job teaching chemistry students in my PhD years.

iv) What if I remain lonely for the rest of my life? At 28, I am not getting any younger (although I have been told I have a baby face and most people think I'm 22. A few gray hairs give me away).

Nobody wants a 28 year old with zero relationship experience, or a partner with mental health issues.

&#x200B;

With these thoughts brewing in my head and all the issues described above, I am losing the one thing that has been keeping me afloat - my work ethic and clarity of mind.

I find myself unable to do the simplest calculations that would normally not trouble me at all, or write the simplest code. My motivation is not gone, but is severely impaired.

I started procrastinating with my work, for the first time in my life. What a horrible feeling.

This forms a positive feedback loop to the feeling of worthlessness.

&#x200B;

Any advice on how to combat this and get back to work? My plan was to just ""pick myself up"" like I've done countless times before, but there was usually SOMEONE there to help me. This time, I think genuine changes to my life are required.

I talk to my friends I made during uni, but they have their own problems and who the hell am I to impose mine on them? Besides, none of them live in the same city. They are all over the world. No in-person conversation.

The business is entering the last stages of initial R&D, a time when the hardest work is required to finish everything off, and I find myself in this sorry state.

&#x200B;

Any advice would be much appreciated. Thank you."	Stammerama	post	28.79007852749308	male	White	0.7224576473236084	na	na	na	4	mmfb	failed
If anyone in the history of *ever* would get a lot out of therapy, it would be *you*, OP. The greatest gift you could give yourself would be to unpack all of this with a good, licensed professional therapist. You need an outside person to listen to this whole story and get to the root causes of your feelings about yourself. And no, this doesn't make you weak; it takes a strong person to admit that they need help. Maybe some of it lies with your mom being bipolar? Who knows? Why on earth feel guilty about inherited wealth? So what, you have money? That's no doing of your own; you were born into a successful family. Don't ever feel guilty about that. Maybe since you're on the cusp of your own earned success, that's where these feelings are coming from.	Stammerama	reply	na	na	na	0.7224576473236084	weak	no	no	na	mmfb	no prediction.
">The fact that I was financially supported throughout my life leaves me feeling impotent. Though I saved quite a bit and am good at managing the finances, it all feels unearned, like I don't deserve it (and I don't!).

How about flipping the script with the belief that everyone deserves to be financially secure? People shouldn't have to earn the right not to be homeless or starve to death. You've been lucky, and not everyone is, but that doesn't mean that you're not deserving of a stable income and enough resources to sustain you.

>During my high school and university years (almost 8 years) I was reasonably content - this is the period when my stutter massively improved.

Chances are that you're overestimating the effect your stutter has on others. I've met a few people with bad stutters and it didn't prevent me from becoming involved with them as friends, colleagues, and romantic partners. Either way, take heart in the fact that it seems to diminish on its own with no special effort when your life circumstances improve. That's promising! It may also be possible to do speech therapy, but I'm not very knowledgeable about this.

>With these thoughts brewing in my head and all the issues described above, I am losing the one thing that has been keeping me afloat - my work ethic and clarity of mind.

It sounds like you're still suffering burnout, which is hampering your progress and making you question your self-worth. (And three days isn't enough to heal that or detox your single-minded addiction to work - it sounds like you have very high expectations for yourself.) Plus, you're using work as a distraction from your [negative thought patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_distortion). As /u/Offthepoint said, therapy could help make some significant lasting changes to this.

I burnt out in my early twenties after a period of high ambition, hard work, and career success, and I'm still struggling to get out of the hole I ended up in years later. Take it from me, it's better to slow down now and keep progressing, even at a snail's pace, than it is to crash and burn dramatically and do some serious harm to yourself and your psyche.

>i) What if the business fails? What will I do to keep active and keep the only thing I have that is of any substance - my scientific knowledge?

It's no wonder that you're worried about this when so much of your time and energy is tied up with your job. Expanding your activities outside of work will make you realize that there's more to life, and to you, than the status of your company.

Sometimes the worst does come to pass, and people lose something important to them that was a pillar of their identity (job, marriage, family, health) and have to start again. You will have the strength to cross that bridge if you come to it. We often don't know what we're capable of until we have no other choice but to go through it.

If you woke up tomorrow without your business and were freed from all obligations, what other areas of life do you think you'd be interested in exploring? Is there a way to dip your toes into the water in those areas?

>As a result, I do not socialize at all with anyone my age. Even my personnel are all a good few years older than me, and I do keep it professional anyway.

If you're a business owner and have personnel, is it possible to hire someone else or increase the wages of your employees in order to delegate more job responsibility to them and free up some time for you? Your city likely has hobby groups, volunteer opportunities, meetups, classes, and other social events you could partake in to strengthen your skills and hobbies, explore new pastimes, contribute to the community, and meet people.

>ii) What will others think of me if the business fails, despite all the opportunities I have to prevent it from failing?

It sounds like you already feel like people don't like you or aren't very interested in you, so from that perspective, what would change? Maybe you're already dealing with what you fear.

In any case, most people have been through various hardships in their lives, both due to circumstance and their own failings. Most of us have experienced setbacks and can sympathize with the setbacks of others.

>iii) What will I do when/if financial support from my father ceases? This is one of the most painful questions for me because it highlights my inadequacy as a person and a man.

You'll find another way to earn money, if you don't already have one by that point.

>I have no real work experience besides the business I am trying to build, and part-time job teaching chemistry students in my PhD years.

Sounds like you have both impressive educational credentials and a lot of real-world experience that would be valued by employers. Go look up listings for jobs in your field and see what they require (though keep in mind that employers sometimes exaggerate necessary qualifications in the hopes of getting the best possible candidate). If you really feel you're lacking a qualification, look into getting it.

>Nobody wants a 28 year old with zero relationship experience, or a partner with mental health issues.

That's bad and surprising news for zillions of other humans, then! Are you sure you're not letting your own negative views speak for everyone else around you? Let other people decide if and why they don't want to be with you, don't decide in advance for them and never give them the chance to actually meet and get to know you.

People might not specifically search for those things, but they're willing to look past a lot when they find someone they're interested in. Everyone has pros and cons, and someone who seems to have it all together might just be better at hiding their struggles, or they're affected in a way that isn't super obvious to the casual observer.

In addition, you will likely meet others with zero relationship experience and mental health issues. Would you immediately write them off as a potential romantic partner, or would you be understanding and not judge them too harshly? Personally, I like meeting other people who have experienced similar issues to me, because we can relate to each other better.

>I talk to my friends I made during uni, but they have their own problems and who the hell am I to impose mine on them? Besides, none of them live in the same city. They are all over the world. No in-person conversation.

I feel like the vast majority of humanity has experienced periods of low self-worth and poor mental health. Try confiding in your friends, and asking them about their own experiences. You're not burdening them, you're opening up the channels of communication to support each other in real ways. They likely have their own issues that they hesitate to share with you for fear of the same.

Ultimately, try to see yourself from an objective perspective. If you met someone like you, who was going through the same issues, would you hate him and think he was pathetic? Or would you be understanding and not think his problems were so bad as to be unfixable? Perhaps you'd even be willing to be a listening ear or an activity buddy.

"**[Cognitive distortion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_distortion)** 
 
 >A cognitive distortion is an exaggerated or irrational thought pattern involved in the onset or perpetuation of psychopathological states, such as depression and anxiety. Cognitive distortions are thoughts that cause individuals to perceive reality inaccurately. According to  Aaron Beck's cognitive model, a negative outlook on reality, sometimes called negative schemas (or schemata), is a factor in symptoms of emotional dysfunction and poorer subjective well-being. Specifically, negative thinking patterns reinforce negative emotions and thoughts.

"i technically still have a dad. but that’s it. and i don’t even know how much i want him in my life anymore 

my dog died 2 months ago. i’m breaking down now even writing that, thinking about that. 

she was the only consistent support in my life growing up. through living in an abusive household to leaving it at 14, only to end up in one that i’m only just now starting to accept was also unhealthy… and i watched her die. i watched her die because my piece of shit stepmom wouldn’t let me take her to the vet. i watched my only family, my best friend, shit all over herself for a day and then rot in the garage another two days after she died 

i just moved out of there to live with my partner a week ago. i feel so out of place, having somewhere my own, somewhere safe to call my own. but i guess visiting to get some of the last of my stuff just now, it hit me leaving that these people aren’t family, not how i thought. i hate my stepmom, and my dad may have saved me from living somewhere worse, but he wasn’t there like he could’ve been. he let so much happen and at the end of the day, enables my stepmom. i will never have a different childhood, i will never have a loving family. 

i finally made it, i’m finally independent and life is perfect, i never would have thought i’d have such a wonderful life when i was living in that abusive household. i should be happy 

my family was my dog, and she loved me, and she was the best dog and only being to have been there through it all. and she is dead. my family is dead.

"You have been accumulating trauma all your life. Forced to carry it, with no way to process it. What I read in your words is that it's too much. It's too heavy, and you want to put it down.

And how can you fully give yourself to a life that's actually good and healthy and safe, when you've never known that and can't trust it?

How can the normal ups and downs of life feel normal instead of like a catastrophe when you've been forced to accept down as the norm for so long?

At least that's what I would assume you feel. I don't mean to speak for you. 

What would I feel? 

Betrayal.

Grief.

Rage.

All of those are normal. But that doesn't have to mean it's the end. 

It may take years. It may take the rest of your life. But you can move through and process each of the things you feel. Give yourself the permission to do so. To admit what you should have had and how the people who should have provided it to you, failed you, and how it makes you feel. Then learn how to give those things to yourself.

Yes, professional help is best, whether it be via a support group if you can't afford therapy, or a good, long-term relationship with a therapist you trust, to pick through it all.

And I don't know about you, but I believe that life force continues on even after the body dies. Even if you don't believe in any of the mainstream religious stuff, energy is neither created nor destroyed. It just changes. So, the energy that animated your dog is still alive, and probably near you. Maybe it would do you some good to have some sort of ritual of mourning and thanksgiving for and to your dog. I think they understood, and understand, that it's not what you wanted for them and how much you love them, but I think it might help you.

I'm sorry if this is all off or seems corny or trite. What you've shared is damn heavy, and  there's no easy way to describe or digest or talk about it.

Hello, so to start off I know this is my mistake but just hoping to get some help here. So I am an international student but never made it to Canada. I have been accepted to University of Calgary and have registered for classes for fall 2022. They require me to send my final transcripts through mail but they told me they didn't receive it and my admission could be revoked. This and also my parent's' financial situation made me decide not to go to Canada. Thinking that I was revoked admission, I didn't withdraw from the classes. It was tough mentally to give up my dream, so I logged out of the email I registered the university with. I never logged into the university portal or anything just to forget things. Now that I tried logging in to the email, I found out that I have an overdue payment and I owe $18000. If I don't sort this out in 2 weeks they will send it off to a collection agency. I plan to go to Canada later in life and am extremely scared that this debt will cause trouble for me. I just found out about this overdue issue today have sent out multiple emails to several departments at the university but they are closed for the weekend now. I don't know what to do during this weekend without feeling overwhelmed and depressed. Any help would be very helpful!	pleasee123	post	30.58227024801031	female	White	0.9988580942153931	na	na	na	7	mmfb	no prediction.

I've found that with anxiety, the instinct to resist the anxiety just feeds it.  When I feel that way I just tell myself that I like the feeling.  I try to savor the sensation like I would a pleasant feeling like if someone was giving me a back rub.  Tell yourself that you want more of that feeling.  Somehow for me that helps anxiety to subside.  Like the other person said, it would be ridiculous of them to charge you for a semester you did not attend.  Of somehow you are unable to convince them to drop the charge, I'd recommend contacting the local news media in Canada.  Local news stations love outrage stories.

It’ll be okay. The school knows how little of a chance you’ll pay this, especially if you’re not in Canada. And as long as they don’t know you’re planning on eventually moving there, it’ll seem like more trouble than it’s worth to try and get you to pay. Just don’t mention that and show the email saying your admission could be revoked to explain why you didn’t do more.	pleasee123	reply	na	na	na	0.9988580942153931	weak	no	no	na	mmfb	no prediction.

"I need help learning how to cope with work anxiety, it’s debilitating right now.

How do you get rid of anxiety at work?

I get so nervous for the day, every morning I wake up it’s just a huge pit of anxiety in my stomach. The reason is for two things. One, I never know who is going to be on the other end of the phone. They could be mean, or nice, or anywhere in between, and that makes me nervous. The bigger reason though is I’m new to the job (3 months in) and I don’t know our products or our systems that well yet. So if someone is calling on a more difficult policy we have (insurance company), there’s a good chance I need to call our support line to be able to help the customer. Maybe even call them twice. These two things give me enormous anxiety. How do I deal with this? I’ve been leaving early when the anxiety gets to be too much but I can’t keep doing that. Please help."

"Hey Hey. Really sorry to hear what you're going through. I feel you, for sure. There have been lots of times in my working life when i've felt that I was in over my head. And it's a real struggle, because at the time it seems that this drowning / flailing feeling you have will last forever. But I promise you it won't. It will pass. You will grow more confident and knowledgeable about this job. You won't always feel this way.

Customer service is hard for sure. On the mean customers, well, that is tough but anyone who's mean to you on the phone - they're probably just mean. And that has nothing to do with you. Or else they're having a really bad day. Either way, their being a jerk doesn't have much to do with you. They're in a bad mood and you just happen to be in the way, which is unpleasant but not a judgement on you.

As for the knowing your systems: It might help for you to look at this situation from the customer's perspective. When I call an insurance company, I just want the information I need as quickly as possible. Whether the rep I'm talking to has worked there for 40 years and knows everything instantly, or whether they have to put me on hold and ask a supervisor, I honestly don't care. When you put people on hold as you figure something out, they're not thinking about you and how you do or don't have it together. They're thinking about their cat, or what to make for dinner, or whatever. If it takes my rep a bit longer to get me the right info I don't care. (I mean, I'd like it to be quick but I'm also realistic. I know if I'm calling customer service I'm gonna be put on hold.) I don't care if the rep has to call the Pope.

How do I let the mean ppl not bother me? I suppose it would be easier if I was more of an ace at work, that way they couldn’t push me around. But I’m so new that they can boss me around and I have no idea how much I can push back. But I suppose that will come with time."

"I can make very few promises about what happens in life, but I can say for sure that eventually you'll come to be more confidant in this job. It's just a matter of time.

Yeah, you may always have anxiety. That may be a constant. But the things you have anxiety about have changed, right? Like in third grade you were crying about things like spilled milk and someone not wanting to play with you at recess, I'm guessing. Now you cry about being bad at your job. Just like you grew out of third grade, you will grow out of this phase. You will grow better at your job and what causes you anxiety now simply won't cause you anxiety in the future. At which point you'll find something else to be anxious about. 

When it comes to not letting people bother you when they're jerks, well that one is hard. But like, maybe ask yourself - so what if they are mean to you? So what if they do boss you around? Whatever problem you're working on with a customer, try to solve it the best you can. That's your job. Your job isn't to have people be nice to you or to like you. Your job isn't to boss your customers and tell them what's what. Your job is to give them the information they need as efficiently as you can, even when they're mean and push you around. As long as you do that, you're doing your job well, and that' the only thing that matters."	Turtlphant	reply	na	na	na	0.9956034421920776	weak	no	no	na	mmfb	no prediction.
"You'll get jaded in time. At first mean people got to me, but eventually I just stopped caring.

Unreasonable assholes come and go, but as long as you're doing your job well they cannot harm you. They'll be gone in minutes as you move onto a new customer who is likely much more reasonable.

Just take your breaks and zone out to release some pressure. Perhaps watch a show or listen to music, just don't allow work thoughts to intrude on your you time.

When you're at home, pretend work does not exist. No overtime, no ""home work"". Keep work and personal time independent of each other. 

That's what helped me to cope. In the end though it's worth working towards another job you enjoy more. But in the short term looking after your mental state is the most important thing. Never feel guilty turning down extra hours, it's not your job to cover for the companies failings or anything. It's just a way to pay the bills."

"So, there is context. Since my childhood, I have battled with anxiety, depression and it has only gotten worse with age. I have had my share of terrible family circumstances, and many personal challenges wherein things just dont go smoothly, but I have only my brain to blame. I have never felt at peace or genuinely happy. I will always be overthinking and succumbing to mental and emotional turmoil.

In school, I had been a topper and performed well in anything I decided to do. But I failed myself and everyone who always thought I will be a big thing. I did not develop my hobbies, kept going from one thing to the other and failed to do anything real in so many interests I had when I was still wide eyed. I wanted to pursue and learn dance and it probably was the one thing I was most excited about, but my parents did not care for that and I guess looking back, I just lacked the spirit and did not try enough. I was always thrown into public speaking where again, because it was so usual, I did not care about it enough and i always felt like an imposter there. Perhaps I always looked for something I had not gotten yet.

In terms of career, I always wanted to do medical but due to my developing depression, I wanted to do something rebellious in my adoloscence and did not take up science subjects. I did commerce which was mind numbingly boring but I still performed well as I have achievement anxiety. I then thought of doing civil services as I had started thinking a purposeful career would suit me best and medical boat had sailed due to educational system restrictions in my country and civil services was ambitious enough as it had a success rate of some 0.001 %. I had to do bachelors before that and I pursued law. My rebellious and not caring phase not gone yet, I did not put in effort in the first semester but feeling empty, I pulled through in every other and turned out to be a top student academically in the 5 years. However, I left the civil services dream as impratical, and corporate law pratical experience drained and bored me. Litigation was filled with nepotism and I felt hustle rather than talent and substance was rewarded early on and on counsel, I then pursued my MBA in HR from the top institute in the country.

I did exceedingly well in my MBA and got the best internship and final placement; top FMCG and top consulting firm in the world. But just after 8 months of consulting, I got paid really really well but I felt more suicidal than ever before as the work did not suit my personality at all and it anyway wasnt HR which I had anyway specialized in. Perhaps it was more ambitious than HR, but I felt like I was terrible at the job and got completely switched off. I resigned and now I am joining another organisation in the HR function taking a great paycut because its a different function and I did not have enough HR experience.

I will be joining next week and relocating to a different city but I feel despirited. I have failed myself. Sometimes I feel like I am just academically good but a terrible professional due to my mental and emotional issues. My peers who did not go through multiple career switches like I did and who were just focussed, not necessarily even worked too hard or studied too hard are in much better places.

I feel like I have failed everyone and most importantly, I have failed myself. I no longer feel wide eyed or excited about anything as I have seen from my past that everytime I felt hopeful, something external has crushed my spirit. I am too old and just a beginner in my career, I have gained massive amount of weight, and I have no developed hobbies. I was not courageous and spirited enough and I feel like im not functional at life.

I have tried medication but its a hit and miss and made me gain a lot of weight, and therapy has been not satisfactory at all, albeit ive only done 3 to 4 sessions each with different ones as I never found the right fit.

It was a long ramble. I am grateful to anyone who read it. Thankyou.

"I'm sorry to hear how you're feeling. I can tell you feel rather lost. What you're going through is really painful and real. 

The first thing i'd say is that you're not a failure at life. As long as you're alive, you haven't failed at life, right? ;)

I've definitely felt lost in my career at points, and really wondered what i should be doing. One thing I learned, that no one really talks about, is that you kind of have to like what you do in order to be successful at it. Like if you got your MBA and were super successful but you were suicidal - well, then you weren't really successful. You looked successful maybe, for a time, but being a live and being mentally healthy is a part of success, and if you don't have that part, then you don't really have ""success."" Don't worry about being less successful than your peers, because they could be totally miserable as well. In which case they're not really successful.

Another thing that helped me when I'd get jealous of my peers is realizing how ""success"" is temporary at best. Sure your friends seem better off. Maybe they are. Right now. But everything changes. They could get laid off. They could get divorced. They could struggle with depression too - and in the process, lose a lot of what they have. No one's path is straight up.

Keep trying. Keep pushing. Set your careers aside for a minute and focus on what it is - job or otherwise - that might give you that sense of wonder and hope that you no longer feel on a day-to-day basis. And keep trying therapy. I've found it's like exercise. You're not going to get fit by doing a workout three times. But do it regularly for a year and you'll start to feel better. 

You got this. You're going to do great. And one day you're going to feel so much better than you do now."	xiazen3195	reply	na	na	na	0.9606167674064636	strong	no	no	na	mmfb	no prediction.
Hello! To further explain the title, I am training in a particular Workout&Crossfit gym where I have become one of the important members since I’ve joined tournaments and so on. I might be selected to be a coach or an assistant coach which really was part of my goal. But, I became depressed from that place. Half the People there are toxic towards me because of some drama (and my recent ex is raining there too) and it really became embedded in my head were if I even saw the name of the place I get sad and run out of energy. Part of me is like get away from everyone there and focus on myself in another gym. But the other part is telling me to man up and deal with it.

"I moved back in my dad a couple months ago who has an addiction issue with crack and I have a hard time sleeping hell be up at night loud partying with people and smoking in the house plus the house is really gross. (it's been like this my whole life and its just been hard moving back I was out on my own for 9 months). He is kind of abusive but has been treating me ok considering his lifestyle . He isnt getting along with my uncle and its really dragging me down. He complains about my uncle every day screaming on the phone (for good reasons that I don't want to go into I'm not a fan of my uncle either but I'm so sick of hearing about it). My grandpa is dying I will prob never get to see him again which is really hard for me (the source of all this family drama).   


I haven't been doing well financially and I am trying to get back on my feet. I quit smoking weed but Its hard because I'm experiencing a ton of negative emotions now. I pretty much have no one to talk to anymore. I get really angry because I am struggling have no one to talk to and I feel like no one cares. Sometimes I burst out in anger. I have said really mean things to my mom. Also to this girl last night who is nice overall but rejected me after we went out on a date a few weeks ago and she did it at the end of the date before I had to walk home in the cold which felt terrible. I was trying to just shake it off and handled it ok at first but I figured since she was going to school for mental health I could open up to her and she can help me in a therapist sense. Well due to the nature of our relationship this was not a good idea since I am embarrassed about my situation in life and it built up resentment after the rejection. I finally snapped when she accused me of being insecure the other day.  I ended up breaking down last night and saying mean things. I'm so overwhelmed with life right now I blocked her number. I just feel really terrible . I decided to stop dating altogether before going on a date with her which was a good choice. She built me up over text  and was flirty before we met which felt good but totally different energy in person.   


I feel completely broken and defeated right now. I feel like I'm cursed and living in hell. When I first move back in with my dad I was very depressed and had trouble eating. I just now started eating again recently so I was feeling a tad better just from that. But the anger outburst and saying mean things from last night really broke me down again. It was because my dad woke me up at 4am asking for my ownly keys to the house since his was in his truck and my uncle stole his truck .   


My ownly hope right now is that I am using all my money to rent an uber car and drive an uber car so I can get back on my feet. I hope it works out. Also what makes me feel good is music."	helpMe787878	post	16.51802255639313	male	White	0.9993199110031128	na	na	na	4	mmfb	failed

"I am a teen and I think I really messed up my life by watching to much porn and watching gore. I am on TikTok a lot and I think I’m being corrupted when I talk to a girl and becomes friends with them I just wanna have sex idk I just have urges.

"All of this sounds aggressively normal for a teenage mind to think about, to be honest. Legitimately typical puberty thought processes, especially the sex thing. Also, questioning your sexuality at this point is normal, too. There is a lot going on in your body at this time, and your brain kind of has difficulty processing all of it, especially new feelings and emotions. It'll even out, but it's going to be a roller coaster. Just don't do anything stupid in the face of hormonal imbalance by acting on urges when another party is not wanting to do anything.

The porn thing just sets unrealistic ideals/expectations. The random thoughts of death are an interesting phenomenon called thoughts from the void. If all of these new thoughts are disrupting your day-to-day life, or just making you uncomfortable, I suggest learning to meditate, which will teach you to silence your mind. The basic gist of it is to just sit down, close your eyes, and focus on one thing. People typically focus on their breathing to do this: I.e., every time you breath in, count up by 1, and every time you breath out, count up by another 1. Or simply think ""In... Out..."", and every time your mind wanders off, catch yourself, clear your mind, and continue to focus on breathing. It's actually pretty difficult at first, but eventually, clearing your mind will be second nature. There are actual scientific studies that prove that meditation is a fantastic way to ease the mind, among many other health benefits that I can't exactly remember right now."

People have given good advice. I’ll just add, sounds a little like OCD. Intrusive thoughts are the worst, I’m so sorry you’re getting them. If it’s any comfort, a lot of people get them, including me. I had a yoga teacher who always said don’t believe everything you think, I find that to be so helpful. I definitely recommend looking into OCD, therapy, and healthy habits. And don’t be too hard on yourself.	Far_Ebb_8959	reply	na	na	na	0.9920172691345215	strong	strong	no	na	mmfb	failed
"The first thing you need to consider is that watching porn is pretty normal and that looking at gore is a piece of human curiosity. It's the unknown, the what-if and the shock value of it all that draws us to stuff like that. Just remember not to desensitize yourself to it. Remember those are real people, that they had hopes, families and ambitions just like you. Learn from the mistakes, the mishaps, the irresponsible choices and horrible circumstances or cruelties that led to the incidents, and learn from them if possible. If you're looking at gore for pornographic purposes, now that's the part where you might need to take a step back and re-evaluate.

I'm a bit old for tiktok, but I have coworkers that go on it a lot. All social media has its influences in one way or another, and tiktok does have a different feel about it from others. I don't have an account but, generally, if you feel like a social media service is messing with your quality of life, then deleting your account is a reasonable thing to do. Deleting my old Facebook account had a dramatic positive effect on my overall quality of life a few years back, after all.

As to the point about girls and sexual desires, that's very much normal. You didn't specifically say that you were male, but I'll assume that based on the other details in the post, please do correct me if I'm wrong.

Hormones have a HUGE impact on the way your mind functions and the things you crave more. Testosterone makes you much more sexually charged in general, so when you have that and a teenage brain getting loaded down with the stuff, ramp that up tenfold. You'll want sex. Whether you get it or not isn't really a huge deal. You'll find ways to be happy. Maybe you'll find someone, maybe you won't anytime soon. Just because you're craving it doesn't mean it'll happen soon, and that's fine. You've got a lot of time ahead of you, and honestly, sex leads to a lot more problems than you'd believe a lot of the time. Pregnancy and STDs aren't just some boogeyman they tell you about in school, though they often do present the worst dangers first in hopes that'll scare you away from it.

As for the stuff about your brain questioning your sexuality, the real question is: What does it matter? Maybe you are, maybe you aren't. It's not something you need to worry about now. You've got all the time in the world to sort that out, and should be in no hurry to do so. The only person that truly needs to be happy with your life and the choices you make is you. As long as you're not causing harm or breaking laws, that's between you and your deity of choice. Maybe you like girls. Maybe you like boys and are afraid of the stigma placed on that by your peers or elders. Maybe you like both. Maybe you like neither. That's a mystery you'll unravel for yourself in time.

Point is, you're not as broken as you fear. Just let go and see what happens. Just keep in mind that being a good person is subjective. Determine for yourself what you are, but remember that you're just as human as everyone else, and you're still very early in life now. You've got a long way to go, and nowhere you really have to be. Enjoy life in whatever way you can. Just don't hurt other people, and strive to be the kind of person you wish you could see more of in others.

Good luck out there."	Far_Ebb_8959	reply	na	na	na	0.9920172691345215	no	no	no	na	mmfb	no prediction.

That’s all so normal. Also, our society has a porn addiction problem and it’s REAL. You should watch the Ted talk about the guy who was a former porn addict. Hint: FORMER! You can bounce back from this. Porn addiction is like any other addiction- it can be treated and you can live a normal life. Instead of porn, try reading erotic literature. It gives you the same excitement but makes you use your brain, which is sometimes more fun and more imaginative. (Literotica.com).. then, it doesn’t graphically violate your optic senses and sear visually in your memory. Start to learn about normal, every day, flawed, goofy, awkward and human sex.

For context: I was harassed by a group online, including someone I considered a close friend and spoke to for over a year. I did not have hobbies, interests, real life friends and my family were abusive so I took the online bs to heart. I was harassed by these people for a long time, even when I removed myself from the situation I was told they’d still bring me up, I tried to argue my case but nothing got through to them and despite the horrible things they did to me they still view themselves as normal. Sometimes I’d only be in the same space as them for a day just to post memes and they’d start on me or be talking about me in a group voice chat and then start typing to bait me. I did have my problems but everyone in that group was weirder than me and they all did extreme things. The main reason I was even targeted in the first place was because I called them out for sexualising girls in their mid teens constantly, or because they’d act entitled to attractive women (they were all average or below looking themselves) meanwhile they’d accuse women of having high standards.

I left the group 5 months ago and from mid 2021 to mid 2022, I only interacted with them for a few hours to days and would be gone for months. I’m told they still bring me up and post pictures of me. I was targeted the most from mid 2021 to august 2022 I did have a few members obsess over me in late 2020 as well though.

Despite leaving the group, I still replay arguments in my head and get angry thinking about their projection, inconsistencies, hypocrisy, unfair targeting of me and extreme disproportionate actions towards me. I get genuine violent thoughts over this and have done for the past 8 months. I tell myself I shouldn’t care about deranged losers who lack self awareness (though I’ll admit I’m a loser too), I’ll tell myself that their reality is warped and remind myself of all the people who interacted with the group that branded them cringe worthy and insane. None of it makes a difference. I still want to confront specific members and I have violent thoughts and get extremely angry thinking about them. 

I’m saving up for therapy (which feels unfair considering they’re all deranged and need it themselves.) I just want to know if I’m insane for still caring."	throwaway-imp	post	23.3124567310927	male	White	0.9969246983528137	na	na	na	1	mmfb	failed

btw, sometimes forcing yourself to be with someone (you said you are ""pushing people away"") is really helpful. i don't know if you have friends, but if so, they are the best people that can help. if not, spend some time trying to socialize. it'll keep your mind occupied."

"You can love and remember Stevie and also have space in your heart and life for a new dog. That is, if you’re ready! 

I am sure Stevie would be happy that you’ve found room in your heart to adopt and love another dog in need of a loving home.

I think what you’re doing is much healthier. It doesn’t come from a place of immeasurable grief or wanting to fill some empty space. You have had your time to process Stevie alone, but who is to say you can’t grieve and acknowledge the love you had for Stevie while also loving a new dog?

"So my work was having a Secret Santa drawing for Christmas. I'm pretty new and don't know people too well, but I opted to join anyways since we get a slip of paper with what people want. I wrote down my slip, put it in the bin, and pulled a name myself.

A few days later during my next shift a lead there (management goes Department Lead>Leads>Associates) asked me if I wanted to participate. I told her I had already put my name in and pulled a name. She responded with ""Oh, really? The DL said you probably didn't want to join in."" I was really confused. The DL was the one who I was with when I put my name in the bin.

So Christmas Eve comes, everyone's exchanging gifts during the party and I just figured my person was late or working another day. 4 days pass, I asked at the end of my shift if I could grab my gift and one of the leads told me ""Uhh I'm not sure where it is. I'll have it for you next shift."" Next shift comes, ""Oh hey, your person is bringing your gift tomorrow!"" Great! Next shift comes 2 days later, ""Uhh we aren't sure where it is. Well let you know."" Okay...

Now today, 9 days later, I finally get something, and by the handwriting I can tell it's from the DL who coincidentally said my name wasn't in the bin. A pair of socks for kids (I'm in my 20s), a small candle, and some chocolates. I really don't mean to sound ungrateful, but it feels like a slap in the face. I put so time into my gift, and in return I get someone's loose pantry candies and socks I can get half my foot in 9 days late. And it's not like she didn't have a chance to drop it off, she's worked almost every shift I've been at since the 24th. Part of me feels like I only got something because mentioned it to anotjer associate who told a senior they felt bad for me. Before that it was just the constant runaround.

I realize this is such a minor issue in the grand scheme of life, but Christmas is such a bad holiday for me for personal reasons and the only thing I had to look forward to about this holiday season was the Secret Santa exchange. It just has me really down and feeling bad about how my coworkers view me."	mntEden	post	21.747571897770186	male	White	0.9994831085205078	na	na	na	3	mmfb	failed
Secret Santa sucks. I worked at an organization where the same thing happened. Recommend doing a white elephant event or mystery grab gift next time to them as you could tell there was a gap in the amount paid in to playing and the amount from the gift you received. Those that bring a gift at a minimum/maximum cost scale: you bring a gift, get a gift with a fair, blanket threshold expectation.	mntEden	reply	na	na	na	0.9994831085205078	no	strong	no	na	mmfb	failed
Bide your time on this until next year (if you're still working there). When Secret Santa rolls around again, speak up and say exactly what you're saying here, that you put so much thought into your gift and someone gave you thoughtless leftovers. In fact, don't wait until next year. If the subject comes up now and then, speak your mind.	mntEden	reply	na	na	na	0.9994831085205078	weak	no	no	na	mmfb	failed
"Especially since you were new there that was just real rude of them. It's understandable you feel that way, personally I would've taken that as a sign to leave that place, and thank God you're not me because that might not be a real smart decision. Or maybe it is, stay awhile and see if your still being blatantly disrespected by your coworkers, if so I would persoanlly leave if I had the means to.  

Maybe this was all really a miss understanding. Maybe they genuinely didn't see that slip of paper with your name, and maybe they just didn't think you'd participate since you were new and so they assumed you wouldn't want to pay for someone else's secret santa gift, naturally making you not get a gift yourself since its like a trade.

If not, try to look at it like this;  you'd probably much rather want a genuine gift given to you rather then one that was painstakingly given out of pure necessity due to pressure from work."	mntEden	reply	na	na	na	0.9994831085205078	weak	strong	no	na	mmfb	failed
I don't want to really get into my life details but long story short almost every night I'm getting really sad about how miserable my life is and how I got no friends, real friends that can understand me, girlfriend etc. I know that is all coming from my obsession in comparing to others or even to comparing myself to imaginary vision of who I could be. How to deal with it or totally get rid of it?	Professional_Tax5455	post	37.68994279337205	male	White	0.9971075654029846	na	na	na	3	mmfb	failed
"I've been dealing with this a lot lately too. It is hard to not compare yourself to others when it's plastered all over our TVs and social media. Personally, I've come to terms with the fact that I don't have that ""American Dream"" life. I grew up poor with  crippling anxiety major depression similar to you. 

So, realizing that my life isn't gonna be picture perfect is part of the challenge. Does it suck? Hell yeah. I wish I was a trust fund baby having Winter break in Cancun. But learning to make do with what you have is the first step in starting to live your life. Don't worry about what other people have that you don't, worry about what you have that they don't, and that's yourself. Do you have any hobbies? Drawing, for example. Sure, there's tons of great artists out there, but can they draw your favorite subject and tailor it to your likes and personal flair? NO! That's something only YOU can do. Or maybe you like cooking. I have a friend who has worked at multiple Michelin Star restaurants, but I'll be damned if he can make a better peanut butter and honey sandwich than me! How about gaming? Maybe you can't get signed to FaZe, but hoping on your favorite game and stomping some Christmas noobs can be just as fun! 

Find your own groove and get comfortable with making *yourself* happy. We look to almost every outlet and person for encouragement, validation, and acceptance except ourselves. There IS something special about you. You ARE worth the time of day, even if that time is spent with yourself. There's no relationship that can work unless you're content and satisfied with who yourself first. 

You'll be okay, friend. You'll find what you love in life and it'll take you farther than you can imagine right now. It sounds cliche but there really is so much out there, so much life to live. I hope you're feeling better soon. It's easy to get caught up in the doom and gloom but if you need an ear to vent or talk, my inbox is always open.

"Really sorry to hear what you're going through. I think we all struggle with expectations to one degree or another. It's hard to just chuck them all out the window at once. But one thing I've found helps is that - whenever you find yourself thinking about something that you ""should be"", just remind yourself (gently) that the thought is really just an expectation that doesn't have to apply to you. This won't make you feel better at first. But I think if you get in the habit of noticing where you're putting unhelpful expectations on yourself, after a while brushing them off will become like second nature, and then maybe in the future you'll be less likely to form them in the first place."

I have a good career but I recently moved out last year with a roommate and our lease is ending. Financially I haven’t been saving at all just staying stagnant. The reason I moved out was to be more independent and also my relationship with my dad is not the best. It’s just ridiculous the cost of living. But now I think I have to move back in to financial reasons. I’m embarrassed to move back, also nervous because my dad and I feel bad because even though our lease isn’t up til April I don’t want to screw over my roommate. I feel lost and like a failure.

I did this last year, and it hit my room mate quite a bit. The thing is, you've gotta look out for yourself. As others have mentioned, cost of living is in a tough spot. I'm almost 30 now and moved back so I could save 90% of my wages instead of spending most of it and saving a little bit. Unfortunately, your roommates issue is their own, and it's human to feel bad but it's also a case of them being an adult too. If they were renting with someone else, this was still a possibility.

I can’t attest scientifically to the “why”, but I can help with the control aspect of it. If you see them or know you might have an interaction with them in the near future, do some deep breathing or “square” breathing (in for four, hold for four, out for four, hold for four, repeat) to calm down your heart rate and help with the nerves/sweating. Sweating is natural when we’re nervous, so maybe start wearing deodorant or wearing dark clothes if you know you might have a chance at being nervous or anxious that day.

"I thought this guy... somewhere between a friend and a romantic partner was just as into me as I was. We’ve been hanging out for a year, lived together for a bit but he had to move to take care of his mom... still visited me and showed me affection but last time we were together, I brought up long distance dating and ever since (this was two weeks ago), he’s stopped flirting, barely talks to me, and for the first time showed me his nasty side. I’ve never asked him for anything, all I’ve done is give and give to try to make him happy but I asked for one thing. The day after he left, I was crushed that I wouldn’t be seeing him for a few months and needed comfort so I asked him if he would just send me some sweet words for me.

His response was... unbelievable. He was so angry. He was like, “I don’t have the capability of expressing my emotions and it’s better you learn that now than later...I need some time... I’ll text you when I’m feeling better and if you respond then... great. 

That was almost exactly what he said. This was Christmas Eve, my dads cancer had just returned, my sister had her third miscarriage, this whole year has been literal hell (last year now, thank goodness) but did he ask me about how I was doing? Nope! I comforted him and he gave me absolutely nothing. I just can’t believe I was so wrong.

I thought you truly knew a person once you lived with them but apparently, people can still hide their dark sides even when you’re living side by side. 

I’m crushed... trying to move on. I was hoping that by backing off, he’d start trying again but he hasn’t, really. 

I don’t want to date, I really don’t but I want to get over him and in the past, I did this by seeing someone else but I just have no interest.


Anyway... I’m so sorry. This seems so typical, doesn’t it?

This isn’t really that serious I guess, but I 22M had a sexting buddy last year (30F) and we used to send each other tons of pics. She eventually started seeing someone long term which I respected and we didn’t talk much until recently when they broke up. She started telling me how horney she was again but then said she didn’t wanna see any pictures from me but later she told me she matched with someone on tinder and they started sexting. Honestly I’m kind of upset by that and wish she hadn’t told me. Now I feel like I’m not good enough and it’s having a super negative effect on my mental health. I know she doesn’t owe me anything and I’m not entitled to anything sexual and that I’m probably acting like kind of a nice guy but I don’t know why she felt the need to even tell me because she must know it makes me feel really jealous and no one wants me at all.	fuckyou4206999	post	25.92384147478447	male	White	0.9991538524627686	na	na	na	1	mmfb	no prediction.
My advice, don't throw yourself out there sexually so quickly. Have some class and restraint, you don't get hurt as much.

There's so many lonely guys too wise to buy into the bar/club/tinder scene. A girl literally just told me I should get a girlfriend about an hour ago.

My uncle just passed away. He was just in his 30s. His wife is a stay at home mom. They have 4 kids, the eldest just 12 years old. I haven’t seen him in a few years. Pandemic and all. He was a great dad and great man to all of us. I still can’t comprehend it. I also feel awful because I haven’t talked to my dad in a few months. This news broke me. I feel awful for my cousins they are so young and for his poor wife. I feel awful for not speaking to my dad and terrified at the thought of losing him when he was upset with me. I just got hit by a reality check and felt so selfish. Although I had my reasons, it’s not fucking worth it. I saw my daddy’s face on my uncles when I got to say goodbye. It’s been a few days and I still can’t get it out of my head. I feel selfish for thinking about myself at all in this situation when those poor kids just lost their father. I’m so scared for them.

I don't usually share my feelings or anything with anyone and I tried really hard to suck it up and fix stuff myself but I am tired now and I'm really scared. My family is wonderful but after corona my dad lost his job and ultimately after more than a year of trying to find a job he decided to start his own business before the savings run out. This was great, it gave my dad motivation and everyone of us in the family some emotional boost as well as we all weren't doing too great ourselves. Cut to now, I'm in college and doing fine, but it seems that the heavy burden of starting a business has took a toll on my dad and mom both. I come home for like 10days in a few months and now I see how much emotionally tired they both are. They are really great though, they try their best to hide the pain from me and my younger brother but I can see it. It makes me so sad because this has taken a toll on their health as well. I myself am super lonely. Even in college I got basically no friends except my hostel roommates who are friends just because we have to be, being roommates. I have no one to share my feelings with, I don't care about relationship I just want true friends. I want someone I can share my pain with. I don't know what I'm supposed to do anymore, everything seems to be going downhill, I'm really mentally tortured as well but luckily I have a strong mind so I'm able to fight it but I am starting to get tired now.	tired_being1	post	21.476600472711752	female	White	0.9974310994148254	na	na	na	1	mmfb	no prediction.
The title basically says it all. My mom was drunk and was trying to tell me smth and I guess I was acting as if I didn’t want her to talk but that’s simply because I hate when she drinks and she does it every weekend. (She’s not an alcoholic yall lol she only drinks 2 day out the week, from like 6 pm- 11. It used to be like 4 times a week so I’m proud of her for changing that) But she saw the way I was acting and she said “you don’t care?? Do you even love me” and more bs I was trying not to listen to too hard but I didn’t want her to feel that way so I tried to apologize 3 times but she didn’t like any of them and wanted me to keep doing it till she liked it. It was like 11:58 at this point and I didn’t want that energy for the new year so I was like I’ll do it after the new year starts, she was upset with this cause she wanted me to fix it before the year starts. But me and my dad said Happy new years at midnight and my mom was mad that I didn’t “fix” it and started cussing me out and calling me all sorts of names as I was waking upstairs. Ofc I was sad but I tried to find happiness to have a good New Years night and I went to sleep decently happy. Then when I woke up I thought my mom would be more understanding of her faults causes she sober now and she normally is the next morning when she’s sober, but not this time. I went downstairs and she basically told me I started the whole year wrong and made me apologize the exact way she wanted me to and at first I refused, cause I wanted her to see my side and how I’m not necessarily wrong in this situation. (Or at least I don’t think I am) Then she threatened to take away our relationship if I don’t change myself and apologize cause she doesn’t need to change cause she’s the mom and I’m the child. And I hate when she says that cause we’re all still learning about life regardless of age but she thinks she shouldn’t have to change for a kid she gave birth to. Which I kinda understand but I don’t. Anyway when I apologized “correctly” she gave me a hug and said she loved me but at this point I wanted to cry but I acted happy in front of her and went upstairs with tears in my eyes. Now I feel like my whole year will be ruined due to the poor start. Can someone pls tell my my year won’t be ruined and just overall mmfb. Ps I’m 14 (soon to be 15 in 2 months now.

I so wish I had better words of wisdom. Just know that you’re not alone, many have experienced this type of pain, and it really really hurts. Your year is not ruined. You’re obviously very wise at a very young age, and very generous. My only advice is to look into Alateen. Your mom doesnt need to be an ‘alcoholic’ for you to be affected by her drinking, and Alateen helps, either meetings or books. It’s so hard to process everything that goes along with a parent drinking: wanting to defend your parent, loving them but hating who they are when they drink, feeling like you‘re not allowed to be upset, feeling responsible, etcccc. Alateen addresses a lot of that stuff. But you are so valid in everything you feel no matter what. Good luck, and I bet you have a good year and a powerful life ahead of you based on the thoughtfulness and sensitivity you show in this post. Good luck!

"I second the alateen support . Also look into resources for kids of narcissistic parents. Having to apologize “exactly correctly” is a red flag. It can be complicated to have parents like this but you can get support that will help. 

Don’t stress that this happened on New Years. You could be literally doing anything at midnight and it will have almost no bearing on the year you will have ahead. Don’t be afraid of it setting some bad tone or something. 

You said you were 14 and not a young kid but 14/15 is young!!! However when you have a parent that ACTS like a child it can make you feel overly responsible and like you have to be the adult. 

In the new year, I hope you get a ton of support for dealing with complex family relationships like this. It’s tough but I’m here to tell you that you can make it"	Quesadillagirll	reply	na	na	na	0.9992291927337646	weak	no	no	na	mmfb	no prediction.
Awe honey, I'm so sorry that happened. I'm glad that you're proud of her and that she's making progress. However her behavior is still unacceptable. That isn't your fault. You're not responsible for her behavior. She should not be calling you names, or saying that you ruined the new year. The new year isn't ruined. This isn't how you're supposed to be treated by your mom.	Quesadillagirll	reply	na	na	na	0.9992291927337646	strong	no	no	na	mmfb	no prediction.
She sounds manipulative. May be hard to agree/accept because that’s your mom but you aren’t wrong for being uncomfortable around someone who gets drunk and can’t control themselves. “Do you even love me” is a classic guilt and just plain unfair. Obviously you do love her. Wanting you to apologize until you’ve met her conditional requirements is narcissistic and manipulative. You didn’t ruin the new year, she did. Your energy was genuine , that’s what you brought into the new year.

Thank you for your help, but I don’t think she’s a narcissist considering this is only her behavior when’s she’s drunk, in normal everyday life she’s very sweet typically.

I guess I more meant that you may find resources that help the kids of narcissists helpful if she is displaying that type of behavior (even if it’s not all the time, sometimes just one time can be kinda traumatic). The guilt-tripping, controlling, temper tantrum like behavior that totally invalidates your needs like “you change because you’re the kid, I don’t have to change cuz I’m the mom” and the emotional manipulation like that other person mentioned (don’t you even love me) is just hurtful and complicated because we you can really love a person but then they may have these kind of traits due to like childhood trauma or a million other things and when ur a kid and live with a parent like that it can be helpful to get support for navigating it. Sometimes there is also a pattern of being really authentically  loving and sweet in between times of being mean so it can be even more confusing. I do hear you though with not wanting to apply labels like “narcissist” or “alcoholic” to your mom because those words don’t fit what you’re experiencing, but I’d encourage you to look up support for children of those types of folks if she does stuff like this again (or even as you recover from this incident) and if you are feeling lost and in need of support because you may find it helpful even if those labels don’t totally apply.

"Hello fellow redditers. Please bear with this post. 

I need some advice.. I’m experiencing an existential crisis and the aspect of fleeting time is morbidly ruminating in my head, which is impairing my judgment here.

I’m a 25 y.o (M) based in Toronto. For context: my parents and I make up a family of 3. We immigrated here a decade back and have been struggling ever since. They are 65 and 60 and live pay cheque to paycheque with absolutely no assets, financial security nor social life. Moreover, my mom has been getting more vocal about how tired she is getting at work and just recently applied for her pension (which is a mere $100). My father is also still working but it’s hard on him too. They are in menial jobs with no qualifications to move to other seniorial positions. I have no siblings or relatives so it’s only us 3. We haven’t moved out of this same first apartment because they don’t have the credit and they fear not having a rent-stablized home they’d be able to afford, which makes the quality of life here a bit less than stellar considering the infestations we incur and I have severe allergies, so I’m highly bothered. Plus we’ve, especially I’ve, outgrown this space. 

My parents have given EVERYTHING their entire lives to provide for me and try to make it out of the Soviet Union and be successful. Once the Union fell, they lost everything. Started again from 0. I’m VERY close with them. My mom even worked in a factory for a few years when we first immigrated just so we could put food on the table and pay rent. She used to be a CEO before in Russia. Just this past year, they practically starved themselves to give me a year abroad doing my Masters, which mentally and physically destroyed them and I was reminded of it every single month, while I myself struggled abroad because I never had enough to meet needs. You can probably sense how much guilt and helplessness I feel.

Here is my dilemma: During this on-going existential crisis, I kept pondering how I need to live my life, “take risks in my 20s,” but also build up my finances and have a vast array of experiences. I have SO many things I wanna do and see and after all, they brought me here for a better life. But MOST of which involve me living in Europe, that’s where my heart is. I’ve grown a huge friend group there & have felt more alive than ever. BUT I worry their health will decline and recently read a book entitled 4000 weeks stating that our time is limited and I would be willingly losing months of my time with my parents (essentially whatever you give your time to, you’re openly giving up the time on something else). G-d knows what happens in a few months to years? And what, visit 3 times a year? That kills me beyond belief. And this is especially difficult because I have debts I have to help them clear, and they get immense joy from having me around to talk about work, go out on the weekends, make them feel less alone and stuck in a rat race they only get depressed about. And my father refuses to do anything with my mother for fun, so she only depends on me to do fun enjoyable things in the city. I know it makes life a bit more bearable. So to leave them completely alone, to thrive and risk losing that time but perhaps have some amazing experiences abroad  myself (as I feel very lonely and out of place here) feels paralyzing. And yes, I have a lot of ruminating anxiety, clearly. 

I should also mention they constantly remind me how much older they’re getting, their declining health, their fears of not seeing the world or even being able to make a living soon. They also remind me how I will have to take care of them financially and physically and how I should maximize my time with parents. They have attached their identities and purpose to me because as I said they have not succeeded in life, are lonely and have struggled/had very difficult childhoods themselves. Both of them experienced immense losses at an early age and took care of both of their mothers, as they raised me and struggled in my early infancy. When we moved here, they had to leave their mothers abroad in carers and my dad lost his mother from a phone call, after not having seen her for 2 years struggling to build a life in Canada and her dementia and health overtook her, she died alone. And my mom flew back every 3 years while her mother withered away alone in nursing home. This destroyed both of them, especially being away and financially not being able to help their families. 

This is also highly cultural as we are Russian-Jews. So I suppose a good deal of the emotional burden and guilt I feel has quite literally been passed through generations but I also can’t help but feel they’re right. They literally have no one but me. And are stating the facts of life currently for them. And I don’t want them to lie to myself and not tell me their own anxious thoughts and worries, even if it makes me MORE anxious. 

And here I am, I don’t know what to do from here. 

During COVID, I remote worked from home, and had the same routine, with no social outings, and I’m about to start another such job and I still have no friends here. The thought of doing that again is SO depressing to me and makes me resent myself for not living my life fully but also happy I can provide for my family and spend time with them. I’m literally 50/50. I also thought to just move downtown Toronto to live alone (as I’ve never done and have always wanted to live alone esp with the apartment situation) but paying such outrageous prices, when I’d rather save the money for a trip with them or when I’d just rather live in Europe seems foolish. I also can’t help but feel I’d be abandoning them or willingly again taking time away from seeing them, even if I live 45 minutes down the subway line. I did that in first year of Uni and didn’t see them that often, maybe 10 times over 9 months. That seems pitiful.

Also, I really really REALLY wanna travel more and being in Europe would make me SO happy. But also when I lived abroad during this Masters year, I felt immense guilt, fleeting time and missed them indescribably bad to the point I wanted to come back at certain points but also was so sad when I came back because I mourned the experiences abroad. 

I’m SO SO SOOOOO conflicted. 

I don’t want to sit on my death bed regretting my 20s or the experiences I didn’t take. Similarly, I don’t wanna regret taking time away from being with the only people that I truly love and care for me, especially in their later years. 

I don’t know where the balance is.

Any advice? Please be brutally honest. 

TLDR; just graduated grad school, really close to aging lonely parents, want to move away to Europe where I thrive but harbour immense guilt and reminds of fleeting time leave me unable to take a decision and I don’t wanna grow resentful with myself."	mtlse5	post	26.085860362446205	female	White	0.9864946603775024	na	na	na	3	mmfb	ethnicity: russian-jewish, age: 25, gender: male, explanation: the author directly states his age as 25 and identifies as male. he mentions his family's immigrational background from the soviet union and that they are russian-jews which indicates the author's ethnic background.
It’s so tough. I’ll let you know if I think of any amazing ideas but I wish you luck and one thing that helped me when I feel stuck is to make a list of all the possibilities, not even necessarily realistic / logical but like also dream scenario. It helps me feel less stuck sometimes. Also do you have therapist/counselor/coach, especially someone who understands parent/child/first gen experiences? Sometimes that’s helpful for decision making also.

I’ve grown up Christian my entire life. I’ve been Baptist, Lutheran, Non-Denominational, I’ve experienced Catholicism, a bit of everything. I’ve always believed the Bible and my relationship with God is more important than any organized religion and I’ve been strong in my faith until recently. I researched atheism, Bible contradictions, and I’m doubting. Someone please give me some facts to prove that Jesus is real or to disprove it all, because I need some guidance here.		post	17.79068493480289	male	White	0.009095289744436741	na	na	na	2	mmfb	no prediction.
"what specifically are contradictions you were told? Many atheist who don't understand the complexities of the bible use that claim as a cop out for shallow comprehension. Remember that just simply reading the book front to back does not mean you have a solid grasp of its content, often there are context that are left out, like the historical context which ties into the meaning. I recommend, if your protestant or not he still brings up good points, Mike Winger on youtube and his series on supposed bible contradictions. Don't watch his debates with Atheist though, most people are not good at debating and he's one of them, gets too nervous. Doesn't mean that what he says isn't true, just that he does not have proper debate edicate. But watch his videos on the topics he does alone, he has great points and is the reason I came back to the faith and grew stronger within it. Many people have confusion, especially these days, it almost feels like a normal part of the Christian walk now. Doesn't make you a bad Christian, it just means you need to be more rooted in the bible and its teaching, don't feel bad because I was guilty of the same thing. God bless, your in my prayers

Start small. Start by saying hello to someone at the caf or in a class and offering a smile. Or even just start by making eye contact and nodding at people. Once those come easier, make small talk. Talk about the weather or how hard a class is with a peer, or even practice small talk with a professor. Once you’re more comfortable, go to a campus event or a community event, and try to talk to some people there. Find ways to surround yourself with people and get more comfortable being in that environment and learning how to control and push past that anxiety. You’ve got this, be consistent, and don’t get down if you get overwhelmed with an interaction and can’t do it.

"I am having the worst evening I've had in ages so I'm screaming into the void. I do not really expect responses.

Many years ago I was in an emotionally abusive relationship. I was basically at fault for everything. His uni assignments not done on time? My fault for not encouraging him enough. Someone trying to flirt with me? I must have invited it. Him having a bad time? Well, if only I didn't suck at cheering him up, right? Anyway, deeply unhealthy stuff and not to go into the worst bits, but on the regular, when I was not good at emotional support, I would be subjected to hours long rants of how terrible I was.

I'm obviously no longer in that relationship and mostly it's alright. I just have a few pain points. I have a friend who sometimes gets bad anxiety, and from the very first time they tried to lean on me when they felt bad, I realized... damn, this is a trigger for me. Big time. It was a painful thing to learn for us both and I struggled with it for quite some time, but we eventually settled on the fact that I cannot support them during those times as I just get more agitated than them, and it just makes things worse.

I have accepted that, painful as it is. They say they've accepted it too. Yet time and time again it comes up - not even in the sense of them trying to lean on me. Today they had a bad day and told me they were feeling anxious.

Now, I am autistic, I was having an off day myself and I wish it were different, but I really did not understand in the moment how serious it was. I later messaged them once I was feeling better, asked if they wanted company. They declined, citing feeling bad.

I left them be for the evening, just hours later sent a text along the lines of ""hope your evening has improved."" They called me, sounded a bit calmer, then berated me for a) not understanding how serious things were earlier and b) berating me for my choice of words. I did apologize for ""not picking up on how serious it was"". Which apparently implies they weren't clear enough? I don't know. English isn't my first language and all I was trying to imply was that my brain was off in the clouds. Having my words picked apart like that makes me want to curl up in a ball and wait until the litany is over, only it was over years ago.

Anyway. Cue fight. I again tried to explain why I find this upsetting. This is exactly what I used to have. I am back feeling like the most disgusting excuse for a human being that ever humaned. I haven't been able to stop crying, I am feeling self destructive, and I feel doubly bad for making this about myself.

This sucks, all of it. I cannot explain this to my friend in a way they understand. I have tried. Multiple times.

"This friend doesn’t seem like a healthy or supportive friend to you. Sometimes, people’s trauma, problems, or mental health issues don’t mesh well with ours. Being understanding of their anxiety is one thing, but it doesn’t absolve them from being a mean person. You can have any condition and still be a mean person. You don’t have to feel bad or guilty, and you’re not a bad friend at all. It sounds like this person has unrealistic expectations of you. We are all responsible for ourselves at the end of the day, and it sounds like your friend needs more mental health support from professionals. 

Friends should not tear us down like that, and what they said sounds both untrue, inappropriate, and hateful. Why are you still friends with this person?"	Caebrine	reply	na	na	na	0.9992539286613464	no	no	no	na	mmfb	no prediction.
Making you rehash a fight over what you did wrong is such a toxic trait in a friend. I actually had to end a relationship over this alone, even though we seemed to work on many other levels. It's not just anxiety, it's an externalizing, harshly critical response. That is anxiety mixed with contempt. Not a good recipe. Your friend needs to work on this with a therapist and own their own feelings. I would not blame you for breaking off your friendship over this, bc for me personally, having fights over what i did wrong (even just a few of them) is so triggering that i am just not willing to put myself there anymore.

They have been very supportive of me in the past, and I love them for many qualities. This is just one thing that absolutely clashes and whenever it happens, I do question myself if it's worth trying to make a friendship work.

It also sounds manipulative and hypocritical for them to list out everything you did wrong, yet when you try to explain yourself they say that “it sounds like they can’t do anything right.” 

I think your reaction is normal. I would react similarly. In fact, I had an ex with bad depression and anxiety who refused to take his medication or go to therapy. He relied on me during his anxiety attacks and would berate and criticize me for not saying or doing x,y,z perfectly. I told him that I’m not a trained mental health professional for these situations, and if he required “x,y, and z” he needed to get it from a trained mental health professional. Please stop feeling guilty or like you’re a bad friend because you’re not. You are dealing with your own trauma, and you’re not trained and in a job where you know exactly how to respond to someone who isn’t doing well. 

It’s hurtful for someone you care about to keep saying these things to you. Not only is it hurtful, but it’s pointless. I’m sorry you’re feeling self destructive due to this.

"Hi, I'm a 13M and I feel like I can't be myself, here's what I mean. I made a separate post on a different subreddit which in summary, I said that my friend left the call, called me slurs, blocked me, and has turned almost all my who I thought were my closest friends against me and the saddest part is, it was over fall guys, a game we have never played, he came second and I chuckled at his reaction. He got mad at me and did what I said he did earlier. Now I feel like an asshole. At sometimes I just sit in bed for like an hour an just scroll through tik tok just wondering in the back of my mind ""is it my fault"" and things like ""I'm such a bad friend"". It's like that with almost every friendship I get into. I start to feel comfortable in that group and I get into a funny and goofy mood and I feel so safe and comfortable. Then boom I get fucking ghosted, or I get fucking blocked, every fucking time, and it is so mentally draining thinking about how alone I am and how I can never keep a fucking friend group. It honestly ruined my social life. And I just want someone to talk to, to play video games with and just to chill out with, idc even abt age anymore. I know my situation is not even close to the other people in this subreddit and that makes me feel bad and like I'm bitching and just overreacting.

The voice in the back of your head asking if you're an asshole is your conscience, and the fact you're even feeling remorse shows that you have a good head on your shoulders.

"I'm so sorry, this must have been really hard for you. Using a partner's trauma against them to hurt them in a place of anger sounds really wrong to me. It seems like a direct attack on trust in your relationship, and one that was supposed to come at the cost of your reliving aspects of that trauma. To me, that crosses a really important line in a relationship. What is a relationship if there isn't trust that disagreement is safe? Or when safety  and loving attitudes are dependent on compliance? 

This isn't your fault. The choice to say that was his. 

Maybe sit down for awhile with a pen and paper and write about what has really changed in your relationship. Has he done anything like this in the past? Are you interested in rebuilding trust within the expectation that changes going forward will be similar to changes behind you? Is he even safe to talk to anymore, or do you mostly imagine real conversations with him in your head that you can't have irl?

If you're able to I hope you can see a therapist. If you choose to stay together, I hope you also see a separate couples therapist and he commits to going to both individual and couples therapy. You deserve to feel peaceful and to feel truly loved. 

Also, I believe you. It would be wrong of anyone (especially people who believe you) to use the trauma of sexual assault and the trauma of group shunning afterwards to hurt you again.

I am a hypochondriac and scared I have rabies. I was bitten by a dog roughly 7 months ago. I was playing with someones two puppy bit bulls and one of them got a little excited and play bit me. it drew blood, maybe a .5mm puncture. They guy looked a little shabby, could of been homeless. I went to the doctor who said that I didn't need to get rabies vaccine because the chances were so low (puppy in good mood, in San Francisco which has a low rate). I even asked if she would have her child get the shot and she said no. Now I can't shake the fear that I have it, as some cases rabies have laid dormant for 3-7 years!! I dont know why I am so worried about it but I feel dumb for not getting it (even though it would have been 10k). don't know what to do I can't stop worrying	Difficult_Instance49	post	19.71902647516445	female	White	0.9931943416595459	na	na	na	2	mmfb	no prediction.
"Well, if you're a hypochondriac, I'm not sure if you're going to believe me. But you don't have rabies for the following reasons:

1. You never showed symptoms
2. The dog didn't show symptoms
3. It's been 7 months ago, while rabies normally kicks in within 20-90 days after infection
4. Rabies in the US is extremely rare, with only 1-3 cases every year.
5. In none of those cases was an American dog the culprit. It's usually a bat or raccoon, or an animal in a developing country ([source: CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/location/usa/surveillance/human_rabies.html))

If that bite would have infected you with anything, you would have noticed something by now. Since that's not the case (even after 7 months), and since all the facts show how stupendously unlikely it is that you would contract something as exotic as that from an all-American dog, you don't have rabies."

"I've recently found out that the group of friends I've grown so close with over more than a decade have all split off into separate groups for very valid reasons. One person coerced another into sex and others defended him, one person was apparently emotionally abusive toward someone else for years, someone testified in court in favor of his fraternity brother who sexually assaulted another person in the group.

"Posting for my friend here, since she doesn't want to post (I have her consent, she just doesn't want to do it herself).

My friend (14f) has been having suicidal thoughts lately. We think she has depression and Schizophrenia, among a lot of other mental diseases, however she says her parents are unwilling to pay for any type of therapy. She's told me her relationship with her parents isn't so great.

She hasn't fully opened up about the details of what she's been through, but judging by some conversations with her she is having suicidal thoughts (direct quote, ""if I died would it matter to you?"") and self-doubt (""I’m…im not the problem am I?"")

According to herself, she can hear voices telling her to commit suicide (which is what lead us to believe she has Schizophrenia) and her most recent messages are what's prompted me to suggest her post on this subreddit, eventually leading to me posting for her.

"Does your friend maybe have access to a school counselor she can talk to about this kind of thing, or maybe she can go to her doctor for a check-up and mention these thoughts?

I know what it's like to have voices in your head that are so loud. Telling you you're worthless, that no one will care if you're gone. It's like an incessant buzzing noise that won't stop. You lose yourself in it almost. 

But, there is a way to make them stop. You just need to see a doctor first. Not necessarily a therapist right now if the parents aren't willing, but she definitely should see a doctor who can maybe convince the parents to let her go to therapy.  She can also see if there's any insurance options for herself, if she's on insurance she won't have to really pay for therapy etc. (depending on copays but for kids/younger people usually there isn't). Chip is also an option that is really good for young people to get on when they can't afford insurances.

I would also advise against self harm with knives and such. Even though you want to die, chances are, you won't and you'll end up with disgusting scars on your arms. I have a few that I need to get a tattoo over because they're hideous. Trust me, you do not want that for yourself.

i also have no clue how to tell her anything. i have problem with trust due to some things that happened earlier in life and some problems with anxiety so talking about these things is never easy and usually requires a fair amount of time; and with all the voices in my head talking almost constantly, i can hardly hear my normal thoughts anymore, let alone focus on something so whats the word uhhh crazy thats happening.

i honestly have gotten used to dealing with most of my problems except for some that have been acting up a bit more lately and seem to be getting worse as time goes on but thats besides the point. i cant have my parents finding about some of them due to their connection with something very important to me they hate. one of the problems is literally something that revolves around that thing.

A guy passing by saw this started to laugh, but idc about him, I just feel bad and pity at my inability to help someone without feeling confident enough.

PS: Please don't say ""atleast you tried to help him that just show's how good of a person you are"" my mom already said that.

It's been 9 days since this happened and I still can't stop thinking about this lol"	CrazyEvery3682	post	18.01379954292916	female	White	0.9973883032798767	na	na	na	1	mmfb	no prediction.
You grow as a person when you learn from your experiences and also when you step out of your comfort zone every once in a while. If you feel like you made a mistake this time, you can turn your regrets into a lesson so that you’ll be more informed on what you should do next time. Mistakes are how we learn. Has this experience taught you that the risk of a potentially awkward, but also possibly rewarding, social interaction and a kind gesture on your part outweigh the remorse you’d feel from not helping, should a similar opportunity present itself in the future? If so, use that insight to guide you from now on. Stepping out of your comfort zone leads to a more fulfilling life, in my experience. The more you push your boundaries, the more you expand your world. It gets easier the more you do it. Be bold. Try not to be afraid of being uncomfortable  every now and then.  Not every experience will have your desired outcome but every experience will teach you something. You aren’t expected to always know what the right thing to do is - part of life is figuring that all out over time- but if you learn from previous experiences it makes you better.

I went on a date w this girl and she said I was sexy in texts which made  me feel good. So we went to a comedy show and it was fun. At the end of  the date she dropped me off at this train stop and said she just wanted  to be friends. I didn't say anything we both just had sad looks in our  eyes and I got out of the car and left. When I got home I went on tinder  and funny enough she was on there too it said she was online but I  swiped left and unmatched on the other dating app I matched her on. I already deleted my dating apps before this but got back on them right after .. prob gonna delete them again and take a break tired of rejection		post	21.885878739534146	male	White	0.9990525841712952	na	na	na	1	mmfb	no prediction.
"My dude. Don't worry. First of all, as time goes on you will become more and more desirable, I promise. Second: if you're going to use the dating apps, make sure you do something else beforehand, something good for yourself - I am thinking an hour of walking, possibly while listening to an audiobook or something. Consider listening to books on the bestseller list. This will accomplish many things: 

1. It will give your mind a break from looking at the dating sites

2. If nothing comes from the sites each day, at least you will have accomplished something

3. It is a human and relatable activity. Who knows, maybe one date will find you talking about books. But walking is something most people can do, and it makes you seem 'normal'. 

In my experience, (limited though it is), you are entering a stage where people come to desire someone who has their life together. This basically means a job, finances in decent order and a home, and depending on where you live, a car.  If you have those few things (which are simple but far from easy) then people will see you as someone whom they can safely share their life with. People want to start a relationship with someone who *wants* to be with them, not someone who *needs* to be with them. If you have those basic ingredients, you are not going to be single forever. In the meantime, don't worry about attracting all sorts of dates. Work on becoming the best partner to the right person, and that person will show up sooner rather than later."		reply	na	na	na	0.9990525841712952	weak	no	no	na	mmfb	no prediction.
"It hasn’t reached the point where there’s anything sexual but she just turned 18 and he’s 27 they worked tg for less than a month before she left cuz we’re moving but he literally spends an hour if not more on texting her and she’s stupid and feels like she’d be a bitch if she doesn’t reply so she spends an hour or more texting him back they literally text so much I’m not exactly sure about what but I know she tells him details about her life and also at some point he asked her if I knew they were texting and told her he’d prefer if I didn’t I’m her older sister btw anyways I keep bringing it up and telling her like be careful block him or wtv and she’s like it’s not a big deal we’re in a diff country and when we go bak we’re gonna be far away and he’s not gonna know where we live and I’m just texting him for now but I’ll stop later and then she said which pissed me off so much that it’s offensive of me to think that she’d be so “dumb” to fall for this first of all I did lecture her about that saying people who “fall for that” aren’t dumb they’re victims second of all u r being dumb by ignoring me and texting a 27y old who has nothing better to do but spend hours of his day texting u about god knows what idk if I’m overreacting or overthinking ive dealt w a lot of shit from guys and I’ve been sa so I’m very paranoid but idk I think my argument is valid please let me know what u think thank u

"It is very kind of you to want to watch out for your sister, but you have to remember that though grooming might involve a lot of message exchange, not all message exchange is grooming. Sometimes older people reach out to younger people, not to get something out of their bodies, but because humans like connecting with other humans, even though they aren't necessarily good at it. I think it's also worth considering if grooming is really the right word if we're talking about someone who is an adult, especially if there's no power dynamic between them.

That said, the way you've represented how she talks about the friendship, like that she will stop it ""later"", does give me some concern. If she was genuinely enjoying the conversation, she wouldn't plan to cut it off at all (unless she felt like she needed to frame it that way to keep you off her back.) And that bit about him not wanting you to know is a big red flag.

I think you are right to be concerned, but you have to respect your sister's agency. Rather than trying to make the decision for her about if this relationship is good or bad, maybe it's worth trying to find out what she gets out of continuing it that she's not getting from people around her. That may take some careful questions, and a lot of careful listening."	Nookeslies	reply	na	na	na	0.9990836381912231	weak	no	no	na	mmfb	no prediction.

I'm currently failing in class, you know why because everyday before the exam I watch youtube and reddit all day { I stopped using Instagram, because it messed my mental health really bad }, and while surfing the internet I just go I'll start studying after this video finishes, then again I'll start studying when it's 3 PM, then I'll start studying when it's 5 PM, but I actually start studying just 3 hour's before the exam.

Even in talking to my crush I go I'll ask her out on Friday, and then Friday comes and I freeze and then I go, I'll ask her next time and then next time never comes.

"I struggle in the same stuff, mate. Let me tell you there is no easy fix. If you want to change you have to put the work in and it will be hard work. In today's age and society, there's almost no reason to deny yourself anything. Especially as an adult where you're free to do as you choose. Now the mantra. Slow is smooth and smooth is fast. You work hard today and imagine all the progress you'll make in a year. So you're gonna have to buckle down and do whatever you have to change. I bought a dry-erase board and write everything that I have to do down. Then, anytime you fall into an old habit whenever you realize what you're doing and that you want to change, you get to it! You're gonna have to be proactive. Parental blockers, timers, rewards, etc. So let's say studying. Go somewhere so you can focus and say today we're doing 20 minutes of studying. Go easy on yourself and be honest 20 minutes might be more than youd have done anyway, so technically, you're winning lol. Once you knock that out, decide if you can handle anymore. I like to trick myself lol. I'll say ""just 20 minutes,"" and after that, I'll say, ""ya see how easy that was. I can do 10 more easssy! That's only half of those measly 20 minutes, ""and finally,""What's another 10 minutes i meant, then I'll be double my goal!"" If it's a bad day, I just dip out after the 20 and boom I'm still ahead.

"I mean it goes without saying that I’m the black sheep of my bio family. It’s weird because at social events everyone has their parents and I have no one really.
Anyways fast forward to today I went to take a depression nap and my (21) sister and (13) cousin came in the room to get some stuff thinking I was asleep. And my cousins says to my sister “you really are the cutest/prettiest one in the family” to which my sister is like “stop”. But then my cousin goes on to say “you also have the most going for you like your boyfriend you’re in school, your friends, you have good grades” and I just made me feel so bad about myself because these are already my intrusive thoughts that I’m not good enough, I’m alone I don’t know what I’m doing with my life and I have nothing to show for my degree. And it’s not like my cousin would just say that unless someone else had been saying that around her. I wish I was cooler, and skinnier and didn’t wear glasses, had more money for brand name things, or even just to do all the things they want me to do, and was overall better adjusted. But sadly I’m not I don’t have the best hair or the best sense of style and they remind me every time they can that I’m inferior— worse I’m always the butt of the joke or the only time anyone would compare my sister to me is if she was horribly disfigured. I try and try and I just feel like they always manage a way to make me feel beaten down.

"You have two choices and I already know which you will pick. 
1. Keep doing the depression napping, keep compairing and hating yourself, keep giving up, keep learning nothing, keep believing yourself useless and a piece of shit. 
2. Do the *exact opposite* of every word. Takes a while to start doing and not listening to your brain tell you it is hopeless.

Your brain dies not require the proof you think it does to stop tearing you down. Also, weirdly, if someone were to come and say you are amazing at everything you do, your brain wouldn't believe that either!

"Hey there. I'm sorry to hear that you're struggling with these thoughts. Reading your post, I don't see anything that would justify you feeling so bad about yourself. It seems to me that you're a good, sensitive and worthwhile person, who deserves nothing less than to be happy. But that's probably hard to believe if you've been thinking so negatively about yourself for so long.

If you want to influence how people think about you, you have to lead by example. If you want them to love you, you need to love yourself too. If you want them to think highly of you, you have to think and speak highly about yourself too. If you want them to believe in you, you have to believe in yourself too. So that's the mindset shift you have to make.

Stop comparing yourself to others. You are a unique and valuable individual in your own right. You're good enough just the way you are. But what you have to think about is the following:

1. What do you want to achieve in life? Again, don't compare yourself to others, think about what YOU really, truly want.
2. Who do you need to be in order to achieve those dreams?
3. What steps can you take right now to start moving in that direction?

Perhaps it's good to talk to someone professionally who may be able to help you figure all that out. It's a lot to go through on your own, and there are so many tried and tested ways to help you with this. You're not alone in this, and you don't have to fix everything by yourself.

"It sounds like you’re emotionally exhausted and overwhelmed from everything that’s been happening. 

I’m partial to the term **emotional hangover**. Sometimes when you keep taking hit after hit in life, you harden up and keep soldiering through. Then, when you don’t have to be a soldier anymore and you can actually pause to process and grieve, it can feel like a huge wave that came out of nowhere, and it can be disorienting. 

It’s a good time for rest, self care, and taking life gently. The fact that you have a clear sense of love for your life is a good sign that you have hope. You need support as well, to remember you are loved.

I am lost. I have no motive left in life. No motive and no hope for anything better. My life is perfectly comfortable, I have loving parents and great siblings and few friends who are closer than anyone I can be. Still I find no motive,  I see myself as a big failure who started good but lost in the world. I could have done better. I could have stayed focused but I chose otherwise. Now I get off the bed and I don't even see books when I have entrance exams in a month.  I just stay and waste the whole day without any objective. I just play games and scroll and get angry at people who actually love me and mean no harm to me. My thoughts are filled with shit though they used to be filled with ideas. I am too free. I am lost. I can't see the light at the end of the tunnel. Everyday I try to motivate myself to try something new but I end up doing the same things again and again. I don't break the cycle.

I’m 15, getting to 16.

I don’t know, I’m not even sure if I’m looking for advice, maybe just someone to talk to. 

Basically, a few hours ago I got a message from my buddy that even though I said I’d prefer he didn’t, he asked out this girl I had a crush on. I’m forcing myself to not care, and I refuse to be anything less than chill about it. They’re dating now, and even though Im supposed to not care, it just… I dunno. It hurts. 

I just finished Scrooge (a tradition) after a long day at work with my family, always fun. It’s just been clawing at me. I have to wake up and go to work tomorrow too, nice and early. Today, you could say. I’ll be having a fun time cleaning up dog shit and working my ass off. 

I dunno, I’m just sad. It’s not his fault, it’s just tough.

I keep telling myself a relationship isn’t a priority, and it isn’t, but god damn am I lonely. I’m homeschooled, and have few friends. It just… hurts. Im now 7th wheel in the friend group.

Every time we hang out I just have to sit there while everyone’s romantic, and would you look at that, now we have another pair to lament over.

It just hurts. I can’t let it stop me, I gotta remember that golden idol. One day I’ll bloody achieve my dreams and make a damn impact.

"Hey there. Sorry you're not feeling so great right now. Reading your post, I get a feeling that you're waiting for something. Are you waiting for a change in your life? Are you waiting for someone to give you permission to chase your dreams? Are you waiting for someone else to make the first move? Why are you waiting for ""one day"" to achieve your dreams, instead of starting *today*?

You had a crush on this girl, but did you follow up on that and ask her out? If you don't do that, someone else will do it, and your chance will pass. And from what you're saying in your post, I think relationships are becoming a priority for you. It seems that you want to experience being close to someone and sharing your love and feelings with someone. So what can you do right now to get closer to that goal? How can you meet more people and spend more time with girls? What places do you need to frequent and what activities do you need to pursue for that? I suggest you make a plan for that.

And the same goes for your other dreams and desires. What are the dreams you want to see fulfilled sooner rather than later? If you want more in this life, make projects out of your dreams, and start defining specific next steps to get closer to those goals.

I'm sure you have the capacity to achieve your dreams, be in a great relationship and make a hell of an impact. But all those things require action. Don't wait for the right time to start taking action, because it's never the right time. Spend some time writing down exactly what it is you want to achieve in the next 6-12 months or so.

My friend has the same problem going on right now. To Find your significant other you have to be prepared and equipped yourself you can’t depend your happiness on someone else what if that person leaves then you back to being miserable that’s why you gotta find your own happiness first before you start looking so no matter the outcome you will be happy don’t depend your happiness on others.

"This is going to be the 8th Christmas while dating my boyfriend and my boyfriends parents still won't let me join them Christmas morning

After my boyfriend fought them for days, they now would allow me over Christmas Eve to sleep over but in the morning would want me to stay in my boyfriends room alone for over an hour while they open presents together. 

I'm Jewish and currently celebrating Hanukkah. My boyfriend and I are currently long distance since graduating undergrad several years ago and I would need to drive up to him, on injured feet, an hour and fifteen minutes away, on my own holiday away from my family to see them to be there specially for him and then to be told by his parents that I have to be quarentined in his room and not be included even though we've been together for 8 YEARS just feels shitty man.

I don't know what to do because I really don't want to do that because I know sitting there waiting and being included and purposfully left out will have me feeling really bad internally....but I also know it's important to my boyfriend I'm there, especially after he fought so much for me to even be there Christmas Eve and in the house Christmas morning at all.

Can someone help make me feel better?

I see exactly where you’re coming from by wanting to support your boyfriend and show a united front that he fought for, but even what you’ve “won” is no where near the amount a person deserves. How could he be alright with the alternative that you’re in the house, but not involved? How does he think that would make you feel? I see four paths: you hide in the room at your boyfriend’s parents request, you don’t go at all and be with your loved ones, you create a new tradition where it’s just you and your boyfriend, or you’re alone. From my vantage point, all sound better than isolating yourself while a family continues as normal. It’s not right, and it’s not ok that it was presented as an option at all.	lolfirefly	reply	na	na	na	0.998431384563446	weak	no	no	na	mmfb	failed
"How is he okay with that though? I’m so confused. This sounds so extremely inhospitable, cruel, and bonkers.

I don’t know what you should do, but it sounds way better to stay with your own family and enjoy another cozy night of Chanukah with them. Your boyfriend can come to you if he wants to see you, many more nights of Chanukah for that :) 

Fuck that rude absurd noise of being forced to hide in a bedroom just to spend xmas with someone who is okay with you being made that uncomfortable and excluded. My head is exploding at this image!"	lolfirefly	reply	na	na	na	0.998431384563446	weak	no	strong	na	mmfb	failed
Remember a relationship is a two way street - support needs to go both ways. He might say that the fault lies with his parents, that they are the ones not supporting him and your relationship.  But if your boyfriend is okay with this whole ordeal (or at the very least willing to go along with) then he is not supporting you.  Not saying your boyfriend should cancel his time with his family and spend it with you and your family instead, but personally if I was in a supportive and loving relationship, then that is exactly what I would do. No way in hell I would've let someone treat someone I was in a relationship with like that, not even if they were my parents.

"At some point you have to value yourself even if your boyfriend doesn’t. You are both adults. If my parents wouldn’t let someone I was dating for 8 years open presents with us on Christmas, I wouldn’t be opening presents with my family on Christmas.

His parents are clearly insane, and I’m betting religious nuts. They can’t have a Jewish person present while they do the very Christian religious ritual of sitting by the pagan tree and opening consumer goods purchased online the way Jesus decreed. /s

Stay with your family and if your boyfriend is upset about it tell him he is welcome to come to your house but he has to stay in his room while you and your parents celebrate Hanukkah each night. See how he feels.

Sorry his family sucks, but if he isn’t going to choose you over them on something this small, you should not bend over backward to enable his cowardice. 8 years is a long time.

The parents are crazy btw. If you were married would it be the same way?

"It is not unreasonable at all to expect your boyfriend to choose you and your comfort over his parents, especially when they're being bigots.

If I were you, I would help my boyfriend that you refuse to spend any holiday, his religion or yours, in a way that doesn't make both of you feel relaxed and happy.  That's a perfectly reasonable expectation. If he feels relaxed and happy with you being excluded, you have a major relationship problem. If he cannot feel relaxed and happy knowing That his parents disapprove of him treating his partner well, then boyfriend has a major family issue.

Tell him that you will not go to a place and be excluded, and will not risk injuring yourself to visit him. You can either agree to celebrate separately, or he will hold his parents accountable for treating you with respect.

If he really does have unreasonable parents, I don't expect this to be easy for him, but the solution cannot be that you always lose out. If you tell him this, and he throws a temper tantrum, or claims that you are ruining his relationship with his parents, then you know where his priorities lie. If, on the other hand, he shows genuine distress and uncertainty on how to deal with this parents, you can talk through that and come up with a plan for how he can better manage his parents' behavior than just giving them what they want all the time.

But no good solution to this is going to work if your boyfriend doesn't prioritize you and your happiness. You need to make that very clear to him going forward."	lolfirefly	reply	na	na	na	0.998431384563446	weak	no	no	na	mmfb	failed

I hate having to be the one to say it, but it is the truth.  His family is completely against the 2 of yall being in a relationship together.
They don't support yall at all🙅🏻‍♀️🙅🏻‍♀️🙅🏻‍♀️....and by the looks of it, they NEVER will.

Something has gotta give, and it isn't going to be his parents.

""You have no social life, I'm your only friend, you are scared to talk to women, have never had a girlfriend, your going to the gym for a year yet you are still a fat piece of shit, you can't score good grades in class, you have 0 jobs 0 internship's, you day dream about starting a business and changing your entire life yet you sit and procrastinate about your crush and play video games all day eating junk, and you don't want to do anything about it because you are a ugly piece of shit with acne's all over the face and a low self esteem and pretty non existent confidence, you little drink alcohol to get confidence and you literally have a 1tb hard drive full of porn that you literally jack of to every day, is there even any meaning to your life, you are just useless and a disgrace to your parent's why are you even fucking alive""

And I was like damn, and then he sat down and started to tear up saying ""Bro I always want the good for you but you just sit and rant and do nothing""

"It know it doesn't help with me saying this, but yeah, life, and most things in it, are harder for some people than others, for folks like you and I, and probably most of the folks here hanging out in subreddits like these. In fact, ALOT harder than others might realise, not having experience what you have themselves, not having faced the same obstacles, the same troubles, the same rejections and insults, or the same self-doubts and recriminations.

And I get you man, I really do. Sometimes things just seem so... hopeless. Nothing you do seems to have any effect or meaning, nothing seems to go right, and nothing you do seems to matter. Fear and tears and rage are all bottled up within you, and the only thing you can do is rant, to let it all out, to release some pressure, with hopes that someone would reassure you, confirm that yeah, life really does suck, to show that they understand you and that you are not wrong to feel the way you do, that it's not just you. That you are not alone, and that you are not defective. And again, I know it doesn't help with me saying this, but you are NOT alone feeling like this, and you are certainly not defective.

And know that at the end of the day, it is worth it, it IS worth pushing on through. Life sucks and a lot of us have very little control over... well, anything. But take control anyways. Do something every once in a while that is by your choice. Whether it's dancing randomly when you are out and about, or learning new recipes and trying new foods that you would normally never touch, just do something that you have chosen yourself, something you wouldn't normally do. Personally I enjoy walking in the rain, with no umbrella and getting completely soaked - it's fun seeing all the people out there hiding and running from the water, while I myself am out there, chosing to enjoy it. It's not much, but it's a little victory, and it makes me feel superior almost.

"Talk to an addiction counselor or therapist immediately. These thoughts you're having, about how your Life is permanently screwed up, is the result of your addiction, and possibly depression causing distorted thinking.

In case you need to hear it, precious few, if any, people accomplish their personal goals by the time they're 20. Not simply because 20 is very young to accomplish anything, but because people change a lot in their young adulthood, and what they want out of life tends to shift around significantly.

I know many people who had never been in a relationship at all by the time they were 20, literally all of them are now married with kids.  I've known many people with addiction problems at your age, and most of them have been in recovery and stable for years.

Absolutely no one has a perfect life, or everything figured out, 20 years old. If you know anyone who presents themselves that way, they are either lying to you, or lying to themselves. 20 years old is, in my opinion, still basically a child. You have barely had any time at all to waste in the first place.

Absolutely everything that you were experiencing now, and struggling with now, literally millions of other people have gone through the same or similar, and were able to move on and find a life they enjoyed.  That might feel impossible right now, but remind yourself it feels impossible because you are struggling with an illness that limits your ability to see potential futures clearly. It's not because no future is there.

Dude even if you were 40 and in that situation it is never too late to build the life you want. Just bc something doesn’t happen on your desired timeline doesn’t mean it failed and you’ll never achieve. Take small steps towards your goals everyday even if it starts out as just 5 minutes. Overtime you will bring to fruition all you want and will build up to where everyday you spend majority of time building the life you want. It’s actually the little choices we make everyday that seem to be no big deal that end up determining our destiny.

"So I come from a working class family background, fortunately enough my father makes enough money to send me to a very high ranked private college in our state, which lead to all the problem.

So now all the people I've met here and all the friend's I've made are rich entitled brat's from business or upper class families, and I like hanging around them because being a business minded person, I get to learn a alot from them.

But here's where the pro's end, they always throw lavish parties and invite me and expect me to do the same even though I can't afford it, they alway's talk about business, their properties, their mercs and bmws, their money and stuff while I just sit quiet in the corner with nothing to talk about.

And me being quiet lead's to me being bullied, as they know I bring nothing to the table for them so they think they have the right to bully me, make fun of me all the time and tell me how ugly I am, and all that stuff.

But I have no other friend's here and can't go over the process of making new, I just want to become a someone of value, someone who bring's something to the table.

But I don't know how I can do that?"	CrazyEvery3682	post	34.38083505637431	male	White	0.9993438124656677	na	na	na	2	mmfb	failed
"Tough situation and totally valid to feel what you are feeling. 

2 things I feel I would do, find new friends through different clubs/activities or find your niche into the group. 

Stand up for yourself and be proud of where you came from. You cant afford what they have but you can still contribute. Show value. Figure out if there is a need in the group and fulfill it.

"Hey man. Sorry this is happening to you. Group dynamics can be tough. 

It's not about how you look. My guess - and this is just a total guess, because I don't know really know you or the situation - is that you're probably coming off as really wanting to belong to these groups of guys. Given how much you've moved around it's only natural that you'd really want to belong. Younger dudes are pretty insecure. And when they get together in groups, one way they all try to hide their insecurity is to find someone who's more insecure than them and beat up on them verbally. They say it's ""just joking"" or whatever, and that's part of it, but it's also a way of reassuring themselves that they belong. 

It's nothing about you, really, that led to you being *that* guy. My guess - again a guess - is that they test everyone, and then depending on the reaction they get, they keep pushing. So like the doing stupid stuff, well, they probably told you to do something once and then you did it and so they're thinking ""oh, we can beat up on him now."" Is there one guy who leads it and then the others join in? That's usually how i've seen it. 

FWIW it's worth, if I were you I might push back on them in a joking way the next time they start ragging on you. Like don't start anything, but if they start ragging on you, rag on them. It's a signal that you're not down to be *that* guy anymore. See how that goes. They might back off. But honestly I think this group of dudes is a bunch of dicks and you'd be better off spending more time looking for other people to connect with."

"The big sad is a bitch.

I used to be depressed too. I’m not going to go into the details, but one day, after a huge mental breakdown that lead me to hurt myself quite a lot, I asked myself: “do I want to be like this?”. After realising I could do better and that the fault of my own depression was mine for being ok with it and not trying hard enough to fight back, waiting for someone to “rescue me”, everything changed.

I don’t like how you said “I’m gonna be like this for a while”. That mindset is batshit. If you really want to feel better, fight your depression, you must change something in your life. For me, it was joining a theatre project, and more recently it was changing the way I dress or going to the gym. Be reborn. Come up with a better version of yourself and set it as your goal, then achieve it.

I know what you might be thinking: “it’s not just that simple”. It IS that simple. The hardest part is taking the first steps. I’ve been there too.

I can’t know what it is like to be you, but I think I can relate to you; I’ve struggled with such feelings on and off in my life. Do you have anyone who you can open up to? Life can be so much sometimes… it’s a lot for a sensitive soul to process alone. Do you have any dreams/goals lately? What does ‘confident and happy’ look like in your mind? Maybe we can help you get back on track :) No pressure of course; sometimes we just need to take a little break and let our emotions move through us in order to get past a rough patch, and that’s okay. It’s human nature to have a hard time sometimes.

"Goes to show that maybe you focused your efforts on the wrong things. The fact that you have fought a lot already is not an excuse to give up; it’s like a marathon, you know where the finishing line is, you just don’t know your position relative to it.

Yesterday, when I commented your post, I came here because I was so tired from studying all day and I thought I could use some comforting. The fact that I studied so much yesterday does not mean I won’t study just as much today, tomorrow and… well the day after tomorrow is Christmas but I would have studied anyway. Same goes for you. You might have to work on yourself for literally years, maybe you should seek the help of a professional to point you on the right direction.

I don’t know what happened to you and what you are doing in your life, but I know and I am 1000% sure that humans, including you, are capable of being ten times stronger than they can be weak. There is no shame in failing to better yourself, nor is there in restarting from scratch.

I can give you two tips:
1. I know my strongest emotions are anxiety and anger. I trained myself to control those emotions separately: first the anxiety, then the anger. Learning self control is a huge step towards a balanced psyche: your conscience has to be stronger than wild emotions, especially sadness.
2. Know in what mind state you are at your best; for me, it is mindfulness and approaching problems calmly. Learn how to recreate it at will. When you’re facing an emotionally challenging situation, stop for a moment and go back to that mind state. Then, proceed.

If you changed a lot of things in your life but had no results, you might have to work on yourself for now. It’s a rough path and it takes years to improve, maybe you have already improved and you don’t know it. Again, if you need it, you might want to seek the help of a professional.

One thing I really like about the holidays is that they're a quiet time, a time to do some thinking and reflecting about the year that's passed and the year to come. I have a hard time in my life finding that quiet reflection time, so I'm really grateful for it. Maybe that's something you can make a focus for yourself this season. Likewise, the holidays always remind me that we're part of something bigger. Maybe there's a way to make that a focus: You may be laying low, but there's someone, somewhere, who could use some help or something this season. Maybe you can connect to that.

Why not spend it improving things for yourself? What could use some spiffing up in your life? Dull bedroom? Paint it. Wardrobe crappy? Get rid of old stuff you're not wearing anymore and bring it to the Goodwill store. Movie you'd like to see? Buy a ticket for Christmas Day. Ever cook something nice for yourself? Plan a really nice meal and go shopping for the ingredients.  Like chocolate? Find out what the best chocolate thing in your town is and go buy it for dessert. Super-clean your home from top to bottom. Here's an even more novel idea - go to church on Christmas morning! (No, the walls won't fall down if you show your face there).

"ironic, huh?

i’m used to her being there when i have the bad ptsd dreams or feel miserable like this, and now there’s no one. 

she lived with me through so much. she meant so much. she was there for me to cuddle as a kid when i got abused. she was my reason to stay alive. and now she’s dead. 

and she’s not just dead, i had to see her in ways i never wanted to. i had to pet her and call her a good girl while crying as she fucking choked to death or whatever happened. i was too much a broke coward to take her to the vet when i know i should have. i listened to people tell me she’d be fine without when i fucking knew better 

and then she just sat there. for almost TWO DAYS i had to periodically check her body, because no one else would. because i always have to be the adult. i cleaned blood dripping from her nose with a Q tip but it just kept getting worse. i aired out the dead fucking body smell but it got so bad. i tried to protect her from flies but could only do so much. she was so cold. she got so bloated 

i wish i didn’t bury her with my jacket. i wish i had something of her left. instead the fucks that told me not to take her to the vet got their way and she’s in a hole in the backyard. i hate them. i hate C for making me not tell my dad what was happening. i hate her for pushing me to not take my dog to the vet. i hate my dad for not stepping in more. i hate him for not being there. i hate both of them for refusing to communicate and making me have to be the adult. 

and then i feel guilty cause they’re nice to me right now. and my dad always is. and so i just sit alone feeling miserable for what i went through. they didn’t have to see what i did. why did it all have to be on me. i feel like they made me go through all this trauma for them, and nothing will undo that. fuck them so much. 

i just want my dog back. she looked so miserable. i hope she loved me, i hope i gave her some comfort, i hope she had a happy life. my poor best friend. i hope she’s at peace now."	KeiiLime	post	24.387327360208324	female	White	0.9988206028938293	na	na	na	2	mmfb	no prediction.

"It was totally out of nowhere.  She seemed to be having a little trouble breathing, so we took her into the vet.  They took an X-Ray and showed fluid in her lungs and a mass in her abdomen.  

She was 14 years old, and she was epileptic, so it's not like she was a kitten.  She had seizures her entire life, but they never seemed to cause any real trouble.  She would seize, get up, walk around a bit, wolf down a bowl of food, and be cranky for the rest of the day.  Happened maybe once a month.  The vet said not to worry about it as long as nothing seemed to happen to her.

Despite being epileptic, she was the absolute sweetest cat I had ever known.  She was my wife's when we got married 7 years ago, but I'm taking the loss a lot harder than my wife.  I really bonded with that cat.  She loved to sleep on my chest, snuggle with my face, lay on my shoulder when I played video games, and just liked to he held like a baby.  She would bunt you in the face if you were petting her, and all she ever wanted was for someone to pet her.  She loved spaghetti sauce and butter.  She sometimes growled or hissed, but she NEVER showed any physical aggression... ever.

I am fucking devastated.  I loved that cat more than I love a lot of people and losing her hurt more than anyone else in my family who has died.  I can't stop picturing the moment she fell asleep forever.  She looked so tired.  Part of me wanted to grab the needle, rip it out of her arm, take her, and run.  I'm having such a hard time losing her.  

I never thought a cat could do this to me.  Hell, I didn't think ANYTHING could do this to me, but here I am, bawling like an idiot.  I had to step out of the room after she went to sleep and just cry outside.  I didn't care. People could see me, but I couldn't keep it together.  I cried harder than I've ever cried in my adult life.  

I miss her so fucking much.  I feel like I let her down or... I dunno.  I feel like I should have saved her or something.  It feels wrong not having her here.  My house is so empty without her.  I've had to put pets down before, and I always get misty eyed and sad for a bit, but this is a new level.  I feel like my heart is in a million pieces."

How did you let her down? She got to live a long life, you both enjoyed each other and you did the humane thing, considering all that was wrong with her, by having her put down. Look, all of our beloved pets are going to pass one day, OP. It's really really hard to say goodbye because it's so permanent. You must have attached many beautiful memories to her, so that's why it's so bad.

"14 years is a really good long lifespan for a kitty, and it sounds like she enjoyed every bit of her time with you, and vice versa. She sounded like such a hilarious, cuddly, sweet baby. Don't beat yourself up, I'm sure she knows you guys did your best for her. It's ok to be sad, and perfectly understandable. Some cats have a certain way of working their way into your heart. 

My family's cat got lost and never came back about 10 years ago. He was 3 or 4. He used to sit on my lap when I was gaming, and would follow me around the house. We were good buddies. He was really frisky though. Maybe too frisky - he was kinda bitey (we didn't train him well) so my family didn't get along with him that well. I still get sad about him sometimes, since I never really got closure after he disappeared. I like to think that some family found him and adopted him and he's happily nibbling some family's ankles. 

My SO's cat is 4 and she's my favorite sassy cuddly little bean. She's not the same and doesn't replace my family's old cat, but I love her a ton, in a different way. I'm not ready for her to pass away, but we'll cross that bridge when we get to it I guess. 

I'd like to share a few comics from one of my favorite online artists that might be relevant.

"She had a younger brother, and he has been helping fill the void.  I also think we're helping fill the void in him, too.  

As a small update, we had to put another one down.  I was hardly emotionally connected to this one as it was our aunts who lives with us, and the cat was always sequestered to her room.  She didn't come out for anything despite multiple tries to.  Anyway, that makes 3 cats in less than a week, and though I wasn't emotionally bonded to the 3rd, the last remaining cat is definitely feeling the absence of the others.  He's become far more affectionate, and he used to never sleep in our room.  Preferring to sleep downstairs with the other 2.  Now that they are gone, we have to leave the door open because he wants to come into our room at night and sleep there.  He's very distressed and I think it's helped me in a way.  Taking care of him because it's clear he's having a hard time for a cat, but remaining calm and approving of affection and changing things to better suit him until he acclimates to a house without other cats in it has helped me remain calm.  There are still times when I tear up and miss Isadora like crazy, but I have to let her brother know that things are okay.  It sucks because he can't grasp what has happened.  All he knows is that she is gone and things have changed.  

I still miss Isadora like crazy and I can't talk about her without welling up, but I don't think we can do more pets.  We had 4 cats, 2 of the aunts and 2 of ours.  The emotional toll  of losing them has really drained all of us.  I don't think any of us are ready to jump into a new addition.

"[This is it](https://ibb.co/BtVH5FK)

That's the picture.  

You know, before I met my wife, I wasn't a cat guy.  I liked them just fine, but I would have never gone and got one myself.  I absolutely loved her.  I can't even explain it.  I've had dogs, dogs I love very much, but Isadora (the cat) was just... something else.  You can tell she was excited to see ME.  Not just anyone, but me.  Like, when we get home, our dog bypasses me and goes directly to my wife.  I would expect that from a dog, but Isadora would do that with me, and I don't experience that much with cats.  Every morning, she would come in and plop on my chest.  We had a routine.  We would snuggle until it was time to walk the dog.  Then, at night, she would lay between us till we fell asleep, and then she would go do her nightly cat things.  Most of the time, as soon as I picked her up, she would start purring.  Honestly, I've never met a more affectionate cat in my life.  Hands down, no contest.  She just loved to love.  Everyone who met her fell in love with her, and I was the lucky dude who got to experience it the most.  As much as I'm trying to describe it, it was just indescribable how much she meant to me."

I met a friend , and I was trying to be sweet and he thought I was very clingy . Like it’s not my fault that I am this way like , if you don’t like it it’s your loss		post	28.37530245313055	male	White	0.9986482262611389	na	na	na	2	mmfb	no prediction.
"I don't know how the situation actually looked like.
In what way were you trying to be sweet?

I understand that you are disappointed because you felt rejected. But maybe something in your behaviour crossed that person's boundaries and made them uncomfortable? (e.g. being physically affectionate) 

Not everyone will like you, and that's okay - just like you don't have to like everyone. But something to consider in the context of all your relationships is communication. Voicing what you like, what you're uncomfortable with - and what the other person likes and dislikes. This way you could avoid bitter feelings on either end. 

We're all different and we're not all naturally compatible with each other and sometimes we have to make modifications in our behaviour/habits to build better bonds."		reply	na	na	na	0.9986482262611389	no	no	strong	na	mmfb	no prediction.

"Hi I just wanted to write this out. She was the greatest mother I could've wished for. She fought cancer 2 times and sadly lost today but everywhere she went, she always cared for other over herself and even in the last moment she didn't want me to see her suffering. She passed away the moment I  went away from her side and I sadly couldn't be with here during her last breath. I feel so relieved somehow, like she removed all my anxiety and sorrow from my heart. I love you mum and I know u will always be by my side forever and always.

You beloved son and sunshine,
Roger"	xleonz	post	24.555929409596427	female	White	0.0012864702148362994	na	na	na	5	mmfb	no prediction.
"My mum died and was successfully resuscitated 20 years ago ….. she said it was so beautiful and my grandmother was there and she felt such joy … she told us never to fear death because there is no death because she remained  able to be with us and in this beautiful other place with loving beings. 
You’ll see her again and she’s done an amazing job with you"	xleonz	reply	na	na	na	0.0012864702148362994	weak	strong	no	na	mmfb	no prediction.
Thank you for sharing Roger.  I'm sorry for your loss and may you continue the unspoken legacy she left you. All the good things you saw in her are things that will live on in you.	xleonz	reply	na	na	na	0.0012864702148362994	strong	no	no	na	mmfb	no prediction.
"May her soul Rest in Peace and May you have the strength to bear it all.
It's not easy to just lose someone so precious to you, seeing them suffer from illness before your own eyes and you can't do anything to lessen their suffering.
It's not easy to get over that we lost them but it's also good to see that their suffering came to an end. 
IMO it's better to be free from suffering then to be shackled to this mortal body and keep suffering."	xleonz	reply	na	na	na	0.0012864702148362994	strong	no	no	na	mmfb	no prediction.
